It analyzed the cases of 368 male coronavirus patients nationwide, 97 receiving hydroxychloroquine, 113 receiving hydroxychloroquine in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin, and 158 not receiving any hydroxychloroquine. This was not a randomized clinical trial, the gold standard of drug testing, which would randomly assign hydroxychloroquine treatment to some patients and not to others. Instead, researchers looked back on cases \u2014 and weren\u2019t able to account for why doctors chose to treat some patients with the antimalarial drug and not others.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump said he\u2019s been taking hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug that he has repeatedly touted as a cure for coronavirus, despite a lack of evidence. The president said he has been taking the drug for a week and a half, as a prophylactic measure, going against the guidance of the FDA. The coronavirus death toll passed 90,000 in the US, even as states begin easing distancing measures. All but one state are looking to loosen restrictions, but only 18 have shown a downward trend in cases. Lindsay Graham, the Republican leader of the Senate judiciary committee, announced a debate and vote on whether to subpoena documents and testimony related to what Donald Trump has been referring to as \u201cObamagate\u201d. Republicans are seeking testimony from Obama-era officials on the FBI investigation into Russian election interference. Trump said the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, asked him to fire the state department inspector general, which will intensify concerns that Pompeo politically retaliated against Steve Linick for investigations into the state department leader. Linick had been investigating Pompeo\u2019s controversial decision to approve Saudi arms sales last year, according to the Democratic chair of the House foreign affairs committee. Reports had already emerged that Linick was investigating the secretary of state for allegedly making a department staffer run personal errands for him and his wife. Moderna\u2019s coronavirus vaccine showed promising results in its first human safety tests. The results sparked hope that the vaccine could be more widely distributed in the next several months, as several companies race to develop an effective vaccine. The attorney general, William Barr, said he does not expect the investigation of the Russia inquiry to lead to a criminal investigation of Barack Obama or Joe Biden. Barr\u2019s comment comes as the president continues to push his baseless claim that the former president and former vice-president broke the law in connection to the Russia investigation. Trump reportedly declined an invitation to address the World Health Organization, which he has criticized for its handling of the pandemic. Republican senator Lindsay Graham announced that the judiciary committee would debate and vote on whether to subpoena documents and testimony from Obama-era officials, related to the FBI\u2019s investigation into Russian election interference. Graham would subpoena testimony from witnesses including James Comey, Andrew McCabe, James Clapper, John Brennan, and Sally Yates. The Senate judiciary committee would vote on authorizing the subpoenas on 4 June. The move is the latest in efforts by Trump and his allies to double down on the theory that Barack Obama and his administration concocted a hoax allegation that Trump colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election. Trump has been referring to the conspiracy theory as \u201cObamagate\u201d. A judge in rural Oregon tossed out the state\u2019s coronavirus restrictions, saying that the governor, Kate Brown, did not seek the legislature\u2019s approval to extend the stay-at-home order. Brown is now seeking an emergency review of the decision by the state\u2019s supreme court. \u201cThe science behind these executive orders hasn\u2019t changed one bit. Ongoing physical distancing, staying home as much as possible and wearing face coverings will save lives across Oregon,\u201d Brown, a Democrat, said. But the judge\u2019s decision today, in response to a lawsuit by 10 churches who argued that the state\u2019s social distancing protocols were unconstitutional, said, \u201cthe governor\u2019s orders are not required for public safety when plaintiffs can continue to utilize social distancing and safety protocols at larger gatherings involving spiritual worship,\u201d he wrote. Judges have struck down restrictions by other Democratic governors, in Wisconsin and North Carolina. Earlier this month, Brown extended the state\u2019s social distancing mandate till 6 July, but most Oregon counties have already received the state\u2019s approval to loosen restrictions. The coronavirus death told in the US passed 90,000 Monday, and the number of cases climbed above 1.5m, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The milestone came as more states seek to loosen restrictions and the president tweeted, \u201cREOPEN OUR COUNTRY!\u201d The president has questioned the death toll, suggesting that the numbers have been inflated. But researchers from the CDC who analyzed deaths in New York over the past two months concluded that the actual death toll is likely higher than the reported number. All the states, except Connecticut, have relaxed stay-at-home orders, to varying degrees. But only 18 states showed a downward trend of new cases according to data from Johns Hopkins. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports: Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and national Republicans are pumping millions of dollars into efforts to restrict voting and aggressively fight Democratic efforts to make it easier to cast a ballot during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Republican National Committee has allocated $20m so far to oppose Democratic lawsuits across the country seeking to expand voting. Republicans are also seeking to recruit up to 50,000 people in 15 key states to serve as poll watchers and challenge the registration of voters they believe are ineligible, according to the New York Times. The 2020 election will be the first time in nearly three decades that national Republicans will be involved in such a program. After the RNC was sued over intimidating minority voters in New Jersey in the early 1980s, they agreed to a federal court order not to engage in \u201cballot security\u201d efforts. The order expired in 2018. Vivian Ho reports: Haircuts, in-person retail shopping, sporting events and religious services could be a reality again in some California counties in just the next few weeks, the state\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, said Monday. Newsom provided an optimistic outlook for the state in his daily briefing, where he modified the criteria that each of California\u2019s 58 counties must meet to reopen and join the state in phase two of coronavirus containment. \u201cWe are looking forward in the next few weeks to a number of significant milestones,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect if we hold the rate of transmissions, we hold the positivity rate down and continue to do justice to the number of hospitalizations, that we will be making announcements statewide.\u201d Newsom had already allowed for local variance to phase two of the stay-at-home order \u2013 California, as a large state with diverse needs, had been hit by the virus unevenly, with some rural counties experiencing low rates of infection and others like Los Angeles county experiencing more than half the deaths in the entire state. While statewide, all retailers were allowed to reopen for curbside pickup, counties could also apply for looser restrictions, such as the go-ahead to reopen some offices, schools and dine-in restaurants. Those counties had to meet criteria such as no deaths in 14 days. Now, under the modified criteria announced Monday, in which counties have to show a rate of 8% positive tests over seven days and a hospitalization rate below 5%, Newsom believes that 53 of the state\u2019s 58 counties could move deeper into phase two if their public health officials so desired. He reiterated again that the decision was up to each individual county. \u201cJust because we are creating the capacity and the availability to move into phase two doesn\u2019t mean every county is ready,\u201d he said. \u201cLA county, as an example, I imagine, will be cautious in that respect.\u201d In California, there have been a total of 78,839 positive cases and 3,261 deaths. During the event with restaurant executives, Trump also addressed the investigation into the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. \u201cHere\u2019s a man that is supposed to be negotiating war and peace with major, major countries with weaponry like the world has never seen before,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cAnd the Democrats and the fake news media, they are interested in a man who is walking their dog.\u201d Trump fired the state department\u2019s inspector general, Steve Linick, on Friday. According to NBC, Linick has been investigating whether Pompeo and his wide made a staffer walk their dog, pick up dry cleaning and make them dinner reservations, as well as the circumstances of Pompeo\u2019s sale of US weapons to Saudi Araba despite a congressional ban. \u201cI would rather have [Pompeo] on the phone with some world leader than have him wash dishes because maybe his wife isn\u2019t there or his kids aren\u2019t,\u201d Trump said. Of course, a third option would have been for the Pompeo family to hire dogwalkers and other helpers, rather than relying on state department employees to do their personal errands. Trump\u2019s use of hydroxychloroquine doesn\u2019t appear to fit within the FDA\u2019s emergency use authorization of the drug as a treatment for coronavirus. The president said he asked the White House doctor if he could take the antimalarial drug. \u201cHe said, well, if you\u2019d like it.\u201d The emergency use authorization is very specific. It \u201callows chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate donated to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) and distributed to states to be used by licensed healthcare providers to treat adults and teens hospitalized with Covid-19 who weigh more than 50 kg (110 pounds)\u201d, according to the FDA. It does not authorize the use of the drug as a preventative treatment. Even Fox News was taken aback by the president\u2019s announcement that he\u2019s taking hydroxychloroquine. Fact check: Trump on hydroxychloroquine Trump acknowledged research finding that US veterans treated with hydroxychloroquine didn\u2019t seem to fare better than those who weren\u2019t given the drug. The preliminary study found that those treated with hydroxychloroquine had a higher risk of death than those who were not. The pre-print of the study, which has been published online without peer review, comes with many caveats. None of those caveats include Trump\u2019s analysis. Those behind the research \u201caren\u2019t big Trump fans,\u201d the president said as an explanation for why he\u2019s taking the unproven drug. The research was a \u201ca very unscientific report,\u201d Trump said. The research was conducted by the VA and academic institutions including the University of Virginia School of Medicine. It analyzed the cases of 368 male coronavirus patients nationwide, 97 receiving hydroxychloroquine, 113 receiving hydroxychloroquine in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin, and 158 not receiving any hydroxychloroquine. This was not a randomized clinical trial, the gold standard of drug testing, which would randomly assign hydroxychloroquine treatment to some patients and not to others. Instead, researchers looked back on cases \u2014 and weren\u2019t able to account for why doctors chose to treat some patients with the antimalarial drug and not others. It could be that those treated with hydroxychloroquine had a higher chance of death because doctors chose to give the most severely ill patients the unproven drug. Asked about the potential harsh side effects of taking the drug, Trump told reporters, \u201cAll I can tell you is, so far I seem to be OK.\u201d Hydroxychloroquine is considered relatively safe for people without an underlying illness, but it\u2019s unclear if it is safe for severely sick Covid-19 patients, who may have incurred organ damage due to the virus. The drug can have serious side effects, including serious heart rhythm problems. So far, the evidence that it\u2019s a cure for coronavirus is anecdotal and mixed. An initial French study that appeared to have launched the Trump administration\u2019s obsession with the drug has since been discredited. The early results of trials and studies that have tricked in so far have not provided compelling evidence that hydroxychloriquine is a \u201cmiracle\u201d drug, as Trump has claimed before. The surge in demand for the unproven hydroxychloroquine also risks shortages of the drug for those who need it most. It is used to help patients manage the chronic autoimmune disease lupus, but some are already complaining the drug is harder to come by. If Trump is taking hydroxychloroquine, he is going against the advice of his own administration. The FDA has warned against using hydroxychloroquine or a related compound, chloroquine, for treating or preventing Covid-19 without medical supervision in a hospital, or as part of a clinical trial. \u201cWhile clinical trials are ongoing to determine the safety and effectiveness of these drugs for Covid-19, there are known side effects of these medications that should be considered,\u201d the FDA commissioner, Stephen M Hahn, said in a statement issued in late April. \u201cThe FDA will continue to monitor and investigate these potential risks and will communicate publicly when more information is available.\u201d Here\u2019s the clip of Trump saying he\u2019s been taking hydroxychloroquine. \u201cI get a lot of positive calls about it,\u201d Trump said of the antimalarial drug. So far, the scientific evidence that the drug works as a treatment has been thin. It has not been widely investigated as a prophylactic measure. Extraordinary news emerging from the White House \u2013 the president has mentioned that he has been taking hydroxychloroquine. This is the dubious treatment for coronavirus that Trump had fiercely touted in the past but which was found to have a very mixed effect on patients. No studies so far have shown that it had a good effect on patients and regulators have advised it not be taken outside of a hospital or clinical trial setting. Trump said earlier at the White House that he was taking it, it is understood as a prophylactic. The US Food and Drug Administration cautions against use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for Covid-19 outside of a hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems. Before recent results from larger trials showed the anti-viral medicine was not good for Covid and could be harmful, Trump was promoting it, including at White House briefings, as a possible miracle cure for coronavirus. That\u2019s it from me today. Our west coast team will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump said the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, asked him to fire the state department inspector general, which will intensify concerns that Pompeo politically retaliated against Steve Linick for investigations into the state department leader. Linick had been investigating Pompeo\u2019s controversial decision to approve Saudi arms sales last year, according to the Democratic chair of the House foreign affairs committee. Reports had already emerged that Linick was investigating the secretary of state for allegedly making a department staffer run personal errands for him and his wife. Moderna\u2019s coroanvirus vaccine showed promising results in its first human safety tests. The results sparked hope that the vaccine could be more widely distributed in the next several months, as several companies race to develop an effective vaccine. The attorney general, William Barr, said he does not expect the investigation of the Russia inquiry to lead to a criminal investigation of Barack Obama or Joe Biden. Barr\u2019s comment comes as the president continues to push his baseless claim that the former president and former vice-president broke the law in connection to the Russia investigation. Trump reportedly declined an invitation to address the World Health Organization, which he has criticized for its handling of the pandemic. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Trump said secretary of state Mike Pompeo had asked him to fire state department inspector general Steve Linick, who was removed from his role on Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about him, other than the State Department and Mike in particular ... weren\u2019t happy with the job he\u2019s doing or something,\u201d Trump told reports of Linick\u2019s ouster. Pompeo was reportedly under investigation for approving Saudi arms sales last year without congressional support and for allegedly making a department staffer run personal errands for him and his wife. But Trump said he was unconcerned that Pompeo may have sought Linick\u2019s removal because of the investigations, insisting he has the right to remove any inspector general and expressing doubt about the credibility of oversight officials who were appointed by Barack Obama. Donald Trump declined an invitation to address a virtual gathering of the World Health Organization (WHO) that began earlier today, while his Beijing counterpart, Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, delivered a virtual speech in which he pledged $2 billion in coronavirus aid to the worldwide response, Axios reports. Other world leaders who addressed today\u2019s gathering included Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel and France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron. The WHO extended an invitation earlier this month for Trump to speak at Monday\u2019s virtual gathering of the World Health Assembly, the WHO\u2019s parent body, Axios said, citing two unnamed sources familiar with the situation. Xi accepted while Trump declined and instead delivered a message of criticism. \u201cThe WHO wanted to bring these two leaders together, the biggest economies in the world, at a time when they are being cold to each other, and try to create some sense of solidarity,\u201d a source said. The WHO aims to establish an independent and impartial inquiry into the source and handling of the coronavirus outbreak, once the pandemic is brought under control, at the virtual meeting of its governing body, the World Health Authority. Trump abruptly announced in April that he was freezing US payments to the World Health Organization over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. He said at the time that funding would be on hold for 60 to 90 days pending a review of the WHO\u2019s warnings about the coronavirus and China. He accused the global body of \u201cseverely mismanaging and covering up\u201d the threat, even though it declared a public health emergency on 30 January \u2013 after which he continued to hold rallies, play golf and compare the coronavirus to the common flu. Karl Rove, a former senior adviser to George W Bush, lashed out against Barack Obama after the former president implicitly criticized Trump in a virtual commencement address. \u201cIt is so unseemly for a former president to take the virtual commencement ceremony for a series of historically black colleges and universities and turn it into a political drive-by shooting,\u201d Rove said. Delivering an address to HBCU graduates this weekend, Obama said, \u201cMore than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they\u2019re doing. A lot them aren\u2019t even pretending to be in charge.\u201d But Rove\u2019s comment immediately sparked backlash from critics, who were quick to point to some of the most controversial aspects of the Republican strategist\u2019s record. Others noted that Obama\u2019s comments pale in comparison to Trump\u2019s claims about his predecessor. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo claimed it was \u201cnot possible\u201d the state department inspector general\u2019s firing was an act of political retaliation because he didn\u2019t know he was being investigated. \u201cIt is not possible that this decision, or my recommendation rather, to the president rather, was based on any effort to retaliate for any investigation that was going on, or is currently going on,\u201d Pompeo told the Washington Post. \u201cBecause I simply don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not briefed on it. I usually see these investigations in final draft form 24 hours, 48 hours before the IG is prepared to release them. So it\u2019s simply not possible for this to be an act of retaliation. End of story.\u201d However, according to Politico, state department officials were recently briefed on the conclusions of the inspector general\u2019s investigation into Pompeo\u2019s decision to approve arms sales to Saudi Arabia last year, and the secretary refused to sit for an interview. For weeks, Joe Biden has been on the receiving end of unsolicited advice urging the homebound presidential candidate to get out of his basement. On Monday, Biden moved out of the basement to a sunny room upstairs with views of his lush backyard in full bloom to address the AAPI Victory Fund virtual summit. The shot was well-framed and the connection was clear \u2013 marked improvements from a recent virtual rally that was riddled with technical glitches. But as he began his remarks, a gaggle of Canadian geese that have taken up residence on his property began honking. Biden warned that this might happen and did not pause when their honking grew louder. There were some technical difficulties; though on this occasion, they were not Biden\u2019s fault. The former vice president was not feted with introductory remarks after the speaker, Dilawar Syed, was unable to connect properly. And at one point, as Biden spoke, a cell phone rang. But if he was irritated, Biden didn\u2019t show it. He assailed Trump for his administration\u2019s handling of the virus that he described as a series of \u201cdenials, delays and distraction, many of which were nakedly xenophobic.\u201d Trump has sought to make China a theme of the 2020 presidential campaign by hammering Biden in a series of dark attack ads tying the former vice president to Beijing. Biden has responded in kind, in an escalating war of words that has alarmed some Asian Americans who say the rhetoric from both campaigns could further inflame anti-Asian xenophobia. In his remarks, Biden spoke directly to the Asian American community, which has faced a wave of attacks and even violence in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, which was first identified in Wuhan, China. Biden accused Trump of stoking racial grievance and said the Asian American community deserved better than a president who \u201cnever, ever misses an opportunity to stoke innuendo, to fan the flames of hate.\u201d \u201cThis is unconscionable what he\u2019s doing and it strikes at the very heart of this country,\u201d Biden said, adding that Trump\u2019s rhetoric was \u201cespecially despicable\u201d given the sacrifices many Asian Americans are making as frontline and essential workers in the fight against the coronavirus. It should be noted that Republican senator Chuck Grassley\u2019s letter to Trump demanding an explanation for the removal of state department inspector general Steve Linick does not outline any consequences if the president does not comply. Trump has already ignored a similar letter from senators demanding an explanation for why intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson was ousted from his role. In response to Grassley\u2019s letter, Democratic senator Chris Murphy noted he has drafted legislation to guarantee inspectors general a seven-year term in office. The bill stipulates the oversight officials would only be able to be removed early for \u201cpermanent incapacity, inefficiency, neglect of duty, malfeasance, or conviction of a felony or conduct involving moral turpitude.\u201d \u201cWe simply cannot allow President Trump to weaponize independent oversight positions in his administration to reward his friends, punish his political enemies, and cover up wrongdoing,\u201d Murphy said last month. The Republican chair of the Senate finance committee has sent Trump a letter demanding an explanation for his removal of the state department inspector general. In the letter, senator Chuck Grassley noted lawmakers from both parties have similarly expressed concern about the recent removal of intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson. The Iowa Republican asked Trump to provide a written explanation for Steve Linick\u2019s removal by June 1 and respond to lawmakers\u2019 letter about Atkinson \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d \u201cAs mentioned in previous letters, Congress\u2019s intent is clear that an expression of lost confidence, without further explanation, is not sufficient to fulfill the requirements of the IG Reform Act,\u201d Grassley wrote. \u201cIGs are intended to be equal opportunity investigators and are designed to combat waste, fraud, abuse, and misconduct without regard to political affiliation. They are the ultimate swamp drainers,\u201d Grassley continued. \u201cRemoval of IGs without explanation could create a chilling effect in the oversight community, and risks decreasing the quantity, quality, fidelity, and veracity of their reports.\u201d Trump appeared \u201chighly focused\u201d on Barack Obama during this past weekend at Camp David, according to CNN. CNN reports: Trump headed into the weekend appearing convinced his predecessor committed a crime worthy of investigation -- despite being unable to name the crime or provide any evidence for it. By Sunday, he emerged prepared to wage wholesale political war with the last person who held his office. ... As he huddled in the mountainside retreat\u2019s rustic cabins with a roster of Republican lawmakers -- many of whom forged national profiles defending Trump during his impeachment proceedings -- Trump discussed ways to advance the baseless conspiracy about the former president, the person said. Attorney general William Barr said today that he did not expect the investigation into the handling of the Russia probe to result in a criminal investigation of Obama or Biden. Despite that comment from a senior member of his own administration, Trump seems unwilling to abandon the #Obamagate conspiracy theory, which former CIA analyst Ned Price described as \u201ca hashtag in search of a scandal.\u201d Health and human services secretary Alex Azar lashed out against Peter Navarro this morning, after the White House trade adviser critcized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for its handling of the pandemic. Azar said Navarro\u2019s comments on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d yesterday were \u201cinaccurate and inappropriate.\u201d Azar acknowledged CDC\u2019s early error in developing a coronavirus test, but he argued that mistake had not signficantly hampered the US response to the virus. In contrast, Navarro said yesterday that the CDC had \u201clet the country down.\u201d \u201cEarly on in this crisis, the CDC, which really had the most trusted brand around the world in this space -- really let the country down with the testing,\u201d Navarro said. \u201cNot only did they keep the testing within the bureaucracy they had a bad test and that set us back.\u201d Navarro\u2019s comments come as tensions between the White House and the CDC are reportedly escalating. CNN reports: In particular, Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator for the President\u2019s coronavirus task force, has become increasingly critical of the CDC, making clear in recent meetings that she is more than frustrated with the agency, according to two senior administration officials. Specifically, Birx believes the way the CDC gathers data on the coronavirus is antiquated, causing inaccurate and delayed numbers on both virus cases and deaths. Birx has expressed her agitation during recent task force meetings, where at least one conversation between her and CDC Director Robert Redfield has grown heated, according to a source close to the task force. Birx and Redfield have known each other for decades, due to their work on HIV research together. And while Birx defended Redfield to their peers earlier this year over the CDC\u2019s faulty test kits, her tone toward him has shifted dramatically in recent weeks, according to multiple officials and a source close to the task force. The Guardian\u2019s Kenya Evelyn recaps New York governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s daily briefing: New Yorkers received more than $9bin in unemployment benefits, Cuomo announced at his latest briefing on the state\u2019s response to coronavirus. Daily cases continue their downward trend, as the governor reported 106 deaths Sunday \u2013 the lowest total in several weeks. But Cuomo noted that $9.2bn in unemployment benefits have been paid out to more than two million New Yorkers, a sobering fact underscoring the virus\u2019 lingering economic effect. State officials acknowledged some residents have yet to be paid, but Cuomo argued the challenge is stamping out fraud to protect taxpayer money. \u201cSuzy Smith is really a computer terminal in some other country,\u201d he quipped of potential fraudulent filings, before noting he\u2019d likely face backlash for the remark. Cuomo continued to push back at questions regarding the state\u2019s early response to the coronavirus outbreak in nursing homes, contending the facilities are a top priority. He announced 35,000 tests had been reserved just for nursing homes. New York state is also requiring facility personnel to get tested twice a week, as the governor said the state would have to \u201cramp up from about 25,000 tests to 90,000 tests a day\u201d. The governor had been criticized for previously allowing patients back to nursing homes after they tested positive for Covid-19 after more than 5,000 residents died since 1 March. That policy was reversed 10 May. In the presser, the governor also announced that western New York, which includes Buffalo, will begin phase 1 of reopening this week. State officials were able to identify more than 525 contact tracers to aid in the effort. Still, Cuomo cautioned businesses and state leaders to follow the science. \u201cThis is not a subject that is a political subject, or where political opinions really matter,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t even care about your personal opinion, this is about facts and science and data.\u201d Cuomo added that he had been \u201cencouraging major sports team to plan reopening without fans, but the games can be televised,\u201d telling reporters he\u2019d want to watch the Buffalo Bills. That\u2019s the only NFL team whose reopening Cuomo would be able to affect, however. Both the New York Giants and Jets play at MetLife Stadium, located in New Jersey. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Moderna\u2019s coroanvirus vaccine showed promising results in its first human safety tests. The results sparked hope that the vaccine could be more widely distributed in the next several months, as several companies race to develop an effective vaccine. Attorney general William Barr said he does not expect the investigation of the Russia inquiry to lead to a criminal investigation of Barack Obama or Joe Biden. Barr\u2019s comment comes as the president continues to push his baseless claim that the former president and former vice-president broke the law in connection to the Russia investigation. The state department inspector general had been investigating Mike Pompeo\u2019s controversial decision to approve Saudi arms sales last year, according to the Democratic chair of the House foreign affairs committee. Reports had already emerged that Steve Linick, who was dismissed on Friday, was investigating the secretary of state for allegedly making a department staffer run personal errands for him and his wife. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Politico has more details on the state department inspector general\u2019s reported investigation into secretary of state Mike Pompeo\u2019s controversial decision to approve arms sales to Saudi Arabia last year. Politico reports: A congressional aide said State Department officials were recently briefed about [Steve] Linick\u2019s conclusions in his investigation of the Saudi arms sales, and that Pompeo refused to sit for an interview with the inspector general\u2019s office. State Department officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. News of the investigation comes after reports indicated Pompeo, who pushed for Linick\u2019s ouster, was also being investigated for making a department staffer run personal errands for him and his wife. The Trump campaign has launched an \u201cinvestigative website\u201d to highlight some of Joe Biden\u2019s verbal slips on the campaign trail. The website is entitled \u201cTruth Over Facts,\u201d a reference to when Biden accidentally said during the Iowa State Fair, \u201cWe choose truth over facts.\u201d (He likely meant to say, \u201cWe choose truth over lies.\u201d) \u201cThe American people deserve to know the truth behind Joe Biden\u2019s delirious and nonsensical claims on the campaign trail,\u201d Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign\u2019s communications director, said in a statement. \u201cWhen he\u2019s mangling the text of the Declaration of Independence or calling someone a \u2018lying, dog-faced pony soldier,\u2019 is he really speaking a language that only he and a select group of others understand?\u201d The president\u2019s reelection campaign has launched a series of attacks against Biden in recent weeks, as Trump struggles to find a positive message to voters with the pandemic wreaking havoc on Americans\u2019 health and finances. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo claimed the fired inspector general was undermining the work of the department, although he does not appear to have offered any evidence to support that allegation. Pompeo said state department Steve Linick, who was dismissed on Friday night, was \u201ctrying to undermine what it was that we were trying to do.\u201d The cabinet memeber\u2019s comments come as the Democratic chair of the House foreign affairs committee has said he believed Linick was fired for investigating Pompeo\u2019s approval of arms sales to Saudi Arabia last year, despite congressional opposition. The White House has denied any claim of political retaliation against Linick. Attorney general William Barr said he did not expect the investigation of the handling of the Russian probe to lead to a criminal investigation of Barack Obama or Joe Biden. Barr said of federal prosecutor John Durham\u2019s investigation, \u201cI don\u2019t expect Mr. Durham\u2019s work will lead to a criminal investigation of either man.\u201d Barr\u2019s comments come as the presient has pushed the baseless claim that the former president and former vice president broke the law in connection to the Russia investigation. Trump has promoted this theory with the hashtag #Obamagate on Twitter, which former CIA analyst Ned Price has called \u201ca hashtag in search of a scandal.\u201d The Democratic chair of the House foreign affairs committee said the state department inspector general may have been fired because of his investigation into Mike Pompeo approving Saudi arms sales. \u201cI have learned that there may be another reason for [Steve] Linick\u2019s firing,\u201d congressman Eliot Engel told the Washington Post. \u201cHis office was investigating \u2014 at my request \u2014 Trump\u2019s phony declaration of an emergency so he could send weapons to Saudi Arabia.\u201d Engel added, \u201cWe don\u2019t have the full picture yet, but it\u2019s troubling that Secretary Pompeo wanted Mr. Linick pushed out before this work could be completed.\u201d Engel said he wanted a full accounting of what Linick uncovered as he investigated the secretary of state\u2019s decision to approve the arms sales despite congressional opposition. The state department inspector general was reportedly also investigating secretary of state Mike Pompeo for his decision to approve Saudi arms sales last year. According to NBC News, state department inspector general Steve Linick was looking into Pompeo\u2019s decision to approve billions of dollars of arms sales to Saudi Arabia last year, despite congressional opposition. Linick was fired Friday night, making him one of several inspector generals to be dismissed recently. Reports had already emerged that Linick was investigating Pompeo for allegedly using a state department staffer to run errands for him and his wife. Linick\u2019s dismissal has raised concerns about potential political retaliation for the investigation, considering Pompeo reportedly urged Trump to oust the inspector general. Trump lashed out against Republican senator Mitt Romney over Twitter, mocking the former presidential candidate for losing to Barack Obama. \u201cLoser!\u201d Trump wrote in the tweet, which included a video recapping Romney\u2019s 2012 loss to Obama, who has also attracted the president\u2019s ire this morning. Trump\u2019s tweet attacking Romney comes two days after the Utah Republican sent his own viral tweet that described the recent firings of multiple inspectors general as a \u201cthreat to accountable democracy and a fissure in the constitutional balance of power.\u201d The AFL-CIO, the largest US federation of union, has filed a court petition demanding an emergency temporary standard to protect workers from coronavirus. The president has been applauding states that have started reopening their economies, even though those states have not met federal guidelines on how to reopen safely. The hasty reopenings have sparked concerns that workers could be exposed to the virus, putting them at a heightened risk of becoming severely ill. \u201cIt\u2019s truly a sad day in America when working people must sue the organization tasked with protecting our health and safety,\u201d AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka said in a statement. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been left no choice. Millions are infected and nearly 90,000 have died, so it\u2019s beyond urgent that action is taken to protect workers who risk our lives daily to respond to this public health emergency. If the Trump administration refuses to act, we must compel them to.\u201d Republicans have been pushing to include liability protections for employers in the next coronavirus relief package, but Democrats have expressed concern that those protections could leave workers\u2019 health at risk. Interviews with longtime Trump supporters in Pennsylvania indicate the extraordinary durability of backing for the president among his base, despite widespread criticism of his handling of the coronavirus crisis. Few people understand the terrible cost of the coronavirus like Lee Snover, a Republican party chair in one of the key swing counties that could determine whether Donald Trump is reelected as president in November. Snover, who helped deliver an upset victory for Trump in 2016 in Northampton county, Pennsylvania, lost her father to the virus this spring. Her husband fell critically ill, too, spending 17 days in an intensive care unit before recovering. Her mother, a cancer survivor, was also in intensive care for eight days before emerging. \u201cIt spread through my entire family,\u201d Snover said. Trump stands accused of driving up the coronavirus death toll by downplaying the public health threat and urging the country to \u201creopen\u201d too quickly. But Snover does not see the president as having failed her family. \u201cI don\u2019t think people give him enough credit,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you think about what a businessman he was, and how much he loved that booming economy, do you know how hard it was for him to shut the country down? That was hard. So I give him credit for that.\u201d Barack Obama took some thinly veiled swipes at Donald Trump this weekend, as the former president delivered two virtual commencement addresses for the country\u2019s graduates. \u201cMore than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d Obama said in his address to graduates of historically black colleges and universities. \u201cA lot of them aren\u2019t even pretending to be in charge.\u201d Trump responded by continuing his Twitter attacks against his predecessor, retweeting an ally who claimed Obama was \u201cthe most corrupt president in US history.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s David Smith reported on Trump\u2019s fixation with Obama over the weekend. Matthew Miller, an Obama administration alum, told Smith, \u201cThere\u2019s some racism there but, most of all, it\u2019s driven by the fact that Obama has the thing that Trump has always craved but never achieved, and that\u2019s respect.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Kenya Evelyn reports on the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s opposition to \u201cimmunity passports\u201d: The US\u2019s largest civil rights group released an analysis in opposition of providing Americans with documentation showing they\u2019ve recovered from the coronavirus. Several countries have weighed using immunity passports to jumpstart tourism, getting citizens back to work and society closer to normal. Experts and business leaders in the US have also floated the idea. But the group contends that separating Americans into \u201ccovid-positive\u201d and \u201ccovid-negative\u201d classes would disproportionately affect the nation\u2019s most vulnerable people. \u201cWe at the ACLU have serious concerns about the adoption of any such proposal, because of its potential to harm public health,\u201d the group wrote, contending that service sector workers, communities of color, immigrants and the poor would be most impacted by a system in which only contagious workers are prevented from going to work. The ACLU\u2019s Esha Bhandari and ReNika Moore, who compiled the analysis, even argue the two-tier system incentivizes income-vulnerable individuals to purposefully become ill with the virus. \u201cThese incentives will be especially hard to counteract if immune workers are given preferential treatment in hiring or higher wages,\u201d they wrote. As the ACLU also notes, the science does not yet support the use of immunity passports or certificates. The accuracy of tests for coronavirus antibodies, and whether former patients can become reinfected with the virus, is highly contested. \u201cGiven the lack of scientific support for reliable immunity determinations, no significant policy decisions should currently be made on the basis of presumed immunity,\u201d the ACLU argued. The ACLU added the passports would threaten individual rights to privacy \u201cby creating a new surveillance infrastructure to collect health data.\u201d The Trump administration has pushed for states to reopen, even as the US experiences an uptick in the number of confirmed cases and deaths where states have relaxed stay-at-home restrictions. This is Joan Greve, taking over the blog from Martin Pengelly. The biotechnology company Moderna said it has seen promising results in its first human safety tests for a potential coronavirus vaccine. The Washington Post reports: The company reported that in eight patients who had been followed for a month and a half, the vaccine at low and medium doses triggered blood levels of virus-fighting antibodies that were similar or greater than those found in patients who recovered. That would suggest, but doesn\u2019t prove, that it triggers some level of immunity. The antibody-rich blood plasma donated by patients who have recovered is separately being tested to determine whether it is an effective therapy or preventive measure for covid-19. ... The data released Monday by Moderna is encouraging, but represents only a first step in a long process to bring a vaccine to market. It comes from an interim report on dozens of patients followed over weeks, whereas vaccine studies require broad testing in thousands of patients followed over many months or years. The news comes days after Moderna director Moncef Slaoui stepped down to take a role at the White House to help speed up vaccine development. Slaoui\u2019s move has sparked conflict of interest concerns, considering he still owns millions of dollars worth of company stock. Fed chairman Jerome Powell said in his \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview, which aired yesterday, that the US economy may not \u201cfully recover\u201d until there\u2019s a coronavirus vaccine. \u201cAssuming there\u2019s not a second wave of the coronavirus, I think you\u2019ll see the economy recover steadily through the second half of this year,\u201d Powell said. He added, \u201cFor the economy to fully recover, people will have to be fully confident. And that may have to await the arrival of a vaccine.\u201d It was quite a weekend for the Trump boys, Donald Jr and Eric, as the campaign attack dogs kept on taking the battle to the Democrats in ways even their father might not consider, if only due to some dim awareness of the last vestiges of dignity due the Oval Office. Donald Jr first. On Saturday, he chose to post to Instagram a meme which baselessly insinuated that Joe Biden, his father\u2019s probable opponent in the election in November, was a paedophile. Trump Jr said he had been \u201cjoking around\u201d, but also pursued the insinuation or even outright accusation further, accusing the former vice-president of \u201cunwanted touching\u201d and including in a tweet pictures taken from congressional swearing-in ceremonies and presented in misleading fashion. In a statement, Biden spokesman Andrew Bates said: \u201cNo repulsive, manipulative tactic will change the subject from how almost 90,000 Americans have paid for Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus negligence with their lives and how the booming economy he inherited from the Obama-Biden Administration is now suffering from depression-level job losses.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that earlier this year Trump Jr, 42, told Axios his father sometimes tells him to tone down his attacks on Twitter. His response: \u201cI learned it by watching you.\u201d Now, Eric. The president\u2019s second son spoke to Fox News host Jeanine Pirro on Saturday night, and accused Democrats of milking the coronavirus outbreak for political and, eventually, electoral gain. \u201cYou watch,\u201d he said, \u201cthey\u2019ll milk it every single day between now and 3 November [election day]. And guess what, after 3 November, coronavirus will magically, all of a sudden, go away and disappear and everybody will be able to reopen.\u201d Trump, 36, also said Democrats \u201cthink they\u2019re taking away Donald Trump\u2019s greatest tool, which is being able to go into an arena and fill it with 50,000 people every single time\u201d. Biden\u2019s campaign responded again, communications director Kate Bedingfield saying in a statement: \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of the biggest public health emergency in a century, with almost 90,000 Americans dead, 1.5 million infected, and 36 million workers newly jobless. \u201cSo for Eric Trump to claim that the coronavirus is a political hoax that will \u2018magically\u2019 disappear is absolutely stunning and unbelievably reckless.\u201d It\u2019s worth remembering here that in the far off, innocent days of early March, Donald Trump Jr told Fox News Democrats were trying \u201cto take a pandemic and seemingly hope that it comes here and kills millions of people so that they could end Donald Trump\u2019s streak of winning\u201d, which he claimed indicated \u201ca new level of sickness\u201d. Mike Pence, the vice-president, defended Trump Jr\u2019s claim. A furore over antisemitic and Nazi-sympathizing comments made by a Republican state representative in Alaska, who likened Covid-19 safety measures at the state capitol to the treatment of Jewish people in Nazi Germany, boiled up and over at the weekend. Alaska\u2019s legislature is due to return on Monday and representatives were told by email they would be asked to undergo screening as they entered the building. Those who are screened will be given a sticker to show completion. Those who refuse will not be given a sticker. In an emailed reply to the new measures that was obtained by the Alaska Landmine, Ben Carpenter, a Republican wrote: \u201cIf my sticker falls off, do I get a new one or do I get public shaming too? Are the stickers available as a yellow Star of David?\u201d The reply drew instant rebuke from colleagues in the House. \u201cThis is disgusting. Keep your Holocaust jokes to yourself,\u201d replied Grier Hopkins, a Democrat. Carpenter initially declined to apologise and in an interview with the Anchorage Daily News made remarks that appeared to show Nazi sympathies. \u201cCan you or I \u2013 can we even say it is totally out of the realm of possibility that Covid-19 patients will be rounded up and taken somewhere?\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want to say Hitler was a white supremacist. No. He was fearful of the Jewish nation, and that drove him into some unfathomable atrocities.\u201d On Sunday, facing a national backlash, Carpenter apologized in an op-ed for a local paper. \u201cI take my responsibility as the voice of the people who elected me very seriously,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI also hold the Jewish people in the highest regard. \u201cI do not take myself so seriously that I cannot recognize that the words I wrote, and those attributed to me, do not adequately reflect the esteem I hold for either group of people. I hope to correct that error now.\u201d The World Health Organization is holding its first global assembly since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. For the Guardian, Lily Kuo reports from Beijing: Beijing is expected to face new levels of pressure \u2026 as dozens of nations push for an independent investigation into the coronavirus outbreak and the US mounts a campaign over Taiwan\u2019s status. More than 120 countries have backed a draft resolution pushed by the European Union and Australia calling for an investigation into the origins of Covid-19, while a US-led coalition has been aggressively lobbying countries to support Taiwan\u2019s bid to attend as an observer. \u2026a report in the official news agency Xinhua on Sunday said \u201cthe US and other countries\u201d were \u201cdetermined to discuss Taiwan-related proposals for only one purpose: to politicise health issues and achieve their own interests at the expense of kidnapping the the World Health Assembly and hurting global cooperation\u201d. \u2026the Covid-19 pandemic, which first emerged in Wuhan last December, has placed China under more scrutiny as critics call for an investigation into how the virus was able to spread across the world. It has now infected more than 4.7 million people and killed 315,000. The resolution on Covid-19 will be put forward on Tuesday if it gains backing from two-thirds of the 194 members of the assembly. Here\u2019s the full report: In the US, Axios reported on Trump\u2019s position on WHO funding on Sunday night: President Trump is leaning toward preserving his total funding cut \u2026 after being on the brink of announcing he\u2019d restore partial funding to the global health agency, according to three sources familiar with the situation. A fourth source, a senior administration official, cautioned that the decision-making was fluid and was still subject to change. And today, Reuters reports the following remarks from WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus today: \u201cWe all have lessons to learn from the pandemic. Every country and every organisation must examine its response and learn from its experience. WHO is committed to transparency, accountability and continuous improvement.\u201d Andrew Pulver, film editor for the Guardian website in the UK, reports on what one of the makers of the Matrix thought of Elon Musk and Ivanka Trump twittering on about \u201ctaking the red pill\u201d: Film-maker Lilly Wachowski has responded to Elon Musk and Ivanka Trump after the pair bantered on social media. After Musk tweeted \u201cTake the red pill\u201d \u2013 referring to a key scene in The Matrix, which subsequently gave rise to the phrase \u201credpilling\u201d as an alt-right, misogynist meme, along with a red rose emoji normally associated with the Democratic Socialists of America, the party to which Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib belong \u2013 Trump replied: \u201cTaken!\u201d Wachowski then pithily responded, \u201cFuck both of you\u201d, before following up with a tweet supporting the Brave Space Alliance, which describes itself as \u201cthe first Black and trans led LGBTQIA center located on the South Side of Chicago\u201d. As I was past it in film terms even when The Matrix came out \u2013 as this piece illustrates handsomely \u2013 I\u2019ll leave the rest of this to Andrew. Full report is here: Speaking of reopening, or not, here\u2019s a picture from Virginia Beach this weekend: \u2026and here\u2019s some reporting from the Associated Press: Warm weather drew crowds to the Virginia Beach oceanfront even though the beach is considered closed under the state\u2019s stay-at-home directives. Families ordered snow cones, bought hermit crabs and cramped gift shops while bikers pedaled on the boardwalk on Saturday, the Virginian-Pilot reported. Tents, umbrellas and beach blankets were set up near the water. Under Governor Ralph Northam\u2019s first phase of a gradual reopening plan, retail stores are reopening with limited capacity, but indoor gyms remain closed, beaches are still off-limits and restaurants cannot provide indoor dine-in service. No restrictions have been lifted in northern Virginia, Richmond and Accomack County, which were granted two-week delays after local officials said it was too early to move forward. The top public health experts in the US, remember, say reopening too soon is a very bad idea indeed. And the beach in the picture above wasn\u2019t open. Politico\u2019s New York Playbook, meanwhile, has details on beaches in and around the city. In short, city beaches will stay closed while state beaches reopen at reduced capacity, a situation redolent of familiar differences between Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo (see here from ProPublica this weekend) and seemingly guaranteed to cause confusion\u2026 On the president\u2019s schedule today: no press briefing, either by Trump himself or his fourth press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany. Instead the president will meet restaurant industry leaders and then, with first lady Melania Trump, speak to governors by teleconference at 4pm. Interesting note from Sunday: an announced visit on Thursday to a Ford plant in Lansing, Michigan, that is now making ventilators. Point one: visits by Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence to facilities concerned with fighting the coronavirus or making equipment to fight it have \u2026 tended to produce news. Point two: Lansing is the Michigan state capital, and it has been the site of angry and in some cases armed protests against Democratic governor and potential Joe Biden running mate Gretchen Whitmer, by rightwingers demanding an end to lockdown. Trump has, controversially, supported such protests. Point three, as Jason Wilson reports: Cellphone location data suggests that demonstrators at anti-lockdown protests \u2013 some of which have been connected with Covid-19 cases \u2013 are often traveling hundreds of miles to events, returning to all parts of their states, and even crossing into neighboring ones. The data, provided to the Guardian by the progressive campaign group the Committee to Protect Medicare, raises the prospect that the protests will play a role in spreading the coronavirus epidemic to areas which have, so far, experienced relatively few infections. \u2026One visualization shows that in Lansing, Michigan, after a 30 April protest in which armed protesters stormed the capitol building and state police were forced to physically block access to Governor Gretchen Whitmer, devices which had been present at the protest site can be seen returning to all parts of the state, from Detroit to remote towns in the state\u2019s north. Full report here: \u2026and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus epidemic, and the politics around it, in the US. I\u2019m here till 9am ET or so, when Joan E Greve will take over in Washington. First, the figures from Johns Hopkins University in Maryland: US cases: 1,486,469 US deaths: 89,559 New York cases: 340,661 New York deaths: 22,013 Other states heavily hit include New Jersey, Massachusetts, Michigan, Illinois, California, Pennsylvania and Connecticut. And cases are on the rise away from the more urban states. The Trump administration spent Sunday continuing its pivot toward opening up the economy, in the face of crippling unemployment in an election year. But on Sunday night one of those independent voices who the president finds so irritating, Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, told CBS\u2019 60 Minutes, essentially, \u201cNot so fast.\u201d \u201cThis economy will recover,\u201d Powell said, but \u201cit may take a while. It may take a period of time, it could stretch through the end of next year, we don\u2019t really know.\u201d Powell also said unemployment could reach 25% and said the economy would not fully recover until Americans \u201cfeel they are safe\u201d. Powell said: \u201cAssuming that there\u2019s not a second wave of the coronavirus, I think you\u2019ll see the economy recover steadily through the second half of this year \u2026 People will have to be fully confident, and that may have to await the arrival of a vaccine.\u201d Short points to that end: Many experts fear a second wave of the coronavirus later in the year \u2013 one Trump administration whistleblower said last week the US was facing \u201cthe darkest winter in modern history\u201d and spoke of the country being \u201cin deep shit\u201d. Trump administration predictions about the development and availability of a vaccine are rated by most experts and even the Republican chair of the Senate health committee as hugely ambitious at best. Powell\u2019s interview would always have seemed likely to stoke the president\u2019s ire \u2013 he also urged more stimulus spending by Congress, and though the House passed a $3tn bill on Friday the Republican Senate and White House don\u2019t want it. And indeed Trump went at CBS on Sunday night. But he was most exercised about the aforementioned whistleblower, Rick Bright, whose interview he said showed CBS and 60 Minutes were \u201cdoing everything in their power to demean our Country, much to the benefit of the Radical Left Democrats\u201d. Trump attacked Bright, while characteristically claiming not to know him, and said \u201cthis whole Whistleblower racket needs to be looked at very closely, it is causing great injustice &amp; harm\u201d. A whistleblower from the intelligence community, remember, triggered Trump\u2019s impeachment over his approaches to Ukraine for help against his political rivals. Trump tagged Senator Susan Collins, who authored whistleblower protection legislation, and said he hoped the Maine Republican was \u201clistening\u201d. He also named the head of CBS, Shari Redstone, and said he hoped she would \u201ctake a look at her poorly performing gang\u201d. In other news on Sunday night, the Axios website reported that Trump is poised to confirm his cut of all funding to the World Health Organization \u2013 in the middle of a pandemic. And has been taking cues from Fox News. More to come.",

The proposed inquiry, mirroring previous WHO-led inquiries such as the one following the Ebola outbreak in west Africa, arguably stops short of the fully independent inquiry sought by Australia and the US, but represents a compromise brokered by a powerful alliance led by the European Union and India. The WHO-led inquiry set out in a resolution being put to the UN World Health Assembly on Monday, and negotiated over the past week, is probably less independent and less directed at China\u2019s role in informing the WHO than some critics of China wanted. But the likely terms of reference will give scope to examine China\u2019s cooperation with the WHO and the powers the organisation possesses to demand greater cooperation from member states. The compromise came after the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, told the assembly he supported a comprehensive evaluation, including into the sources and transmission routes of the virus. \u201cChina supports a comprehensive evaluation of the global response to the epidemic after the global epidemic is under control, to sum up experiences and remedy deficiencies,\u201d said Xi. \u201cThis work needs a scientific and professional attitude, and needs to be led by the WHO, and the principles of objectivity and fairness need to be upheld.\u201d He insisted that China had been transparent and open throughout, acting quickly to share information about the disease with the WHO, but said the world needed to be able to respond more quickly in future.

Without naming China, Azar added: \u201cIn an apparent attempt to conceal this outbreak, at least one member state made a mockery of their transparency obligations, with tremendous costs for the entire world. \u201cWe saw that WHO failed at its core mission of information sharing and transparency when member states do not act in good faith. This cannot ever happen again.\u201d In a hard-hitting speech, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said recent weeks had seen many expressions of international solidarity, but very little practical action. \u201cWe are all paying the price for implementing contradictory strategies,\u201d he said. He warned the disease had spread across the world, and was now heading for developing countries where he predicted it would be even more devastating. He said the WHO was irreplaceable and needed enhanced support, arguing: \u201cWe are as strong as the weakest health system.\u201d An inquiry to look back fully into how everyone reacted, he said, should wait until we have turned the page. \u201cNow is not the time,\u201d he insisted, arguing: \u201cNow is the time for unity. We stand together, or we fail.\u201d The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the only priority worth talking about was ending the disease. The time demanded \u201cfreedom from complacency and unfounded accusations\u201d, a remark that could be directed at Washington\u2019s repeated claim that China may have deliberately spread the virus in the west. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, threw her support behind the WHO, saying everyone needed to look at the sustainability of its financing.",

Earlier, the embassy in Canberra said the resolution set to be decided at the World Health Assembly on Tuesday evening was \u201ctotally different from Australia\u2019s proposal of an independent international review\u201d \u2013 something it argued was clear from a close look at the draft itself. \u201cAll those who know the consultation process that led to the resolution understand this,\u201d an embassy spokesperson said in an emailed statement on Tuesday. \u201cTo claim the WHA\u2019s resolution a vindication of Australia\u2019s call is nothing but a joke.\u201d China had repeatedly claimed Australia\u2019s vocal early calls for an independent investigation into the origins and handling of the coronavirus were a political \u201cmanoeuvre\u201d against Beijing. But on Monday the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, voiced support for a Covid-19 review led by the World Health Organization, although he said it should only happen after the pandemic was under control. A motion drafted by the European Union and strongly backed by Australia is expected to pass the World Health Assembly on Tuesday. The motion \u2013 co-sponsored by about 120 countries \u2013 calls on the WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, to initiate a \u201cstepwise process of impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation\u201d to review the lessons learned from the international health response to Covid-19.

But the question of origins is not dealt with in that process. A separate clause in the motion urges Tedros to continue to work closely with the World Organisation for Animal Health, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and countries \u201cto identify the zoonotic source of the virus and the route of introduction to the human population\u201d.

Last week a former senior diplomat warned that ties between the two countries were at risk of slipping into permanent hostility. The new tariffs, which take effect on Tuesday and apply for five years, come as a blow to Australian barley producers, which rely on China as their largest export market. Industry groups predict the impost will make the trade impossible until the dispute is resolved. China\u2019s commerce ministry announced late on Monday that it would proceed with tariffs of 73.6% on barley imported from Australia after an 18-month investigation into claims the industry was \u201cdumping\u201d the product at a lower price than at home. In addition, a tariff of 6.9% will be applied based on claims the Australian industry gains an unfair advantage from government subsidies. The commerce ministry said the dumping and subsidies \u201ccaused material injury\u201d to China\u2019s domestic barley industry. But Birmingham said it was \u201ccompletely ridiculous\u201d for the Chinese government to list measures such as Murray-Darling Basin infrastructure upgrades as a type of subsidy to barley exporters, when the bulk of the barley production involved dry-land farming. Birmingham said it was \u201cvery disappointing that China has, to date, refused to schedule minister-to-minister discussions\u201d as this would be the best way to resolve disagreements. He said Australia would \u201creserve our rights\u201d when it came to having the dispute resolved through the WTO, although he noted \u201cthere may be other paths that we choose to pursue first\u201d. Littleproud said \u201cwild speculation\u201d that the push for a Covid-19 inquiry could have been behind China\u2019s decision on barley tariffs was \u201cdangerous\u201d. \u201cThere is no trade war,\u201d Littleproud said. \u201cEveryone needs to take a deep breath, take a cold shower and understand that we produce the best food and fibre in the world and that we\u2019ll be able to send our barley and other produce into other markets if our producers wish to do so.\u201d The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, called on the government to seek clarity from the US about the American agriculture sector\u2019s increased access to China \u201cand whether that has disadvantaged Australia\u201d. China announced last week it would immediately allow barley imports from the US, which was seen as a measure to meet commitments in the first phase of a trade deal with Donald Trump. The National Farmers\u2019 Federation said it was \u201cfrustrated and deeply concerned\u201d with Beijing\u2019s decision on tariffs and called on the government to pursue the issue through the WTO \u201cto the fullest extent possible\u201d. The federation\u2019s chief executive, Tony Mahar, said China was Australia\u2019s largest barley market, taking almost half of its crop \u2013 worth about $917m \u2013 each year. \u201cThis is a massive blow to Australian grain growers, who are right now nearing the end of their winter planting,\u201d he said.",

According to a <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6262/809\">2015 Science magazine study</a>, the Gulf of Maine is heating up faster than 99% of the world\u2019s oceans. This, in addition to proactive conservation efforts implemented over the years, has accounted for the flourishing of the lobster population; lobster are thriving in the slightly warmer waters. But lobstermen know better than to celebrate. All they need to do is look at what happened in the early 2000s in places like Connecticut, Rhode Island, and the Long Island Sound, where once-robust lobster fisheries have become commercially extinct due to the continually warming waters.</p> <p>\u201cI think we have a long time before that happens in Maine,\u201d says Susie Arnold, a marine scientist at Maine\u2019s Island Institute, who works with fishermen to diversify their businesses by including aquaculture, like kelp farming. \u201cBut the changes that are occurring are undeniable.\u201d</p> <p>Those changes aren\u2019t good, but kelp farming has the potential for environmental good. \u201cThe ocean is a sponge for carbon dioxide,\u201d says Nichole Price, senior research scientist and director of the Center for Seafood Solutions at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Maine. Carbon dioxide is the cause of ocean acidification, one of the myriad stressors responsible for destroying coral reefs and preventing mollusks from building their shells. Price has found evidence that sugar kelp has an especially high capacity for absorbing CO2 and thus lowering the acidity of the surrounding water. Investing in kelp farming now could potentially benefit marine life in the future.</p> <p>\u201cThe Maine coast is almost all lobster now, and it didn\u2019t used to be that way,\u201d says Baines, who has a close-cropped white beard, chiseled cheekbones and hazel eyes so deep-set that it often looks like he\u2019s squinting. \u201cWhen I was a teenager, in summertimes I worked in a lobster boat that went long-lining for ground fish \u2013 cod, haddock, hake \u2013 that were dominant in the Gulf of Maine.\u201d The way Baines says \u201ccod\u201d sounds more like \u201ccaught\u201d, as one might expect of a New Jersey native who spent his childhood summers in Maine and has lived his adult life here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--showcase\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F11e4b618d05331595ee6c5ed874dbe48fcf3c932%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3600_5400&amp;left-caption=&amp;right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Ff577b8f212acaac031b433c970e949793253cf55%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3600_5400&amp;right-caption=&amp;always-place-captions-below=false\" data-alt=\"Bob Baines details\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/photo-collage/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&left-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2F11e4b618d05331595ee6c5ed874dbe48fcf3c932%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3600_5400&left-caption=&right-image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.gutools.co.uk%2Fimages%2Ff577b8f212acaac031b433c970e949793253cf55%3Fcrop%3D0_0_3600_5400&right-caption=&always-place-captions-below=false\">Bob Baines details</a> <figcaption><strong>Left:</strong> Bob Baines at the helm of the FV Thrasher. <strong>Right:</strong> Heading back to harbor after checking progress of his kelp farm off Spruce Head, Maine. Photographs: Greta Rybus/The Guardian</figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Baines still goes out scalloping and sometimes fishes for halibut, most Maine lobstermen these days rely entirely on lobster to survive. If it\u2019s a bad year for lobster, it\u2019s a very bad year for lobstermen. And, in general, profit margins are lower than they were years ago, due to fuel costs and the rising price of bait and gear, in addition to regulations placed on lobster fishing by the federal government to protect the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/17/north-atlantic-right-whales-were-watching-them-die\">endangered right whale</a>. Federal restrictions due to the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/11/01/china-loves-maine-lobster-trumps-trade-war-means-canada-is-filling-demand/?arc404=true\">trade war </a>with China and the economic fallout caused by Covid-19 have further devastated their bottom line.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>If it\u2019s a bad year for lobster, it\u2019s a very bad year for lobstermen</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Kelp farming is positioned as a form of insurance, offering lobstermen such as Baines some of the financial security off-season fishing once did. He is one of the 24 \u201cpartner farmers\u201d working with Atlantic Sea Farms, which was founded in 2009 under the name Ocean Approved as the first commercial seaweed farm and nursery in North America. (Baines\u2019s daughter, Jesse, works for the company.) Atlantic cultivates seeds and gives them to partner farmers, assists with the design and layout of the kelp farms, and coaches farmers throughout the season \u2013 from setting up the farm in the winter to the harvest in spring, complementary to lobster\u2019s summer to fall season. Because Atlantic Sea Farms seeks experienced lobstermen who already have equipment and know-how, start-up costs tend to be lower than those who are beginning from scratch.</p> <p>The farmers grow two types of kelp \u2013 ripply sugar kelp and ribbon-like skinny kelp \u2013 which Atlantic then processes into a line of goods they sell online, to grocery stores, fast-casual chains, meal kit companies such as Daily Harvest, and national restaurants. Kelp grows 3-8lbs per foot of line, which means a farm with 13,000ft, the average size of Atlantic Sea Farms\u2019 partner farmers\u2019 lines, can potentially generate around $20,000 to $57,000 at harvest time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"951a0524dedf0585eb8cf37b40da87f46bfa3f26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/951a0524dedf0585eb8cf37b40da87f46bfa3f26/0_0_5400_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Baines is among 19 veteran lobstermen along the Maine coast who are applying their hard-earned expertise to kelp farming.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Baines is among 19 veteran lobstermen along the Maine coast who are applying their hard-earned expertise to kelp farming.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Greta Rybus/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Southport, Maine, an hour down the coast from Baines\u2019 kelp farm, husband and wife Alex Hutchins and Jodi Brewer are coming up on the end of their latest season growing kelp for Atlantic Sea Farms. This will be their third harvest \u2013 though last year an errant dock tore through their lines, sweeping their entire farm away. \u201cWe were getting ready to harvest,\u201d says Hutchins, 35, wearing a weathered baseball cap, wisps of sandy brown hair poking out from underneath. \u201cThere were 18,000 feet of line, 3 \u00bd to 4lbs of kelp a foot, about 5 to 8ft long \u2013 we would have had 90,000lbs of kelp. We spent three days cleaning it up.\u201d</p> <p>After last year\u2019s debacle, Hutchins babysits the plots regularly to see that the lines haven\u2019t crossed, which would rub the kelp right off, and otherwise make sure that everything is looking right. If all goes well, he is projecting a 48,000lb harvest.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not much of a quitter,\u201d says Hutchins. \u201cWhen Jodi and I met, the price of lobster went down and I was washing windows for $10 an hour.\u201d Hutchins, who comes from a long line of lobstermen, is no stranger to the turbulence of the trade. His family started fishing in Maine in the 1600s; he himself has been lobstering since he was eight, and started in earnest as a 20-year-old, with his father as his sternman. Until a few years ago, Hutchins fished for shrimp during the lobster off-season. He had invested in hundreds of shrimp traps right before the state closed the shrimp fishery in 2014, due to the warming waters. That is when he and Brewer turned to kelp.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted to fill the void where we had lost shrimping,\u201d says Brewer, who wears a fleece pullover embroidered with her name, and punctuates her speech with nervous giggles. \u201cThe price of lobster is so volatile anyways,\u201d adds Hutchins. \u201cWhat we have going on right now with the coronavirus and the prices dropping.

      "bodyText": "Rocky shorelines and weathered saltbox homes dot the landscape of South Thomaston on the coast of Maine. Lobster traps take up frontyard real estate and lobster shacks, still shuttered for the season, are common sightings. Back from a day of scalloping, lobsterman Bob Baines has docked his boat, the FV Thrasher, at the Spruce Head Fishermans Co-op. His sternman, David McLellan, clad in waterproof overalls like Baines, shucks the last few hauls, tossing the meats into a bucket and the shells overboard. It\u2019s the last week of scallop season, but there is a new venture on the horizon. Baines, 64, steers the Thrasher back out toward Hewett Island on Penobscot Bay to check on the underwater kelp farm that he \u201cplanted\u201d in December. It\u2019s a willowy structure made up of moorings, buoys and ropes that hovers 7ft underwater and spans 1,000ft wide, like a monster cat\u2019s cradle. The only indicator that there is anything happening below the surface are the buoys that outline a hidden plot, with 13 parallel lines criss-crossing back and forth, each wrapped in a helix of twine impregnated with kelp seed that has grown into translucent brown ribbons. Baines is among the latest of 19 veteran lobstermen along the Maine coast who are applying their hard-earned expertise to kelp farming. It\u2019s boom time for lobster in Maine \u2013 2019 was the fourth most profitable year in the history of an industry that accounts for $1bn in state revenue, second only to tourism. But a variety of factors, most of which can be traced to climate change, have left lobstermen more vulnerable than ever. The lobster industry\u2019s unprecedented growth may sound like a good thing, but the cause of it is alarming. According to a 2015 Science magazine study, the Gulf of Maine is heating up faster than 99% of the world\u2019s oceans. This, in addition to proactive conservation efforts implemented over the years, has accounted for the flourishing of the lobster population; lobster are thriving in the slightly warmer waters. But lobstermen know better than to celebrate. All they need to do is look at what happened in the early 2000s in places like Connecticut, Rhode Island, and the Long Island Sound, where once-robust lobster fisheries have become commercially extinct due to the continually warming waters. \u201cI think we have a long time before that happens in Maine,\u201d says Susie Arnold, a marine scientist at Maine\u2019s Island Institute, who works with fishermen to diversify their businesses by including aquaculture, like kelp farming. \u201cBut the changes that are occurring are undeniable.\u201d Those changes aren\u2019t good, but kelp farming has the potential for environmental good. \u201cThe ocean is a sponge for carbon dioxide,\u201d says Nichole Price, senior research scientist and director of the Center for Seafood Solutions at the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Maine. Carbon dioxide is the cause of ocean acidification, one of the myriad stressors responsible for destroying coral reefs and preventing mollusks from building their shells. Price has found evidence that sugar kelp has an especially high capacity for absorbing CO2 and thus lowering the acidity of the surrounding water. Investing in kelp farming now could potentially benefit marine life in the future. \u201cThe Maine coast is almost all lobster now, and it didn\u2019t used to be that way,\u201d says Baines, who has a close-cropped white beard, chiseled cheekbones and hazel eyes so deep-set that it often looks like he\u2019s squinting. \u201cWhen I was a teenager, in summertimes I worked in a lobster boat that went long-lining for ground fish \u2013 cod, haddock, hake \u2013 that were dominant in the Gulf of Maine.\u201d The way Baines says \u201ccod\u201d sounds more like \u201ccaught\u201d, as one might expect of a New Jersey native who spent his childhood summers in Maine and has lived his adult life here. While Baines still goes out scalloping and sometimes fishes for halibut, most Maine lobstermen these days rely entirely on lobster to survive. If it\u2019s a bad year for lobster, it\u2019s a very bad year for lobstermen. And, in general, profit margins are lower than they were years ago, due to fuel costs and the rising price of bait and gear, in addition to regulations placed on lobster fishing by the federal government to protect the endangered right whale. Federal restrictions due to the trade war with China and the economic fallout caused by Covid-19 have further devastated their bottom line. Kelp farming is positioned as a form of insurance, offering lobstermen such as Baines some of the financial security off-season fishing once did. He is one of the 24 \u201cpartner farmers\u201d working with Atlantic Sea Farms, which was founded in 2009 under the name Ocean Approved as the first commercial seaweed farm and nursery in North America. (Baines\u2019s daughter, Jesse, works for the company.) Atlantic cultivates seeds and gives them to partner farmers, assists with the design and layout of the kelp farms, and coaches farmers throughout the season \u2013 from setting up the farm in the winter to the harvest in spring, complementary to lobster\u2019s summer to fall season. Because Atlantic Sea Farms seeks experienced lobstermen who already have equipment and know-how, start-up costs tend to be lower than those who are beginning from scratch. The farmers grow two types of kelp \u2013 ripply sugar kelp and ribbon-like skinny kelp \u2013 which Atlantic then processes into a line of goods they sell online, to grocery stores, fast-casual chains, meal kit companies such as Daily Harvest, and national restaurants. Kelp grows 3-8lbs per foot of line, which means a farm with 13,000ft, the average size of Atlantic Sea Farms\u2019 partner farmers\u2019 lines, can potentially generate around $20,000 to $57,000 at harvest time. In Southport, Maine, an hour down the coast from Baines\u2019 kelp farm, husband and wife Alex Hutchins and Jodi Brewer are coming up on the end of their latest season growing kelp for Atlantic Sea Farms. This will be their third harvest \u2013 though last year an errant dock tore through their lines, sweeping their entire farm away. \u201cWe were getting ready to harvest,\u201d says Hutchins, 35, wearing a weathered baseball cap, wisps of sandy brown hair poking out from underneath. \u201cThere were 18,000 feet of line, 3 \u00bd to 4lbs of kelp a foot, about 5 to 8ft long \u2013 we would have had 90,000lbs of kelp. We spent three days cleaning it up.\u201d After last year\u2019s debacle, Hutchins babysits the plots regularly to see that the lines haven\u2019t crossed, which would rub the kelp right off, and otherwise make sure that everything is looking right. If all goes well, he is projecting a 48,000lb harvest. \u201cI\u2019m not much of a quitter,\u201d says Hutchins. \u201cWhen Jodi and I met, the price of lobster went down and I was washing windows for $10 an hour.\u201d Hutchins, who comes from a long line of lobstermen, is no stranger to the turbulence of the trade. His family started fishing in Maine in the 1600s; he himself has been lobstering since he was eight, and started in earnest as a 20-year-old, with his father as his sternman. Until a few years ago, Hutchins fished for shrimp during the lobster off-season. He had invested in hundreds of shrimp traps right before the state closed the shrimp fishery in 2014, due to the warming waters. That is when he and Brewer turned to kelp. \u201cWe wanted to fill the void where we had lost shrimping,\u201d says Brewer, who wears a fleece pullover embroidered with her name, and punctuates her speech with nervous giggles. \u201cThe price of lobster is so volatile anyways,\u201d adds Hutchins. \u201cWhat we have going on right now with the coronavirus and the prices dropping. Normally this is the highest price time of year. I got $10.50 to $11 per lb this time last year. And now we\u2019re at $4, $4.50. So it\u2019s nice for me to have something else to fall back on besides lobstering.\u201d Back in South Thomaston, Baines cruises toward his kelp farm, pointing it out on a chart plotter, where it looks like a stick drawing of a rectangle on a digital screen. It appears straightforward enough, but creating a three-dimensional rope structure in the ocean is as challenging as you\u2019d think. \u201cWhen you\u2019re seeding the farm, you\u2019re working out of a skiff, not out of a big lobster boat,\u201d says Baines. \u201cIn a 14ft skiff in choppy waters, you\u2019re bouncing all over the place. When I got home that first day of seeding, I hadn\u2019t been that tired in I don\u2019t know how many years of fishing.\u201d But the effort seems to be paying off. Baines lifts a line out of the water, from where kelp the color of a Budweiser bottle dangles like streamers and offers a sample. The flavor is fresh and vegetal, like underripe peas, and, surprisingly, not salty. No wonder it has gastronomic appeal. Atlantic Sea Farms\u2019 kelp has been championed by the likes of Alice Waters, renowned chef, and made an appearance last March in a salad created by chef David Chang for the fast-casual chain Sweetgreen. At Chaval, a French and Spanish-influenced restaurant in Portland, kelp has found its way into the glass \u2013 dried and powdered, in a salted cocktail rim that tasted like the beach \u2013 and onto the plate \u2013 in an ethereally crisp churro stuffed with lemon cream, where kelp is integrated into the dough and blended into the sugar mixture that is sprinkled on top. Despite the multifold promise of kelp, not everyone is on board with seaweed aquaculture. \u201cKelp farming is so new that for many fishermen, the initial reaction is \u2018I don\u2019t want that around here, that\u2019s where I go lobstering\u2019,\u201d says Baines. At a community hearing last year to review the lease for Baine\u2019s kelp farm, other lobstermen complained that the aquaculture lease would somehow hamper their ability to catch lobster, even though kelp farming occurs from winter to the spring, during lobster\u2019s off-season. \u201cIt\u2019s not a reasonable argument,\u201d says Baines. \u201cOnce they see that my lease didn\u2019t bother anyone or take anything away from them, it will all settle right down.\u201d Meanwhile, Atlantic Sea Farms powers ahead.

But watching so little television is certainly novel for Thorne. The 41-year-old grew up in Bristol and Berkshire, and would spend five or six hours a day in front of the TV \u2013 mostly on the sofa next to his mum \u2013 running straight through from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/eastenders\">EastEnders</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/apr/09/tim-pigott-smith-obituary\">Tim Piggott-Smith</a> in The Chief before the news kicked in at 10.</p> <p>And it didn\u2019t stop there. \u201cMy mate lived near the school, so we\u2019d go over at lunchtime and watch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/31/bouncers-dream-and-gorillagrams-an-oral-history-of-neighbours-the-worlds-silliest-sunniest-show\">Neighbours</a>,\u201d Thorne says. \u201cAnd then I\u2019d watch it again in the evening. I\u2019d watch the same show twice. In one day. I was a relatively clever kid \u2013 what was I doing?

And he said, \u2018What the fuck are you doing here then?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Whatever it was, it worked.

It originated from an idea by acclaimed music producer Glen Ballard and, along with Alan Ball (the creator of Six Feet Under), Chazelle was brought on board to direct before he had hit the big time, while Thorne was the last to join. But it was Thorne who was tasked with crafting the story. The protagonist even shares a name with his son. \u201cWe\u2019d just failed our third round of IVF having decided that we\u2019d definitely call him Elliott if he was a boy,\u201d Thorne tells me later over email. \u201cI stole his name for a TV character, essentially.\u201d</p> <p>Which must make it all the more frustrating that some have framed the show as Chazelle\u2019s response to accusations of racial insensitivity in his past projects. La La Land <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/06/la-la-land-criticism-race-gender-jazz-awards\">prompted a backlash</a> due to the way it framed a white protagonist as the true spirit of jazz, counterposed with John Legend playing a commercial sell-out. The Eddy also has jazz at its heart, but this time there is a black leading man: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/16/moonlight-review-masculinity-naomie-harris\">Moonlight</a>\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Holland as club owner Elliot. And that had nothing to do with Chazelle.</p> <p>\u201c[The character] was black from the beginning,\u201d Thorne explains. \u201cBecause of the history of black Americans in Paris, if you\u2019re telling the story of an American jazz club, you tell the story about an African American doing that. I set up a very diverse writing team \u2013 Rebecca Lenkiewicz has lived in eastern Europe, Rachel De-Lahay is one of the most articulate people about race I\u2019ve ever come across in my life.

He spends far more time talking about city infrastructure (his dad was a town planner), Grenfell and the exclusion of working-class urban communities than he does five/four rhythms or Louis Armstrong. What really drew him to this story, he says, was the version of Paris it would allow him to examine. This isn\u2019t the picture postcard view, all pretty bridges and the Eiffel Tower. It\u2019s life in the grittier <em>arrondissements</em>.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s something about Paris, because of the ring road,\u201d he says. \u201cThe exclusivity it creates. I\u2019d spent a lot of time there, I hung out in those places, mostly talking to dealers. I\u2019d seen the lack of infrastructure.

Thorne has been a passionate advocate for a more inclusive attitude towards disability in the industry \u2013 and believes things had started to improve. But with money bound to be tight it would be all too easy for things to slip backwards. \u201cI could feel the landscape changing and I\u2019m petrified that when I go back, the theatres won\u2019t have the resources or the energy to support that,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause the Arts Council isn\u2019t going to be able to support them all.\u201d</p> <p>Thorne\u2019s next project was set to be a lavish retelling of A Christmas Carol at the Old Vic theatre \u2013 which is still due later this year.

I\u2019ve spent about four or five years trying to think Philip Pullman\u2019s thoughts. He is one of the cleverest, most soulful writers I\u2019ve ever encountered. And I hope that by spending time with him, I\u2019m making myself into a better writer. If I just wrote my own stuff, I would probably go down that cul-de-sac of being a slightly tormented, anxious, weird man.\u201d</p> <p>And yet that is what he plans to do in the next phase of what he somewhat bashfully calls his career next. \u201cI\u2019m trying to self-generate a bit more,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be a more conscious about my choices. I feel like I\u2019ve been given a lot of stories, and now I need to work out what stories I want to tell.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>The Eddy is on Netflix now.</p></li> </ul>",

So when I speak to Jack Thorne, the multi-award-winning writer of His Dark Materials, This Is England and new Netflix drama The Eddy, I\u2019m keen to know which prestige TV shows he\u2019s bingeing on. \u201cAnything with Keith Lemon in it,\u201d he says. \u201cMe and my wife get an hour to watch TV at night, otherwise we\u2019re not going to be able to cope with Elliott\u201d \u2013 their four-year-old son.

But with money bound to be tight it would be all too easy for things to slip backwards. \u201cI could feel the landscape changing and I\u2019m petrified that when I go back, the theatres won\u2019t have the resources or the energy to support that,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause the Arts Council isn\u2019t going to be able to support them all.\u201d Thorne\u2019s next project was set to be a lavish retelling of A Christmas Carol at the Old Vic theatre \u2013 which is still due later this year. It\u2019s another adaptation for a writer who is perhaps best known for taking on others\u2019 work. \u201cI love doing other people\u2019s stuff,\u201d he admits. \u201cI learn so much. I\u2019ve spent about four or five years trying to think Philip Pullman\u2019s thoughts. He is one of the cleverest, most soulful writers I\u2019ve ever encountered. And I hope that by spending time with him, I\u2019m making myself into a better writer. If I just wrote my own stuff, I would probably go down that cul-de-sac of being a slightly tormented, anxious, weird man.\u201d And yet that is what he plans to do in the next phase of what he somewhat bashfully calls his career next. \u201cI\u2019m trying to self-generate a bit more,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be a more conscious about my choices. I feel like I\u2019ve been given a lot of stories, and now I need to work out what stories I want to tell.\u201d The Eddy is on Netflix now.",

      "bodyText": "Government wage subsidies for disabled and vulnerable workers could be drastically scaled back from August under Treasury plans to wind down its Covid-19 furlough scheme, employers\u2019 groups have warned. Charities and social enterprise employers have been told by the government that its plan to bring the coronavirus job retention scheme to an eventual close this autumn does not currently include an exemption for vulnerable workers. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, announced last week that the furlough scheme \u2013 under which the government pays 80% of staff wages up to \u00a32,500 a month \u2013 would be extended until October. However, state support will be scaled back from August, with employers expected to contribute to maintain a wage packet of at least 80% for furloughed workers. Although a final decision has yet to be taken, the chancellor is believed to favour a universal approach to scaling back the scheme for all employers, without tailoring it to reflect a gradual return to work for firms and workers. Business groups and Labour have however warned that a blanket approach could trigger widespread job losses in sectors of the economy where Covid-19 restrictions are kept in place for longer \u2013 such as in pubs, theatres and restaurants \u2013 or for firms with higher numbers of vulnerable staff. Anneliese Dodds, the shadow chancellor, said: \u201cIf we see all sectors being lumped together in this way, and we also don\u2019t see a differentiated scheme for particularly vulnerable workers, then we\u2019ll see a very major spike in unemployment.

The scheme is currently costing about \u00a314bn a month. Sunak told parliament on Monday that he would provide an update by the end of the month. \u201cWe\u2019re in deep consultation with both unions and business groups to make sure we get the design of the second part of this scheme right. It\u2019s right both for the economy and indeed for the taxpayer to ask employers to make a contribution to paying the wages of their employees,\u201d he said. However, Social Enterprise UK, which represents thousands of charities and social enterprises, said it had been warned by Downing Street not to expect tweaks to the scheme to support vulnerable workers following talks with No 10. The trade body has written a letter to Sunak alongside other groups representing more than 100,000 social enterprises \u2013 including Co-operatives UK and the Disability Business Forum \u2013 to warn this would raise the risk of redundancies for the most vulnerable people in society. Lord Victor Adebowale, chair of Social Enterprise UK, said: \u201cWithout flexibility in the winding down of the furlough scheme, the good work that has been done in recent years to help disabled people, those recovering from addiction and helping ex-offenders back in work could be undermined. \u201cThese workers could take years to get back into work with a huge impact on their wellbeing as well as creating higher costs to the taxpayer.\u201d The government has told 2.5 million people to shield from coronavirus, with hundreds of thousands of these people in employment.

The death toll stands at 318,534. US deaths, the highest worldwide, passed 90,000,<strong> </strong>and the number of cases climbed above 1.5m, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker.</p> <h2><strong>Trump threatens to make WHO funding freeze \u2018permanent\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Late on Monday evening, Donald Trump tweeted a letter addressed to World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus saying that if the WHO \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/global-report-trump-threatens-to-pull-out-of-who-over-failed-response-to-pandemic\">does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days</a>, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the World Health Organization permanent and reconsider our membership of the organization.\u201d The letter does not detail what the improvements are.</p> <h2><strong>WHO chief promises review of coronavirus response</strong></h2> <p>Before Trump\u2019s letter was released, the World Health Organization said on Monday that an independent review of the global coronavirus response would begin as soon as possible . A resolution drafted by the European Union calling for an independent evaluation of the WHO\u2019s performance appeared to have won consensus backing among the WHO\u2019s 194 states. The motion is expected to be voted on on Tuesday.</p> <h2><strong>Trump says he is taking hydroxychloroquine</strong></h2> <p>After US president told reporters at the White House that he has been<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/trump-taking-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-fda-warnings\"> taking hydroxychloroquine</a>, his doctor released a letter confirming that they had discussed the use of the drug and \u201cconcluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks.\u201d A White House spokesperson told the New York Times that Trump was prescribed the drug and is taking it.

      "bodyText": "Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Global cases pass 4.8 million There are 4,805,005 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The death toll stands at 318,534. US deaths, the highest worldwide, passed 90,000, and the number of cases climbed above 1.5m, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Trump threatens to make WHO funding freeze \u2018permanent\u2019 Late on Monday evening, Donald Trump tweeted a letter addressed to World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus saying that if the WHO \u201cdoes not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the World Health Organization permanent and reconsider our membership of the organization.\u201d The letter does not detail what the improvements are. WHO chief promises review of coronavirus response Before Trump\u2019s letter was released, the World Health Organization said on Monday that an independent review of the global coronavirus response would begin as soon as possible . A resolution drafted by the European Union calling for an independent evaluation of the WHO\u2019s performance appeared to have won consensus backing among the WHO\u2019s 194 states. The motion is expected to be voted on on Tuesday. Trump says he is taking hydroxychloroquine After US president told reporters at the White House that he has been taking hydroxychloroquine, his doctor released a letter confirming that they had discussed the use of the drug and \u201cconcluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks.\u201d A White House spokesperson told the New York Times that Trump was prescribed the drug and is taking it. The US Food and Drug Administration has cautioned against use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for Covid-19 outside of a hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems. Brazil cases overtake UK to become third-highest worldwide The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Brazil stands at 255,368, according to Johns Hopkins University figures, making the country the third-worst affected in terms of cases.There are 16,792 officially confirmed deaths in Brazil, which is lower than the UK, Italy, Spain and France.

      "body": "<h2>Top story: US president says he is taking hydroxychloroquine</h2> \n<p>Good morning, Warren Murray giving you a push start along the hard shoulder.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/global-report-trump-threatens-to-pull-out-of-who-over-failed-response-to-pandemic\">has written an incendiary letter to the WHO chief</a>, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, saying that unless the organisation made \u201cmajor substantive improvements\u201d, which he did not specify, the US would cut funding permanently and reconsider its membership. The letter alleged the WHO had shown an \u201calarming lack of independence\u201d from China and accused Tedros of presiding over \u201crepeated missteps \u2026 that have been extremely costly for the world\u201d, including Trump said, consistently ignoring \u201ccredible reports\u201d of the virus spreading in Wuhan in December.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s threat came on the day the WHO member states held a virtual assembly and were poised to agree an independent investigation into how the coronavirus was handled. The letter also coincided with Trump announcing that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/trump-taking-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-fda-warnings\">he had been taking hydroxychloroquine for a couple of weeks</a>, despite warnings from his administration that it is dangerous. \u201cI think it\u2019s good, I heard a lot of good stories \u2026 I take a pill every day,\u201d Trump said.</p> \n<p>At home in the UK, evidence is mounting that the under-25s have been hit hardest by the Covid-19 economic fallout. In a report published today ahead of unemployment figures expected to highlight the pandemic\u2019s impact on the labour market, the Resolution Foundation says ministers should be considering job guarantees to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/19/young-workers-jobs-covid-19-crisis-resolution-foundation-economic-fallout\">prevent young people being permanently scarred by the crisis</a>. \u201cOne in three young people have been furloughed or lost their jobs completely, and over one in three have had their pay reduced since the crisis started,\u201d said Maja Gustafsson from the Resolution Foundation. Large numbers of young people are employed in severely affected sectors such as leisure, retail and hospitality. Wage subsidies for disabled and vulnerable workers could fall away from August along with the furlough scheme, employers\u2019 groups have warned. Charities and social enterprise employers have been told by the government that its plan to close the scheme this autumn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/vulnerable-not-exempt-from-coronavirus-furlough-winding-down-employers-told\">does not exempt vulnerable workers</a>. </p> \n<p>Temporary care workers transmitted Covid-19 between care homes as cases surged, according to an unpublished study by Public Health England. Agency workers \u2013 often employed on zero-hours contracts \u2013 unwittingly spread the infection after being drafted in to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/agency-staff-were-spreading-covid-19-between-care-homes-phe-found-in-april\">replace existing staff who were self-isolating</a> to protect care home residents. At least 22,000 people are estimated to have died in care homes in England and Wales directly or indirectly from Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Stay tuned in to our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/19/coronavirus-live-news-imf-chief-says-economic-recovery-unlikely-in-2021-as-us-deaths-pass-90000\">global live blog</a> for updates and catch up with overnight news <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance\">at a glance.</a></p> \n<p><em>There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice</a>.</em></p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Criminal drinkers tracked and traced \u2013 </strong>Offenders who commit \u201calcohol-fuelled\u201d crimes can be required to wear \u201csobriety tags\u201d and banned from drinking under legislation that comes into force in England and Wales today. The ankle monitors <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/19/alcohol-fuelled-offenders-may-have-to-wear-sobriety-tags\">pick up whether there is any alcohol in the wearer\u2019s sweat</a>. The first tags are expected to be fitted this year once probation staff have been trained and the monitoring contract agreed. When up and running as many as 2,300 are likely to be fitted on offenders every year. People found to be breaching an alcohol abstinence order can be brought back before the courts to face further punishment including jail.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>12 die \u2018with Malta and Europe watching\u2019 \u2013 </strong>Further evidence of Malta\u2019s strategy to push people back to the conflict zone of Libya has been revealed by a woman who survived a Mediterranean crossing in which 12 people died. Voice messages obtained by the Guardian confirm the Maltese government\u2019s strategy to use private vessels, directed by its armed forces, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/19/exclusive-12-die-as-malta-uses-private-ships-to-push-migrants-back-to-libya\">return refugees to Libyan detention centres</a>. The woman said her boat was intercepted and those on board taken back to Tripoli where they have been imprisoned. Two migrants died during the interception, three en route to Libya, and seven while they were all adrift in a dinghy. Lawyers and the Alarm Phone hotline for migrants in distress at sea say Malta is breaching international law. A spokesperson for Alarm Phone said: \u201cTwelve people have died while Malta and Europe were watching.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Bill seen as slap in face \u2013 </strong>The government\u2019s controversial immigration legislation was voted through the Commons last night amid claims from Labour and some Tories that it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/18/points-based-uk-immigration-bill-passed-by-parliament\">alienates the very workers risking their lives during the pandemic</a>. Labour\u2019s shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said the bill\u2019s salary threshold of \u00a325,600 tells people that anyone earning less is unwelcome. \u201cThose who clapped [for carers] on Thursday are only too happy to vote through a bill today that will send a powerful message to those same people \u2013 that they are not considered by this government to be skilled workers.\u201d If it comes into force the bill would repeal EU freedom of movement and introduce a new framework setting out who can come to Britain. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has highlighted the promise of a fast-track NHS visa.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Buffett ripped off \u2013 </strong>A German manufacturing company allegedly conned the US investor and world\u2019s fourth-wealthiest person Warren Buffett into overpaying for its business by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/19/german-company-allegedly-cons-warren-buffett-out-of-643m\">Photoshopping company orders and invoices</a>. A Buffett company paid \u20ac800m (\u00a3715m) to buy Wilhelm Schulz, a family-run manufacturer of stainless steel. But it turned out that rather than booming, the company was struggling and at risk of bankruptcy. A New York arbitration court ruled the business was worth no more than \u20ac157m and ordered Schulz to make up the difference of \u20ac643m. \u201cThe evidence strongly points to fraud, and there is little in the record to suggest otherwise,\u201d the panel said. A state prosecutor in D\u00fcsseldorf is also investigating the pipe maker for fraud and forgery.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018We had to start from scratch\u2019 \u2013 </strong>Makers of The Archers have binned 12 scripts and five weeks of storylines to bring back the show. Fans have been making do with repeats but next week the Radio 4 soap returns with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/19/the-archers-episodes-lockdown-ambridge-radio-4-rural-soap-coronavirus\">life in Ambridge under lockdown</a>. Writing in the Radio Times, the show\u2019s editor, Jeremy Howe, says: \u201cWe had to start from scratch, and we had to figure out a new way to make The Archers so that everything \u2013 absolutely everything \u2013 could be done remotely.\u201d Actors have contributed their lines from home via microphone and computer. The show returns properly on 25 May with stories featuring David and Josh Archer, Tracy Horrobin and police officer Harrison Burns.</p> \n<h2>Coronavirus Extra</h2> \n<p>China has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/china-puts-city-of-shulan-under-wuhan-style-lockdown-after-fresh-covid-19-cases\">put the north-eastern city of Shulan into lockdown</a> after an outbreak of coronavirus, imposing measures similar to those used in Wuhan at the end of January. Shulan, with a population of around 700,000, was classified as high risk after a cluster of cases emerged connected to a woman with no known history of travel or exposure to the virus.</p> \n<p>The first results from human trials of a vaccine, by Moderna in the US, have shown that each of eight participants produced an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/18/first-human-trial-results-raise-hopes-for-coronavirus-vaccine\">antibody response similar to people who have had the disease.</a></p> \n<p>For our science podcast, Ian Sample talks to Prof Kate Jones about whether the coronavirus pandemic is part of a wider picture of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2020/may/19/covid-19-are-pandemics-becoming-more-common-podcast\">increasing animal-to-human virus transmission</a>.

The UK climbed one rung in the rankings, to just below Germany, Australia, France, China \u2013 and the US, which leads the index despite Trump administration support for fossil fuels, in large part due to plans to invest $57bn (\u00a347bn) to install up to 30GW of offshore wind by 2030.</p> \n<p>Asian shares jumped on Tuesday and oil extended gains on optimism the global economy would recover quickly following a successful early-stage trial of a coronavirus vaccine.

      "bodyText": "Top story: US president says he is taking hydroxychloroquine Good morning, Warren Murray giving you a push start along the hard shoulder. Donald Trump has written an incendiary letter to the WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, saying that unless the organisation made \u201cmajor substantive improvements\u201d, which he did not specify, the US would cut funding permanently and reconsider its membership. The letter alleged the WHO had shown an \u201calarming lack of independence\u201d from China and accused Tedros of presiding over \u201crepeated missteps \u2026 that have been extremely costly for the world\u201d, including Trump said, consistently ignoring \u201ccredible reports\u201d of the virus spreading in Wuhan in December. Trump\u2019s threat came on the day the WHO member states held a virtual assembly and were poised to agree an independent investigation into how the coronavirus was handled. The letter also coincided with Trump announcing that he had been taking hydroxychloroquine for a couple of weeks, despite warnings from his administration that it is dangerous. \u201cI think it\u2019s good, I heard a lot of good stories \u2026 I take a pill every day,\u201d Trump said. At home in the UK, evidence is mounting that the under-25s have been hit hardest by the Covid-19 economic fallout. In a report published today ahead of unemployment figures expected to highlight the pandemic\u2019s impact on the labour market, the Resolution Foundation says ministers should be considering job guarantees to prevent young people being permanently scarred by the crisis. \u201cOne in three young people have been furloughed or lost their jobs completely, and over one in three have had their pay reduced since the crisis started,\u201d said Maja Gustafsson from the Resolution Foundation. Large numbers of young people are employed in severely affected sectors such as leisure, retail and hospitality. Wage subsidies for disabled and vulnerable workers could fall away from August along with the furlough scheme, employers\u2019 groups have warned. Charities and social enterprise employers have been told by the government that its plan to close the scheme this autumn does not exempt vulnerable workers. Temporary care workers transmitted Covid-19 between care homes as cases surged, according to an unpublished study by Public Health England. Agency workers \u2013 often employed on zero-hours contracts \u2013 unwittingly spread the infection after being drafted in to replace existing staff who were self-isolating to protect care home residents. At least 22,000 people are estimated to have died in care homes in England and Wales directly or indirectly from Covid-19. Stay tuned in to our global live blog for updates and catch up with overnight news at a glance. There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * Criminal drinkers tracked and traced \u2013 Offenders who commit \u201calcohol-fuelled\u201d crimes can be required to wear \u201csobriety tags\u201d and banned from drinking under legislation that comes into force in England and Wales today. The ankle monitors pick up whether there is any alcohol in the wearer\u2019s sweat. The first tags are expected to be fitted this year once probation staff have been trained and the monitoring contract agreed. When up and running as many as 2,300 are likely to be fitted on offenders every year. People found to be breaching an alcohol abstinence order can be brought back before the courts to face further punishment including jail. * * * 12 die \u2018with Malta and Europe watching\u2019 \u2013 Further evidence of Malta\u2019s strategy to push people back to the conflict zone of Libya has been revealed by a woman who survived a Mediterranean crossing in which 12 people died. Voice messages obtained by the Guardian confirm the Maltese government\u2019s strategy to use private vessels, directed by its armed forces, to return refugees to Libyan detention centres. The woman said her boat was intercepted and those on board taken back to Tripoli where they have been imprisoned. Two migrants died during the interception, three en route to Libya, and seven while they were all adrift in a dinghy. Lawyers and the Alarm Phone hotline for migrants in distress at sea say Malta is breaching international law. A spokesperson for Alarm Phone said: \u201cTwelve people have died while Malta and Europe were watching.\u201d * * * Bill seen as slap in face \u2013 The government\u2019s controversial immigration legislation was voted through the Commons last night amid claims from Labour and some Tories that it alienates the very workers risking their lives during the pandemic. Labour\u2019s shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said the bill\u2019s salary threshold of \u00a325,600 tells people that anyone earning less is unwelcome. \u201cThose who clapped [for carers] on Thursday are only too happy to vote through a bill today that will send a powerful message to those same people \u2013 that they are not considered by this government to be skilled workers.\u201d If it comes into force the bill would repeal EU freedom of movement and introduce a new framework setting out who can come to Britain. The home secretary, Priti Patel, has highlighted the promise of a fast-track NHS visa. * * * Buffett ripped off \u2013 A German manufacturing company allegedly conned the US investor and world\u2019s fourth-wealthiest person Warren Buffett into overpaying for its business by Photoshopping company orders and invoices. A Buffett company paid \u20ac800m (\u00a3715m) to buy Wilhelm Schulz, a family-run manufacturer of stainless steel. But it turned out that rather than booming, the company was struggling and at risk of bankruptcy. A New York arbitration court ruled the business was worth no more than \u20ac157m and ordered Schulz to make up the difference of \u20ac643m. \u201cThe evidence strongly points to fraud, and there is little in the record to suggest otherwise,\u201d the panel said. A state prosecutor in D\u00fcsseldorf is also investigating the pipe maker for fraud and forgery. * * * \u2018We had to start from scratch\u2019 \u2013 Makers of The Archers have binned 12 scripts and five weeks of storylines to bring back the show. Fans have been making do with repeats but next week the Radio 4 soap returns with life in Ambridge under lockdown. Writing in the Radio Times, the show\u2019s editor, Jeremy Howe, says: \u201cWe had to start from scratch, and we had to figure out a new way to make The Archers so that everything \u2013 absolutely everything \u2013 could be done remotely.\u201d Actors have contributed their lines from home via microphone and computer. The show returns properly on 25 May with stories featuring David and Josh Archer, Tracy Horrobin and police officer Harrison Burns. Coronavirus Extra China has put the north-eastern city of Shulan into lockdown after an outbreak of coronavirus, imposing measures similar to those used in Wuhan at the end of January. Shulan, with a population of around 700,000, was classified as high risk after a cluster of cases emerged connected to a woman with no known history of travel or exposure to the virus. The first results from human trials of a vaccine, by Moderna in the US, have shown that each of eight participants produced an antibody response similar to people who have had the disease. For our science podcast, Ian Sample talks to Prof Kate Jones about whether the coronavirus pandemic is part of a wider picture of increasing animal-to-human virus transmission. As the TV and film industry struggles to safely restart shooting mothballed shows and films in the UK, from Line of Duty to The Batman, the animation and special effects industry \u2013 where many creators already work alone \u2013 has remained at full capacity with surging demand. Today in Focus podcast: From sleeping rough to a hotel bed Amelia Gentleman reports on life inside the hotels that are now housing some of the more than 5,400 homeless people across England and Wales. It is part of an unprecedented emergency operation to get all rough sleepers off the streets. Lunchtime read: Ikea and the true cost of fast furniture A Billy bookcase is made every three seconds. But with a third of people admitting to throwing away furniture that they could have sold or donated, does the cheap furniture boom have a heavy environmental price? Sport Preparations are under way for England\u2019s behind-closed-doors Test matches, with Ashley Giles seemingly covering all contingencies. Meanwhile, the ICC has handed down a message that sweat is fine but saliva is not when it comes to polishing a cricket ball. Fernando Alonso is ready to return to Formula One, with the former double world champion understood to have had talks with Renault about taking a seat in 2021. Neil Lennon has vowed to shrug off any attempts to discredit a ninth league title in a row for Celtic, after the Scottish Premiership season was abandoned. One hundred and ninety-seven people will attend each match when Spanish football returns, according to a protocol prepared by La Liga and seen by the Guardian. Dries Martens has agreed a new three-year extension with Napoli, ending Chelsea and Internazionale\u2019s hopes of signing the 33-year-old on a free transfer this summer. And Olympic swimming champion Michael Phelps has admitted that the Covid-19 pandemic is taking a toll on his mental health. Business The UK has become more attractive to renewable energy investors following the government\u2019s decision to lift its block on financial support for onshore wind and solar projects. Britain has taken sixth spot in EY\u2019s \u201cattractiveness index\u201d for renewable energy ahead of a major clean energy auction in 2021. The UK climbed one rung in the rankings, to just below Germany, Australia, France, China \u2013 and the US, which leads the index despite Trump administration support for fossil fuels, in large part due to plans to invest $57bn (\u00a347bn) to install up to 30GW of offshore wind by 2030. Asian shares jumped on Tuesday and oil extended gains on optimism the global economy would recover quickly following a successful early-stage trial of a coronavirus vaccine. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia Pacific shares outside of Japan rose 1.5% to two-week highs. Australia\u2019s benchmark and the Hang Seng led the way with a 2% gain in earlier trading, South Korea added 1.8% while China\u2019s blue-chip index climbed 0.8%. Japan\u2019s Nikkei added 2% to the highest since early March. The pound is on $1.219 and \u20ac1.117 at time of writing. The papers The Times and the Metro have the same front-page picture: two women having outdoor breakfast in a Milan piazza as Italian bars and eateries reopen. They wear latex gloves and have eyes closed \u2013 unclear whether savouring the food or squinting at the daylight. The Times splashes with \u201cAir bridges plan revives hope of summer flights\u201d (the Telegraph also likes that story, which we\u2019ve covered here), while the freesheet reports on \u201cThe hidden Covid cases\u201d, saying 200,000 may not know they\u2019ve had it.

      "bodyText": "Nancy Pelosi has led a chorus of surprise and alarm after Donald Trump said he was taking the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to ward off coronavirus. Trump\u2019s own government has warned that the drug should only be administered for Covid-19 in a hospital or research setting due to potentially fatal side effects. The US House Speaker did not mince her words when she was asked on CNN about the president\u2019s decision. \u201cHe\u2019s our president, and I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group and his, shall we say, weight group ... morbidly obese, they say,\u201d she said. Trump is 73. At his last full checkup in February 2019 he passed the official threshold for being considered obese, with a Body Mass Index of 30.4. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a BMI of 40 or above is considered \u201csevere\u201d obesity, which some also call \u201cmorbid\u201d obesity. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called Trump\u2019s remarks about hydroxychloroquine \u201cdangerous.\u201d \u201cMaybe he\u2019s really not taking it because the president lies about things characteristically,\u201d Schumer said on MSNBC. He added: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether he is taking it or not. I know him saying he is taking it, whether he is or not, is reckless, reckless, reckless.\u201d The revelation was also noted in China. Hu Xijin, editor of Communist Party mouthpiece the Global Times, said Trump was leading the US response to the pandemic with \u201cwitchcraft\u201d. Trump has spent weeks pushing hydroxychloroquine as a potential cure or prophylaxis for Covid-19 against the cautionary advice of many of his administration\u2019s top medical professionals. The drug has the potential to cause significant side effects in some patients and has not been shown to combat the new coronavirus. Several prominent doctors said they worried that people would infer from Trump\u2019s example that the drug works or is safe. \u201cThere is no evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective for the treatment or the prevention of Covid-19,\u201d said Dr. Patrice Harris, president of the American Medical Association. \u201cThe results to date are not promising.\u201d People should not infer from Trump\u2019s example \u201cthat it\u2019s an approved approach or proven,\u201d because it\u2019s not, said Dr David Aronoff, infectious diseases chief at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.",

It follows <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/06/spending-time-garden-has-similar-health-benefits-living-wealthy/\">analysis</a> of data from nearly 8,000 people published earlier in May, which found that those who spent time in their garden were significantly more likely to report higher psychological wellbeing than those who did not.</p> <p>Nowhere has this been more apparent than in a hospital setting during the coronavirus pandemic.

All states and territories except New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT have put some border restrictions in place to limit coronavirus transmission, although the commonwealth insists it has never recommended closing state borders. With mass international travel to Australia all but closed off for the foreseeable future, domestic travel is seen as a vital reignition for a battered tourism sector. But on Monday the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, suggested its borders were unlikely to open before September, and other states have shown no urgency to open up. On Tuesday South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory all reiterated that they would not be changing their position anytime soon. The Tasmanian premier, Peter Gutwein, said it was far too early to consider opening the island state\u2019s borders and that he would not set a date for reopening until at least July. The federal tourism minister, Simon Birmingham, has urged state and territory governments to admit domestic holidaymakers as soon as possible. \u201cThose states who\u2019ve got border controls in place, assuming we\u2019ve continued to see very low rates of transmission of Covid-19, ought to be looking at opening up their borders,\u201d Birmingham said. \u201cWe need people moving across this country again when it\u2019s safe to do so.\u201d Tourism employs one million Australians \u2013 one in 13 workers \u2013 but the sector has been devastated by the travel bans and lockdown measures imposed to contain the spread of Covid-19.

I think knowing that someone was there inspired hope.\u201d</p> <p>The number Fogg had called was Nightline, the student-run listening service, which celebrates its 50th birthday this month.

      "bodyText": "As a first-year maths student at the University of Manchester in 2014, Josh Fogg went through a mental health crisis. \u201cI was having a really bad case of depression and anxiety,\u201d Fogg says. One night, when things came to a head, Fogg remembered a card from a friend with a phone number on it. \u201cI\u2019d not really thought much about it, but the number was on the back of our student cards and I gave them a ring.\u201d That call made a huge difference. \u201cI didn\u2019t say much but the volunteer on the other end just sat there with me while I was really struggling. I think knowing that someone was there inspired hope.\u201d The number Fogg had called was Nightline, the student-run listening service, which celebrates its 50th birthday this month. The helpline, inspired by the non-judgmental ethos of the Samaritans, is provided by trained student volunteers who stay up overnight to take calls, messages and visits from students who want to talk about their problems. For Fogg, who identifies as non-binary, the first call turned into several, over the course of which they became more comfortable opening up and eventually gained the confidence to seek professional help. \u201cA big part of me wonders whether I would still be here if there hadn\u2019t been someone there that first night.

Hunger, thirst, and the scorching heat of the Indian summer are slowing them down. Some have died of exhaustion and sunstroke.

He was still waiting for the police to help when a group of well-wishers, having seen Yadav\u2019s tweet about Pandit, arrived in the area and managed to find him at the station. By now, he was full of grief. His wife, Bimal Devi, had just called to say their son had died. One of the well-wishers, a woman, paid for and arranged for his train ticket home. \u201cHe wept with gratitude at strangers helping him,\u201d said Yadav. Yadav\u2019s photograph illustrates the anguish of millions of migrant labourers in India who are desperate to get home to their families. After waiting in vain for the government to provide them with transport (belatedly some trains are now being laid on for them) they have embarked on astonishing odysseys, from cities all over the country, journeys that have left Indians transfixed and distressed. Whether by truck, bicycle, auto-rickshaw or on foot, they have been heading out under their own steam, some making journeys of nearly 1,000 km to reach home. Hunger, thirst, and the scorching heat of the Indian summer are slowing them down. Some have died of exhaustion and sunstroke. Last week a group of 16 who fell asleep on a railway line they had believed was not being used were killed by a goods train. \u201cIf I am to die, I want to die with my parents,\u201d said one young daily wage labourer leaving Indore, a city in Madhya Pradesh. An auto-rickshaw driver fleeing Mumbai said: \u201cEven if I starve in the village, I will never come back. My children needed medicines and food and I wasn\u2019t able to do anything.\u201d Every day the exodus continues. The residents of Dharavi slum in Mumbai are fleeing in their thousands every day. With living conditions that make it almost impossible to escape the contagion and more than 1,100 confirmed cases of C0vid-19, many people feel they are sitting ducks. Yadav, 44, has been documenting their plight for the past few weeks, ever since India\u2019s lockdown began on 25 March. He has been taken aback at the response to his image of Pandit. It has been splashed all over Indian news outlets and social media. He is getting calls from California and New York, both about his photograph and from people who want to help Pandit. \u201cIn my career so far, this is the photograph that has best shown one person\u2019s pain,\u201d he said. Pandit reached Bihar last Wednesday and was put into a quarantine centre. There, he developed a temperature and headaches and was sent to hospital, where he has tested negative for Covid-19. On the government\u2019s inaction towards workers separated from their families, Pandit said he was not surprised. \u201cI am a nobody, I\u2019m like an ant, my life doesn\u2019t matter. The government is only concerned with filling the stomachs of the rich,\u201d he said. Pandit cannot wait to reach his home and family. Once there, he plans never to return to Delhi or go to any other city for work, even though he has no land or any other means of support. \u201cHowever I manage, I will manage. My family and my parents will be with me. That\u2019s enough for me,\u201d he said. If he does ever return to Delhi, though, it will be to meet the woman who paid for his ticket and booked it for him. Before leaving, she gave him her address lest he needed further help to get home. \u201cI would like to meet her again. She was my angel,\u201d he said.",

In nearly a month since it launched, more than 5.87 million Australians have downloaded and registered to use the Covidsafe contact-tracing app, which is designed to make it easier for state health officials to find close contacts in the event a user tests positive for coronavirus. Last week, state health department contact tracers received training in how to access the data, but no states have yet reported using the data for contact tracing. Guardian Australia understands NSW Health has tested the data but has had issues integrating it into the existing contact-tracing methods, and the Digital Transformation Agency was contacted by the department to fix technical problems. The Digital Transformation Agency referred questions on the matter to the federal health department. The federal health department initially declined to answer specific questions on the issue, instead providing a general statement that states now have access to the app data. In a statement provided after publication, the department said it \u201cwasn\u2019t aware\u201d of any technical issues NSW had been facing, but the department welcomed feedback on the app. \u201cWe welcome and expect ongoing feedback and evaluation of the operation of the app as more restrictions are eased and there are potential outbreaks, enabling contacts to be more quickly notified, such as with the opening of pubs and increased use of public transport and travel.\u201d In a press conference on Tuesday morning, NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant told reporters that the state was still \u201cevaluating\u201d the app, and pointed out the low case numbers meant it was less likely that the data would be used. \u201cWe\u2019ve actually had quite low case numbers over the recent week which I\u2019m very pleased [about].

It\u2019s now obvious that the UK government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/furlough-qa-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme\">coronavirus </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/furlough-qa-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme\">job </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/furlough-qa-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme\">retention </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/furlough-qa-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-coronavirus-job-retention-scheme\">scheme</a> (CJRS), which subsidises 80% of people\u2019s wages but did not put the necessary duties on employers to prevent them from firing employees, is failing in the one thing it\u2019s meant to do: retain jobs.</p> <p>Job numbers haven\u2019t collapsed in other countries such as Denmark or Germany because they have security and democracy at work, not just wage subsidies. Unemployment in Denmark has <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20180116-focus-denmark-low-unemployment-rate-strict-controls-job-seekers-benefits\">risen to just 4.2%</a>. Unemployment in Germany has risen to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3b6ba29e-c90a-4b68-a149-4847415d75ac\">5.8%</a>. It might get worse, but it\u2019s a fraction of the UK\u2019s problem.</p> <p>Unemployment isn\u2019t natural. It\u2019s a legal and social choice. In Germany, workers in companies with more than 20 staff can elect a work council that may veto or delay dismissals and get compensation to internalise the social costs. In companies with more than 2,000 workers, staff can elect half of the supervisory board of directors. The system was restored post-second world war, after Hitler abolished all labour rights. It restarted with a law that the <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Control_Council_Law_No_22_(10_April_1946)_Works_Councils#Articles_IV\">UK and US helped to draft</a>, but we\u2019ve failed to follow it ourselves. In Denmark, workers in companies with more than 35 staff have the right to organise <a href=\"http://www.worker-participation.eu/www.worker-participation.eu/index.php/National-Industrial-Relations/Countries/Denmark/Workplace-Representation\">cooperation committees</a> and workers elect up to one third of the board of directors.</p> <p>Democracy and security at work make enterprise more rational. Directors elected by staff ensure managers think in the long term. In this crisis, short-term thinking isn\u2019t even creating so-called shareholder value, just a sinking spiral of dole queues and shuttered shops.</p> <p>The unemployment pandemic is by far the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/global-report-coronavirus-us-unemployment-could-hit-25-warns-fed-chairman-as-japan-enters-recession\">worst in the US</a>, because it has the worst labour rights in the free world. Despite a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/washington-coronavirus-stimulus-bill-vote\">$2.2</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/washington-coronavirus-stimulus-bill-vote\">tn bailout</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/14/unemployment-us-data-coronavirus\">36 million people</a> have been fired. This probably means more than 25% unemployment, a crisis worse than the Great Depression. Americans have no self-standing job security rights, except to get 60 days\u2019 warning before mass layoffs. An arbitrary, incompetent or venal boss can say \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d for a good reason, a bad reason, or no reason at all. This is the Donald Trump system of job security. It\u2019s creating a \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d depression.</p> <p>But the UK can\u2019t be content with its laws. Yes, employers must give reasonable notice before dismissal. At no time can an employer dismiss an employee in a way that breaches the \u201c<a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wnx7DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA211&amp;lpg=PA211&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=\">duty of mutual respect</a>\u201d, or the contract. After two years of work, employees can only be dismissed for a fair reason, as assessed by an employment tribunal, and have a right to a redundancy payment if the dismissal is for economic reasons.</p> <p>That\u2019s fine, but British workers have no votes at work (outside universities such as Cambridge or Edinburgh), and no voice or veto over dismissals. Many employers evade employment rights by drafting sham contracts, pretending their staff are self-employed. The CJRS, with a <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/launching-an-economic-lifeboat/\">\u00a330-40</a><a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/launching-an-economic-lifeboat/\">bn expected cost</a>, pays 80% of wages to any employee who is furloughed, and it also covers the self-employed. But the scheme came without job security and workplace democracy conditions, <a href=\"https://www.ier.org.uk/comments/ten-things-the-government-can-do-right-now-to-prevent-a-corona-depression/\">as labour law experts called for</a>. So, employers fire staff despite subsidies.</p> <p>A dwindling minority of economic theorists argue we need \u201clabour market flexibility\u201d, saying that rights kill jobs. But there\u2019s no credible evidence for this claim. For instance, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) \u2013 whose research has influenced the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund \u2013 thinks employment protection legislation hampers job creation, productivity and investment. But the <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/lawarxiv/fmdu9/\">OECD\u2019s analysis</a> is based on breathtaking misunderstandings of employment law. By contrast, the latest credible research shows that job security and workplace democracy decrease unemployment, while <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ilr.12128\">improving productivity</a> and innovation.</p> <p>How can we stop the unemployment pandemic? First, we must change what got us here, and boost workplace security and democracy. In the UK, the secretary of state could amend the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) code that employers must follow before making dismissals. Such amendments could give all staff a voice on dismissals through elected work councils, if unions collectively bargain for them, or if five or more staff request it.</p> <p>We must strengthen our pension laws so that staff representatives, not short-term asset managers, control shareholder votes in companies. Then, to stop irrational layoff decisions being made to begin with, workers need the right to vote for representatives on their board of directors, like they do at Oxford University, BMW or H&amp;M. We already have a <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/lawarxiv/yxrfa\">democratic </a><a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/lawarxiv/yxrfa\">society </a><a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/lawarxiv/yxrfa\">act</a> drafted for the UK, and any US state can pass the workplace democracy and security laws they need without the federal government. States can adapt models such as those that have been proposed by senators Elizabeth Warren, <a href=\"https://berniesanders.com/issues/corporate-accountability-and-democracy/\">Bernie Sanders</a> or Tammy Baldwin.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/17/normal-life-failed-coronavirus-rethink-economy-labour-party\">'Normal' life failed us.

She likened the work of surgeons and nurses to sculpture: \"a special grace of mind and body induced a spontaneous space composition, an articulated and animated kind of abstract sculpture very close to what I have been seeking in my own work\". Image: The Hands, 1948, Barbara Hepworth (1903-1975), \u00a9 Bowness. Bristol Museums, Galleries &amp; Archives, 2:B - Vuillard became close to Lucie and Jos Hessel in 1900 when Jos\u2019s company Bernheim Jeune began to sell his work in their gallery. The three dined and holidayed together. It looks like Vuillard has included some of his own paintings on the wall behind Lucie.

This is the only painting by Gonzal\u00e9s in a public collection in Britain. Although it has a radical impressionist appearance, it was discovered in her studio, unfinished, after her death. Image: The Donkey Ride, c.1880, Eva Gonzal\u00e9s (1849-1883), Bristol Museums, Galleries &amp; Archives, 4:A - Children kept birds as pets but the goldfinch, with its distinctive crimson marking, is also symbolic of Christ\u2019s crucifixion.

His claim in Parliament that the people of Bristol weren\u2019t interested in Reform meant that his visit to the city for the autumn assizes was met with protest. Wetherell\u2019s parliamentary borough was abolished after the Great Reform Act of 1832. Image: Bristol Riots: The Burning of the Toll Houses on Prince Street Bridge with St Mary Redcliffe, 1831, William James M\u00fcller (1812-1845), Bristol Museums, Galleries &amp; Archives, 6:A - The sculpture depicts the moment in Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost when Eve first sees her reflection in a pool: \"as I bent down to look, just opposite, a shape within the watery gleam appeared, bending to look on me. I started back, it started back; but pleased I soon returned\". The V&amp;A has a companion piece illustrating the lines that follow, \"Eve listening to the voice\", the speaker being Satan who will use Eve\u2019s pleasure to tempt her. Image: Eve at the Fountain, 1822, Edward Hodges Baily (1788-1867), Bristol Museums, Galleries &amp; Archives, 7:D - From the series, Modern Flower Notes, this print is probably part of a triptych. The scene might be set on Mukojima, an area on the banks of the Sumida river in Edo (Tokyo) famous for its brightly coloured cherry trees with double blossoms. Visitors to Mukojima would picnic beneath the cherry blossom. Image: Utagawa Yoshitora (active 1836-1887), Cherry Blossom, 1843-45, courtesy of Bristol Museums, Galleries &amp; Archives, 8:C - Bristol has one of the largest collections of English delftware, representing a major industry in and around the city from the 1640s until 1785. Delftware gave way to ordinary earthenwares, in particular those made by the firm of Pountney, which survived in the city until 1969. There were two porcelain factories. The factory owned by Benjamin Lund made imitation or \"soft-paste\" porcelains around 1750; the other, operating in the 1770s on Castle Green, made true \"hard-paste\" porcelain as produced in China.

The streets will be beautiful.\u201d</p> <p>But are they really going to mount 1,000 murals across America? That seems like an astronomical task, especially in a time when spray paint and artist materials are not necessarily easy to obtain for everyone.</p> <p>\u201cWe have sponsors willing to do murals by the dozens,\u201d says Meyer. The Beautify website is a marketplace where business owners can upload photos of their empty walls for artists to see, create their proposals, contact the business owners and complete their collaborative contract, and payment, online.</p> <p>They have mounted murals already in Pasadena, West Hollywood, Seattle and Oakland, with artworks by artists such as Guerin Swing, Gino Loffredo, Sel Dog, and Corie Mattie, who is so far one of the few female artists of the group.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14b82aea68d80882d1c4b696d94b290c65373bb9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14b82aea68d80882d1c4b696d94b290c65373bb9/0_0_5168_3448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Corie Mattie with one of her projects for Beautify\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Corie Mattie with one of her projects for Beautify.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mattie has created a series of coronavirus-themed murals in yellow, black and white, as a way to uplift passersby, using a cartoon of a person wearing a face mask opening a long coat to reveal hope and prayers. Among the encouraging slogans for her murals, she has written: \u201cCancel plans, not humanity,\u201d \u201cClose your doors, open your mind,\u201d and \u201cHope is free, give it away\u201d. One she created in Santa Monica reads: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_fsXb0DPoW/\">After the plague, came the renaissance</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMy brother is a doctor in Los Angeles and my mother is a cancer survivor who is an at-risk person and I wanted to find some way to help raise awareness and also give hope,\u201d says Mattie. \u201cA unique opportunity has arisen for artists during Covid-19, a period of strong artistic expression. Sometimes, you can\u2019t describe a situation with words, so that\u2019s where art becomes more relatable and valuable.\u201d</p> <p>Each paid project for artists comes with a hefty fee, like one mural willing to pay an artist <a href=\"https://www.beautifyearth.com/post/toy-district-la-mural-artist-opportunity\">$5,000 in LA</a> to a project in Iowa willing to pay <a href=\"https://www.beautifyearth.com/post/artist-opportunity-mural-council-bluffs-iowa\">$18,000 to paint a building</a>. Artists are slated to get 78% of the profits through Beautify.

Once we get through this, the world is going to be the best it\u2019s ever been. Stay positive, we\u2019re going to get there. The streets will be beautiful.\u201d But are they really going to mount 1,000 murals across America? That seems like an astronomical task, especially in a time when spray paint and artist materials are not necessarily easy to obtain for everyone. \u201cWe have sponsors willing to do murals by the dozens,\u201d says Meyer. The Beautify website is a marketplace where business owners can upload photos of their empty walls for artists to see, create their proposals, contact the business owners and complete their collaborative contract, and payment, online. They have mounted murals already in Pasadena, West Hollywood, Seattle and Oakland, with artworks by artists such as Guerin Swing, Gino Loffredo, Sel Dog, and Corie Mattie, who is so far one of the few female artists of the group. Mattie has created a series of coronavirus-themed murals in yellow, black and white, as a way to uplift passersby, using a cartoon of a person wearing a face mask opening a long coat to reveal hope and prayers. Among the encouraging slogans for her murals, she has written: \u201cCancel plans, not humanity,\u201d \u201cClose your doors, open your mind,\u201d and \u201cHope is free, give it away\u201d. One she created in Santa Monica reads: \u201cAfter the plague, came the renaissance\u201d. \u201cMy brother is a doctor in Los Angeles and my mother is a cancer survivor who is an at-risk person and I wanted to find some way to help raise awareness and also give hope,\u201d says Mattie. \u201cA unique opportunity has arisen for artists during Covid-19, a period of strong artistic expression. Sometimes, you can\u2019t describe a situation with words, so that\u2019s where art becomes more relatable and valuable.\u201d Each paid project for artists comes with a hefty fee, like one mural willing to pay an artist $5,000 in LA to a project in Iowa willing to pay $18,000 to paint a building. Artists are slated to get 78% of the profits through Beautify. According to Meyer, \u201cOur goal is to get them work and get their work out there and to get artists paid.\u201d Ruben Rojas is another muralist working with Beautify, who has created the \u201cYou Can\u2019t Quarantine Love\u201d mural on a boarded-up cocktail bar in the artist\u2019s neighborhood in Santa Monica. The goal is to get people thinking about our new world, going forward, he says. \u201cWe know \u2018quarantine\u2019 as a negative buzz word and this was an opportunity to repurpose it for good Rojas. My motivation stems from action and responsibility to inspire positivity and change.\u201d With an overwhelming response through social media, he has learned the power of public art through the pandemic. \u201cEvery time we paint a mural, we are creating culture and history,\u201d says Rojas. \u201cHumans have been painting on walls since the dawn of time, and I don\u2019t see it stopping any time soon. If anything, I see us painting the entire world in color.\u201d",

In the past month, the company had a 225% increase in commuter bike sales and a 310% increase for e-bikes.</p> \n<p>As a result, companies have also had to think about how to facilitate this shift towards active transport. The deputy chief executive of ANZ, Alexis George, said the company had to rethink original plans to close communal showers in its offices.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have a lot of people who want to run or bike to work if they are so inclined \u2026 so we\u2019ve had to think about whole new cleaning regimes around those bathrooms and how we can keep those open for those who cycle,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Staggering work hours has also been suggested as a means of mitigating the pressure on peak-hour services.</p> \n<p>George said a recent staff survey revealed the main concern of employees about returning to work was around catching public transport safely.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think they have faith that we will keep our office safe, but it\u2019s the public transport. So that\u2019s about being a bit creative around the start times \u2026 we can\u2019t all come in at 8.00am to 9.30am because those are the typical peak travel times,\u201d George said.</p> \n<p>Stevenson said governments should create policies that would help commuters combine active and public transport options. These include allowing riders to take their bikes on public transport, and staggering bus start-points so that workers can ride to a certain point along their commute to catch an empty bus.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"783d38d7-bf50-42bc-ae36-fc21decf46a2\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Email:</b>&nbsp;sign up for our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_atom\">daily coronavirus newsletter</a></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>App:&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_atom\">download it</a>&nbsp;and never miss the biggest stories</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Social:&nbsp;</b>follow us on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://facebook.com/theguardianaustralia\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardianaustralia/\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaus\">Twitter</a>&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Podcast:</b>&nbsp;listen to our daily episodes on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/full-story-coronavirus-updates/id1482061243\">Apple Podcasts</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7GJod4EyoLywB1AW6zrSHh?si=LD1i9SJwRqSAcT3i4ZCI-w\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;or search \"Full Story\" in your favourite app</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe have to think long-term because Covid-19 is here for a long time.

      "bodyText": "The union representing bus workers in Sydney has said it cannot rule out strike action if the increase in passenger numbers due to the easing of Covid-19 restrictions threatens drivers\u2019 safety. The secretary of the New South Wales Rail, Tram and Bus Union, David Babineau, criticised NSW government advice that drivers should not enforce new 12-person capacity limits on buses and instead accept all passengers who attempt to board as unclear and potentially hazardous to drivers. Asked whether the union would consider industrial action if physical distancing could not be maintained on buses, Babineau told the Guardian \u201cnothing is off the table when it comes to the safety\u201d of drivers. State governments, employers and transport experts are grappling with how to keep passengers safe on public transport as restrictions ease. The NSW transport minister, Andrew Constance, announced measures on Monday to ensure physical distancing, which include a reduction in the number of people allowed in a train carriage from 123 to 32, delegating where people can sit and stand, and securing more public parking to accommodate the anticipated increase in drivers avoiding public transport. On Tuesday morning the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said drivers \u201chave every opportunity to enforce safety and have access to anything which makes them be safer\u201d. But Babineau said the contradiction in messaging had led the union to consider implementing its own information campaign for drivers and public transport users to encourage safe social distancing. \u201cThere needs to be a huge public campaign about the new rules here. The union needs to bypass the government entirely and appeal to passengers directly.\u201d He also pleaded with the government to \u201cgive us bloody masks\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve been asking for it forever, masks, masks, masks.\u201d The NSW government advice about the limits states that \u201call drivers have ongoing access to hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes\u201d, but does not mention masks. Babineau also said he was frustrated the new limits were announced only days before the full return of schooling in the state. \u201cThere\u2019s a total lack of clarity on this. We\u2019re being told social distancing is vitally important,\u201d he said, pointing out the advice to drivers also states school children and vulnerable riders should never be left at a bus stop and urges drivers to avoid confrontation with passengers flouting distancing, regardless of whether the 12-passenger limit has been reached. \u201cThere\u2019s no mechanism to enforce this. Is it a rule, a guideline, or a suggestion? They\u2019re all very different things. Someone needs to do something concrete here.\u201d The Guardian contacted Berejiklian\u2019s office for clarification, and received a response from a Transport for NSW spokesman that said: \u201cOur frontline transport staff have been doing an amazing job during this unprecedented time and we urge customers to keep showing them their respect and understanding.\u201d Ensuring physical distancing on public transport is not as simple as just limiting the number of passengers. It requires coordination between a number of systems, said Prof Mark Stevenson, an epidemiologist and urban transport expert at the University of Melbourne. Stevenson said that creative thinking was needed to make up for the reduction in the number of seats on buses, trams and trains. \u201cPublic transport is a finite resource, you can\u2019t just increase the number of trains,\u201d he said. \u201cIf 20% of the train is filled up [towards the start of the journey], it\u2019s going to be a very difficult scenario for people at later stops to get access.\u201d Instead, cities should be looking to facilitate \u201cactive transport\u201d options: walking, running and biking to work, he said. \u201cIn Victoria, 14% of all car trips are under 5km in distance, and they could be made by either walking or cycling. But the reason people choose not to do that is often for safety,\u201d Stevenson said. \u201cI think there is potential for governments to think of this time as an experiment, and say \u2018OK, in the short term, we are going to provide at least one lane or half a lane on major roads to cyclists within a 10km radius of the city to allow them to ride on a roadway that is safe\u2019. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to spend an enormous amount of money on infrastructure.\u201d Australia has experienced a massive boom in bike sales since coronavirus lockdown measures came into place. James van Rooyen, the founder of Australia\u2019s largest online bike retailer, Bicycles Online, said it had seen a \u201csecond wave of people wanting [to buy bikes] for their daily commute\u201d. In the past month, the company had a 225% increase in commuter bike sales and a 310% increase for e-bikes. As a result, companies have also had to think about how to facilitate this shift towards active transport. The deputy chief executive of ANZ, Alexis George, said the company had to rethink original plans to close communal showers in its offices. \u201cWe have a lot of people who want to run or bike to work if they are so inclined \u2026 so we\u2019ve had to think about whole new cleaning regimes around those bathrooms and how we can keep those open for those who cycle,\u201d she said. Staggering work hours has also been suggested as a means of mitigating the pressure on peak-hour services. George said a recent staff survey revealed the main concern of employees about returning to work was around catching public transport safely. \u201cI think they have faith that we will keep our office safe, but it\u2019s the public transport. So that\u2019s about being a bit creative around the start times \u2026 we can\u2019t all come in at 8.00am to 9.30am because those are the typical peak travel times,\u201d George said. Stevenson said governments should create policies that would help commuters combine active and public transport options. These include allowing riders to take their bikes on public transport, and staggering bus start-points so that workers can ride to a certain point along their commute to catch an empty bus. \u201cWe have to think long-term because Covid-19 is here for a long time. We need to be thinking very seriously about these strategies as potential opportunities to change the way we operate, and not just what do we need to do to get us over this hurdle,\u201d Stevenson said. \u201cIt\u2019s needed not just for dealing with Covid-19, but the enormous challenges we face with climate change\u201d. A spokesman for the Public Transport Users Association, David Bowen, said \u201cit\u2019s a bit of an unknown as to precisely what is going to happen\u201d when offices reopen and public transport ridership increases. Bowen, whose group is based in Victoria, supported the staggering of work start times to stretch out morning and evening peak hours on trains and buses, but said governments needed to persuade businesses to do this, and that messaging to commuters alone was not enough.",

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus pandemic has plunged the already troubled private health insurance industry deeper into crisis, with funds losing money in the first three months of the year as financial markets crashed. Australians continued to turn away from private health insurance as investment income diminished, continuing a long-term trend that experts say has the industry locked in a \u201cdeath spiral\u201d. The tide of financial red ink washed away any benefits the industry might have enjoyed from a 2.4% fall in insurance claims due to the cancellation of elective surgery. Insurance companies usually invest in both company shares and debt instruments such as bonds, both of which have been smashed by the coronavirus crisis. Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (Apra) data released on Tuesday shows that, across the industry, investment income plunged 450% from a total of $82m in the December quarter to a loss of almost $290m. The industry\u2019s total profit tumbled 115%, from a profit of $370m in December to a loss of almost $54m. And the percentage of Australians with private health insurance continued to slide, falling from 44% to 43.8%. It was as high as 47.4% in 2015. Stephen Duckett, the head of the health program at thinktank the Grattan Institute, said the industry\u2019s long-term decline in membership would probably get worse as the economic shocks of the coronavirus lockdown continue after the restrictions themselves are eased. The dramatic fall in investment income \u201cwill bounce back eventually, presumably,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a Covid-19 impact, and then it\u2019s whatever your views on where the market\u2019s going over the next six months. \u201cThe big risk for insurance is the decline in numbers that\u2019s just going on. \u201cA hundred people a day dropping out over the last quarter, and young people more than old people. \u201cThat\u2019ll probably get worse with higher unemployment.\u201d In April, the Australia Institute estimated that the fall in elective surgery and other procedures due to coronavirus could save private health insurers more than $3.5bn. And Duckett said the cancellation of elective surgery in March and April left the funds \u201ccashed up\u201d. \u201cThe problem with their cashflow is that with hospital care, a significant proportion of those people are going to want to have their procedure in the second half of the year. \u201cAlthough they\u2019re cashed up now they\u2019re going to have to spend a significant amount of that in the second half of the year.\u201d Experts have been warning for more than six months that the private health insurance industry was in a death spiral due to soaring premiums that encourage healthy young people to stay out of the system. In February, before the coronavirus pandemic hit Australia, Apra member Geoff Summerhayes warned that if funds carried on with business as usual, hoping for a government hand-out, there would be just three left with a viable business model within two years. \u201cHe might be right, he might have been generous,\u201d Duckett said. \u201cSix funds are 80, 90% of the industry so he might be a bit ambitious, but it certainly won\u2019t be the 30-odd we see now. \u201cIf I were government you would want to be managing the whole economy, not worrying too much about the health insurance industry. \u201cIn the post-pandemic world I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a priority for government.\u201d",

Lee told Asia Times that the organisers would meet to discuss alternatives to the vigil, traditionally held in Victoria Park in the city\u2019s east. Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, earlier said there had been 23 straight days with no local infections before an outbreak was detected in a small family. \u201cWe need to remain vigilant but there is no need to panic,\u201d she said. She said Hong Kong had never imposed a full city lockdown, but instead prohibited group gatherings of a certain size \u201cbecause large crowds make it very easy to transmit infectious disease\u201d. Restaurants and bars have been allowed to reopen in recent weeks under strict conditions, but amid hot weather in the city, crowds have packed out some parts of the entertainment districts.",

      "bodyText": "Chinese authorities have sealed off the north-eastern city of Shulan, home to about 700,000 people, after an outbreak of coronavirus, imposing measures similar to those used in Wuhan. All villages and residential compounds in the city were closed off, and only one person from each household allowed out for two hours every second day for essentials. The development came as Beijing signalled it could ease some border restrictions as it prepares for the start on Thursday of its signature political event, the Communist party\u2019s delayed annual congress, also known as the \u201ctwo sessions\u201d. In Shulan, residential compounds were restricted to just one entry and exit for emergency vehicles, and banned non-residents and vehicles from entering. If there are confirmed cases in a community residence, no one can enter or leave. Last week, the city was reclassified as high risk after a cluster of cases emerged connected to a woman with no known history of travel or exposure to the virus. In response, authorities ordered the temporary closure of public places, schools and public transport. On Monday however these restrictions were increased further, with China Daily referring to the city as \u201cthe latest pandemic hotspot in the country\u201d. It said hundreds of people were under medical quarantine, and that life might not go back to normal for weeks. On Tuesday, another nearby city introduced protective measures. Jilin province authorities said that due to the \u201csevere circumstances\u201d of the epidemic in the areas surrounding the city of Jiaohe, public transport inside the city and between the city and neighbouring counties would be stopped until further notice. The north-east of the country, which borders Russia and North Korea, has emerged as an area of serious concern, as cases appear to have been brought in from across the border, and then begun to spread locally. At least 34 people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in Jilin province in the past fortnight. Despite the highest level of lockdowns prompted by just a few dozen cases, Chinese media have said the country can handle more imported cases and will likely begin opening up again. Chinese media has reported the country is likely to ease its border controls after the two sessions meeting, which begins Thursday. Relaxed entry rules could apply to Chinese students overseas who want to return home after graduating, and business travellers, but not large numbers of tourists yet, according to academics quoted by the Global Times. Zhou Zijun, a public health expert at Peking university, told the paper China \u201ccan now properly handle a small level of imported cases\u201d. Discussions were reportedly beginning between countries including China, Japan and South Korea, about opening channels for business travel, with strict testing requirements. On Monday China reported six new cases of Covid-19, of which three were local transmissions. Two were in Jilin province, and one in Hubei. The national health commission also reported 17 new asymptomatic coronavirus cases. Chinese authorities are particularly sensitive to the possibility of further outbreaks, just days out from its annual \u201ctwo sessions\u201d, which had been postponed from March because of the coronavirus. While there are extra measures in place to ensure the meeting of party delegates goes ahead safely, it is a sign that Beijing believes it is beginning to go back to normal. At the end of April tens of millions of people travelled for the first time in months over a five-day national holiday, and quarantine requirements on people arriving in Beijing were lifted. Housing officials in charge of residences have been warned they will be removed from their roles if there are new outbreaks, prompting speculation this could backfire and lead to local cover-ups. Some officials in Wuhan \u2013 where another small outbreak recently prompted an ambitious plan to test all 11 million residents \u2013 and Jilin province have already been removed from their posts, Chinese media has reported.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s where we will wrap up the Covid-19 live blog for the evening. This is what happened in Australia on Tuesday 19 May: The Australian death toll related to Covid-19 reached 100 with the 19th death of a Newmarch aged care centre resident. Victoria reports 5,600 fines issued for restrictions breached in the state worth $8m. Qantas is preparing to relaunch domestic flights in mid-June. Australia claims vindication for support for investigation into the origins of Covid-19, which China labelled \u201cnothing but a joke\u201d China puts an 80% tariff on Australian barley The federal government has indicated it could end the free childcare subsidy soon, and plans to keep a report on the success of its childcare industry subsidy under wraps For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic please see our global live blog. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow with all the Australian coronavirus news. Until then, please take care. 7NEWS is reporting that people will be allowed to travel to regional parts of NSW again from 1 June. A bit more on the 5,600 fines issued in Victoria for breaching the chief health officer\u2019s orders (I\u2019m watching the replay of this morning\u2019s hearing). The justice department wasn\u2019t aware of anyone challenging the fines in court yet, but the government is confident they would stand up because police were told to use discretion, and because the development of the health orders had a lot of legal advice. Victoria police is in the process of breaking down the fines to local government area-level, which means we will be able to match up the fines with the locations of the most coronavirus cases and see if it has been evenly distributed. Labor is calling on the government to explain why it now thinks the World Health Organisation is best placed to investigate the origins of the coronavirus. The call comes amid expectations a European Union-drafted motion, strongly backed by Australia, is set to be adopted at the World Health Assembly overnight tonight. Labor\u2019s Senate leader and foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong, is seeking to draw attention to the fact that the motion deals with the origin and handling of the coronavirus through potentially different processes. As has been widely reported already, the motion allows for the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, to initiate \u201ca stepwise process of impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation\u201d of lessons learned from the global health response to Covid-19. But the question of origins is not dealt with in that process. A separate clause in the motion urges Tedros to continue to work closely with the World Organisation for Animal Health, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations and countries \u201cto identify the zoonotic source of the virus and the route of introduction to the human population\u201d. In a statement issued tonight, Wong said the Labor party was pleased to see broad international support for the resolution, but the government should clarify \u201chow the two reviews will work and explain how they deliver on what Australia has called for\u201d. While the resolution calls for an independent review into the response to coronavirus, the review into the source will be carried out by the WHO. The government needs to explain why it changed its mind and now thinks the WHO is best placed to investigate the origins of the coronavirus. Good evening, everyone. Earlier this evening we published this story from me on how Australia\u2019s biggest state (population-wise) can\u2019t even use the Covidsafe app data yet, despite the heavy push from the government. Add to that several states haven\u2019t had cause to use it yet, and it begs the question of why did the government tie it so hard to easing restrictions? On that note I will hand over to Josh Taylor, who will see you through the evening. Stay well and wear long pants in professional video calls, even if no one can see. It\u2019s a psychological thing. A strong entry in the field of camera v reality when working from home. Simon is based in London. I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s not wearing long pants. You can see more WFH setups (and feel better about angling your webcam away from the pile of laundry every morning) here. This temporary fence has been erected around the Olympic Park oval at the Holden Centre, which is the training and administrative headquarters for the Magpies. AFL players have returned to training, under strict social distancing guidelines, ahead of the season recommencing on 11 June. As someone who attended a lot of music festivals in their youth, I can tell you it\u2019s quite easy to get through this type of temporary fence, so this poses more of a deterrent than an actual obstacle. If someone really wanted to get on the oval, they would get on the oval. That is not encouragement. Please do not bust through the fences; leave the footballers to train in infection-free peace. If you\u2019re wondering how WA is feeling, take a look at talkback radio. The refusal of states such as Queensland and Western Australia to reopen their borders has become a point of tension in the national cabinet, Ben Doherty reports. Although it\u2019s worth noting that we have just heard two Queensland MPs, David Littleproud and Matt Canavan, saying they support the state border. Littleproud says there was a six-month extension to the anti-dumping investigation, which pushed it out to this month. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to speculate. It\u2019s important that we calmly and methodically work through each of these issues, no matter whether with China or with any other nation that we trade with. And it\u2019s a timely reminder to our exporters to make sure that they meet the specifications of those countries that we\u2019re exporting to. Otherwise, they have grounds on which to challenge the free trade agreements that we put in place. So we\u2019ll continue to work calmly and methodically. We firmly believe that Australian farmers aren\u2019t subsidised and we\u2019ll continue to prosecute that case. But to try and draw links isn\u2019t wise, and speculating isn\u2019t wise. We need to work in facts and deal in facts and work calmly and methodically through this. Asked by host Patricia Karvelas if he is offended by China\u2019s comments, Littleproud says no. Look, I\u2019m a big boy. The reality is what I want to do is continue to engage with our trading partners to ensure that we understand one another. We understand how we trade with one another. But when we make our own decisions, that we respect each other\u2019s sovereignty in a respectful way. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do at a ministerial level, at a government level, and a diplomatic level. Speaking of David Littleproud, he just spoke to the ABC\u2019s Afternoon Briefing program about meetings he and the trade minister, Simon Birmingham, have had today in the wake of China\u2019s barley tariffs decision. Littleproud says Australia is \u201cnot going to get into tit for tat\u201d with China and return tariffs. \u201cThat\u2019s a retaliation, and we don\u2019t retaliate,\u201d he says. We\u2019ve accepted it on face value, China\u2019s decision around these exports. But we have made quite clear that we reserve our right to explore that decision through all avenues \u2013 firstly domestically back through China \u2013 there\u2019s a short window for us to appeal this decision \u2013 and then we will reserve our right to take it to the WTO. He says the grain industry is \u201cvery calm and they\u2019re very mature about this\u201d, even though the drought means that some farmers have just put in their first barley crop for two or three years. We\u2019re tying make sure that not only China, but all our trading partners, appreciate, understand, that Australian agriculture is probably one of the least subsidised agricultural production systems in the world. Unlike his colleague Matt Canavan, Littleproud says we should not read anything into the fact that the barley tariffs have hit at the same time that Australia is having a diplomatic stoush with China over its push for an independent investigation into the coronavirus. Look, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to speculate on what\u2019s been an 18-month protracted process that has simply got to a juncture that coincided with events around the WHO. The Greens have repeated their call for Australia to push for a ban on the global wildlife trade, in the wake of the agriculture minister, David Littleproud, today calling for an investigation into the risks posed by wildlife wet markets. You can read Littleproud\u2019s comments here. The Greens environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, says Littleproud\u2019s push to investigate wet markets will not come to anything unless the wildlife trade is also halted. She put up a motion in the Senate last week calling for support for a global ban on the wildlife trade, but the motion failed. Says Hanson-Young: The agriculture minister and the PM can wax lyrical about an investigation into wildlife wet markets all they like, but if wildlife continue to be traded for consumption and other purposes, a health risk will remain. The science is well established on the link between wildlife consumption and the transfer of zoonotic diseases to humans. When wildlife is traded, it brings animals in contact with humans and other species in horrendous conditions leading to the spread of disease. The Australian government has an opportunity to really lead on this issue and help end the cruelty and reduce the risk of another pandemic like coronavirus in the future. Right now it seems they\u2019re not really serious about leading a global effort to reduce the risks for disease to emerge and spread. Canavan says the Queensland premier\u2019s decision to keep the state borders closed until possibly September is sensible, given the continued spread of the coronavirus in Victoria and NSW. He says \u201cthe decision to close state borders has been proven the right one\u201d. It seemingly has helped constrain the virus in some states. And I myself have thought we should have had stronger processes or restrictions on regional travel here in Queensland. We just had a case in Rockhampton, where I\u2019m talking to you now, which seems to have come from travel between Brisbane and Rockhampton. I\u2019m not against [state borders]. However, Canavan says he would like to see a \u201cmore responsive timeframe\u201d. I don\u2019t know if we need to set September as a hard marker if conditions in NSW continue to decline as they seem to have or are doing. Surely let\u2019s reopen earlier. Still on barley, the Labor MP Ed Husic is also on the ABC describing the barley tariffs as \u201ca $500m kick in the guts to us, to our country\u201d. Husic says Labor will support the government taking the issue to the World Trade Organization. The Queensland LNP senator Matt Canavan says the Chinese embassy\u2019s claim that it was \u201cnothing but a joke\u201d for Australia to say its push for an independent investigation into the origin of the coronavirus had been vindicated by widespread global support, is \u201cclearly\u201d a provocative comment. Asked if China\u2019s decision to impose tariffs is \u201cclearly economic retaliation\u201d, Canavan says: I wouldn\u2019t use the word clearly, I\u2019d say it\u2019s most likely ... I think it\u2019s hard to explain otherwise. The chief executive of Grain Trade Australia, Pat O\u2019Shannassy, has been on ABC24 talking about the impact on Australian farmers of China\u2019s decision to impose an 80% tariff on barley imports. O\u2019Shannassy says the tariffs amount to a $500m hit to the Australian grains industry, and the industry is disappointed by China\u2019s decision. We know that the allegations and what has been claimed through this case is unsubstantiated and not true. We\u2019re refuting that. It is disappointing but we have to work with what is in front of us. O\u2019Shannassy says Australia has been working on its malt and barley trade with China since the 1960s, and there are varieties of barley grown in Australia that have been bred specifically for the Chinese market. Other markets can be developed, but that takes time. He says farmers will not necessarily be \u201cabandoning barley\u201d and switching to other grains. Unfortunately, barley growers are in the middle of their planting season now and going at it. For many, it\u2019s perhaps a little too late to adjust their plans. The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, has warned against \u201ccheap politicking\u201d, after the Chinese embassy in Canberra declared it was \u201cnothing but a joke\u201d for Australia to claim vindication over the growing global support for an international review into the handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Asked on Sky News about the comments, Birmingham said: Australia is not going to engage in cheap politicking over an issue as important as Covid-19. Birmingham signalled his displeasure with the \u201cprovocative\u201d comments. He said just as with the trade dispute, Australia would not engage in a \u201ctit for tat\u201d retaliation. We\u2019re not going to escalate rhetoric. Labor has released a joint statement from its shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, employment spokesman, Brendan O\u2019Connor, and industrial relations spokesman, Tony Burke, on the ABS data released today that showed 730,000 jobs have been lost since the coronavirus outbreak began. The ABS data showed the impact on the Covid-19 outbreak on employment and wages, sourced from single touch payroll data. It showed a 7.3% decline in payroll jobs overall and the loss of one out of every four payroll jobs in accommodation and food services. The Labor frontbenchers said the Morrison government \u201cbotched\u201d the rollout of the jobkeeper program, which meant support \u201carrived too late or not at all\u201d. Too many Australians are left out and left behind, some accidentally but many deliberately. Since the outbreak of the virus, the biggest job losses have been concentrated in hospitality and the arts, with young Australians hardest hit. They said those workers would not be able to \u201csnap back\u201d in September, when jobkeeper and the expanded jobseeker payments are due to expire. Meanwhile in the Covid-19 Senate inquiry, Kristina Keneally is asking about the education minister\u2019s offer to give non-government schools early funding if they reopen by 1 June. Alex Gordon, the deputy secretary of schools, has explained the two payments of 12.5% of their funding were first for returning to classroom learning in term two, and then to have a plan to reach 50% of in-person attendance by 1 June. Keneally asks what sort of checks will be applied. Gordon confirms the department \u201cwon\u2019t be checking\u201d if schools reach 50% attendance, because the requirement was to \u201chave a plan\u201d not to achieve that target. She said: We haven\u2019t required them to provide a plan. It\u2019s a bringing forward of funding they\u2019d get in July, so it was deemed a low risk. Schools have to provide an assurance that they have a plan, to declare to us that they have a plan for classroom learning. Gordon said the department \u201cwon\u2019t check every school\u201d but it will apply its \u201cassurance framework re the requirements of the act on an ongoing basis\u201d. Calla Wahlquist will guide you through the next little while. Thank you again for joining me today. Take care of you. The NRL has worked out where it will be playing: The heads of the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States, the Caribbean Community, and the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat have come together to create a joint statement on the Covid response. It is very worried about the economic and social challenges to its member states and wants debt relief: We are gravely concerned about the potentially dire consequences to the economies and livelihoods of our member states. While welcoming the recent decision of international creditors such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank to provide debt relief to low income countries, we call for this relief to include the most vulnerable economies in the world, including our member states. ... We acknowledge the potentially dire consequences to the economies and livelihoods of our member states, and the exacerbation of inequalities in our societies. Determined to protect the lives and livelihoods of our people, we also call on our development partners and relevant multilateral organisations \u2013 the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the United Nations (UN), the World Bank Group (WBG), the World Food Programme (WFP), and the World Health Organization (WHO) \u2013 to put in place the needed short, medium, and long-term emergency response programmes, in coordination with our regional institutions, to assist developing countries to address the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. It also calls for greater coordination of health resources and equipment \u2013 and then moves on to this kicker: We recognise that while Covid-19 is the most urgent threat facing humanity today, climate change remains the greatest threat in the longer term. We also call on all countries to ensure that the economic recovery measures to tackle Covid-19 align with the goals of the Paris Agreement. The transboundary nature of this pandemic reinforces the importance of multilateralism to address our common challenges. Labor\u2019s Murray Watt is asking education officials about the government\u2019s $18bn funding guarantee and shift towards short courses. Rob Heferen confirms the $18bn is a guarantee on funding such that, even if domestic student enrolments fall, universities will still get their government funding. But he doesn\u2019t have a figure on domestic enrolments. On short courses, Heferen confirms there is no extra funding but argues the benefit universities get is \u201cflexibility\u201d about how they allocate their places to bachelor and sub-bachelor courses, which is \u201cextremely valuable\u201d to some universities. Labor\u2019s Tanya Plibersek seizes this evidence to argue there is no funding in the relief package at all: twitter.com/tanya_plibersek/status/1262596236336484352 Which is not quite true ... There is a separate $100m of fee relief, but that is shared with the whole tertiary sector. Asked if universities have warned of insolvency, Heferen replies: \u201cInsolvency? No. Challenges? Definitely.\u201d The department is aware that hundreds of casuals have been let go, for example. So, to repeat, that is WA, SA and the NT all saying they\u2019ll be keeping their borders closed, until their health authorities say it is OK. South Australia\u2019s Liberal premier Steven Marshall spoke about his reluctance on ABC radio this morning: I want to open the borders but I want to open them when they\u2019re safe and I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s any chance that we\u2019ll be opening them anytime soon \u2013 there\u2019s still too many cases interstate. I think that they will open this year but we\u2019ll only do it once the other states get themselves into a good position as well. But so far, it is only Queensland which is under pressure to open up, despite the Queensland government using the same line as the other jurisdictions \u2013 only when the health officials say it is safe. WA premier Mark McGowan says Simon Birmingham \u201ccan say what he likes\u201d but the borders with the east will be staying up for as long as the state\u2019s health authorities believe it to be necessary. We understand and we support our businesses across the state. We understand that a lot of them are doing it tough. As soon as we can bring the borders down, we will, inside Western Australia. The border with the east will stay up for a period longer. The border with the east will stay up for as long as is necessary to protect the health of Western Australians. Mr Birmingham can say what he likes, we\u2019re gonna keep the borders in place for as long as is required to protect the health of the citizens of Western Australia. The South Australian government, I note, has a similar approach to the Western Australian government, as does the Northern Territory. And you might note that the Northern Territory and South Australia have very low rates of infection, just like Western Australia. So our borders with the east are an important part of our defence mechanism against the introduction of the virus into our state. We\u2019ll keep \u2019em up as long as is necessary. As the \u2018this is not a trade war\u2019 back and forth continues, it might be worth pointing out that the Nationals lost the trade portfolio after almost 60 years in 2013, when Tony Abbott decided to shift it to the Liberals in his cabinet, as part of an \u201caggressive free trade and foreign investment strategy\u201d. There was a bit of a push to get the trade portfolio back following Scott Morrison\u2019s election win a year ago, but obviously, the Nationals lost that, as Simon Birmingham, who is very much a Liberal, got the job. But the barley biff will have those rumblings starting up again. Suddenly, not even Bondi looks that bad. Rob Heferen acknowledges that universities are experiencing \u201cthe most extreme instance of financial difficulty we could imagine\u201d but said their financial position is \u201cpretty solid\u201d because many have large cash reserves. James Paterson\u2019s questioning established that about one-fifth of international students were unable to enter Australia (120,000 out of 626,000) and universities are still receiving all their government funding. He therefore rejected the claim universities have been \u201cabandoned\u201d. Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi asks if the department has done any modelling of potential job losses in the sector. Heferen says, no, they haven\u2019t, because universities can decide for themselves whether to respond to decreased revenue through reduced staff, capital projects or dipping into reserves. Michele Bruniges, the education department secretary, backs Heferen, that it is not possible for the department to do modelling because universities are autonomous. On the topic of schools, officials reveal that about 670 non-government schools applied for early funding by meeting Dan Tehan\u2019s conditions of resuming in-person teaching and a plan for 50% attendance by 1 July. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has threatened to permanently cut the US\u2019s funding to the World Health Organisation. Liberal senator James Paterson is asking the Department of Education about universities\u2019 eligibility for jobkeeper. Rob Heferen, the deputy secretary of higher education, research and international, has said that although universities are eligible for the wage subsidy, \u201cso far as we\u2019re aware no university has qualified\u201d. Heferen said universities had to meet the same turnover tests as other businesses to qualify \u2013 a 30% decline in revenue for those earning less than $1bn or 50% for those earning more \u2013 but there were \u201ca couple of variations\u201d to the rules affecting universities. Universities have to count their commonwealth grants and Help funding (which will make it harder to meet the downturn test) and measure revenue declines over 6 months, not one. Heferen has set out other supports for university, including $100m of fee relief (shared with the tertiary sector) and a guarantee on commonwealth funding, even if enrolments drop. The Department of Education is up before the Covid-19 Senate committee. So far, officials have said they will not release a full report on the first four weeks of the free childcare policy, arguing it is cabinet-in-confidence and contains commercially confidential information. A summary showed a quarter of services found the relief package had not helped their financial viability. Ros Baxter, the deputy secretary of early childhood and child care, says the program is on track to cost the $1.6bn estimated for the 12 weeks from 6 April to 28 June. She says that childcare subsidies cost $8.3bn last year \u2013 a figure suggesting the government will spend less this quarter than normal \u2013 but Baxter warned against a simple comparison because numbers vary through the year. When the relief package was announced, the department believed it was on track to spend $1.3bn over the same period because of a 30% decline in attendance. So on that figure the relief package did add $300m to the sector. Baxter says many providers were \u201con the brink of collapse\u201d if it weren\u2019t for the relief package and that if they had been allowed to fall over, the commonwealth would have owed much less in childcare subsidies. Labor\u2019s Katy Gallagher is now probing the fact the department estimated that a third of workers in the sector would be ineligible for the jobkeeper wage subsidy. The government is only providing 50% of childcare fees, and providers are expected to apply for jobkeeper to make up the difference. Understandably, providers with a lot of staff who are ineligible for jobkeeper were among the biggest critics of the package. Baxter is noting there is a fund for \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d to make up the difference. A quick update on the situation in Victoria. We now have three aged care homes that are being managed as active outbreak sites. The first is the Villa Maria aged care home in Bundoora, reported yesterday. You\u2019ll recall that a resident at that home had an inconclusive test result, then tested negative, but the Victorian Health Department\u2019s protocol is to manage all inconclusive cases as if they are a positive case. That is also what happened at the Hammond Care facility in Caulfield, which was reported today. A resident produced a positive test result, and subsequently tested negative, but the outbreak is being managed as if it were a positive result because aged care homes are so high-risk. So the facility is closed to visitors for 14 days. The third aged care facility is Lynden Aged Care in Camberwell. A resident of that home tested positive while being treated in a hospital in Melbourne, and remains in that hospital. This has not been reported as an inconclusive result \u2013 it\u2019s a true positive. All of their close contacts have been told to quarantine for 14 days and all residents and staff at the home will be tested. There was also a new case associated with the Cedar Meats cluster, bringing the total number of cases to 100. There are no new cases linked to the Maccas cluster. In all there were seven new cases reported overnight, but the state\u2019s total has only gone up by six (to 1,573) because another case was removed due to \u201creclassification\u201d. This usually means either a) a case that was part of Victoria\u2019s total is now counted in some other state\u2019s total, or b) a case that was inconclusive has now been deemed negative and struck off the list. The ACT remains (known) active Covid case-free. Just in case there are any Melbourne radio 3AW listeners on the blog. Victoria Health has also just released its official update: There are seven new cases since yesterday \u2013 one case was removed from the overall total due to reclassification. Today\u2019s new cases include: A single case of coronavirus in a resident of the Lynden aged care facility in Camberwell. The resident was diagnosed at a metropolitan hospital, where they are being treated. Residents and families are all being informed and we\u2019re working closely with the facility to ensure appropriate public health actions have been taken, including isolation, quarantine, cleaning and contact tracing. Close contacts have been ordered into home quarantine and all residents and staff at the home will be tested. A single case of coronavirus was notified in a resident of the HammondCare facility in Caulfield. A subsequent test has since come back negative. As per the policy of the public health team, even when a subsequent test result comes back negative the case is still managed as though it is a positive. This is a precautionary approach designed to minimise potential spread as quickly as possible. Because of the high-risk setting, the aged care facility will continue to be managed as if it were an outbreak site. Both aged care facilities will remain closed to visitors for 14 days as a precaution. One new case linked to the Cedar Meats outbreak \u2013 with the total number of cases now linked to this cluster at 100, made up of 64 staff and 36 external to the facility. One case of a returned traveller in hotel quarantine. Three other cases are under investigation. There were no further cases linked to the McDonald\u2019s Fawkner outbreak, with the total number of cases in that outbreak remaining at 12. Just catching up on the Victorian situation (there can be multiple press conferences on at the same time, so reviewing the information can take some time) and there have been more Covid cases diagnosed in aged care homes. The deputy chief medical officer in Victoria, Annaliese van Diemen, says there has been a Covid case identified in the Hammond aged care home in Caulfield. There has been another case identified at the Lyndon aged care facility in Campbellwell. That\u2019s on top of the Villa Maria aged care facility in Bundoora reporting a case yesterday. Both the HammondCare facility and the Villa Maria centre are in lockdown as a precaution. This was the whole Anthony Albanese quote on the impact of the US deal with China when it comes to barley exports: I\u2019ve said before, there\u2019s nothing remarkable about suggesting that there should be an inquiry into the origins and the spreading that occurred with the coronavirus. We have a coronial inquiry into a single death in this country and that is a significant thing that we do and it is normal practice. There\u2019s more than 300,000 people who have died due to this crisis globally and, of course, there should be an inquiry. With regard to trade, it would appear that this is unfair treatment of Australian barley farmers by China and the government should be giving that consideration. And Labor would support taking action at the WTO, the World Trade Organisation, to hold China to account on this. The imposition of 80% tariffs is an extraordinary decision. And we need to also \u2013 the Australian government should be pursuing with the US what the circumstances are behind the agreement between China and the US for access to China for US agriculture, and whether that has disadvantaged Australia, and we should be pursuing that on behalf of our farmers. Victoria has recorded six new positive Covid-19 tests in the past 24 hours. The death of a 93-year-old woman, who had been diagnosed with Covid-19, takes Australia\u2019s official Covid-19 death toll to 100. The woman had been a resident at Newmarch House, the aged care home in western Sydney which has been the site of a heartbreaking cluster. The woman was the 19th resident to die after contracting the virus while living in the facility. The Reserve Bank has released its minutes from the 5 May meeting, explaining its outlook for the Australian economy (a 10% decline in GDP over the first half of 2020). Some interesting details: Household consumption was expected to contract by about 15% over the first half of 2020, despite a spike in retail spending in March as households stocked up on groceries, pharmaceuticals, home office and home exercise equipment. Overall, the peak-to-trough decline in total hours worked was expected to be around 20%, with a weak labour market to lead to wage freezes or even cuts. The unemployment rate was expected to peak at around 10% in the June quarter \u2013 the number is being suppressed by people on the jobkeeper wage subsidy not counting as unemployed, but may rise as requirements to seek work are reapplied to jobseekers. Covid-19 is expected to have a \u201cvery large\u201d impact on prices, with inflation as measured by CPI expected to fall by around 2.25% in the June quarter, driven by the decline in petrol prices and the removal of childcare fees. Interest rates, including for home mortgages, are now at record lows. Commercial property is particularly vulnerable. With more people working from home, vacancy rates are expected to rise and rents to fall. The RBA summarised its decision: In considering the policy decision, members recognised that the global economy was experiencing a very severe downturn as countries sought to contain the Covid-19 outbreak through restrictions on activity. Many countries were likely to experience their biggest peacetime economic contractions since the 1930s and labour markets were very weak. The outlook remained uncertain, although if infection rates continued to decline and restrictions were eased, a recovery could be expected to start later in 2020, supported by both the large fiscal packages and the monetary policy response. The bank is planning for both an upside scenario, that as restrictions are eased economic activity returns, and a downside scenario where restrictions need to be reimposed due to a second wave of infections. But there\u2019s not a lot of language explaining which is considered more likely. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has released new data showing total payroll jobs fell by 7.3% and total wages paid fell by 5.4% in the seven weeks from mid-March (when Covid-19 restrictions were introduced after Australia reached 100 cases) and early May. The head of labour statistics at the ABS, Bjorn Jarvis, said: The latest data shows a further slowing in the fall in Covid-19 job losses between mid-April and early May. The largest net job losses over the seven weeks of the Covid-19 period, in percentage terms, were in Victoria and New South Wales, where the falls in payroll jobs were around 8.4% and 7.7 %. The accommodation and food services industry had lost around a third of payroll jobs (33.3%) by the week ending 11 April, and a subsequent increase in jobs saw this reduce to around 27.1% by the week ending 2 May. Breaking down the statistics by demographic: Women have had a bigger hit to jobs (down 7.1% compared with 6.9% for men) but a smaller hit to wages (down 1.9% compared with 7.6% for men). People under 20 have had the biggest cut to jobs (down 14.6%). And straight after the statement from the Chinese embassy calling Australia\u2019s claims of \u201cvindication\u201d in terms of calling for a Covid origins inquiry \u201cnothing but a joke\u201d, David Littleproud has released a statement claiming \u201cthe setting up of this scientific review has vindicated our efforts\u201d. The minister for agriculture, David Littleproud, is pleased to see the strong international support which he led last month at the G20 to investigate wildlife wet markets as part of the broader review of Covid-19. Minister Littleproud said his call for the expert review to look into the wildlife wet markets which he led at the G20 last month will provide a greater understanding of how to prevent another devastating event like Covid-19. \u201cSince 1980, two pandemics have been linked to wildlife wet markets and a further two linked to unsustainable wildlife practices \u2013 this is acknowledgment we need to work globally to protect us from these risks. \u201cWe have long known about the risks associated with wildlife wet markets and the potential for pandemics they pose but they also are a risk to agriculture and food security,\u201d minister Littleproud said. \u201cThat is why I worked with Australia\u2019s chief veterinary officer, Mark Schipp, to push for global reforms underpinned by a scientific review. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say I was the outlier at that time, but with calm and methodical work, the setting up of this scientific review has vindicated our efforts. \u201cIt will take a global effort to reduce the risks for disease to emerge and spread, and the threat to agriculture that the mix of wildlife, domestic animals and humans provide in wildlife wet markets. \u201cThe review will be a joint WHO, OIE, FAO collaboration. Together we can gather information that will contribute to the betterment of all nations. \u201cLet\u2019s hope the outcomes of the review finds ways to protect human life and the agriculture that underpins global food security.\u201d Add Tasmania to the list of states \u2013 South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland \u2013 that are pushing back against opening borders. As we were pointing out yesterday, the World Health Assembly motion which is under discussion was put forward by the EU, not Australia \u2013 Australia was a co-sponsor. But the motion is different to what Australia wanted, in that it allows for the World Health Organization to lead the inquiry, which was the main thing Australia did not want. Things are going really well. Anthony Albanese says Australia needs to know what the agreement is between China and the US in terms of trade, so it knows what the playing field looks like as it negotiates the barley tariff decision. Last week, China said it would immediately allow more imports of barley from the US. Donald Trump has been playing a very hard trade deal with China, but no one seems to know what the state of play is, and how it is impacting other trading nations. Albanese is the one of the first to raise that issue today \u2013 and it is a pretty big point, given Australia\u2019s response is to tell China, not so subtly, it will look to other markets to sell barley. AAP has an update on the Victorian rental situation, since the Covid measures were put in place: Victorian tenants who have struck agreements with their landlords to drop their rent amid the effects of coronavirus are paying 31% less on average. Attorney general Jill Hennessy has revealed the average decrease while being grilled at a parliamentary inquiry investigating the state government\u2019s response to Covid-19. During the pandemic, Victorian tenants seeking rent reductions, their landlords and agents have been encouraged to reach agreements and register them with Consumer Affairs Victoria. Emergency laws passed in the state on 29 March also introduced a new dispute resolution process for when parties can\u2019t come to an agreement independently. That will last until September. Hennessy said more than 15,000 people had contacted Consumer Affairs making inquiries about residential tenancies during the pandemic. More than 6,800 changed rental agreements have been struck without any need for dispute resolution. Almost 1,270 others were reached after assistance teams stepped in to help resolve disputes, with that process taking about six days on average. Where an agreement has been struck, weekly rent has decreased by an average of 31%, or about $184. There are still cases were agreement has not been reached, with 81 residential tenancy matters referred to the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal. Since 12 May, when a chief resolution officer has been able to accept disputes referred by Consumer Affairs Victoria, 216 matters have also been sent their way. Speaking from Tumbarumba in New South Wales, which is part of the Eden-Monaro electorate, Anthony Albanese says he\u2019ll leave it to the states to decide when they reopen their borders: No one wants any restriction to be in place for one day more than necessary. But state governments are making decisions based upon the health advice. I haven\u2019t been critical of any of the state governments, be they New South Wales, where we\u2019re now, or any of the other states. They\u2019ll make their decisions based upon the advice they receive. It looks like Qantas is preparing for domestic travel to resume from 12 June \u2013 it has loaded information on its \u201cfly well\u201d program onto its website, outlining its new procedures: Pre-flight Information sent to all customers before they fly, so they know what to expect. Contactless check-in (via online/app) and self-serve bag drop strongly encouraged, including use of Q Bag Tags. Hand sanitising stations at departure gates. Temporary changes to Qantas Lounges, including increased physical distancing, hand sanitising stations, enhanced disinfection of surfaces and adjustments to food and drink service. Working with airports on other safeguards in the terminal, including regular disinfection of security screening points and installing hygiene screens at airline customer service desks, wherever practical. Onboard Masks provided to all passengers on each flight \u2013 while not mandatory from a safety point of view, they are recommended to be worn in the interests of everyone\u2019s peace of mind. Enhanced cleaning of aircraft with a disinfectant effective against coronaviruses, with a focus on high contact areas \u2013 seats, seatbelts, overhead lockers, air vents and toilets. Sanitising wipes given to all passengers to wipe down seat belts, trays and armrests themselves, if preferred. Simplified service and catering to minimise touchpoints for crew and passengers. Passengers asked to limit movement around cabin, once seated. Sequenced boarding and disembarkation to minimise crowding. In addition, the air conditioning systems of all Qantas and Jetstar aircraft are already fitted with hospital-grade HEPA filters, which remove 99.9% of all particles including viruses. Air inside the cabin is refreshed on average every five minutes during flight. All airline employees are required to follow strict personal hygiene protocols, for the benefit of themselves and others. All passengers are encouraged to download the Australian Government\u2019s CovidSafe app as part of improving the ability of health authorities to contain the spread of coronavirus. In line with public health advice, anyone with cold and flu-like symptoms should stay at home. Queensland has announced part of its Covid-19 stimulus response. The key takeaways: A $400m accelerated works program to deliver new road, bridge and pavement sealing works across the state; A further $200m in 2020-21 for a works for Queensland program to support jobs and fund productive building projects; and An $11.25m expansion of the household resilience program in cyclone-affected areas. $50m for tourism infrastructure and more funding towards a domestic tourism campaign; Redirecting $50m of industry attraction funding under the Making it for Queensland initiative to continue to expand manufacturing capacity for PPE, hand sanitiser and medical supplies to respond to Covid-19; and A $10m package to support international students and safeguard Queensland\u2019s global education brand. $20m for free online training which includes training in safety and hygiene standards to keep Covid-19 contained; A further $14.8m to support project development of the CopperString 2.0 project that will connect the North West Minerals Province with the national electricity market; and $20m towards construction of a Queensland apprenticeships centre in renewable hydrogen at Beenleigh. Small businesses will also have access to grants of up to $10,000. Sorry folks \u2013 just saw an incorrect headline on the blog (it has been a long week) and yes, the push is for domestic border restrictions to be scrapped, not international (which obviously would be much bigger news than a blog post, at this point). Sorry for the confusion \u2013 it should be fixed now, and if it\u2019s still showing, just reload the page. Meanwhile, Simon Birmingham again singles out Queensland for not opening up its borders, while ignoring that South Australia, where he lives and which he represents and is currently standing in, has also indicated it will be keeping its borders closed to other states, possibly until the end of winter. Which would be September. The Queensland premier yesterday suggested that borders could be shut all the way through to September. If we continue to see the national success in containing Covid-19 as things like restaurants and pubs reopen and we get things gradually back to normal with appropriate social distancing, then there\u2019s no reason, if all of those next steps are successful, that we can\u2019t see borders reopen well before September. It doesn\u2019t sound like Australia is rushing off to the World Trade Organisation just yet, and instead hopes \u201cother avenues\u201d will offer a solution. Australia is not interested in a trade war. We don\u2019t pursue our trade policies on a tit-for-tat basis. We will continue to operate as we always do. We acknowledge that China has a right to use anti-dumping laws and rules. We use those laws and rules at times as well. But it is a case where China, we think, in this case, has made errors of both fact and law in the application of those rules. Question: What about the issues that the Chinese present about subsidies and how they use the context of the farm allowance payments ... How do they come to those conclusions? And how have we not been able to set them straight on that? Simon Birmingham: It\u2019s completely ridiculous to be listing things like the Murray-Darling Basin infrastructure upgrades as some sort of subsidy to barley exporters when the bulk of that barley comes out of Western Australia or South Australia and is firmly dryland farming. The Murray-Darling basin is nowhere near Geraldton or other parts of the barley-growing world and I think it demonstrates the absence of factual analysis in the decision that\u2019s been made by China. We will continue to mount the case, and we hope that \u2013 through whatever appeal mechanisms we determine to use \u2013 that we find a hearing that takes greater account of the facts of the argument. Simon Birmingham, as the more senior minister, can at least acknowledge the elephant in the room, which David Littleproud, could not. Q: So you believe this is not in any way related to Australia\u2019s push for an investigation into how Covid-19 started? Birmingham: I can understand why people draw those links \u2013 particularly given the unhelpful comments of the Chinese ambassador to Australia a few weeks ago. In the end, China denies there\u2019s a link. The only thing we can do in defence of our farmers is engage in the process as constructively as we can. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done with Australian industry to date and we now enter a new phase in terms of analysing how we can appeal, what steps we can take, and we\u2019re going to do that with the same determination we\u2019ve shown in defending rights of our farmers up until now. ... The decision was always due by today. So from the minute it started, 18 months ago, the deadline for a decision was today, so there is some coincidence that exists around the timing. As I say, others can debate whether or not there\u2019s a linkage. As Australia\u2019s trade minister, my job is to put the best foot forward in defence of our farmers and exporters and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do in terms of continuing to defend their behaviour, their work and their hard work and to make sure that we stand up for Aussie farmers and Aussie jobs. Simon Birmingham says Australia will take some time to examine the Chinese government tariff decision, but says on the outset it does not make sense; China\u2019s decision is one that does concern us deeply, because it appears to have been based, without a proper understanding of the facts or the evidence. It just doesn\u2019t stack up in terms of any analysis of Australian farming and our barley production to suggest that our exporters engage in dumping of products or unduly subsidised. We\u2019re going to take some time to talk with industry while, together with the farming sector, we thoroughly analyse the details of this case and the determination that China\u2019s made, so that we construct the best pathway forward to appeal the decision, to get the decision reversed and we want to make sure that is done in a calm way with the best interests of all parts of Australian farmers, but in particular our barley-producers. In the meanwhile, we\u2019re going to work damn hard with those barley-producers to make sure we find alternative markets for them, to make sure that when this year\u2019s crop is harvested, they\u2019re able to get it out onto the world market as they always do so successfully, and we have our new free trade agreement coming online with Indonesia on July 5. It provides some opportunities. We have sent a message to our trade and diplomatic posts around the world to make sure that they continue their efforts, as they do, to find new market opportunities for Australian farmers. Simon Birmingham should be holding his press conference closer to 10.30. But his lines will be very similar to what he was saying this morning as he did the breakfast rounds. Here he is talking to the Seven network, but it was all pretty much the same \u2013 Australia won\u2019t apologise for calling for an independent investigation into the origins of Covid, but insists there is no trade war: Outside of what we\u2019ve seen, in terms of decisions around four meat processing plants and some of the usual ebbing and flowing we see in terms of commodity trades, I\u2019m not getting any signals of that [other sectors being impacted] I hope and trust that we can continue to see, in total, the benefits of the two-way trade we have with China continue to flow for both countries. You know, this barley decision is bad for Australian farmers but it\u2019s also bad for Chinese breweries and other customers of Australian barley in China who will end up paying more for product or getting substandard product from around the world. And so we hope that China will reconsider this at some point and we\u2019ll continue to work with them where we can. This number is huge \u2013 Victoria social distancing fines have hit $8m. Queensland has recorded no new cases of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours. But, as with every other jurisdiction, the economic impact has been profound. Annastacia Palaszczuk says the health response meant Queensland avoided a potential worse case scenario of 30,000 deaths, but came with a \u201cmuch greater economic toll\u201d. The Queensland government plans on revealing its stimulus plan, when parliament sits. In the meantime, Australia will be picking up the phone to the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia, as well as Indonesia and India to see if they want some more barley. David Littleproud: So we\u2019ll pursue other markets as quickly as we can. We\u2019re not saying we\u2019ll never come back to China, but we\u2019ll make sure that we have this conversation and this dialogue constructively to work through to make sure that if we can get to an agreement, understanding of what\u2019s happened, an appreciation of our point of view, then those markets will continue, as do other agricultural markets into China. China is pretty into beer, which is why Australian barley has been so popular. So there will be domestic implications within China, with the subtle threat from Australia being \u201cmaybe our barley won\u2019t be there for you when you want it back\u201d. Diplomacy is a tricky bish. Neither Simon Birmingham or David Littleproud had any warning about the decision, based on their public comments this morning, which would point to the CCP still not picking up the phone to the Australian ministers. They found out about it around 9pm last night, when it was announced. So, in short, China is still not taking our calls. That isn\u2019t new \u2013 China banned Australian ministers from visiting under the Turnbull administration as well \u2013 you may remember Steve Ciobo couldn\u2019t get a visa there for a bit while he was trade minister. But given the sensitivities around the pandemic, and the world trade situation as it stood even before the pandemic, there isn\u2019t exactly an easy diplomatic fix to this. The Australian assertion that the Chinese government\u2019s decision to impose an 80% tariff on Australian barley has nothing to do with the Australian push for an independent inquiry into the Covid pandemic origins and response is completely at odds with the very public assertion of the Chinese ambassador that there would be questions over Australian products, including higher education, if the investigation push continued. I mean, there were cranky diplomatic phone calls over the comments, which first appeared in the Australian Financial Review last month. But that will be the public line. Privately, it is something very different. So the message from the federal government is \u2013 this has nothing to do with Australia\u2019s calls for an independent inquiry into Covid, Australia will diversify its export markets, Australia will be \u201ccalm and methodical\u201d in its response, and everything else is cool beans. Shorter version \u2013 calm your farms. Except, exporters are rightly worried, and this won\u2019t be the end of it. Question: But are Australian farmers paying the price for that? David Littleproud: No. Because unless you have evidence to the contrary to say that this barley decision is predicated on that, then you can\u2019t make those assertions. They are dangerous assertions to make. This is a process that started 18 months ago, well before Covid-19 came into place, and this was the juncture, coincidentally, of when it had to come to a decision. So I think you\u2019re trying to speculate wildly. They have given reasons, which we are working through now, and if we do not agree with those reasons, we\u2019ll take it to the umpire. That\u2019s what you do, calmly and methodically. There is no trade war. Everyone needs to take a deep breath, take a cold shower and understand that we produce the best food and fibre in the world and we have marketplaces that we\u2019ll be able to send our barley and other produce into other markets if our producers wish to do so. Question: Should your government apologise to Australian farmers for them getting caught up in this diplomatic stoush? David Littleproud: No. Australians will always stand up for our sovereign right to make a determination. We did, in no way, ask for confrontation. It was an investigation that we asked for. And I think the world, last night, accepted that view. This wasn\u2019t about persecution. This was about understanding of a pandemic that 300,000 souls lost their lives to. That is the responsible thing to do as a good global citizen. The fact that Australia led the way, and asked for that, for that review to take place, we should be damn proud as a nation that we led the world, not only on understanding what the WHO has done, but understanding what wildlife wet markets\u2019 role is in these pandemics. We should be damn proud Australia is now leading the world. The reality is they are separate. These are issues in which the Chinese officials raised on barley 18months ago. This wild speculation is dangerous. The facts remain that we\u2019ll calmly and methodically work through it with our trading partners and what we believe, as a nation, around something that affects us as a global citizen is important to continue and we will continue to stand up for that every day of the week. David Littleproud repeats that there is no trade war, and he has no reason to think the tariff decision was linked to Australia\u2019s call for an independent investigation into the origins and original response to the coronavirus pandemic: There\u2019s no trade war. In fact, even today, I think you have seen that there\u2019s increased demand for iron ore out of China. The reality is they have used a process, quite fairly, around a belief that we have not been fair in our trade. We prosecute the case, quite strongly, that that is not the case. We will now reserve our right - and probably go to the independent umpire to make that determination. That\u2019s... That\u2019s what you do in a fair trading system. You use the rules. China has been well within their rules in what they have done. We continue to trade openly on a number of other commodities, not only in agriculture, but in minerals and also services. This will not change. But we will continue to make sure that everything is done on a fair and equitable basis and when we believe that it isn\u2019t, then we\u2019ll have the independent umpire make that assessment. David Littleproud says Australia will continue to do what it can to work with China to rectify the barley decision, and will \u201cprobably\u201d go to the World Trade Organisation to appeal the tariff imposition, but says there is no trade war with China. In the meantime, can I say to barley-producers around the country we will not take our foot off the accelerator in finding other markets. We have already \u2013 only in the last week \u2013 opened up greater access into India in getting some of their ... in some of their conditions eased to allow easier access into India. We now have a free trade agreement that starts on 5 July with Indonesia and also within the Middle East - Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are also interested. So we\u2019ll continue to work with our trading partners, but we\u2019ll continue to prosecute our case that Australian barley-producers and producer of any commodity here in Australia are not subsidised. We hold that view strongly. We\u2019ll continue to prosecute that calmly and methodically, work with China as best we can to ensure that we understand one another better. My door is always opened and my phone is always on to my Chinese counterpart and my department, who are ensconced in Beijing, are working continuously with government officials there to ensure there is better understanding in the future. Australian farmers can take comfort in the fact that our produce is the best in the world and there is demand for it in other parts of the world and we will pursue those markets vigorously. Simon Birmingham will hold a press conference at 10am. He\u2019s got a lot to talk about today. The ACT, which remains (known) active Covid-19 case free, is looking at further relaxing of its physical distance restrictions. The ABC reports chief minister Andrew Barr has released the territory\u2019s \u201croadmap\u201d (the new favourite political buzzword, along with \u201cCovid-safe\u201d) towards reopening. If things stay as they currently are, gatherings of up to 20 people would be allowed from 30 May, which would also allow gyms, cinemas, beauticians and tattoo studios to reopen (think stage two restrictions). If that goes well, from 19 June, then stage three could be put into place, which would see gatherings of up to 100 people, meaning \u2013 pubs would be back. The Senate select committee looking at the government\u2019s Covid-19 response will hold a hearing today, from 1pm. It\u2019s on education, skills and training today The ACCC has opened up discussion on its concept paper on how to make the digital media space a little fairer: The ACCC has released a concepts paper seeking views on each of the issues to be covered in a mandatory code to address bargaining power imbalances between Australian news media business and each of Google and Facebook. We welcome all interested parties to make a submission in response to the questions set out in this concepts paper. With 157 newsrooms closing in Australia in the last year, Buzzfeed, 10 Daily and (possibly) Australian Associated Press among them, as well as the loss of crucial regional media outlets, despite massive audience jumps in an age where people need more information than ever, it\u2019s a review which is beyond time. You\u2019ll find it here. The National Farmers\u2019 Federation is \u201cfrustrated and deeply concerned\u201d with China\u2019s decision to place an 80% tariff on Australian barley. NFF CEO Tony Mahar released a statement saying that from today, Australian barley exports face a dumping margin of up to 73.6% as well as a subsidy margin of up to almost 7%, making exporting barley to China \u201cvery difficult to say the least\u201d. \u201cChina is Australia\u2019s largest barley market, almost 50% of our barely worth about $917 million is exported to China each year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe new tariffs will significantly curtail and, most likely stop, exports of Australian barley to China by artificially increasing the price, until the situation can be can resolved.\u201d Maher rubbished the Chinese government\u2019s claims that Australian growers were subsidised. Australian grain growers are amongst the least subsidised in the world. They operate in a free and competitive global market. The idea that Australian barley has been \u2018dumped\u2019 in China doesn\u2019t match the realities of Australian grain production. Export sales are made at prices above the purchase value offered to farmers, which in turn surpasses their cost of production. He wants Australia to appeal the decision at the World Trade Organisation, which Simon Birmingham has already floated, and urged the government to try and reopen talks with the CCP. More than two-thirds of Australia\u2019s agricultural production is exported, and up to 30% of that goes to China. Our relationship with China has gone from strength to strength since the coming into force of ChAFTA in 2015. China is an important market for Australian wool, red meat, cotton, dairy, wine, horticulture and seafood. Australia\u2019s barley trade relationship with China goes back to the 1960s. It is the NFF\u2019s strong hope that a resolution that is satisfactory to both parties can be reached sooner rather than later, to avoid unnecessary detriment to Australian farmers and Chinese consumers \u2013 who value our barley. The South Australian premier has indicated he will be keeping SA\u2019s borders closed for as long as his state\u2019s medical officer deems it necessary, which could be until after winter \u2013 which would make it September, the same as Queensland, and yet he doesn\u2019t seem to be facing the same \u201cbring down the borders\u201d chant from the feds. I wonder what the difference could be? David Littleproud, in a chat to Sky News this morning, warned Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk not to \u201cpoliticise\u201d the Covid-19 response, and turn the border closure into an election issue. The federal Queensland Liberal MP says the Queensland government shouldn\u2019t be listening to just its own health advisers. I think the premier in Queensland has to be very careful about this, not to turn this into a political sideshow, leading up to a state election around parochialism, state parochialism. We\u2019ve got to predicate our decisions on the best medical advice, not just from the Queensland medical officer, but from the chief medical officer of the country and I think that needs to be transparent around where all those officials see the risk \u2026 we now have a greater understanding of this disease, this virus, than what we had previously, so I think now with the tracing app, there is opportunity for us to look at this more pragmatically. I think the premier needs to understand parochialism won\u2019t help the Queensland economy, if we can do it safely, with the tracing app and understanding where people are and what we have put in place, then, we shouldn\u2019t put ourselves in cotton wool for too long, because it is only going to destroy much of the tourism sector \u2013 and in particular, outback Queensland, that would have 50,000 to 60,000 visitors there right now, we will be destroying their economies as well, so if it can be done safely, and the medical advice is telling us that, not just from Queensland, but from around the country, then I think we need to have that honest conversation.\u201d Meanwhile, in the midst of a pandemic, and released late last night, the government has revealed its new emissions reduction measures. Adam Morton has the first take on that hefty decision, here. David Littleproud will hold a press conference on China\u2019s decision to level an 80% tariff against Australian barley, but Simon Birmingham says it is all about diversification at the moment. We will have to work very hard with our barley producers here in Australia to find new market opportunities for them. China can, at any stage, choose to lift these duties, and we\u2019ll certainly continue to try to engage with them, to convince them that they should do so,\u201d he told the Nine network. Gladys Berejiklian on schools returning to face-to-face learning: Having been through this process of staged introduction of face-to-face learning, again we\u2019ve used that time to prepare our schools for a Covid-safe environment. I\u2019m very pleased we have been able to use that time to do it properly, because from now on, we don\u2019t ever want to see a situation where all schools are closed. We want to make sure that face-to-face time in the classroom is what maintains and sustains learning through the pandemic. But I do say it will be common, common for schools to be shut down temporarily. It will be common for a specific area to be on high alert. It will be common for a particular school to take extra measures if there\u2019s a community breakout in that community with cases. And we just have to accept that. But I think, given how we\u2019ve seen the education department and our officials and the health officials deal with incidents in the past, we can have confidence that moving forward, if there\u2019s a case in a school, if there\u2019s a particular community that\u2019s had a high number of cases, that schools have the ability to take extra steps, or else, of course, we\u2019ll shut those schools down if there\u2019s a case identified in the school community. NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian says from 5,300 tests, there were just two positive results in the last 24 hours. That\u2019s part of the reason schools are going back, back. From 25 May, all students will be back to on-site learning. That is the same date as Queensland. With the tourism industry continuing to suffer and many operators on the brink of collapse, the push to reopen the state borders is getting stronger. Gladys Berejiklian has been one of the most vocal \u201cbring down the borders\u201d proponents, but the federal government is now getting on board. Both WA and Queensland have warned they will keep borders up for as long as they believe is necessary to protect the health of their residents. WA has put no date on it. South Australia has no plans to reopen. Yesterday, Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the restrictions could stay in place until September. Simon Birmingham told the Nine Network it was time for the internal borders to come down. We need people moving across this country again when it\u2019s safe to do so. There is no national cabinet this week, so that is a discussion that will have to wait until the next meeting. *An earlier version of this post was incorrectly headlined \u2018international borders\u2019 instead of \u2018domestic borders\u2019. It is most definitely domestic borders we are talking about here Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. Here are the main developments you might have missed yesterday and overnight: China has put punitive tariffs of more than 80% on barley imports from Australia as more than 110 countries backed a push for an international coronavirus inquiry. Trade minister Simon Birmingham said Australia was \u201cdeeply disappointed with China\u2019s decision\u201d and may appeal the decision. Australia reported its 99th confirmed death of a coronavirus patient NSW premier expected to announce students will return to classrooms full-time from 25 May Twelve McDonald\u2019s outlets in Melbourne\u2019s north and west have been shut due to a delivery driver testing positive for coronavirus New strict transport rules in NSW will mean a maximum of 12 people on a bus at one time, 32 in a train carriage, and 45 on a ferry Labor leader Anthony Albanese has backed reducing jobseeker below its current level but higher than the former newstart payment. Birmigham told ABC radio he still hasn\u2019t heard from China\u2019s commerce minister, and reiterated his disappointment, but said he would not allow emotions to \u201ccloud his judgement\u201d. The government has also started tackling the \u201cmisinformation linking 5G and the coronavirus\u201d as that conspiracy takes a stronger hold in the mainstream. Meanwhile, Labor has begun campaigning in Eden-Monaro, despite there not being a byelection date set as yet. We\u2019ll bring you all the day\u2019s events. You have Amy Remeikis with you for most of the day and the entire Guardian brain\u2019s trust at your disposal. Ready?",

In China, <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china/russian-border-becomes-chinas-frontline-in-fight-against-second-virus-wave-idUKKCN21V06R\">the entry of people with coronavirus</a> across the Russian border is one example where easing restrictions resulted in new cases of the virus. Meanwhile in Germany, <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-breaks-out-in-third-german-slaughterhouse/a-53389860\">outbreaks of coronavirus linked to abattoirs</a> where employees live in poor housing conditions is a reminder that the R number can also increase when vulnerable individuals are exposed to the virus for the first time.</p> <p>The potential rise in R after lockdown measures are relaxed is something that epidemiologists are well aware of. If the government delivers an effective testing and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/15/epidemiologists-contact-tracing-coronavirus\">contact-tracing strategy</a> that can bring the virus under control by the time lockdown measures are lifted for everyone, new cases of Covid-19 would theoretically be little cause for concern \u2013 as health authorities would have measures in place to identify and curb incipient outbreaks.</p> <p>What\u2019s of greater concern to epidemiologists are indications that the R number is rising uncontrollably, or in a way that increases the exposure of the most vulnerable or puts health systems under great strain. In other words, what\u2019s as important as the R number is the total number of cases across a population that an increase in R would cause. While the increase in Germany\u2019s R number is concerning, this would be far more alarming were it to occur in the UK, where there are currently many more cases of coronavirus.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/regional-differences-in-covid-19-transmission-rate-emerge-in-england\">Regional differences</a> in the value of R are also important. Easing the lockdown in areas with greater health resources, fewer Covid-19 cases and where more people have already had the virus, may be practical compared with another part of the country where outcomes of an increasing R would be more severe. Differences in the R number among particular risk groups, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/agency-staff-were-spreading-covid-19-between-care-homes-phe-found-in-april\">care home residents</a>, are also likely to be more meaningful than the value of R for the country as a whole. Again, we\u2019ll need a widespread programme of testing and tracing to determine these risks, and enable health authorities to rapidly contain incipient outbreaks.</p> <p>Intuitively, we know that if contact between people with Covid-19 and those susceptible to infection increases, the R number is likely to rise. But this doesn\u2019t happen in a straightforward way. A 10% increase in contact doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a 10% increase in R, or a 10% increase in overall risk of catching the virus. Understanding how contact between people affects transmission, whether it be transmission of hate messages via a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06930-7\">malicious bot on the internet</a> or transmission of a virus from an infected person, is a pivotal concept in the field of \u201cnetwork science\u201d.</p> <p>For Covid-19, a single contact can endanger an otherwise isolated community. Once an infection is introduced, the results can be <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-52676174\">disastrous</a>. In network science, this pattern is described as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/30918\">small-world</a>\u201d effect. The concept originated from the idea that individuals with apparently little in common often have connections they are unaware of. What this means for public health is that even if only a handful of people have the potential to expose other communities to disease risk, in communities that are geographically distant or isolated, the impact of those few people on the spread of a virus can be significant. In the case of coronavirus, many areas in the UK have only experienced small outbreaks so far, creating fewer opportunities for the effects of \u201cherd immunity\u201d to curb the risk of a future outbreak.</p> <p>To understand why mass gatherings are so important for infection, we can use a second concept borrowed from network science, that of \u201cscale-free networks\u201d. This is when some individuals in a network have a disproportionate number of contacts compared with the average. Gatherings are one context in which a single individual who is infected with Covid-19 could have many more contacts with other people than average. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15842.1\">Emerging scientific research suggests</a> that some individuals may be responsible for infecting many more people than others. One crucial question, which scientists haven\u2019t yet answered, is whether these patterns are driven by more contact or differences in infectiousness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/18/sage-advice-britain-coronavirus-science-government-policy\">The Sage advice must be published now to find where Britain got coronavirus wrong | Anthony Costello</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mass gatherings become more significant if such events occur frequently, with at least some of the same individuals returning repeatedly to the same place. This is often the case for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/14/angelo-ogbonna-accuses-premier-league-ignoring-coronavirus-risk\">scheduled football matches</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/churches-consider-ticketing-when-they-reopen-after-lockdown-coronavirus\">religious services</a>, both of which occur weekly \u2013 an interval conveniently similar to the time it takes a person infected with coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2020.25.17.2000257\">to become infectious to others</a>. Gatherings both increase the opportunities to become infected and increase the chances of infecting other people. If a few people who are infected with coronavirus come into contact with many others, the<a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.64.066112\"> risk of a rapid spread can become uncontrollable</a>. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/21/experts-inquiry-cheltenham-festival-coronavirus-deaths\">some events</a> present both kinds of risk: drawing in many people from great distances, and holding them together in close contact for an extended period.</p> <p>Lowering our chance of a second wave will require minimising the impact of both of these factors. This means restricting large gatherings, especially where individuals might repeat these over the course of a single infection, and restricting movements over long distances, or those with a higher probability of putting vulnerable groups at risk. Crucially, it also means having in place a testing and tracing strategy that allows health authorities to identify new cases of Covid-19. These concepts are intuitive, but what network science tells us is that the risk associated with even a small change in patterns of human contact can be substantial.</p> <p>\u2022 Rowland Kao is the Sir Timothy O\u2019Shea Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology and Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, and is working with Public Health Scotland on coronavirus modelling. </p>",

Understanding how contact between people affects transmission, whether it be transmission of hate messages via a malicious bot on the internet or transmission of a virus from an infected person, is a pivotal concept in the field of \u201cnetwork science\u201d. For Covid-19, a single contact can endanger an otherwise isolated community. Once an infection is introduced, the results can be disastrous. In network science, this pattern is described as a \u201csmall-world\u201d effect. The concept originated from the idea that individuals with apparently little in common often have connections they are unaware of. What this means for public health is that even if only a handful of people have the potential to expose other communities to disease risk, in communities that are geographically distant or isolated, the impact of those few people on the spread of a virus can be significant. In the case of coronavirus, many areas in the UK have only experienced small outbreaks so far, creating fewer opportunities for the effects of \u201cherd immunity\u201d to curb the risk of a future outbreak. To understand why mass gatherings are so important for infection, we can use a second concept borrowed from network science, that of \u201cscale-free networks\u201d. This is when some individuals in a network have a disproportionate number of contacts compared with the average. Gatherings are one context in which a single individual who is infected with Covid-19 could have many more contacts with other people than average. Emerging scientific research suggests that some individuals may be responsible for infecting many more people than others. One crucial question, which scientists haven\u2019t yet answered, is whether these patterns are driven by more contact or differences in infectiousness. Mass gatherings become more significant if such events occur frequently, with at least some of the same individuals returning repeatedly to the same place. This is often the case for scheduled football matches or religious services, both of which occur weekly \u2013 an interval conveniently similar to the time it takes a person infected with coronavirus to become infectious to others. Gatherings both increase the opportunities to become infected and increase the chances of infecting other people. If a few people who are infected with coronavirus come into contact with many others, the risk of a rapid spread can become uncontrollable. And some events present both kinds of risk: drawing in many people from great distances, and holding them together in close contact for an extended period. Lowering our chance of a second wave will require minimising the impact of both of these factors. This means restricting large gatherings, especially where individuals might repeat these over the course of a single infection, and restricting movements over long distances, or those with a higher probability of putting vulnerable groups at risk. Crucially, it also means having in place a testing and tracing strategy that allows health authorities to identify new cases of Covid-19. These concepts are intuitive, but what network science tells us is that the risk associated with even a small change in patterns of human contact can be substantial. \u2022 Rowland Kao is the Sir Timothy O\u2019Shea Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology and Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, and is working with Public Health Scotland on coronavirus modelling.",

Previously asked about water-based foaming and other cull methods such VSD, an AVMA spokesperson said depopulation decisions were difficult and \u201cand contingent upon several factors, such as the species and number of animals involved, available means of animal restraint, safety of personnel, and other considerations such as availability of equipment, agents and personnel\u201d. European campaigners said firefighting foam causes prolonged suffering. Although risks of similar livestock culls appear low in Europe so far, welfare group, Compassion in World Farming advised using foam that contains nitrogen gas because death is faster. A 2019 European Food Safety Authority journal report said it did not find water-based or firefighting foam acceptable because \u201cdeath due to drowning in fluids or suffocation by occlusion of the airways\u201d is not seen as \u201ca humane method for killing animals, including poultry\u201d.",

Although Trump\u2019s official physician has said he was in \u201cvery good health\u201d at his last official checkup, the president is 73 and his recorded weight would put him in a BMI category of \u201cclinically obese\u201d. So why is Trump taking it? Despite there being no conclusive body of evidence that it can be effective when used to prevent contracting coronavirus, the president apparently decided in conversation with the White House physician Sean P Conley that it was worth the risks. \u201cAfter numerous discussions he and I had for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks,\u201d Conley wrote.

      "bodyText": "Good evening, here are the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Josh Taylor and it is Tuesday 19 May. Australian death toll rises to 100 A 93-year-old woman at Newmarch House who had been diagnosed with Covid-19 died, taking Australia\u2019s Covid-19 death toll to 100. She is the 19th resident of the Sydney aged care home to die after testing positive for coronavirus. Qantas prepares return to domestic travel Qantas is preparing to return to domestic flights from 12 June, with more safety measures put in place, including contactless check-in, hand sanitiser at departure gates, and masks provided on board. The decision around maintaining flight capacity has been met with criticism from infectious disease experts. China puts tariffs on Australian barley China has put punitive tariffs of more than 80% on barley imports from Australia as more than 110 countries backed a push for an international coronavirus inquiry. The agriculture minister, David Littleproud, claimed vindication for the support for the inquiry. \u201cSince 1980, two pandemics have been linked to wildlife wet markets and a further two linked to unsustainable wildlife practices \u2013 this is acknowledgment we need to work globally to protect us from these risks. \u201cWe have long known about the risks associated with wildlife wet markets and the potential for pandemics they pose but they also are a risk to agriculture and food security.\u201d The Chinese embassy in Canberra said Australia claiming vindication for the motion China ultimately supported was a \u201cjoke\u201d. Victoria rakes in over $8m in fines More than 5,600 fines related to breaches of public health orders have been issued in Victoria, adding up to over $8m. That came in response to close to 70,000 calls to the police assistance line related to alleged breaches. Victoria police have committed to publishing more information on the fines, including the local government area where the fine was issued. The justice department was unaware of whether any fines had been challenged in court. Union demands protection for public transport workers The union representing bus workers in Sydney has said it cannot rule out strike action if the increase in passenger numbers due to the easing of Covid-19 restrictions threatens drivers\u2019 safety. Free childcare days are numbered The education minister, Dan Tehan, has indicated that the childcare subsidy will not be around much longer. He claimed the policy a success because 99% of centres are still operating and said the government is consulting the sector \u201cto make sure any changes will see the sector continue to thrive\u201d. Tehan said \u201cno decision\u201d had been taken on ending free childcare but \u201cif demand continues to increase at the levels we\u2019re seeing it, we have to understand that this system was put in place to deal with falling demand\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s done its job \u2026 Now we\u2019ve got to help the sector dealing with increasing demand and, as we know, the old system was working effectively.\u201d The government is also refusing to release a full report on the operation of the childcare subsidy scheme claiming the document is cabinet in confidence. Ros Baxter, the deputy secretary of early childhood and child care at the education department, says the program is on track to cost the $1.6bn estimated for the 12 weeks from 6 April to 28 June.

The expense of skiing is still a major barrier, as is a long-standing trope that \u201cblack people don\u2019t ski\u201d, they say. \u201cPeople are still very surprised,\u201d Clay of the reactions he gets when people find out that he\u2019s a veteran skier. \u201cWhenever someone asks, \u2018Do black people ski?\u2019 I point them to the National Brotherhood of Skiers and say, \u2018Why don\u2019t you come out here and join us?\u2019 It\u2019s a large country, there are a lot of people, and we haven\u2019t touched them all.\u201d \u201cThose boundaries were formed by history,\u201d Finley echoes, \u201cand now we\u2019ve got to reach beyond them.\u201d",

Lately, the Wisconsin supreme court seems to be doing its level best to make its state qualify for \u201cfailed\u201d status. Multiple decisions have both undermined the government\u2019s legitimacy and endangered the people.</p> <p>First, there was the primary. Because voting in person is clearly risky during a pandemic, several states delayed their primaries to make sure everyone was able to mail in a ballot instead of having to go to a polling place. Not so Wisconsin. The state\u2019s Democratic governor signed an executive order for an all mail-in election but was thwarted by the Republican legislature. Then the governor issued an order postponing the election. Republicans challenged it, and the Wisconsin supreme court sided with them. The primary went forward, but was a disaster: there were \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/long-lines-form-in-milwaukee-as-wisconsin-proceeds-with-elections-under-court-order/2020/04/07/93727b34-78c7-11ea-b6ff-597f170df8f8_story.html\">long lines</a> in Milwaukee, where only five polling places in the whole city were open\u201d and more than 50 people appear to have <a href=\"https://time.com/5829264/wisconsin-primary-coronavirus/\">contracted coronavirus</a> as a result. Ensuring that people can vote without risking their lives is a basic duty of government, one at which Wisconsin failed.</p> <p>But the Wisconsin supreme court\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/wisconsin-lockdown-ruling-supreme-court-republicans\">latest decision</a> is even worse. The conservative majority overturned the state\u2019s \u201cstay-at-home\u201d order, immediately leading bars to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/15/wisconsin-bars-coronavirus-stay-at-home-order\">flooded with patrons</a>. Even as public health officials stress the danger in suddenly lifting restrictions, justices presented it as a freedom issue, with one <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/us/coronavirus-wisconsin-supreme-court.html\">writing</a> that the \u201ccomprehensive claim to control virtually every aspect of a person\u2019s life is something we normally associate with a prison, not a free society governed by the rule of law\u201d. Public opinion is <a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2020/0511/Poll-Most-Americans-disapprove-of-anti-lockdown-protests\">generally against</a> the anti-lockdown protests, but if a conservative minority has power, the \u201cletting a deadly virus spread unchecked = freedom\u201d perspective will triumph.</p> <p>Courts are the least democratic branch of government to begin with; judges are like robed \u201cphilosopher kings\u201d with the power to overturn measures overwhelmingly favored by the people. (Sometimes that\u2019s a good thing, but decisions as to what to let stand and what to overturn are <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2018/06/how-the-supreme-court-pretends-to-be-reasonable\">almost always political</a>.) Once a single party dominates at court, it simply has veto power over the entire democratic process.</p> <p>The court\u2019s conservative majority has shown no hesitation in imposing its ideology on the state. As Akela Lacy <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/04/03/wisconsin-supreme-court-election/\">reported</a> in the Intercept, they have been denying the rights of unionized workers, ruling consistently against criminal defendants, and even overturning a rule banning people from carrying weapons on public buses.</p> <p>Wisconsin\u2019s Republicans have succeeded in capturing power in the state even without having to capture popular approval. As Michael Li of the Brennan Center <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/gerrymandering-meets-coronavirus-wisconsin\">documents</a>, the state has been heavily gerrymandered, meaning Republicans can exercise power without having to win majority support:</p> <p><em>\u201c[G]errymandered maps make it virtually impossible for them to ever lose their legislative majority.

In fact, Wisconsin\u2019s maps are so gerrymandered that Republicans can win close to a supermajority of house seats even with a minority of the vote. <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/Whitford-Opinion112116.pdf\">Analyses</a> of the maps in the lawsuit challenging the maps showed that Republicans are a lock to win 60</em><em>% of statehouse seats even if they win just 48% of the vote.\u201d</em></p> <p>In a supposedly democratic country, this should be an outrage. How can a government claim legitimacy if it does not require the people\u2019s support? But this is true far beyond Wisconsin. Republican rule is minority rule; as we know, thanks to our archaic electoral college system Donald Trump, like George W Bush, was able to win the election without winning the most votes, and the undemocratic Senate is Republican-dominated. The Republican agenda is <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/09/republican-memo-admits-voters-oppose-republican-policies.html\">unpopular</a>, meaning that in order to impose it, institutions have to be crafted that will prevent the population from exercising its will. The easier it is for the masses to participate, the more difficult it is for Republicans to protect the 1%, who really should be winning exactly 1% of the vote. (Donald Trump admitted that if voting were easy enough Republicans would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/trump-republican-party-voting-reform-coronavirus\">never win another election</a>.)</p> <p>What respect do people owe a government that cannot protect them and cannot claim democratic legitimacy?

      "bodyText": "Dan Tehan has suggested the days of free childcare are numbered, as a return to the old subsidy model will be needed to keep centres viable as Australians return to work. The education minister told Radio National on Tuesday a new report on the free model showed it had \u201cdone its job\u201d during the Covid-19 pandemic but will need to change. The comments come as new figures tabled by the education department to the Covid-19 response Senate inquiry on Tuesday, show just one in five Victorian independent schools and one in four non-government schools Australia-wide put their hand up for early funding, a rejection of Dan Tehan\u2019s plan to incentivise a return to in-classroom learning. On Tuesday an education department report found that a quarter of childcare centres found the free childcare system \u2013 due to conclude at the end of June \u2013 had not helped them remain financially viable. Education department officials have blocked the release of the full report, claiming cabinet and commercial confidentiality. Tehan claimed success because 99% of centres are still operating and said the government is consulting the sector \u201cto make sure any changes will see the sector continue to thrive\u201d. Tehan said \u201cno decision\u201d had been taken on ending free childcare but \u201cif demand continues to increase at the levels we\u2019re seeing it, we have to understand that this system was put in place to deal with falling demand\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s done its job \u2026 Now we\u2019ve got to help the sector dealing with increasing demand and, as we know, the old system was working effectively.\u201d Tehan noted demand is increasing because children are going back to school and parents are going back to work as restrictions ease, and spruiked the old subsidy system which ensured \u201c73% of families paid no more than $5 an hour \u2026 and it was working\u201d. Tehan also held out the possibility of more funding for non-government schools. He revealed the federal government is considering \u201cmodifications\u201d to the new funding system \u2013 which considers parents\u2019 income \u2013 and \u201cwe\u2019re also examining some of the loadings as well\u201d. On 29 April the education minister offered independent and Catholic schools to bring forward up to 25% of their funding if they met conditions to return to school in term 2 and aim for 50% attendance by 1 June. The initiative was largely superseded by states announcing a return to in-classroom learning as health results improved. The New South Wales government phased in a return to school from 11 May, with all classrooms to be reopened by 25 May, and Victorian schools will return from 26 May with all grades back by 9 June. The Victorian education minister and independent schools were fierce critics of the incentive, arguing the federal government was using taxpayer money to force schools to ignore the advice at the time of the Victorian chief health officer not to attend in-person. The education department figures show that 827 non-government schools nationwide said they would reopen by 1 June, with 678, or 24% requesting early funding. Some 809 schools declared they had a plan to achieve 50% school attendance by that date, with 667 or 23% asking for early funding. Catholic schools largely rejected the offer \u2013 with none claiming the payment in any state or territory except the Northern Territory and South Australia. About two-thirds of independent schools complied with the conditions in New South Wales, but in Victoria just one-third met the conditions and one-fifth asked for early payment. On Tuesday, education department officials told the Covid-19 response Senate inquiry that schools will only need to declare they have plans to boost attendance, and will not need to prove they achieve a 50% attendance rate. Alex Gordon, the deputy secretary for schools, said as the program simply brings forward funding due in July it was judged a \u201clow risk\u201d so schools need only \u201cprovide assurance that they have a plan\u201d to qualify. Education officials also confirmed that the government\u2019s $18bn funding guarantee for universities and promotion of a shift towards short courses does not boost universities\u2019 funding. Rob Heferen, the deputy secretary for higher education, said the benefit of the guarantee is that universities will receive federal funding even if domestic enrolments drop, while the \u201cflexibility\u201d to offer short courses instead of longer bachelor degrees will be \u201cextremely valuable\u201d to some universities. Heferen acknowledges that universities are experiencing \u201cextreme\u201d pressures, but argued their financial position is \u201cpretty solid\u201d because many have large cash reserves and international student enrolments had held up in semester one. Just one-fifth of international students, about 120,000, were unable to come to Australia due to Covid-19, although universities anticipate enrolments will fall away in the second semester before recovering in 2021 or 2022, he said. Heferen confirmed that after a series of changes to jobkeeper rules no universities had qualified for the $1,500 fortnightly wage subsidy, despite being eligible. But he defended the \u201ccouple of variations\u201d to the rules affecting universities, arguing that a \u201cquirk in the GST rules\u201d would have meant universities could exclude government revenues to reach the threshold for downturn in revenue. A change to force universities to count revenue over six months \u2013 not one month like other businesses \u2013 was designed to prevent the drop in international enrolments \u201ccrunched up\u201d in a particular month allowing universities to meet the threshold. Labor\u2019s education spokeswoman, Tanya Plibersek, said the universities relief package \u201cdoesn\u2019t include a dollar of extra funding\u201d for \u201cthe 20,000 short courses announced by Scott Morrison with great fanfare\u201d. Liberal deputy chair, James Paterson, rejected Labor\u2019s claim that universities had been \u201cabandoned\u201d by the government.",

It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The requirement to keep 2 metres distance between people means only 50 MPs can attend the chamber in person, while up to 120 can join proceedings remotely via Zoom.

The app which was due to be released in mid-May following its trial on the Isle of Wight is now expected in the \u201ccoming weeks\u201d the minister said. \u201cI\u2019m not aware that\u2019s been set as a condition that\u2019s necessary for the phased reopening of primary schools,\u201d she told BBC Breakfast. \u201cI think it is better to get the app as good as we can make it rather than rush out an app and have to change it. \u201cSo it\u2019s important that that trial, that pilot in the Isle of Wight, is allowed to run to its full length that\u2019s needed, rather than perhaps the target deadline that the health secretary has set.\u201d The government has recruited 21,000 contact tracers as part of its test, track and trace strategy and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, had previously committed to the NHS app being ready for the rest of England in the middle of this month. Reception, year one and year six are due back in smaller class sizes in schools on 1 June, which has prompted significant concern from teaching unions over staff safety. The minister said the app is only one element of the tracing system the government is developing when it was suggested on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that it may be needed to give people confidence to return to work and school. \u201cIn terms of the app it\u2019s fair to say that we\u2019ve announced that we will get that out as soon as possible but it\u2019s important on the app \u2013 and it\u2019s only one element of the tracing \u2013 is that we make sure we get it right,\u201d she said. The \u00a3625 NHS surcharge that migrant workers from outside the European Economic Area must pay, even if they work for the NHS, and paid on top of visa fees, is correct in principle, Coffey told Sky News. There has been criticism that foreign care workers helping with the coronavirus outbreak still face the charge, which is rising from \u00a3400 to \u00a3625 this autumn.

But the pandemic \u2013 and the city\u2019s homeless policies during the pandemic \u2013 helped create a perfect storm within the neighborhood\u2019s 35 blocks. In order to be able to enforce social distancing guidelines, San Francisco\u2019s overcrowded homeless shelters drastically reduced their capacity. The city made hotel rooms available to homeless people, but only those who had tested positive for the virus or ranked among the most vulnerable.<strong> </strong>Many unhoused people suddenly had no other choice but to take to the streets, some fortunate enough with tents and others making do with what they could find. Amid a lack of testing, it\u2019s unclear how widespread the virus is in the neighborhood, among the housed and unhoused.</p> <p>\u201cI really don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d said Roger Moussa, 51, who has been sleeping on the streets since his shelter bed reservation ran out a month ago. \u201cI feel completely helpless. I have nowhere to go, and every other night I get robbed.\u201d</p> <p>Tents have sprung up throughout San Francisco\u2019s 49 sq miles since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, but in the Tenderloin, the number of tents had exploded by 285% \u2013 268 tents total. Neighborhood residents believe this to be an undercount, with some tallying 432 tents as of last week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8f5eb10a0de73c94342de4d1ea0a2db225069ae3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f5eb10a0de73c94342de4d1ea0a2db225069ae3/0_0_3996_2664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018This is not a way for people to live, especially now,\u201d said Kathy Looper, owner of the Cadillac Hotel in the Tenderloin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This is not a way for people to live, especially now,\u201d said Kathy Looper, owner of the Cadillac Hotel in the Tenderloin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Chiu/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is not a way for people to live, especially now, and the city is not providing any solution,\u201d Looper said. \u201cThey herded everyone into this one neighborhood and said it\u2019s OK, but it\u2019s not OK. They created their own Warsaw ghetto.\u201d</p> <p>Several unhoused people said they weren\u2019t trying to make life difficult for the housed Tenderloin residents. Many have community ties, with some living in the supportive housing offered there before becoming homeless again. Given the option, most of them wouldn\u2019t be sleeping on the sidewalk; they didn\u2019t have a choice.</p> <p>\u201cI tried to go into the men\u2019s shelter but they said the corona had came out,\u201d said Abdull Best, 25. \u201cYou can\u2019t get into a new shelter while it\u2019s quarantined. No new residents during the quarantine.\u201d</p> <p>The city has responded with a Tenderloin Neighborhood Plan that includes more public restrooms and hand-washing stations. It <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/05/14/855588754/san-francisco-shifts-from-trashing-homeless-camps-to-sanctioning-them-amid-covid\">launched</a> several \u201csafe-sleeping sites,\u201d city-sanctioned encampments with access to some amenities and services and identified 13 of the hardest hit blocks for cleaning and clearing. \u201cI want to really recognize that this is going to be a targeted plan, a challenging one, and we are set to be as aggressive as we can in implementing it so that the people in the community can see a difference,\u201d said Mayor London Breed.</p> <p>For many in the neighborhood, it\u2019s yet another empty gesture in a long history of empty gestures. Residents have grown accustomed to being overlooked by the powers that be. Located just three blocks from the towering beaux-arts majesty of city hall, the neighborhood has long been written off as an open-air drug market and homeless hub. Tourists are warned to avoid it. Fox News and conservative media relish in attacking it, splashing live shots of feces and syringes on the pavement as proof of the city\u2019s failings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bacb72688175383a37a2c6c4326329509b07122d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bacb72688175383a37a2c6c4326329509b07122d/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"San Francisco\u2019s first sanctioned tent encampment is in a fenced-off space near city hall with spaces marked for social distancing and some amenities.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">San Francisco\u2019s first sanctioned tent encampment is in a fenced-off space near city hall with spaces marked for social distancing and some amenities.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it\u2019s also one of the <a href=\"https://default.sfplanning.org/publications_reports/SF_NGBD_SocioEconomic_Profiles/2012-2016_ACS_Profile_Neighborhoods_Final.pdf\">most diverse</a> and densely populated communities in the city: 31% of the neighborhood is Asian, 23% is Latino and 10% is black. In San Francisco, a city with the most <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/9/18537122/billionaire-study-wealthx-san-francisco\">billionaires per capita</a> in the world, the median household income is $104,552. In the Tenderloin, where 30% of the neighborhood is in poverty, the median household income is $23,513.</p> <p>A term frequently used with the Tenderloin is \u201ccontainment zone\u201d. For years, residents have viewed this as the city\u2019s tactic in dealing with the neighborhood. \u201cThere\u2019s inherent pressure in urban life, with homelessness and drug dealing and mental illness \u2013 just urban realities,\u201d explained David Faigman, dean and chancellor of the UC Hastings Law School, which is located in the neighborhood. \u201cAnd if we can keep it in the Tenderloin, we\u2019re not going to see it in the Marina. We\u2019re not going to see it in Pacific Heights.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this month, UC Hastings filed a federal lawsuit against the city, joined by the merchants and property association and some other residents. The lawsuit seeks to compel the city to clear the sidewalks and clean the streets by providing healthy and safe options for the unhoused population in the encampments.</p> <p>\u201cWe could have brought a lawsuit 10, 15, 20, 25 years ago and we probably could have had standing,\u201d Faigman said. \u201cWe would have had neighbors who were fed up with what they were dealing with. But what they\u2019re dealing with now is at such a much more profound level. We have a virus that could possibly be deadly, and we don\u2019t know how prevalent the pandemic is out on the streets.

      "bodyText": "On the streets of San Francisco\u2019s Tenderloin neighborhood, social distancing does not exist. Tents and blankets cram the narrow sidewalks, even set right against sun-faded buildings. Occupants of these encampments loll on the pavement nearby, hyper cognizant they risk losing their belongings if they leave. Makeshift shelters and overflowing carts are in constant conflict with pedestrians for six feet of space. Passing through sometimes means pushing through crowds, weaving around camp debris, blankets and waste as flies bounce off face coverings. In the Tenderloin, social distancing does not exist because many of the neighborhood\u2019s unhoused residents have nowhere else to go. Weeks into the global coronavirus pandemic, as San Francisco prepares to cautiously reopen, the historically low-income and underserved neighborhood once again finds itself experiencing a very different reality than the rest of the city. While other parts of the Bay Area look like \u201couttakes from The Good Place\u201d, the Tenderloin \u201cisn\u2019t even third world at this point\u201d, said Kathy Looper, owner of the Cadillac Hotel in the neighborhood. \u201cI\u2019ve been to third world countries that look better than this,\u201d Looper said. The Tenderloin has long been a refuge for some of San Francisco\u2019s most vulnerable, displaying a vicious cycle of homelessness, addiction and mental illness in the heart of the city. But the pandemic \u2013 and the city\u2019s homeless policies during the pandemic \u2013 helped create a perfect storm within the neighborhood\u2019s 35 blocks. In order to be able to enforce social distancing guidelines, San Francisco\u2019s overcrowded homeless shelters drastically reduced their capacity. The city made hotel rooms available to homeless people, but only those who had tested positive for the virus or ranked among the most vulnerable. Many unhoused people suddenly had no other choice but to take to the streets, some fortunate enough with tents and others making do with what they could find. Amid a lack of testing, it\u2019s unclear how widespread the virus is in the neighborhood, among the housed and unhoused. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d said Roger Moussa, 51, who has been sleeping on the streets since his shelter bed reservation ran out a month ago. \u201cI feel completely helpless. I have nowhere to go, and every other night I get robbed.\u201d Tents have sprung up throughout San Francisco\u2019s 49 sq miles since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, but in the Tenderloin, the number of tents had exploded by 285% \u2013 268 tents total. Neighborhood residents believe this to be an undercount, with some tallying 432 tents as of last week. \u201cThis is not a way for people to live, especially now, and the city is not providing any solution,\u201d Looper said. \u201cThey herded everyone into this one neighborhood and said it\u2019s OK, but it\u2019s not OK. They created their own Warsaw ghetto.\u201d Several unhoused people said they weren\u2019t trying to make life difficult for the housed Tenderloin residents. Many have community ties, with some living in the supportive housing offered there before becoming homeless again. Given the option, most of them wouldn\u2019t be sleeping on the sidewalk; they didn\u2019t have a choice. \u201cI tried to go into the men\u2019s shelter but they said the corona had came out,\u201d said Abdull Best, 25. \u201cYou can\u2019t get into a new shelter while it\u2019s quarantined. No new residents during the quarantine.\u201d The city has responded with a Tenderloin Neighborhood Plan that includes more public restrooms and hand-washing stations. It launched several \u201csafe-sleeping sites,\u201d city-sanctioned encampments with access to some amenities and services and identified 13 of the hardest hit blocks for cleaning and clearing. \u201cI want to really recognize that this is going to be a targeted plan, a challenging one, and we are set to be as aggressive as we can in implementing it so that the people in the community can see a difference,\u201d said Mayor London Breed. For many in the neighborhood, it\u2019s yet another empty gesture in a long history of empty gestures. Residents have grown accustomed to being overlooked by the powers that be. Located just three blocks from the towering beaux-arts majesty of city hall, the neighborhood has long been written off as an open-air drug market and homeless hub. Tourists are warned to avoid it. Fox News and conservative media relish in attacking it, splashing live shots of feces and syringes on the pavement as proof of the city\u2019s failings. But it\u2019s also one of the most diverse and densely populated communities in the city: 31% of the neighborhood is Asian, 23% is Latino and 10% is black. In San Francisco, a city with the most billionaires per capita in the world, the median household income is $104,552. In the Tenderloin, where 30% of the neighborhood is in poverty, the median household income is $23,513. A term frequently used with the Tenderloin is \u201ccontainment zone\u201d. For years, residents have viewed this as the city\u2019s tactic in dealing with the neighborhood. \u201cThere\u2019s inherent pressure in urban life, with homelessness and drug dealing and mental illness \u2013 just urban realities,\u201d explained David Faigman, dean and chancellor of the UC Hastings Law School, which is located in the neighborhood. \u201cAnd if we can keep it in the Tenderloin, we\u2019re not going to see it in the Marina. We\u2019re not going to see it in Pacific Heights.\u201d Earlier this month, UC Hastings filed a federal lawsuit against the city, joined by the merchants and property association and some other residents. The lawsuit seeks to compel the city to clear the sidewalks and clean the streets by providing healthy and safe options for the unhoused population in the encampments. \u201cWe could have brought a lawsuit 10, 15, 20, 25 years ago and we probably could have had standing,\u201d Faigman said. \u201cWe would have had neighbors who were fed up with what they were dealing with. But what they\u2019re dealing with now is at such a much more profound level. We have a virus that could possibly be deadly, and we don\u2019t know how prevalent the pandemic is out on the streets. You have people in wheelchairs, children and the elderly who need to maneuver around a population that may have a very high rate of Covid-19. \u201cThere has always been an underlying health crisis,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut now it\u2019s a true exigent emergency.\u201d To many in the neighborhood, the city\u2019s homelessness policies amid the pandemic have continued to institutionalize homelessness within the neighborhood borders, rather than try to solve the issue with housing. \u201cThe time they spent writing the plan they could have spent moving people into hotels or sanctioned encampments,\u201d said Randy Shaw, executive director of the Tenderloin Housing Clinic. And many recognize that nothing will change until those without shelter can safely get off the streets. \u201cThere is a literal plague sweeping the country and our city and we are only as safe and as protected as our most vulnerable residents,\u201d said local lawmaker Matt Haney, who represents the Tenderloin. The crisis unfolding in the Tenderloin has created light tension in the world of homeless outreach. Residents\u2019 demands for clearing tents and sweeping encampments can come across as anti-homeless, but many of those advocating for the measures work in homeless outreach. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re against homeless people \u2013 it\u2019s that \u201cno one should be in those tents\u201d, Shaw said. \u201cEveryone should agree they should either be in hotels or in supervised encampments. They shouldn\u2019t be on sidewalks in the Tenderloin.\u201d There needs to be concern for the housed residents of the Tenderloin as well, Shaw said, many of whom do not have the luxury to work from home and have to make their way through the crowded streets every day. \u201cThere\u2019s a level of despair in the Tenderloin that I\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cWhat does it say to these families that the city government will allow these conditions to proliferate right on the sidewalks? It sends a message that they\u2019re not valued at all.\u201d One week after the city announced its Tenderloin Neighborhood Plan, tents and makeshift structures still crammed the sidewalks, their occupants never too far away.

      "body": "<p>Mark Acasio says he and his gorilla suit are joining the Las Vegas Raiders this fall. Acasio, a long-time fan from Brentwood, California, known far and wide as Gorilla Rilla, has shelled out $3,500 for home-game tickets and $8,500 for a <a href=\"https://lasvegassun.com/news/2017/aug/24/faq-psls-personal-seat-licenses-raiders-stadium/\">personal-seat license</a> (PSL) for a front-row seat at Allegiant Stadium, the Raiders\u2019 posh new home.</p> <p>Acasio has not missed a Raiders\u2019 home game in 25 years. Just because the Raiders will now be a one-hour flight from his home instead of a one-hour drive, he is determined to stay loyal to the team and to his comrades moving to Vegas from the Black Hole, the NFL\u2019s most infamous cheering section, at dingy Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum.</p> <p>\u201cOn the other hand, many other friends of mine have not, and will not, step foot in Las Vegas,\u201d Acasio tells The Guardian.</p> <p>They won\u2019t because Las Vegas is not exactly around the corner from the Bay Area, and because tickets in the sections at Allegiant Stadium envisioned as a New Black Hole are about double what they were in Oakland \u2013 $218.75 in Vegas, up to $110 in Oakland. There was a PSL in Oakland, but as far as anyone can remember, it was not much more than $500.</p> <p>But that is only half of the issue. Oakland had the Raiders twice: from 1960 until 1982, when they moved to Los Angeles for 13 years, and then again from 1995 through last season. The Raiders won two Super Bowls in their first stint in Oakland and another in Los Angeles, but the second stay was pretty bleak, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Las_Vegas_Raiders_seasons\">with only one winning season since 2002</a>.</p> <p>Although they knew that Mark Davis, the Raiders\u2019 owner and son of Al Davis, the legendary former Raiders\u2019 coach and owner, had tried in vain for years to replace the obsolete Coliseum, many of the team\u2019s long-suffering fans were enraged that the team abandoned the Bay Area again \u2013 and that Davis was hardly nostalgic about Oakland.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/aug/11/oakland-raiders-move-las-vegas-nfl-fans-city-impact\">The Raiders helped unite the divisions in Oakland.

      "bodyText": "Mark Acasio says he and his gorilla suit are joining the Las Vegas Raiders this fall. Acasio, a long-time fan from Brentwood, California, known far and wide as Gorilla Rilla, has shelled out $3,500 for home-game tickets and $8,500 for a personal-seat license (PSL) for a front-row seat at Allegiant Stadium, the Raiders\u2019 posh new home. Acasio has not missed a Raiders\u2019 home game in 25 years. Just because the Raiders will now be a one-hour flight from his home instead of a one-hour drive, he is determined to stay loyal to the team and to his comrades moving to Vegas from the Black Hole, the NFL\u2019s most infamous cheering section, at dingy Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum. \u201cOn the other hand, many other friends of mine have not, and will not, step foot in Las Vegas,\u201d Acasio tells The Guardian. They won\u2019t because Las Vegas is not exactly around the corner from the Bay Area, and because tickets in the sections at Allegiant Stadium envisioned as a New Black Hole are about double what they were in Oakland \u2013 $218.75 in Vegas, up to $110 in Oakland. There was a PSL in Oakland, but as far as anyone can remember, it was not much more than $500. But that is only half of the issue. Oakland had the Raiders twice: from 1960 until 1982, when they moved to Los Angeles for 13 years, and then again from 1995 through last season. The Raiders won two Super Bowls in their first stint in Oakland and another in Los Angeles, but the second stay was pretty bleak, with only one winning season since 2002. Although they knew that Mark Davis, the Raiders\u2019 owner and son of Al Davis, the legendary former Raiders\u2019 coach and owner, had tried in vain for years to replace the obsolete Coliseum, many of the team\u2019s long-suffering fans were enraged that the team abandoned the Bay Area again \u2013 and that Davis was hardly nostalgic about Oakland. \u201cI have a football team, but it\u2019s going to be the Raiders,\u201d Wayne Deboe, a fan for 60 years and the president of the Oakland Raiders Booster Club, tells the Guardian. \u201cThey\u2019re called the Las Vegas Raiders now, but they\u2019ll always be just the Raiders to me.\u201d The Black Hole had consisted of four lower-deck sections at the Oakland Coliseum where fans dressed up in freaky silver-and-black outfits and loudly cheered the Raiders: \u201cpositive fanaticism\u201d. The Black Hole is also a global fan club with thousands of members. But the Black Hole is, well, let the club\u2019s website explain it: We are a STATE OF MIND. Our state of mind has united the entire Raiders Nation over the years. We have grown from a few friends to a worldwide family made up of generations of fans young and old, from all ethnicities, races, and sexes. If you bleed SILVER and BLACK, then we are connected and you are spiritually part of us. Rob Rivera, a resident of Hayward, California, who is the president and co-founder of the Black Hole, tells the Guardian, \u201cThe move has broken our hearts, pissed us off. They proved loyalty is a one-way street in the NFL.\u201d Deboe was not a Black Hole denizen: \u201cThey stand up too long for me,\u201d says Deboe, who is retired and lives in Castro Valley, California. But he feels burned, too.

      "bodyText": "Wildcat strikes, walkouts and protests over working conditions have erupted across the US throughout the coronavirus pandemic as \u201cessential\u201d workers have demanded better pay and safer working conditions. Labor leaders are hoping the protests can lead to permanent change. Norma Kennedy, an employee at an American Apparel clothing plant is one of those people. Kennedy along with dozens of other workers walked off her job in Selma, Alabama, on 23 April after two workers tested positive for coronavirus. The plant has remained open during the pandemic to manufacture face masks for a US army contract. \u201cWe left for our own protection,\u201d said Kennedy. \u201cBeforehand, management said if someone tested positive they would shut down and have the plant cleaned. When workers tested positive, they didn\u2019t want to shut it down. They\u2019re not really concerned about the workers.\u201d Working conditions, low pay and lack of safety protections have triggered protests throughout the pandemic as workers across various industries, including food service, meat processing, retail, manufacturing, transportation and healthcare have come together to protest about issues, many of which were apparent before the coronavirus. \u201cThere are no federal mandates or requirements to implement the social distancing guidance or anything else. It\u2019s only guidance and employers can choose to implement them or not,\u201d said Deborah Berkowitz, director of worker safety and health for the National Employment Law Project. \u201cAnd that is why, in an unprecedented way, they are walking out to bring public attention to the fact that their companies are not protecting their safety and health.\u201d Roberto Echiveste, a truck driver in El Paso, Texas, for 10 years, was one of hundreds of drivers who joined in a protest convoy through El Paso on Friday 1 May. During the pandemic, Echiveste and other drivers have seen their freight rates drop from $2-$2.50 per mile to as low as $0.50 per mile. \u201cI\u2019m losing money just to work. The last week I worked I paid $200 out of my own pocket just to get home,\u201d said Echiveste. \u201cI have to pay to work and truck brokers are keeping most of the cut. We have to pay on average $500 each time we fuel, insurance is around $1,000 per month, and parts for my truck are three to four times more expensive than a regular car part, and some drivers are still paying for the truck and trailer. On that alone, I pay over $2,300 per month.\u201d Echiveste said the protest was coordinated on Facebook, and he joined it with his brother, father and neighbor who are all truck drivers. Similar protests were held by truck drivers in southern California, Arizona, Sacramento, California, Lansing, Michigan, Washington DC and Chicago, Illinois, over decreased freight rates and working conditions during the pandemic. Fast-food workers with the Fight for $15 and a union campaign have organized one-day strikes and protests in California, Illinois, Florida, Missouri and Tennessee through the pandemic. Ieshia Townsend, a McDonald\u2019s worker in Chicago for five years, participated in one of the strikes and walked off the job in protest of lack of hazard pay, proper personal protective equipment, paid sick leave and lack of health insurance benefits. \u201cWorkers like me are going on strike because McDonald\u2019s and other billion-dollar corporations do not care about us as workers. They don\u2019t care if we\u2019re safe on the job, they don\u2019t care if we\u2019re sick on the job,\u201d said Townsend, who has also experienced significant cuts to her work schedule during the pandemic. McDonald\u2019s dismissed the strikes as \u201climited activity\u201d and noted they are granting 10% of pay earned in the month of May in bonuses to workers at corporate owned stores, which make up only 5% of McDonald\u2019s restaurants. On 29 April, Braden Lauder, a shift manager for one year at an Arby\u2019s in Morris, Illinois went on strike with co-workers over the lack of hazard pay, lack of personal protective equipment, and understaffing. \u201cWe\u2019re understaffed, underpaid and underappreciated,\u201d said Lauder. He makes $12 an hour as a shift manager, and noted several of his co-workers make under $10 an hour. \u201cAt the same time, I\u2019m a shift manager so I do the paperwork for the sales that we pull each day and I know for a fact that we\u2019re busier now than we have been at any other point since I started almost a year ago.\u201d Arby\u2019s did not comment on the lack of hazard pay. \u201cThe safety of our team members and guests continues to be our top priority. This was an isolated incident that occurred at a franchised location, and we understand from the owner that all parties are engaged in an open dialogue,\u201d said an Arby\u2019s spokesperson. On 11 May, more than 100 Uber drivers in San Francisco held a caravan protest outside Uber headquarters following the company\u2019s virtual stockholder meeting to demand Uber drop funding for a ballot initiative to repeal Assembly Bill 5 (AB5), which took effect on 1 January 2020. AB5 classifies drivers as employees, granting drivers rights such as minimum wage and access to unemployment and workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Uber has devoted spending at least $30m on the ballot initiative to repeal the law. \u201cWe feel that money could be used to support drivers during this crisis,\u201d said Mekela Edwards, an Uber driver in the San Francisco, California, area for about one year. \u201cThis crisis, personally for me, just showed me how vulnerable I am as a driver.\u201d Edwards has been unable to work due to her doctor directing her to self-isolate during the pandemic. It took several weeks before she began receiving unemployment benefits and has yet to receive a response to her application for paid sick leave from Uber. \u201cI applied, I submitted the doctor\u2019s note, filled out the application, submitted my paperwork and have still not heard from Uber at all,\u201d Edwards added. Uber and American Apparel did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Sharon Block, executive director of the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School, said it was too early to tell if these worker actions around the US will have a lasting impact. \u201cThese walkouts show that essential workers don\u2019t want to be treated any more as if they were disposable. They are demanding a voice in how their companies respond to the pandemic. Having a voice is a life-and-death matter now more than ever,\u201d said Block. \u201cSuccess will be a matter of whether consumers and policymakers will be inspired by these workers\u2019 courage.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>On 1 April, just as Italy was at the peak of its coronavirus crisis, a man in a protective face mask approached a residential home for vulnerable old people in Foggia in the southern region of Puglia. He was not coming to help residents, however, but rather to blow the home\u2019s doors off with an explosive device.</p> <p>The incident, in which fortunately no one was injured, came as no surprise to the care home\u2019s owner, Luca Vigilante. He had only recently completed repairs following a bomb attack on the premises in January.</p> <p>The car of Vigilante\u2019s brother Christian was also blown up a few weeks before the January attack. The pair are key witnesses in two trials involving a criminal organisation that authorities believe is Italy\u2019s \u201cfifth mafia\u201d. </p> <p>Alongside Cosa Nostra in Sicily, the \u2019Ndrangheta in Calabria, the Camorra in Naples and the Sacra Corona Unita, investigators have identified an emerging Puglia-based crime organisation that has remained under their radar for several years.</p> <p>Judicial investigations had suggested mafia activity in northern Puglia, but confirmation from government authorities came after three car bombings in Foggia in January and the year\u2019s first murder, when gunmen on a scooter shot a 50-year-old man in his car. The violence in Foggia prompted the interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese, to send a team of anti-mafia investigators to Puglia.</p> <p>Signs of the criminal clan\u2019s activities predated these incidents. There was an average of one murder a week, one robbery a day and an extortion attempt every 48 hours in Foggia province in 2017 and 2018.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is a primitive mafia, one that feeds cadavers to pigs so as not to leave a trace</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe Foggia mafia is relatively young,\u201d the head prosecutor for the city, Ludovico Vaccaro, said. \u201cThe clans that make up this organisation have been embedded in this territory for at least 30 years. We cannot compare them to the historical Italian mafia groups like Cosa Nostra and \u2019Ndrangheta, but it is a mafia characterised by a high degree of aggression and violence. It is what I call a primitive mafia, one that feeds cadavers to pigs so as not to leave a trace. An unrefined mafia in its actions, and for this reason dangerous.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c334d3c8b89df91c36ffbd8f65abb47860ef7638\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c334d3c8b89df91c36ffbd8f65abb47860ef7638/0_481_6759_4058/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An aerial view of Foggia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An aerial view of Foggia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessio Mamo/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The mafia in Foggia province emerged in the late 1970s, when the head of the Neapolitan mafia and founder of the New Organised Camorra, Raffaele Cutolo, met a delegation of local criminals in Puglia with the goal of \u201chiring\u201d them into his organisation and extending his influence into the contraband trade in cigarettes in the Balkans.</p> <p>\u201cCutolo\u2019s plan failed shortly afterwards,\u201d said Giuseppe Volpe, a prosecutor and head of the anti-mafia district directorate of Bari. \u201cAn internal struggle ensued from which one autonomous criminal clan emerged victorious and gradually began infiltrating other areas of Puglia.\u201d</p> <p>Volpe said that after the January car bombings, media unaware of an independent mafia in Foggia province wrongly reported the attacks as the work of the Sacra Corona Unita, the so-called fourth mafia. \u201cBut that wasn\u2019t the case. We are witnessing what should be called a fifth mafia, independent of the Sacra Corona Unita,\u201d he said.</p> <p>At least three criminal sub-groups operate in the area around Foggia.

      "bodyText": "On 1 April, just as Italy was at the peak of its coronavirus crisis, a man in a protective face mask approached a residential home for vulnerable old people in Foggia in the southern region of Puglia. He was not coming to help residents, however, but rather to blow the home\u2019s doors off with an explosive device. The incident, in which fortunately no one was injured, came as no surprise to the care home\u2019s owner, Luca Vigilante. He had only recently completed repairs following a bomb attack on the premises in January. The car of Vigilante\u2019s brother Christian was also blown up a few weeks before the January attack. The pair are key witnesses in two trials involving a criminal organisation that authorities believe is Italy\u2019s \u201cfifth mafia\u201d. Alongside Cosa Nostra in Sicily, the \u2019Ndrangheta in Calabria, the Camorra in Naples and the Sacra Corona Unita, investigators have identified an emerging Puglia-based crime organisation that has remained under their radar for several years. Judicial investigations had suggested mafia activity in northern Puglia, but confirmation from government authorities came after three car bombings in Foggia in January and the year\u2019s first murder, when gunmen on a scooter shot a 50-year-old man in his car. The violence in Foggia prompted the interior minister, Luciana Lamorgese, to send a team of anti-mafia investigators to Puglia. Signs of the criminal clan\u2019s activities predated these incidents. There was an average of one murder a week, one robbery a day and an extortion attempt every 48 hours in Foggia province in 2017 and 2018. \u201cThe Foggia mafia is relatively young,\u201d the head prosecutor for the city, Ludovico Vaccaro, said. \u201cThe clans that make up this organisation have been embedded in this territory for at least 30 years. We cannot compare them to the historical Italian mafia groups like Cosa Nostra and \u2019Ndrangheta, but it is a mafia characterised by a high degree of aggression and violence. It is what I call a primitive mafia, one that feeds cadavers to pigs so as not to leave a trace. An unrefined mafia in its actions, and for this reason dangerous.\u201d The mafia in Foggia province emerged in the late 1970s, when the head of the Neapolitan mafia and founder of the New Organised Camorra, Raffaele Cutolo, met a delegation of local criminals in Puglia with the goal of \u201chiring\u201d them into his organisation and extending his influence into the contraband trade in cigarettes in the Balkans. \u201cCutolo\u2019s plan failed shortly afterwards,\u201d said Giuseppe Volpe, a prosecutor and head of the anti-mafia district directorate of Bari. \u201cAn internal struggle ensued from which one autonomous criminal clan emerged victorious and gradually began infiltrating other areas of Puglia.\u201d Volpe said that after the January car bombings, media unaware of an independent mafia in Foggia province wrongly reported the attacks as the work of the Sacra Corona Unita, the so-called fourth mafia. \u201cBut that wasn\u2019t the case. We are witnessing what should be called a fifth mafia, independent of the Sacra Corona Unita,\u201d he said. At least three criminal sub-groups operate in the area around Foggia. Besides the Societ\u00e0 Foggiana, which profits from extortion and drug-dealing, there is the Cerignola clan, known for its armoured car heists and cocaine smuggling, and another group active around the Gargano, on the spur of Italy\u2019s boot, whose bosses smuggle marijuana from the Balkans. Prosecutors came to realise over the years that they were dealing with a real mafia, but the authorities in Rome continued to underestimate the forgotten Foggia mob as a B-list organisation. Investigators say the recent wave of car bombs and arson attacks against business owners who refuse to pay protection money indicate that the new groups are in crisis. \u201cThey need cash,\u201d Volpe said. \u201cThey need to fill their coffers, and in order to do it they need to frighten people.\u201d As Italy deals with the disastrous economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic there is also evidence of the mafia, including in Puglia, exploiting the crisis by using stolen or extorted cash to purchase businesses that had to shut during the lockdown. \u201cI\u2019d be a liar if I told you I\u2019m not afraid,\u201d said Luca Vigilante. \u201cAnd I know that my life has changed and that it will be hard to get back to a normal one. But we cannot give up. They must not win.\u201d He and his brother are under police protection after reporting that two alleged mobsters had attempted to extort money from them. The Vigilantes are among the few businessmen to have rebelled against requests for protection money in Foggia, where prosecutors say that until a few years ago, more than 80% of shopkeepers paid up. A week before the second attack on the brothers, Daniela Marcone of the anti-mafia association Libera organised a protest in the streets of Foggia. Such anti-mafia fervour had not been seen since the murder of high-profile members of the Italian state in the 1990s. About 20,000 people took part. \u201cWe had to show people that they were not alone,\u201d said Marcone. \u201cWe had to show them the honest people of Foggia are on the side of the business community.\u201d Her father, Francesco Marcone, was killed in the stairwell of his apartment building in 1995. He was the director of the public tax agency and had been denouncing corruption and tax evasion for months. \u201cMy father\u2019s murder was a textbook mafia killing,\u201d Marcone said. \u201cSomeone even suspected that his killer was a member of the Sicilian mafia, which in those years had become a killing machine. For the authorities and for ordinary people alike, it seemed unthinkable that the mafia existed in Foggia.\u201d Francesco Marcone\u2019s murder, like many others, remains unresolved. The local mafia is believed to have killed 360 people in the Gargano area alone, and 80% of the killings are unsolved. Vaccaro points a finger at the state\u2019s crisis of legitimacy. The government decided without explanation in 2013 to remove eight judicial districts between courts and prosecution offices from the province of Foggia. Cutting the number of prosecutors and judges has resulted in trials that drag on for years. \u201cThe state is not much present in this area, which seems forsaken and forgotten,\u201d said Vaccaro. \u201cIf we want to fight [the Foggia mafia], we must convince people that the state is on their side, that it is close and prepared to support them. It\u2019s taken us 30 years to realise that we\u2019re dealing with a serious mafia group. Let\u2019s not take another 30 years to defeat it.\u201d",

Hong Kong blocks Tiananmen Square vigil with gathering ban Authorities in Hong have effectively banned the annual vigil by extending physical distancing measures for another 14 days.

      "body": "<p>Last Thursday evening, Transport for London came within hours of running out of money. What would have happened to the tube, the buses, the Overground and everything else TfL is responsible for if it had is unclear: I don\u2019t think it would have meant bailiffs walking off with DLR carriages, but who can say?</p> <p>Anyway, it didn\u2019t happen: at the last minute the office of the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, agreed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/14/london-faces-bus-and-train-cuts-without-urgent-funding\">\u00a31.6bn bailout package</a> with national government. In return, it had to accept two government officials on the TfL board, plus the inevitable <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/sadiq-khan-congestion-charge-tfl-bailout-government-a4441361.html\">public statements</a> about how this proved the mayor couldn\u2019t be trusted with money.</p> <p>In truth, it proves nothing of the sort: to hold Khan responsible you\u2019d need to be politically motivated, innumerate or both. And while this may look like a little local difficulty of no interest to those outside the capital, the affair highlights the Tory party\u2019s chronic inability to comprehend the difference between public services and private goods, and sends worrying signals for how the government might approach the question of public sector deficits across the country in months to come.</p> <p>To explain how we got here, you need to dig back into recent history. In 2015, the then chancellor and the then mayor of London agreed a new financial settlement for TfL. No longer would it receive \u00a3700m a year from the Treasury to keep its transport services running: instead, although it would be allowed to keep a <a href=\"http://content.tfl.gov.uk/tflmayorsbudget.pdf\">decent sum</a> from devolved business rates, it would be expected to pay its own way.</p> <p>And lo, it came to pass. Since 2018, most of TfL\u2019s income has come from advertising, congestion charging and, predominantly, fares. Because TfL is also responsible for a certain amount of road maintenance in London, this has led to the frankly <a href=\"https://www.citymetric.com/transport/london-roads-TfL-subsidy-vehicle-excise-duty-road-tax-3521\">ludicrous situation</a> in which tube passengers are subsidising drivers. The result, in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/70d657d5-2c48-430f-86bf-8badcd37d80a\">words</a> of the current mayor, was that London would be \u201cthe only transport system in western Europe that gets no government grant\u201d.</p> <p>Nonetheless, all this was working fine \u2013 ish \u2013 until the pandemic hit: at that point, people stopped travelling, fare income collapsed and TfL nearly ran out of money. Which brings us to the current situation. </p> <p>There are several things about this that are messed up. Let\u2019s start with the conditions attached to the bailout. Barring the use of Freedom Passes \u2013 which offer free travel for Londoners over 60 \u2013 from peak hours services may not be pretty, but you can see the logic, in terms of both spreading demand and minimising the chance of older people catching the coronavirus. (Freedom Pass holders who work have seemingly not been considered.)<strong> </strong>But promising to raise fares at a moment of economic crisis \u2013 when it\u2019s the poorest and most vulnerable who are least able to work from home \u2013 is not the action of a government that thinks we\u2019re all in this together. Meanwhile, requiring TfL to switch its \u201cstay at home\u201d messaging for the baffling, government-preferred \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/the-week-of-staying-alert-that-left-the-government-in-a-daze-coronavirus-boris-johnson\">stay alert</a>\u201d formulation is just plain weird.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s the way the Tories are turning their own incompetence into an assault on a popular Labour politician. Assorted government outriders have <a href=\"https://www.conservativehome.com/localgovernment/2020/05/shaun-bailey-bad-management-made-the-bailout-transport-for-london-necessary.html\">tried to blame</a> this mess on Khan\u2019s fare freeze, which has been estimated to cost TfL around \u00a3640m over four years. They have yet to explain how avoiding such a freeze would have plugged the gap caused by the pandemic, which, at \u00a3600m every month, is roughly 45 times larger. Perhaps Khan will now spin a fare increase that would have happened anyway as the result of Tory cruelty; but you can already see the contours of the \u201cLabour can\u2019t be trusted with money\u201d argument that still, somehow, resonates, even though the economy collapses every time we let the Tories anywhere near it.</p> <p>The really messed up thing about all this, though, is that the government seems genuinely to have believed that London transport should be self-funding. But millions of people use TfL services every day: they\u2019re as basic to the successful running of the city as the roads or the sewers, and without them London would grind to a halt. It makes little sense to force the public infrastructure that underwrites London\u2019s economy to \u201cbalance its books\u201d, as if it were a private company looking to make a profit.<strong> </strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/18/britain-trust-coronavirus-government-pandemic-public\">How can Britain trust this floundering crew of fibbers to tackle coronavirus? | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is telling that few major western cities have copied the UK capital\u2019s unusual transport funding model: the closest seem to be Manchester and <a href=\"https://www.citymetric.com/transport/cold-hard-truth-about-torontos-transport-network-3597\">Toronto</a>, both of which are also in trouble, and neither of which are nearly so dependent on their metros as London.

The power generated by clean energy projects eclipsed fossil fuels for the first time ever, making up almost half the electricity used to keep the lights on. As the UK emerges from the financial maelstrom of the coronavirus pandemic, analysts, economists and environmentalists argue that the renewable energy industry could \u2013 and should \u2013 play a greater role, powering a green economic recovery too. The companies harnessing energy from the sun, wind and sea hold the potential to spur the UK\u2019s economy by attracting billions in investment and creating thousands of green jobs across the UK\u2019s regions while accelerating Britain\u2019s climate ambitions. Britain\u2019s clean energy sector proved this point in the wake of the 2009 financial crisis and the Confederation of British Industry calculated that the green economy contributed a third of the UK\u2019s economic growth in 2010-11. Britain\u2019s traditional economic engines \u2013 the banks and financial services firms \u2013 had continued to flounder, leaving GDP growth struggling below 1% while the economic value of offshore wind climbed by almost 17% and the solar industry\u2019s growth was almost 7%. The CBI report concluded that the so-called \u201cchoice\u201d between going green or going for growth was a false one because green business was already on track to become a major pillar of Britain\u2019s future growth. \u201cAfter the last financial crisis, the UK\u2019s green economy contributed substantially to new fiscal growth, supporting tens of thousands of jobs and finding new export markets around the world,\u201d says Nathan Bennett of RenewableUK. \u201cOnce again, our industry will play a proactive role in getting the economy back on track, as we move out of lockdown. Renewables are a UK-wide opportunity to have a sustainable, forward-looking recovery and to boost productivity across the economy.\u201d Today, much of the risk shouldered by renewable energy investors a decade ago has fallen away alongside plummeting technology costs. The UK\u2019s commitment to pursuing a carbon-neutral economy by 2050 alongside its established financial support frameworks offer far more certainty to willing investors than in the past. The investment case for renewables is flattered further by the relative gloom shrouding investment opportunities elsewhere: fossil fuels have fallen from favour among a growing number of investors due to climate concerns and the collapse of global market prices for oil, gas and coal in recent weeks. Oil investors may have been able to count on returns on equity of about 25% when prices hovered at $100 a barrel, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, but today that figure is below 10% and falling. The returns on equity invested in offshore wind is 11%, and for solar it is 8% despite falling electricity bills. Economists believe the renewable energy industry\u2019s hard-fought financial clout combined with public policy support could create an economic and employment juggernaut capable of spurring the UK\u2019s post-pandemic recovery while tackling the climate crisis too. \u201cThe climate emergency has not gone away,\u201d says Bennett. \u201cIf anything, the Covid-19 pandemic has underlined the need to make sure our economy is sustainable and resilient in the long term.\u201d Globally renewable energy could power an economic recovery from Covid-19 by spurring global GDP gains of almost $100tn (\u00a380tn) between now and 2050, compared with a business-as-usual scenario, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena). Irena said the coronavirus outbreak had exposed \u201cthe deep vulnerabilities of the current system\u201d and urged governments to invest in renewable energy to kickstart economic growth and help meet climate targets. Keith Anderson, chief executive of Scottish Power, one of the UK\u2019s biggest renewable energy investors, says it is no overstatement to say that \u201cthe economic and environmental advantages of investment in a green recovery are aligned as never before\u201d. Scottish Power is poised to invest billions in the UK\u2019s renewable energy industry in the coming years, including an onshore wind renaissance after the government\u2019s U-turn on blocking financial support for onshore turbines. The investment plans mapped out by Scottish Power and other renewable energy giants have remained intact through the pandemic while oil majors have slashed billions from their spending plans and warned that job losses are likely later in the year. \u201cThe best thing about it is that you\u2019re investing for the next 40 years in clean energy,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole load of other infrastructure work you could do in the UK, but the thing about investing in renewables is that it is just as good at creating jobs and kickstarting the economy \u2013 but the added benefit is that you\u2019d be tackling climate change at the same time.\u201d The Social Market Foundation believes there could be long-term benefits for workers too. The thinktank called last week for the government to help train those left jobless by the looming financial recession to work in the low-carbon economy. The government could spur the economy, accelerate its climate ambitions and help kickstart social mobility, it said. The \u201cnet zero\u201d industries, which include clean energy, electricity networks, car-charging infrastructure and energy efficiency, could help provide new jobs for many of the 1.4 million people expected to be left unemployed following the pandemic. The SMF has estimated that in some parts of the country, the number of green jobs that need to be filled to meet the climate goal is equal to half the number of people who were unemployed before the coronavirus crisis. \u201cThere is a pressing need to provide better support for those who lose work in this crisis,\u201d says Kathryn Petrie, the SMF\u2019s chief economist. \u201cBut also an opportunity. A well-designed guarantee of work and training could protect people from lasting damage, support UK skills and support the greening of the economy.\u201d But the potential upsides could still slip away without decisive action to grasp the opportunity to reset the UK economy on a sustainable green foundation. The International Energy Agency\u2019s executive director, Fatih Birol, has called on governments to devise stimulus plans that put the green energy agenda at the heart of the economic recovery. Anderson says there is not a moment to lose. \u201cThis is our message to the government: now is the time to do it. Investors are very keen to push money this way, and into these projects. The UK has a fantastic opportunity to grab a huge slice of the world\u2019s renewable energy investment today. Now is the time.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Ovo Energy, Britain\u2019s second biggest energy supplier, is to cut 2,600 jobs and close offices as the coronavirus lockdown drives more customer services online.</p> <p>The decision comes just four months after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/10/ovo-gets-green-light-for-500m-sse-takeover-from-watchdog\">Ovo bought SSE\u2019s retail division for \u00a3500m</a>, instantly increasing its customer base from 1.5m to 5m homes.</p> <p>Announcing the cuts on Tuesday, Ovo said the Covid-19 pandemic had accelerated a shift in customer behaviour, with more people going online, which had permanently reduced the need for some functions and roles.</p> <p>The job losses will affect gas engineers, electricians, meter readersand call centre staff and the company will close its offices in Glasgow\u2019s Waterloo Street, Selkirk and Reading. Jobs are also expected to go at offices in Perth, Cumbernauld and Cardiff.</p> <p>About 80% of the cuts will come from the SSE business. The company expects about 1,000 jobs will be lost in Scotland and approximately 1,400 in Wales and England.</p> <p>The GMB union accused Ovo of betrayal, saying it had promised there would be no job losses after the takeover of SSE\u2019s retail business.</p> <p>Justin Bowden, a GMB senior organiser, said: \u201cCoronavirus outbreak or not, this is a massive betrayal of promises made to workers and politicians that the sale to Ovo would not result in job losses.</p> <p>Ovo denied it had made any assurances around jobs, and said the cuts would be made largely through voluntary redundancy over the course of this year.</p> <p>Stephen Fitzpatrick, the former banker and Conservative donor who founded Ovo and remains its chief executive, said: \u201cToday is a very difficult day.

      "bodyText": "Ovo Energy, Britain\u2019s second biggest energy supplier, is to cut 2,600 jobs and close offices as the coronavirus lockdown drives more customer services online. The decision comes just four months after Ovo bought SSE\u2019s retail division for \u00a3500m, instantly increasing its customer base from 1.5m to 5m homes. Announcing the cuts on Tuesday, Ovo said the Covid-19 pandemic had accelerated a shift in customer behaviour, with more people going online, which had permanently reduced the need for some functions and roles. The job losses will affect gas engineers, electricians, meter readersand call centre staff and the company will close its offices in Glasgow\u2019s Waterloo Street, Selkirk and Reading. Jobs are also expected to go at offices in Perth, Cumbernauld and Cardiff. About 80% of the cuts will come from the SSE business. The company expects about 1,000 jobs will be lost in Scotland and approximately 1,400 in Wales and England. The GMB union accused Ovo of betrayal, saying it had promised there would be no job losses after the takeover of SSE\u2019s retail business. Justin Bowden, a GMB senior organiser, said: \u201cCoronavirus outbreak or not, this is a massive betrayal of promises made to workers and politicians that the sale to Ovo would not result in job losses. Ovo denied it had made any assurances around jobs, and said the cuts would be made largely through voluntary redundancy over the course of this year. Stephen Fitzpatrick, the former banker and Conservative donor who founded Ovo and remains its chief executive, said: \u201cToday is a very difficult day. What should have been a much longer process to digitise the SSE business and integrate it with Ovo has been accelerated due to the impact of the coronavirus. \u201cWe are seeing a rapid increase in customers using digital channels to engage with us, and in our experience, once customers start to engage differently they do not go back. As a result, we are expecting a permanent reduction in demand for some roles, whilst other field-based roles are also heavily affected.\u201d Since the Covid-19 lockdown began, Ovo\u2019s smart meter installations have fallen 92% and home service engineering work has dropped by 69%. Meter reading has completely stopped since March. The company has furloughed 3,400 staff who were unable to do their jobs because of the pandemic, including meter readers. Before the acquisition, SSE had moved some call centre jobs to South Africa and the Philippines and had planned to move a further 700 roles to South Africa, but Ovo has suspended the offshoring programme. Bowden said: \u201cWhilst we were able to save 700 jobs from offshoring for now, this is still 2,600 good UK jobs from a company that is busy soaking up taxpayers\u2019 money from the furlough scheme.

      "bodyText": "The failure to explain why the government took the significant and consequential decision to drop community testing at the start of the coronavirus outbreak is unacceptable, MPs have said in a damning letter to Boris Johnson. The science and technology committee\u2019s investigation into the early handling of the pandemic calls for Public Health England to explain the scientific reasoning behind abandoning mass testing to concentrate instead on testing limited numbers in its own laboratories. The letter to the prime minister urges the government to learn from its experience. It states: \u201cThe decision to pursue an approach of initially concentrating testing in a limited number of laboratories and to expand them gradually, rather than an approach of surging capacity through a large number of available public sector, research institute, university and private sector labs is one of the most consequential made during this crisis. \u201cFrom it followed the decision on 12 March to cease testing in the community and retreat to testing principally within hospitals. \u201cAmongst other consequences, it meant that residents in care homes \u2013 even those displaying Covid-19 symptoms \u2013 and care home workers could not be tested at a time when the spread of the virus was at its most rampant. \u201cThe failure of PHE to publish the evidence on which its testing policy was based is unacceptable for a decision that may have had such significant consequences.\u201d The letter also criticises the government for a lack of transparency on the scientific advice it receives, and calls for a full list of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) participants to be updated regularly, including with the number of meetings they attended. One investigation finding was that \u201cthe transparency around scientific advice has not always been as clear as it should have been\u201d, and the length of time it has taken to publish scientific papers on the government\u2019s website was highlighted. All but two of the Sage members\u2019 names have been published, and the committee suggested those who are not identified should instead disclose the disciplines that they work in, to give greater transparency around decision making. The MPs also found that it has not been clear why a nationwide sampling study for the virus could not have been instigated by the government at a much earlier stage. They suggest that had this been in operation even a month earlier, many of the decisions to be made on social distancing could have been made earlier and with more detailed data. The UK\u2019s national statistician, Sir Ian Diamond, told the committee he had been asked to set a study up on 17 April \u2013 more than three weeks after the country went into lockdown. The committee chair, Greg Clark, said the findings and recommendations were devised to be constructive. The MP said: \u201cGreater transparency around scientific advice; putting capacity in place in advance of need, such as in testing and vaccines; collecting more data earlier and learning from other countries\u2019 approaches are some of the early lessons of this pandemic that are relevant to further decisions that will need to be taken during the weeks and months ahead. \u201cWe hope the government will act on these recommendations which are offered in a constructive spirit based on the evidence we have taken so far.\u201d The letter to Johnson follows six public evidence sessions.

If reality matches its vision \u2013 public money not for unsustainable farming practices but for public goods, such as preventing flooding, improving soils or boosting biodiversity \u2013 nature conservation could be transformed. \u201cA lot of the \u00a33.4bn does need to go to biodiversity and the environment,\u201d said Shardlow, who hopes that the new public mood will be matched by increased determination within Defra to resist further cuts. \u201cDefra were very compliant last time,\u201d said Shardlow. \u201cI hope they\u2019ve learned their lesson.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>As the lockdown restrictions begin to be eased across the UK, more workers are being asked to return to the workplace.</p> <p>The government has said that employees should only be asked to go back if they cannot do their job from home, so if you can, your employer should not be asking you to travel in to work.</p> <p>If you do need to go to your workplace, your employer is obliged to make sure you will be safe there. Employment lawyer <a href=\"https://www.mattgingell.com/\">Matt Gingell</a> says: \u201cEmployers have a general duty to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare of all of their employees.\u201d</p> <p>Here\u2019s a guide to your rights if your employer wants you back in the workplace.</p> <h2>How much notice should I be given that I have to return?</h2> <p>\u201cIf employees are unable to work from home, employers can ask employees to return to work and, technically, no notice is required,\u201d says Gingell.</p> <p>Solicitor and consumer law expert <a href=\"https://www.jajsolicitors.co.uk/people/\">Gary Rycroft</a> says there is no notice period written into law \u201cbut giving at least 48 hours\u2019 notice should allow either side to have discussions and air any concerns or even official \u2018grievances\u2019\u201d.</p> <p>The advisory group Acas says employers need to check if there are any arrangements in place with unions or similar about notice. It advises: \u201cEmployees and workers should be ready to return to work at short notice, but employers should be flexible where possible.\u201d</p> <p>So while your employer could ask you to return straight away, a good employer would understand if there were things you needed to put in place first, and give you chance to do so.</p> <h2>What if I was furloughed?</h2> <p>When you were furloughed your employer should have outlined what would happen when it wanted you to go back to work, and this may have a clause saying that you have to return as soon as you are asked.</p> <p>\u201cThe termination of the furlough agreement and when an employee will be expected to return to work will depend on the provisions of the agreement,\u201d says Gingell. Again, though, even if there is no notice period, a good employer should realise that you may need some time to prepare.</p> <p>If you have been furloughed under the government\u2019s job retention scheme, your employer can\u2019t ask you to go in and do ad hoc days, or work part-time. They would need to take you off furlough and renegotiate your contract with you.</p> <h2>Can they ask me to go back in part-time?</h2> <p>Not, currently, if you have been furloughed and they are using the government scheme to pay you. It only allows companies to furlough people for all of their normal hours, and bans them from asking you to do any work while you are off.</p> <p>But if your company has not claimed government money to cover your wages, it can ask you to resume work part-time. Make sure you understand the terms of the request \u2013 your employer cannot adjust your contract without your permission, so if it is asking you to change your hours you should get advice.</p> <h2>Can they ask me to take a pay cut?</h2> <p>\u201cThe law here is the same as it would be if an employer made the same request in the normal course of an employee\u2019s employment. Reducing hours and/or pay are deemed to be such fundamental changes to an employee\u2019s terms and conditions that the employee concerned should be consulted and then agree in writing,\u201d says Rycroft.</p> <p>He points out that for some employers \u201cthis may be the only economically viable option\u201d, and the alternative, if people refuse, could be redundancies. To make more than 20 people redundant there will need to be collective consultation.</p> <h2>What if I am in a vulnerable group or live with someone who is?</h2> <p>No special rules have been put in place to protect people in these groups who are asked to go into work but some already exist \u2013 if you are disabled or pregnant, for example, your employer has extra obligations.</p> <p>Rycroft says some employees may be able to argue that it will be discriminatory to force them to attend work outside the home. \u201cIt is all a question of degrees, in terms of how the employer can show that they have listened to legitimate concerns and made reasonable adjustments,\u201d he says.</p> <p>If you are pregnant your employer is obliged to make sure you can do your job safely. This can mean allowing you to do your job from home, or giving you a new role which can be done remotely. If your employer refuses either of these options, and you do not feel safe going into work you should take advice. <a href=\"https://www.employmentsolicitor.com/pregnancy-work-covid19/\">Employmentsolicitor.com says that you could be able to argue for a medical suspension</a> on full pay, which will allow you to stay at home.</p> <p>Living with someone who is vulnerable or especially at risk is not necessarily a reason an employee can refuse to return to work, says Rycroft. \u201cHowever, you can, as an employee raise a grievance and ask to be listened to and hopefully a compromise may be agreed, such as unpaid leave or using up annual holiday. But if an employer can show that a workplace is safe, the employer may insist on an employee attending.\u201d</p> <h2>What if I have childcare to worry about?</h2> <p>Legally, you can take time off to look after any dependants \u2013 these could be children, or older relatives. This time is typically unpaid. If you are currently furloughed and your employer does not have enough work for everyone to go back full-time, they may agree to leave you on furlough so you can continue to earn 80% of your normal pay.</p> <h2>What information should they give me in advance?</h2> <p>Rycroft says there is no law saying that employers should provide information before you return, but the government guidance to employers recommends that they do. He says this information \u2013 written or verbal \u2013 should cover how they are making your workplace safe in light of the pandemic. So you should be told what is happening to ensure social distancing and hygiene. \u201cThis will allow employees to understand how their health and safety at work is being addressed.</p> <h2>Can I refuse to go back?</h2> <p>Yes, if you believe there is a real danger to going to work. \u201cIf an employee refuses to return to the workplace due to the employee reasonably believing imminent and serious danger and is then dismissed for that reason the employee could, depending on the circumstances, have a claim for unfair dismissal,\u201d Gingell says.</p> <p>\u201cThe requirement that the employee has to believe that there is imminent and serious danger, does limit the right.\u201d</p> <p>Otherwise, you cannot refuse. \u201cIf someone refuses to attend work without a valid reason, it could result in disciplinary action,\u201d says Acas. But you may be able to make other arrangements with your employer \u2013 perhaps you can use holiday or take unpaid leave, or if you have concerns about something like travelling at peak time, they may be willing to accommodate different shifts. Your employer does not have to agree to this, but it is worth asking.</p> <p>Acas has more details on your rights around <a href=\"https://www.acas.org.uk/absence-from-work\">absence from work</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>What if I am worried when I see my workplace?</h2> <p>Rycroft says that under section 100 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 employees may leave a place of work where there is an imminent health and safety danger.

Grande, posting on Instagram, responded to 6ix9ine\u2019s allegations without naming him: \u201cto anybody that is displeased with their placement on the chart this week or who is spending their time racking their brain thinking of as many ways as they can to discredit hardworking women (and only the women for some reason.....), i ask u to take a moment to humble yourself.\u201d Billboard published a detailed article refuting 6ix9ine\u2019s allegations. \u201cOverall, Stuck With U drew 28.1m US streams, 26.3m in radio airplay audience and 108,000 sold in the tracking week \u2026 Gooba had 55.3m US streams, 172,000 in radio airplay audience and 24,000 sold. Those sums resulted in the songs\u2019 respective rankings on this week\u2019s Hot 100.\u201d 6ix9ine based his claims on an email showing a forecast that was allegedly sent to major labels last Thursday, prior to the chart\u2019s unveiling on Friday, which showed Stuck With U charting at No 5. He shared images of a second email, sent, he said, at \u201cthe last second\u201d before the chart sales cutoff, which showed an additional 60,000 sales for Stuck With U, placing it at No 1. \u201cUnderstand this, they bought 30,000 or so units on six credit cards,\u201d he posted on Instagram. \u201cIt\u2019s all manipulated, it\u2019s all fabricated.\u201d He further accused Billboard of \u201cdisqualifying\u201d 20m of Gooba\u2019s streams. \u201cI want the world to know that Billboard is a lie. You can buy No 1s.\u201d Bieber said that the sales of his single with Grande were not reported until Thursday in order to beat the competition. \u201cThat\u2019s called strategy,\u201d he said. He claimed that the streams that 6ix9ine considered \u201cdisqualified\u201d were from his song\u2019s global streaming figures, which do not factor into the domestic chart. The proceeds from Stuck With U go to the First Responders Children\u2019s Foundation, which gives financial scholarships to the children of first responders, particularly those who have been killed or injured in the line of duty. Gooba is 6ix9ine\u2019s first single since he was released from prison into house arrest in April, after his chronic asthma put him at risk of contracting the coronavirus. He was jailed after pleading guilty to multiple counts of racketeering, drug trafficking and firearms offences.",

It is essential that any review of the global response is based on a factually accurate account of what took place in December and January.\u201d</p> \n<p>EU diplomats, aware that the WHO has become a stage prop in Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, have been focusing on trying to minimise the US-China clash at the assembly, and still hope the compromise resolution can minimise the damage, and possibly pave the way for Trump to delay a final break from the WHO.</p> \n<p>In Brussels, the EU threw its weight behind the WHO, urging all countries to support it in the wake of Trump\u2019s continued attacks. \u201cThis is the time for solidarity,\u201d said the European commission\u2019s spokeswoman Virginie Battu-Henriksson. \u201cIt is not the time for finger-pointing or undermining multilateral cooperation.</p> \n<p>Welcoming what had been a victory for EU diplomacy, the bloc\u2019s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, pointedly distanced himself from Trump\u2019s criticisms, saying: \u201cThe resolution underlines the importance of responding to this crisis through solidarity and multilateral cooperation under the umbrella of the United Nations. We commend the WHO for its leading role in guiding the response to this crisis.\u201d</p> \n<p>He reiterated the EU\u2019s call for vaccine research to be shared and said the WHO would hold a lessons learned inquiry.</p> \n<p>The WHO regularly conducts reviews into its handling of major epidemics, so the real battle if the US stays in the UN body would be over issues such as the precise terms of reference and the identity of the inquiry chair.</p> \n<p>The loss of US funding to the WHO would be a severe blow since the US contributed more than $400m to the WHO in 2019, or about 15% of its budget. WHO funding is in need of reform since the overstretched body is heavily dependent on one-off voluntary contributions from nations and philanthropists such as the Gates Foundation. Many European states share the desire to reform the WHO, but find Trump\u2019s threats counterproductive since they only entrench Chinese influence with Africa, and make the reform cause harder.</p> \n<p>Overall, China seemed content with the WHA\u2019s direction, sensing that the US tactics had left Trump increasingly isolated. </p> \n<p>China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, described Trump\u2019s letter as slanderous. \u201cThe US leadership\u2019s open letter is \u2026 trying to mislead the public \u2026 to achieve the goal of smearing and slandering China\u2019s efforts in epidemic prevention and to shift responsibility in its own incompetence in handling the epidemic,\u201d Zhao said. </p> \n<p>The US decided not to resist the resolution, but put out a statement disassociating itself from a section in the resolution that favoured equal access to the intellectual property of any coronavirus medicines, such as a vaccine. </p> \n<p>At the White House Trump refused to back down, insisting the WHO will \u201chave to clean up their act, they have to do a better job. They have to be much more fair to other countries, including the United States or we\u2019re not going to be involved with them and we\u2019ll do it in a separate way.\u201d</p>",

It is essential that any review of the global response is based on a factually accurate account of what took place in December and January.\u201d EU diplomats, aware that the WHO has become a stage prop in Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, have been focusing on trying to minimise the US-China clash at the assembly, and still hope the compromise resolution can minimise the damage, and possibly pave the way for Trump to delay a final break from the WHO. In Brussels, the EU threw its weight behind the WHO, urging all countries to support it in the wake of Trump\u2019s continued attacks. \u201cThis is the time for solidarity,\u201d said the European commission\u2019s spokeswoman Virginie Battu-Henriksson. \u201cIt is not the time for finger-pointing or undermining multilateral cooperation. Welcoming what had been a victory for EU diplomacy, the bloc\u2019s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, pointedly distanced himself from Trump\u2019s criticisms, saying: \u201cThe resolution underlines the importance of responding to this crisis through solidarity and multilateral cooperation under the umbrella of the United Nations. We commend the WHO for its leading role in guiding the response to this crisis.\u201d He reiterated the EU\u2019s call for vaccine research to be shared and said the WHO would hold a lessons learned inquiry. The WHO regularly conducts reviews into its handling of major epidemics, so the real battle if the US stays in the UN body would be over issues such as the precise terms of reference and the identity of the inquiry chair. The loss of US funding to the WHO would be a severe blow since the US contributed more than $400m to the WHO in 2019, or about 15% of its budget. WHO funding is in need of reform since the overstretched body is heavily dependent on one-off voluntary contributions from nations and philanthropists such as the Gates Foundation. Many European states share the desire to reform the WHO, but find Trump\u2019s threats counterproductive since they only entrench Chinese influence with Africa, and make the reform cause harder. Overall, China seemed content with the WHA\u2019s direction, sensing that the US tactics had left Trump increasingly isolated. China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, described Trump\u2019s letter as slanderous. \u201cThe US leadership\u2019s open letter is \u2026 trying to mislead the public \u2026 to achieve the goal of smearing and slandering China\u2019s efforts in epidemic prevention and to shift responsibility in its own incompetence in handling the epidemic,\u201d Zhao said. The US decided not to resist the resolution, but put out a statement disassociating itself from a section in the resolution that favoured equal access to the intellectual property of any coronavirus medicines, such as a vaccine. At the White House Trump refused to back down, insisting the WHO will \u201chave to clean up their act, they have to do a better job. They have to be much more fair to other countries, including the United States or we\u2019re not going to be involved with them and we\u2019ll do it in a separate way.\u201d",

The NASUWT\u2019s snapshot survey revealed soaring levels of anxiety among teachers, with the overwhelming majority describing government plans for reopening primary schools as confusing and unsafe. Ninety-five per cent of those polled said they were concerned and anxious about reopening, 93% said the government\u2019s plans were confusing, while 91% lacked confidence in government measures to protect their health and that of their pupils. The survey results were published as unions prepared to meet the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, on Tuesday for crunch talks about schools reopening from 1 June in the face of widespread opposition from teachers and some councils. NASUWT\u2019s general secretary, Patrick Roach, has called on Williamson to provide all the scientific evidence and modelling the government has relied on in making its decision to start reopening schools. In a letter to the education secretary, Roach underlined the NASUWT\u2019s commitment to working with ministers but said the government would have to do \u201cfurther urgent work\u201d to win the trust and confidence of the profession. \u201cThe NASUWT is fully committed to ensuring children can return to school as quickly as possible,\u201d said Roach. \u201cHowever, our bottom line is that no teacher or pupil should be expected to return to school until it is safe for them to do so. \u201cThe results of our survey underscore the fact that the government has thus far failed to win the trust and confidence of teachers about the safety of reopening schools. It is now imperative that the government takes every available opportunity to provide the necessary assurances that teachers are seeking.\u201d The government has said it wants children in nursery, reception, year one and year six to begin a phased return to schools in England from 1 June, with other primary years following soon after, so primary children where feasible are in a school for a month before the summer holiday. Secondary school pupils preparing for exams next summer are expected to get some \u201cface time\u201d with their teachers where possible. The NASUWT said the response to its survey was overwhelming, with 29,000 members submitting their views in fourdays. It said many of the findings would be concerning for ministers who have been trying to reassure teachers and parents that it was safe for schools to reopen. Currently, schools are open only to children of key workers and vulnerable pupils. Among the NASUWT findings, which Roach relayed to Williamson in his letter, just 5% found the government plans clear or helpful, a mere 2% were supportive of the government\u2019s plans to reopen schools, while 92% said they were not reassured by government claims about safety. Almost nine in 10 teachers (87%) believed PPE was essential to protect against transmission. Government guidance is that PPE will not be routinely needed in most schools. More than seven out of 10 (72%) said government plans to keep children in separate, small groups at all times, were not workable, while almost half (48%) said staggered lunched breaks were not practical in their school or college. Teachers were also concerned about safe physical distancing in schools \u2013 92% said social distancing would not be possible or would present a major issue in their school. Asked whether they thought it was safe to return to school at the beginning of June, 85% said no, 5% responded yes and the rest were undecided. A Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cPlans for a phased return of some year groups from 1 June, at the earliest, are based on the best scientific and medical advice. The welfare of children and staff has been at the heart of all decision making. \u201cWe have engaged closely with the unions throughout the past eight weeks, including organising for them to hear directly from the scientific experts last week, and will continue to do so, including to develop further guidance if required.\u201d",

After Sweet Sorrow, set in the 90s, he was planning to write a novella situated in the present day. \u201cI wanted to write about now, but \u2018now\u2019 changes day by day.\u201d And he doesn\u2019t find the nerve-jangling news feed of Covid-19 stories conducive to writing fiction: Nicholls lives in London with his partner, Hannah, an art historian, and their two children, aged 12 and 14, so parenting is taking up time and headspace instead. He was shaken by the recent news that Nuffield Southampton theatres had gone into administration. \u201cThe first play I ever saw was there. It was the only theatre I had access to, so its loss strikes a chord. For all my own failures in that world, it was an important, inspiring place, the model of a great community rep, an introduction to amazing plays. I hope it rises again.\u201d As for physical distancing, he says: \u201cThere is a glorious recklessness in physical contact, not just in theatre but in the medium of television. I crave to see people touching, kissing, fighting on screen. I think the lockdown has reminded us how much we crave physical interaction.\u201d The Understudy will be broadcast in two parts on 20 May and 27 May. David Nicholls will discuss his novel Sweet Sorrow at a Guardian Live online event on 11 June.",

Its chairman, Jeremy Hunt, described <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/coronavirus-real-care-home-death-toll-double-official-figure-study-says\">estimates that 22,000 people may have died </a>from Covid and related issues in care homes as \u201cvery, very shocking\u201d.</p> \n<p>MPs also heard from Isabell Halletz, the chief executive at the German employers\u2019 association for care homes, who said there had been fewer than 3,000 Covid-19 deaths in care homes in Germany, partly because no one was allowed in from hospitals without a negative test, or had undergone quarantine in designated centres or repurposed hotels for at least 14 days.</p> \n<p>Adelina Comas-Herrera, a research fellow at the London School of Economics studying Covid-19 deaths in care homes globally, also praised Singapore and South Korea, which have recorded no care home deaths by quarantining infected residents or moving them to hospitals.</p> \n<p>\u201c[Their] infection control policies [were] based not on influenza but on Sars and that has helped them,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>The international comparisons came as figures released by the Office of National Statistics on Tuesday revealed 9,980 deaths were registered in care homes in England and Wales up to 8 May from confirmed or suspected Covid-19. Adding more up-to-date death tolls reported to regulators and deaths of care home residents in hospitals to 1 May, it means 14,835 care residents have died from Covid-19.</p> \n<p>UK care homes are demanding a significant increase in testing of staff and residents, up to three times a week, amid fears a lifting of the lockdown could spark new outbreaks.</p> \n<p>So far, the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, has promised only that all care home residents and staff will be tested by 6 June, but no commitment has been made for repeat testing.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople are often finding their tests aren\u2019t arriving on time or being taken away on time,\u201d said Green. \u201cWe are looking at delays of eight to 10 days until people get results.\u201d</p> \n<p>The call for routine testing was echoed by Sir David Behan, the chief executive of HC-One, the largest private provider, and Sam Monaghan, the chief executive of MHA, the largest charitable provider.</p> \n<p>Vic Rayner, the executive director at the National Care Forum, which represents charitable care operators, said the promise of 30,000 tests a day was enough only for one test each for care residents and staff.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat that means is you haven\u2019t got the right tools and resources to manage outbreaks within homes and identify when and where infections might have come in,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly challenging for providers to operate in that climate. It is absolutely critical that we get that repeat testing.\u201d</p> \n<p>The committee also heard warnings about the continued risk posed by temporary care workers spreading the virus if they work in more than one home. A Public Health England study, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/agency-staff-were-spreading-covid-19-between-care-homes-phe-found-in-april\">revealed by the Guardian on Monday</a>, found this had happened in early April but instructions to restrict movements were issued by the government only last Thursday.</p> \n<p>Green said floating agency staff were a danger and operators may have to ensure agency staff are restricted to a particular care home rather than move between care homes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>James Bullion, the president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, said: \u201cThe fact that we have agency staff moving between three or four establishments is a consequence of the structural model we have got. We do need to look at a salaried model and higher level of wages.\u201d</p> \n<p><br></p>",

Lum\u2019s account came as the health and social care committee tried to learn lessons from the crisis in care homes, where four in 10 Covid deaths have occurred. Its chairman, Jeremy Hunt, described estimates that 22,000 people may have died from Covid and related issues in care homes as \u201cvery, very shocking\u201d. MPs also heard from Isabell Halletz, the chief executive at the German employers\u2019 association for care homes, who said there had been fewer than 3,000 Covid-19 deaths in care homes in Germany, partly because no one was allowed in from hospitals without a negative test, or had undergone quarantine in designated centres or repurposed hotels for at least 14 days. Adelina Comas-Herrera, a research fellow at the London School of Economics studying Covid-19 deaths in care homes globally, also praised Singapore and South Korea, which have recorded no care home deaths by quarantining infected residents or moving them to hospitals. \u201c[Their] infection control policies [were] based not on influenza but on Sars and that has helped them,\u201d she said. The international comparisons came as figures released by the Office of National Statistics on Tuesday revealed 9,980 deaths were registered in care homes in England and Wales up to 8 May from confirmed or suspected Covid-19. Adding more up-to-date death tolls reported to regulators and deaths of care home residents in hospitals to 1 May, it means 14,835 care residents have died from Covid-19. UK care homes are demanding a significant increase in testing of staff and residents, up to three times a week, amid fears a lifting of the lockdown could spark new outbreaks. So far, the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, has promised only that all care home residents and staff will be tested by 6 June, but no commitment has been made for repeat testing. \u201cPeople are often finding their tests aren\u2019t arriving on time or being taken away on time,\u201d said Green. \u201cWe are looking at delays of eight to 10 days until people get results.\u201d The call for routine testing was echoed by Sir David Behan, the chief executive of HC-One, the largest private provider, and Sam Monaghan, the chief executive of MHA, the largest charitable provider. Vic Rayner, the executive director at the National Care Forum, which represents charitable care operators, said the promise of 30,000 tests a day was enough only for one test each for care residents and staff. \u201cWhat that means is you haven\u2019t got the right tools and resources to manage outbreaks within homes and identify when and where infections might have come in,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly challenging for providers to operate in that climate. It is absolutely critical that we get that repeat testing.\u201d The committee also heard warnings about the continued risk posed by temporary care workers spreading the virus if they work in more than one home. A Public Health England study, revealed by the Guardian on Monday, found this had happened in early April but instructions to restrict movements were issued by the government only last Thursday. Green said floating agency staff were a danger and operators may have to ensure agency staff are restricted to a particular care home rather than move between care homes. James Bullion, the president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, said: \u201cThe fact that we have agency staff moving between three or four establishments is a consequence of the structural model we have got. We do need to look at a salaried model and higher level of wages.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "For nearly five full years, Virginia Pe\u00f1a Zamudio has been searching: trawling prisons, markets and forensic records for the slightest trace of her missing son. Rosendo Vazquez Pe\u00f1a was kidnapped from a car repair shop in Mexico\u2019s Veracruz state in September 2015 and has not been seen here since. Since then Pe\u00f1a Zamudio has, like thousands of Mexican parents and spouses, thrown herself into a life of hunting, joining a search \u201cbrigade\u201d of grieving relatives determined to find their loved ones, dead or alive. But the coronavirus, which has killed at least 5,000 people in Mexico, has brought the hunt for its desaparecidos to a sudden and traumatic halt. \u201cWe\u2019re shut inside, we can\u2019t even move,\u201d said Pe\u00f1a Zamudio. \u201cAs a mother, I want to be able to break all of these barriers, but I can\u2019t.\u201d Up and down Mexico \u2013 where nearly 62,000 people have vanished since its \u201cwar on drugs\u201d began in 2006 \u2013 families have found themselves in a similar position, seeing their quests to locate loved-ones frustrated by the pandemic. \u201cThe searches are stopped right now. I\u2019m not sure when they\u2019re going to start again because of the virus,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Barajas, a US citizen who has been looking for his father since he was seized from his ranch in the northern state of Baja California by gunmen in April 2019. Last year a series of edgy and gruesome desert hunts \u2013 one witnessed by the Guardian \u2013 failed to find any sign of Barajas\u2019 father, who is also called Jos\u00e9. Relatives suspect he was snatched by cartel members operating near the US border and is likely to have been murdered. This year, Barajas said he felt the searchers were making progress: during one recent mission activists found eight or nine bodies buried in shallow graves and a bag full of human bones. \u201cAnd then, right after that, everything stopped,\u201d added Barajas, who said he was anxious to resume his hunt. Pe\u00f1a Zamudio\u2019s plans have also been derailed by the shutdown, which has seen the government institutions tasked with offering logistical support or protection to the search teams suspend or reduce their activities. In February, she spent two weeks with a 200-strong search brigade in the city of Poza Rica. While some members searched for human remains on riverbanks and abandoned oilfields, Pe\u00f1a Zamudio visited penitentiaries, rehab centers and local medical forensic departments in search of her son, who would now be 27. Wherever she went she carried his laminated photo and asked strangers if they\u2019d seen someone with Rosendo\u2019s characteristics, including a tattoo on his chest reading: \u201cLa vida no es f\u00e1cil\u201d (\u201cLife isn\u2019t easy\u201d). The Poza Rica searches would be Pe\u00f1a Zamudio\u2019s last for a while. Her \u201ccollective\u201d had been planning to visit Tijuana and Oaxaca to search for their loved-ones, many of whom disappeared during the same several-day period in 2015. The last time she travelled to Oaxaca, last September, 18 people in the city\u2019s central market told her they\u2019d seen her son, who she suspects was abducted by police and may still be alive. Pe\u00f1a Zamudio had hoped the latest trip would shed further light on his whereabouts \u2013 but then came the coronavirus. \u201cAs long as we can\u2019t go out and search, the authorities should still be doing it,\u201d Pe\u00f1a Zamudio said. In an open letter the Movimiento por Nuestros Desaparecidos en M\u00e9xico, a nationwide coalition of the families of disappearance victims, announced its members were temporarily suspending their expeditions. \u201cJust as we don\u2019t want any more people to disappear, we also value everyone\u2019s wellbeing,\u201d they wrote. \u201cFor the families of the disappeared, compulsory social isolation means lost days in trying to ensure our loved ones can come home,\u201d the group admitted. \u201cBut it\u2019s clear to us that now is the time to put lives first. If we aren\u2019t healthy, we won\u2019t be of any use searching for the more than 61,000 people we have lost.\u201d \u201cSadly the disappearances have not stopped [because of the pandemic],\u201d the group added, urging Mexico\u2019s government to develop a plan to continue conducting some searches despite the health emergency. As Pe\u00f1a Zamudio waits out the crisis at home, she said she had been dreaming about her son and worrying about his safety during the pandemic. \u201cI think about whether he\u2019s living in the street, if he\u2019s in a really crowded place, what will happen to him,\u201d she said.

      "body": "<p>Clap for them, then charge them. This is the how the Conservatives treat migrant key workers. For all the admiration and thanks heaped upon these workers during the coronavirus pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/16/home-office-priti-patel-failure-to-scrap-nhs-migrant-surcharge-sparks-anger\">the government</a> has refused to scrap the NHS immigration surcharge. The majority of non-EU migrants, including those who work in the NHS, will have to pay the surcharge on top of taxes, national insurance contributions and extortionate immigration fees.</p> <p>And so it has to be said plainly: the government praises NHS workers for providing life-saving care, then makes them pay through the nose to access that same care themselves. Migrant staff have to pay twice for the very healthcare system they work for. Just because they are immigrants.</p> <p>When confronted with this contradiction at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/government-reviewing-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-medics\">the end of April</a>, Priti Patel suggested the surcharge was \u201cunder review\u201d. This has been the home secretary\u2019s standard response of late: whenever Patel has been presented with evidence showing the deleterious impact of the government\u2019s immigration policies, she\u2019ll say they\u2019re being looked at.</p> <p>In an attempt to wriggle out of this claim, Patel\u2019s department then said she had never promised any formal review of the NHS surcharge. Instead, this was just Patel referring to the fact that \u201call government policies are continuously kept under review\u201d. Used again yesterday by foreign secretary Dominic Raab, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/1262425636855074818?s=20\">without a hint of irony</a>, this is a handy catchphrase the government uses to avoid scrutiny.</p> <p>Stopping short of doing nothing, the Conservatives have done the absolute bare minimum to change the policy. Until October, doctors, nurses and paramedics will be exempt from paying the surcharge for a year as part of an <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/nhs-frontline-workers-visas-extended-so-they-can-focus-on-fighting-coronavirus\">automatic visa extension</a>. The concession amounts to crumbs from the master\u2019s table: pause it for a year and then, once the clapping has stopped, continue as if nothing has happened.</p> <p>This one-year exemption is a scrap that\u2019s not even considered for other migrant key workers: the care workers, supermarket staff, porters and cleaners who have put their lives on the line during this pandemic are only a few of those not given a temporary pass. They will still have to pay up. \u201cI wanted to do nursing but I couldn\u2019t afford overseas student fees, so I decided to be a care worker and I\u2019m working hard,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-nhs-visa-extensions-uk-doctors-nurses-a9444056.html\">Shantel Murray told </a><a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-nhs-visa-extensions-uk-doctors-nurses-a9444056.html\">the Independent</a>. \u201cRight now I\u2019m doing all I can to help the community. But I just feel so undervalued.\u201d</p> <p>Kimesha is a care worker who is paid only \u00a39 an hour. She can barely afford the surcharge and visa costs for herself and her three children, so has had to take a second job. \u201cIt is very stressful because it keeps going up. It is a struggle for people like me who aren\u2019t earning enough to pay rent, council tax and bills. It should be abolished for everyone,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/03/calls-grow-scrap-nhs-surcharge-migrant-healthcare-workers-coronavirus\">she told the Guardian</a>. Care-worker badges and platitudes are no substitute for policy change.</p> <p>The surcharge has tripled in price in less than two years. At the end of 2018 it was \u00a3200 for an adult; now it\u2019s \u00a3400 and is set to rise again, to \u00a3624, on 1 October this year. For anyone under the age of 18 it will be \u00a3470, meaning for a family of two adults and two children, it will cost \u00a32,188 to use the NHS each year.</p> <p>Matt Hancock <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattHancock/status/1195997609942560768?s=20\">defended the increase</a> during the general election campaign, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s the national health service not the international health service.\u201d Here is the myth of British exceptionalism. In 1971, <a href=\"http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/immigration-and-the-national-health-service-putting-history-to-the-forefron\">around 30% of doctors working in NHS</a> were born overseas. That figure is still roughly the same. The government wants an exclusively \u201cnational\u201d health service, just one that is staffed by \u201cinternational\u201d workers \u2013 who then have to pay to access the health service themselves.</p> <p>The government justifies the surcharge, saying it \u201censures that migrants make a proper financial contribution to the cost of their NHS care\u201d. Except they already do \u2013 it\u2019s called taxes.</p> <p>The duplicity of the surcharge is painfully obvious. If any lesson is learned from this pandemic, it should be that healthcare is a universal, basic right, whether you\u2019re a key worker or not. The \u201cgood migrant\u201d/\u201cbad migrant\u201d binary is a dead end. Nobody should have to pay twice to access it just because they weren\u2019t born in this country.</p> <p>This one policy, callous though it is, is emblematic of a much bigger problem: how the government treats all migrants. Though not officially part of the \u201chostile environment\u201d, the NHS surcharge was introduced at the same time as many of the policies that fall under this infamous title. Most remain in operation \u2013 despite the Windrush scandal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/21/right-to-rent-rule-justified-finds-uk-appeal-court\">court rulings</a>, endless cases that show the damage they\u2019ve done and a global pandemic.

      "bodyText": "Clap for them, then charge them. This is the how the Conservatives treat migrant key workers. For all the admiration and thanks heaped upon these workers during the coronavirus pandemic, the government has refused to scrap the NHS immigration surcharge. The majority of non-EU migrants, including those who work in the NHS, will have to pay the surcharge on top of taxes, national insurance contributions and extortionate immigration fees. And so it has to be said plainly: the government praises NHS workers for providing life-saving care, then makes them pay through the nose to access that same care themselves. Migrant staff have to pay twice for the very healthcare system they work for. Just because they are immigrants. When confronted with this contradiction at the end of April, Priti Patel suggested the surcharge was \u201cunder review\u201d. This has been the home secretary\u2019s standard response of late: whenever Patel has been presented with evidence showing the deleterious impact of the government\u2019s immigration policies, she\u2019ll say they\u2019re being looked at. In an attempt to wriggle out of this claim, Patel\u2019s department then said she had never promised any formal review of the NHS surcharge. Instead, this was just Patel referring to the fact that \u201call government policies are continuously kept under review\u201d. Used again yesterday by foreign secretary Dominic Raab, without a hint of irony, this is a handy catchphrase the government uses to avoid scrutiny. Stopping short of doing nothing, the Conservatives have done the absolute bare minimum to change the policy. Until October, doctors, nurses and paramedics will be exempt from paying the surcharge for a year as part of an automatic visa extension. The concession amounts to crumbs from the master\u2019s table: pause it for a year and then, once the clapping has stopped, continue as if nothing has happened. This one-year exemption is a scrap that\u2019s not even considered for other migrant key workers: the care workers, supermarket staff, porters and cleaners who have put their lives on the line during this pandemic are only a few of those not given a temporary pass. They will still have to pay up. \u201cI wanted to do nursing but I couldn\u2019t afford overseas student fees, so I decided to be a care worker and I\u2019m working hard,\u201d Shantel Murray told the Independent. \u201cRight now I\u2019m doing all I can to help the community. But I just feel so undervalued.\u201d Kimesha is a care worker who is paid only \u00a39 an hour. She can barely afford the surcharge and visa costs for herself and her three children, so has had to take a second job. \u201cIt is very stressful because it keeps going up. It is a struggle for people like me who aren\u2019t earning enough to pay rent, council tax and bills. It should be abolished for everyone,\u201d she told the Guardian. Care-worker badges and platitudes are no substitute for policy change. The surcharge has tripled in price in less than two years. At the end of 2018 it was \u00a3200 for an adult; now it\u2019s \u00a3400 and is set to rise again, to \u00a3624, on 1 October this year. For anyone under the age of 18 it will be \u00a3470, meaning for a family of two adults and two children, it will cost \u00a32,188 to use the NHS each year. Matt Hancock defended the increase during the general election campaign, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s the national health service not the international health service.\u201d Here is the myth of British exceptionalism. In 1971, around 30% of doctors working in NHS were born overseas. That figure is still roughly the same. The government wants an exclusively \u201cnational\u201d health service, just one that is staffed by \u201cinternational\u201d workers \u2013 who then have to pay to access the health service themselves. The government justifies the surcharge, saying it \u201censures that migrants make a proper financial contribution to the cost of their NHS care\u201d. Except they already do \u2013 it\u2019s called taxes. The duplicity of the surcharge is painfully obvious. If any lesson is learned from this pandemic, it should be that healthcare is a universal, basic right, whether you\u2019re a key worker or not. The \u201cgood migrant\u201d/\u201cbad migrant\u201d binary is a dead end. Nobody should have to pay twice to access it just because they weren\u2019t born in this country. This one policy, callous though it is, is emblematic of a much bigger problem: how the government treats all migrants. Though not officially part of the \u201chostile environment\u201d, the NHS surcharge was introduced at the same time as many of the policies that fall under this infamous title. Most remain in operation \u2013 despite the Windrush scandal, court rulings, endless cases that show the damage they\u2019ve done and a global pandemic. Almost nothing, it turns out, is as stubbornly maintained as the government\u2019s anti-immigrant politics. At the very start of lockdown, campaigners asked the government to make some basic changes to protect immigrants and ensure they have access to healthcare. It has largely chosen not to. Instead it has made the decision to press on with its immigration bill, which will end free movement and pave the way for cleaners, porters and care workers to be prevented from coming to the UK. This policy designates workers according to whether they\u2019re \u201chigh\u201d or \u201clow skilled\u201d; it turns people into commodities. It\u2019s precisely the classification of certain people as \u201clow skilled\u201d that allows the government to exclude from the surcharge exemption care workers and other key workers who have played a crucial role during this pandemic. Clap for them during the pandemic, force them to pay twice to access healthcare, kick them out afterwards. Or as Labour puts it: clap for them on Thursday; vote to take away their rights on Monday. \u2022 Maya Goodfellow is a writer and academic, and the author of Hostile Environment: How Immigrants Became Scapegoats",

Gough Island, which has one of the most important seabird colonies in the world, is the stage for what has been described as \u201cone of nature\u2019s greatest horror shows\u201d. Mice from the boats of seal hunters managed to get on to the island 150 years ago and have somehow evolved to two and even three times the size of an ordinary British house mouse. Every year the mutant mice feast from the nests on live seabird chicks, killing about 2 million of them. It is a catastrophe that is pushing one of the world\u2019s most threatened species, the Tristan albatross, towards extinction. The RSPB said there was also evidence the mutant mice had begun targeting live adult birds. All of which made the yearlong mission to rid the island of mice of huge importance. When the coronavirus struck not all the team had arrived so they were left with few options but to return home, a spokesperson for the RSPB said. \u201cWe would not have been able to complete the project because we didn\u2019t have everyone we needed there.\u201d However getting back was easier said than done, with countries around the world imposing travel restrictions. Gough Island, around the size of Guernsey, is part of the British overseas territory of Tristan da Cunha and approximately 1,700 miles from Cape Town. Kate Lawrence, a member of the team and now back home in New Zealand, said colleagues in the UK worked on an extraction plan that seemed to change daily. \u201cTravelling via Cape Town, the Falkland Islands, Saint Helena and Ascension Island were all possibilities at some point.\u201d The best option was a 1,969 nautical miles journey on the team\u2019s expedition yacht through rough seas to Ascension. Lawrence said: \u201cSailing in that boat for 12 days, looking at the endless blue ocean around me, made the world feel quite big, in contrast to the previous ease of air travel and the rapid spread of Covid-19, which makes the world seem so small.\u201d Once on Ascension, home to just 800 people, the group had to wait five days for the next RAF flight back to the UK. Tristan da Cunha\u2019s administrator, Fiona Kilpatrick, said it was a complex operation which had involved staff from three UK overseas territories as well as teams in South Africa, Vienna and London. \u201cTheir challenging journey showed how carefully this needed to be planned and how much coordination and diplomacy was required to get them home. We hope to welcome them back soon.\u201d All of the group are now safely home. The RSPB, meanwhile, is hoping to try once more in its mission to exterminate the giant mice in 2021, if conditions allow and finance can be raised.",

      "body": "<p>When the UK fully emerges from the coronavirus lockdown and shoppers are allowed out again for non-essential purchases, their local high street could be a very different place from the one they left in March. Since the pandemic gripped the nation, a string of big-name retailers have fallen into administration or announced store closures, and some of the shutters that were pulled down may not be lifted again.</p> <p>The failures of Laura Ashley, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/30/oasis-and-warehouse-to-permanently-close-shops-with-loss-of-1800-jobs\">Warehouse, Oasis</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/cath-kidston-to-close-all-60-uk-stores-with-loss-of-900-jobs\">Cath Kidston</a> did not go unnoticed, but the news stories were, of course, a footnote to other, more tragic, events. And, so far, to those who don\u2019t work for them, their loss has been invisible. But the job cuts at those retailers and other struggling brands, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/17/at-least-seven-debenhams-stores-close-loss-400-jobs\">Debenhams</a>, will be felt by thousands of families. And in the short term many high streets will be even more scarred than they were before lockdown.</p> <p>When I ask Mary Portas if it is the worst crisis ever to hit the high street, she points out that it goes far beyond that.

In the early days, JD Wetherspoon and Waterstones both found their names preceded by #boycott on Twitter, after staff raised concerns about having to work. In contrast, the repair shop Timpson has won praise for its approach \u2013 topping up pay for furloughed staff so their income is not reduced.</p> <p>The idea that shoppers may be alert to how businesses treat them, their workers and the planet plays into something Portas was already talking about before all of this began.

Have you spoken to Sir Terry Leahy?\u2019\u201d And it was those at the top who had all of the power. Now, she says, we are what she calls more \u201csentient\u201d consumers, and businesses need to reflect our concerns to attract our money.</p> <p>She references Mark Carney, the former governor of the Bank of England, who recently suggested the shift in values that would be sparked by the crisis. <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2020/04/16/mark-carney-on-how-the-economy-must-yield-to-human-values\">Writing in the Economist</a>, he said: \u201cFundamentally, the traditional drivers of value have been shaken, new ones will gain prominence, and there\u2019s a possibility that the gulf between what markets value and what people value will close.\u201d With this in mind, Portas says: \u201cEvery \u00a31 is a vote, a vote for how we want to live.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8491eb3628a1e946d948495f4784db8bcffe39d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8491eb3628a1e946d948495f4784db8bcffe39d2/0_177_5317_3191/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Laura Ashley shop after it went into administration.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Laura Ashley shop after it went into administration.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naomi Baker/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although, during the lockdown, some spending has moved online, Portas says there is a \u201cpower\u201d to bricks-and-mortar shops: \u201cIf [people] do come into your store, they\u2019re two-and-a-half times more likely to buy.\u201d But some retailers are not delivering places that people want to go to.</p> <p>One thing she talked about in 2011 was support for small, local businesses.

While this may have been fuelled by the difficulty of getting a supermarket delivery slot without setting your alarm clock for 4am, it may also have changed our shopping habits.

      "bodyText": "When the UK fully emerges from the coronavirus lockdown and shoppers are allowed out again for non-essential purchases, their local high street could be a very different place from the one they left in March. Since the pandemic gripped the nation, a string of big-name retailers have fallen into administration or announced store closures, and some of the shutters that were pulled down may not be lifted again. The failures of Laura Ashley, Warehouse, Oasis and Cath Kidston did not go unnoticed, but the news stories were, of course, a footnote to other, more tragic, events. And, so far, to those who don\u2019t work for them, their loss has been invisible. But the job cuts at those retailers and other struggling brands, such as Debenhams, will be felt by thousands of families. And in the short term many high streets will be even more scarred than they were before lockdown. When I ask Mary Portas if it is the worst crisis ever to hit the high street, she points out that it goes far beyond that. She is on a video call from her home in Gloucestershire where, like many people, she is juggling work \u2013 for the consultancy that she founded \u2013 and home-schooling her young son. \u201cIt\u2019s the worst crisis to hit anybody in any kind of industry that relies on people having disposable income and actually being outside their homes,\u201d she says.

All the individuals will be expected to isolate for seven days. The 20th club completed testing on Tuesday and their figures will be included in the results from a second round of testing, due to be published on Saturday.</p> <p>The Bundesliga, which restarted last Saturday, announced 10 positive tests in early May from 1,724 tests on players and staff at clubs in the top two tiers, equating to 0.58% of tests being positive to the Premier League\u2019s 0.8%. On 10 May, La Liga said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/10/five-positive-coronavirus-tests-confirmed-among-la-liga-players\">five players in Spain\u2019s top two divisions</a> had tested positive, without naming how many had been tested.</p> <p>Focus now turns back to the process of creating medical protocols, with the next task a plan for the safe introduction of contact training. This is likely to prove the most controversial part of Project Restart, with Watford\u2019s Troy Deeney \u2013 who has said he will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/19/pfa-asks-premier-league-to-research-covid-19s-impact-on-bame-players\">refuse</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/19/pfa-asks-premier-league-to-research-covid-19s-impact-on-bame-players\"> to return to training</a> over safety concerns \u2013 having articulated the fears of many players over risks to their health and that of their families.</p> <p>The left-back Danny Rose, on loan at Newcastle from Tottenham, has aired similar concerns to Deeney. Newcastle went back to training on Tuesday but Rose was wary to return. \u201cPeople are suggesting we should go back to football, like we\u2019re guinea pigs or lab rats,\u201d he told the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTZb-5qiiaE\">Lockdown Tactics podcast</a>. \u201cWe\u2019ve going to experiment this phase and see if it works or not.</p> <p>\u201cI can just imagine people at home saying: \u2018Well, they earn that amount of money, so they should be going back.\u2019 For stuff like that, I think: \u2018Is it worth the hassle?\u2019 I could be potentially risking my health for people\u2019s entertainment and that\u2019s not something I want to be involved in if I\u2019m honest.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday Chelsea\u2019s Callum Hudson-Odoi trained after he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/18/chelsea-callum-hudson-odoi-arrested-after-police-called-to-his-home-reports\">reportedly arrested</a> in the early hours of Sunday.</p> <p>The Premier League hopes to complete a return to contact training in short order. It is to meet representatives from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and public health officials this week to discuss the protocols needed to enable \u201cstage two\u201d of a return for elite sport, rules that will incorporate physical contact.</p> <p>Once government approves a rubric for guidelines, the league will consult with players, managers and the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association before finalising bespoke rules. The league hopes to finish the protocol by the time the 20 shareholder clubs meet next Tuesday, when it would be put to a vote.</p> <p>The timeline will not get any less frantic should that vote pass, with further considerations needed on how to make matches safe behind closed doors, issues that include resolving discussions with police about the use of home venues. There is an acceptance in the league and within government that the end of June is looking more likely for a possible return, with Friday 26 a possible new date.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As the process of discussion and debate continues, players and staff \u2013 up to 40 a time from each club \u2013 will be tested twice a week.

The Bundesliga, which restarted last Saturday, announced 10 positive tests in early May from 1,724 tests on players and staff at clubs in the top two tiers, equating to 0.58% of tests being positive to the Premier League\u2019s 0.8%. On 10 May, La Liga said five players in Spain\u2019s top two divisions had tested positive, without naming how many had been tested. Focus now turns back to the process of creating medical protocols, with the next task a plan for the safe introduction of contact training. This is likely to prove the most controversial part of Project Restart, with Watford\u2019s Troy Deeney \u2013 who has said he will refuse to return to training over safety concerns \u2013 having articulated the fears of many players over risks to their health and that of their families. The left-back Danny Rose, on loan at Newcastle from Tottenham, has aired similar concerns to Deeney. Newcastle went back to training on Tuesday but Rose was wary to return. \u201cPeople are suggesting we should go back to football, like we\u2019re guinea pigs or lab rats,\u201d he told the Lockdown Tactics podcast. \u201cWe\u2019ve going to experiment this phase and see if it works or not. \u201cI can just imagine people at home saying: \u2018Well, they earn that amount of money, so they should be going back.\u2019 For stuff like that, I think: \u2018Is it worth the hassle?\u2019 I could be potentially risking my health for people\u2019s entertainment and that\u2019s not something I want to be involved in if I\u2019m honest.\u201d On Tuesday Chelsea\u2019s Callum Hudson-Odoi trained after he was reportedly arrested in the early hours of Sunday. The Premier League hopes to complete a return to contact training in short order. It is to meet representatives from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and public health officials this week to discuss the protocols needed to enable \u201cstage two\u201d of a return for elite sport, rules that will incorporate physical contact. Once government approves a rubric for guidelines, the league will consult with players, managers and the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association before finalising bespoke rules. The league hopes to finish the protocol by the time the 20 shareholder clubs meet next Tuesday, when it would be put to a vote. The timeline will not get any less frantic should that vote pass, with further considerations needed on how to make matches safe behind closed doors, issues that include resolving discussions with police about the use of home venues. There is an acceptance in the league and within government that the end of June is looking more likely for a possible return, with Friday 26 a possible new date. As the process of discussion and debate continues, players and staff \u2013 up to 40 a time from each club \u2013 will be tested twice a week. In charge of operating the testing procedure is Prenetics, a Hong Kong company whose UK arm had previously specialised in DNA testing. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a test it\u2019s an overall process,\u201d said their chief executive, Avi Lasarow, whose company has formed a consortium with the London-based laboratory TDL to process results. \u201cOur role as a company is to provide a gold-standard solution by essentially delivering the ability to collect the samples safely with registered healthcare professionals, make sure those samples get to the lab for analysis under a strict chain of custody and then report that out via a secure technology infrastructure.\u201d",

There is no plausible route out of the UK\u2019s coronavirus crisis that does not involve mass suffering and death. If, as some newspapers and Conservative MPs insist, the government eases the lockdown while the pandemic is still raging, the eventual death toll could be several times greater than today\u2019s. If it doesn\u2019t, and we spend all the warm months of the year in confinement, the impact on our mental and physical health, jobs and relationships could be catastrophic.</p> <p>We have been told repeatedly that the UK was unprepared for this pandemic. This is untrue. The UK was prepared, but then it de-prepared. Last year, the Global Health Security Index <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/11/countries-preparedness-pandemics/?fbclid=IwAR3V4ExLwttUjv7c2fbVa6GMEFaciLYfK43dVZtkq3dDesIdn_ToVZ9n6TU\">ranked this nation second in the world for pandemic readiness</a>, while the US was first. Broadly speaking, in both nations the necessary systems were in place. Our governments chose not to use them.</p> <p>The climate modeller James Annan has used his analytical methods to show what would have happened if the UK government had imposed its <a href=\"https://bskiesresearch.wordpress.com/2020/05/12/the-human-cost-of-delaying-lockdown/\">lockdown a week earlier</a>. Starting it on 16 March, rather than 23 March, his modelling suggests, would by now have saved around 30,000 lives, reducing the rate of illness and death from coronavirus roughly by a factor of five.</p> <p>But even 16 March would have been extraordinarily late. We now know that <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/why-didn-t-boris-act-sooner-against-coronavirus-\">government ministers were told on 11 February</a> that the virus could be catastrophic, and decisive action was urgently required. Instead, Boris Johnson told us to wash our hands and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/revealed-the-inside-story-of-uk-covid-19-coronavirus-crisis\">\u201cgo about our normal daily lives\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Had the government acted in February, we can hazard a guess about what the result would have been, as the world has conducted a clear controlled experiment: weighing South Korea, Taiwan and New Zealand against the UK, the US and Brazil. South Korea did everything the UK government could have done, but refused to implement. Its death toll so far: <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/south-korea/\">263</a>. It still has an occasional cluster of infection, which it promptly contains. By contrast, the entire UK is now a cluster of infection.</p> <p>While other countries either closed their borders or quarantined all arrivals, in the three months between the emergence of the virus and the UK\u2019s lockdown, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/just-273-people-arriving-in-uk-in-run-up-to-lockdown-quarantined\">18 million people</a> arrived on these shores, of whom only 273 were quarantined. Even after the lockdown was announced, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/95000-have-entered-uk-from-abroad-during-coronavirus-lockdown\">95,000 people entered the UK</a> without additional restrictions. In fact, on 13 March, the UK stood down even its own guidance, which had gently requested travellers from Italy and China to self-isolate. This decision, taken as other nations were stepping up their controls, seems baffling.</p> <p>Similarly, on 12 March, Johnson abandoned both containment and nationwide testing and tracking. A week later, the status of the pandemic <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1932\">was lowered</a>, which meant that the government could reduce the standard of personal protective equipment required in hospitals, and could shift infectious patients into non-specialist care. Again, there was no medical or scientific justification for this decision.</p> <p>Exercise Cygnus, a pandemic simulation conducted in 2016, found that the impacts in care homes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/revealed-the-secret-report-that-gave-ministers-warning-of-care-home-coronavirus-crisis\">would be catastrophic</a> unless new measures were put in place. The government insists that it heeded the findings of this exercise and changed its approach accordingly. If this is correct, by allowing untested patients to be shifted from hospitals to care homes, while failing to provide the extra support and equipment the homes needed and allowing agency workers to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/agency-staff-were-spreading-covid-19-between-care-homes-phe-found-in-april\">move freely within and between them</a>, it knowingly breached its own protocols. Tens of thousands of highly vulnerable people were exposed to infection.</p> <p>In other words, none of these are failures of knowledge or capacity. They are de-preparations, conscious decisions not to act. They start to become explicable only when we recognise what they have in common: a refusal to frontload the costs.

      "bodyText": "The government is considering adding an extra bank holiday to the UK calendar this year, potentially around the school half-term holiday in October. The idea has been proposed by the official tourist agency VisitBritain to help extend the season and make up for lost earnings from two bank holiday weekends in May caused by the coronavirus shutdown. Patricia Yates, the acting chief executive of VisitBritain, told MPs on the Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee that the tourism sector expected to lose \u00a337bn from the impact of Covid-19. Downing Street said the government was \u201csupporting the tourism industry during this challenging time\u201d, and would respond to VisitBritain\u2019s proposal in due course. A spokesman added: \u201cIt is worth acknowledging that an extra bank holiday comes with economic costs.\u201d VisitBritain believes there will be a \u00a315bn drop in income from visitors coming to Britain from overseas, combined with \u00a322bn from lost domestic tourism. At the start of the year, before the pandemic struck Europe, VisitBritain had estimated the British tourism business would generate income of \u00a3107bn in 2020. Yates told MPs: \u201cEvery time we do the modelling, the figures get worse.\u201d The predicted slump in income for the UK\u2019s tourist sector does not include the impact of a possible 14-day quarantine for all visitors coming to Britain. The tourist organisation welcomed the extension of the government furlough scheme to support businesses which often depend on the summer season for most of their annual income. Yates told the committee that businesses in the tourism sector usually begin trading around Easter, and would therefore need to extend their season beyond September to try to recoup some of the lost trade. \u201cBecause the industry has lost the benefit of the two May bank holidays, I think that\u2019s an idea that is being considered, to have an October bank holiday around half-term, because what we are going to need to do is generate people not just in July and August,\u201d she said. Foreign travel restrictions are expected to remain in place for some time, and the British tourism sector hopes income from domestic visitors will partially offset money that would have been spent by foreign tourists, but Yates cautioned that Britons were reluctant to travel within the UK. \u201cGiven that it has to be the year of domestic tourism, there\u2019s a real job to be done there in convincing people that it is socially responsible to travel and enjoy a holiday, and that it is safe to do so,\u201d Yates said. Samantha Richardson, the director of the National Coastal Tourism Academy, told MPs that the majority of residents in Britain\u2019s coastal communities wanted to see tourism return, but that seaside car parks and toilets had not yet been reopened by local authorities, as physical distancing measures would need to be introduced. VisitBritain is calling on the government for more funding to market Britain to foreign tourists to help lessen the impact of the coronavirus crisis. \u201cAustralia spends more [on tourism marketing] in China than we do internationally, so we are hugely outspent,\u201d said Yates, adding that the official tourist agency in Ireland had asked for its marketing budget to be doubled.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cWe were asked to create a very simple ventilator,\u201d Chris Spicer says. \u201cOne that would ventilate a patient who\u2019d been anaesthetised.\u201d The Covid-19 pandemic was about to take hold, and Spicer and his team were being drafted in to help with a national emergency.</p> <p>Amid the many areas in which Britain was underprepared for the pandemic, one of the main causes for concern was the country\u2019s lack of medical ventilators. With the virus attacking the respiratory systems of those infected, just 8,000 machines existed in hospitals throughout the UK. Bracing itself for the worst healthcare crisis in its history, the NHS estimated that 30,000 ventilators would be needed to cope with the rising number of intensive care patients.</p> <p>More than 20 companies \u2013 including Ford, Rolls-Royce, McLaren and Siemens UK \u2013 formed the Ventilator Challenge UK Consortium, set up with the aim of producing medical equipment by using existing technological designs from Smiths Medical and Penlon, with materials and parts in current use in their industries.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a massive challenge,\u201d says Spicer. \u201cWe\u2019d never done anything like it before. It\u2019s also a highly emotional project. Everyone has someone in a vulnerable category \u2013 my grandmother is 95, lives in a care home, and is currently in hospital [although she\u2019s just tested negative for the virus].

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe were asked to create a very simple ventilator,\u201d Chris Spicer says. \u201cOne that would ventilate a patient who\u2019d been anaesthetised.\u201d The Covid-19 pandemic was about to take hold, and Spicer and his team were being drafted in to help with a national emergency. Amid the many areas in which Britain was underprepared for the pandemic, one of the main causes for concern was the country\u2019s lack of medical ventilators. With the virus attacking the respiratory systems of those infected, just 8,000 machines existed in hospitals throughout the UK. Bracing itself for the worst healthcare crisis in its history, the NHS estimated that 30,000 ventilators would be needed to cope with the rising number of intensive care patients. More than 20 companies \u2013 including Ford, Rolls-Royce, McLaren and Siemens UK \u2013 formed the Ventilator Challenge UK Consortium, set up with the aim of producing medical equipment by using existing technological designs from Smiths Medical and Penlon, with materials and parts in current use in their industries. \u201cIt was a massive challenge,\u201d says Spicer. \u201cWe\u2019d never done anything like it before. It\u2019s also a highly emotional project. Everyone has someone in a vulnerable category \u2013 my grandmother is 95, lives in a care home, and is currently in hospital [although she\u2019s just tested negative for the virus]. That was a real driver, thinking, if that was your father or your granny in that scenario, how could you make that little bit of a difference?\u201d The starting point for Spicer, as project manager, was how to problem-solve under pressure and with social distancing in place. \u201cWe thought: \u2018What\u2019s a new way of thinking?

      "bodyText": "Time for a quick recap: Britain\u2019s labour market has deteriorated sharply as the Covid-19 pandemic, and lockdown, pushes the economy into recession. The number of vacancies in the UK economy pretty much halved in April, and the claimant joint surged over 2 million, in a clear sign that UK unemployment will rise sharply in the next few months. UK chancellor Rishi Sunak - whose furlough scheme is currently protecting millions of jobs - warned that the country faces a severe downturn, with no guarantee of a quick recovery. Economists predicted that the jobless total would rise, and pay would decline, in the coming months. Energy firm Ovo slashed over 2,000 jobs, and luggage-maker Antler fell into administration, as the pandemic continued to hit sectors of the economy hard. Pizza Express made a cautious attempt to restart business, by reopening 13 London restaurants for delivery only in the next 10 days. Fund manager Schroders warned that the impact of the crisis would last many years, hitting confidence and scarring the economy. The World Bank also weighed in, saying private creditors were being too slow to help the world\u2019s poorest countries. As if it didn\u2019t have enough problems, budget airline easyJet reported it had suffered a huge hack attack. Goodnight. GW Back in Washington, US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin has declared that people who refuse to return to work during the Covid-19 pandemic should lose the right to unemployment benefit. Mnuchin is also being pressured to ensure that companies who take help from the government don\u2019t then lay workers off. After a mixed days trading, European stock markets have closed lower - mostly. The EU-wide Stoxx 600 dipped by 0.5%, handing back a small chunk of yesterday\u2019s rally. Utility firms, energy companies, and telecoms operators led the fallers. FTSE 100: down 46 points or 0.7% at 6,002 German DAX: up 18 points or 0.17% at 11,077 French CAC: down 40 points or 0.9% at 4,458 Italian FTSE MIB: down 366 points or 2% at 17,034 Spanish IBEX: down 170 points or 2.5% at 6,609 David Madden of CMC Markets says stock markets bulls have \u2018taken a breather\u2019, partly due to signs of resistance to the Franco-German proposal of a new Covid-19 recovery package. Stock markets in Europe are in the red as traders\u2019 book some of their profits from yesterday\u2019s massive gains. In the past 24 hours the outlook hasn\u2019t really changed, but equities have handed back some of the ground that was made yesterday. Economies around the global are still being reopened, and hopes remain high for a potential Covid-19 vaccine, but it seems like the bulls have decided to take a breather today. It might transpire that today\u2019s negative move was just a slight retracement before the next leg higher. France and Germany are backing a \u20ac500 billion rescue plan for Europe \u2013 which would hand out grants to regions struggling with the Covid-19 crisis. A number of Northern European countries, like the Netherlands, are not keen on the scheme as they would prefer to see loans being issued. While the divisions over the plan continues, sentiment is unlikely to be positive. Our economics editor, Larry Elliott, warns that the jump in UK unemployment in April is just the start...there could be much worse times ahead. Crunch time for the labour market will come between the start of August, when the government wants employers to start paying a portion of wage subsidies, and the end of October, when the furlough scheme is due to end completely. At present, many companies are not laying off staff because the Treasury is picking up the tab for 80% of monthly pay up to a limit of \u00a32,500. If severe lockdown restrictions are still in place, Rishi Sunak will have a tough choice: extend the scheme or see the UK suffer a second wave of job losses. The pressure on the chancellor to at least keep furloughing for sectors most affected by social distancing \u2013 hospitality, leisure and retailing \u2013 will be considerable. UK fund manager Schroders has warned today that the economic impact of Covid-19 pandemic could last for many years, long after the outbreak has passed. In a new report, chief economist Keith Wade examines how previous pandemics often lasted for many years -- leaving \u201cdeep scars\u201d on those who survive. Those households and businesses will be more cautious, keener to save and more cautious about spending. Wade writes: Studies of the economic effects of pandemics point to significant long run effects. Growth and returns on assets are depressed for a considerable period of time, up to 40 years after the pandemic has passed. Those studies cover outbreaks stretching back to the Black Death of the 14th century up to the H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic of 2009. Covid-19 is most frequently compared with the Spanish flu of 1918-19, an outbreak that claimed 40 million lives, or 2% of the world population implying 150 million deaths when applied to today\u2019s population. Fortunately, better health systems and government action to suppress the virus mean that the current outbreak should not be anywhere near as fatal. Nonetheless, although governments may ultimately succeed in curtailing the health impact, the economic effects and debt costs are significant. Wade also argues that Covid-19 will accelerate existing economic trends - meaning lower interest rates, higher healthcare spending, rising populism and accelerated technological change. More here. Back in the City, the FTSE 100 is once again struggling to hold onto the 6,000-point mark. The blue-chip index is now down 80 point, or 1.3%, at 5966. Tobacco firm Imperial Brands is the top faller, down 7%, with utility firms also dropping. Investors are taking their cue from Wall Street, where the Dow is still in the red. Strong sales results from Walmart have been balanced by weaker figures from retail chains Home Depot and Kohl\u2019s, who both missed forecasts. Over in Westminster, UK chancellor Rishi Sunak is warning that the UK faces a steep recession due to the Covid-19 pandemic, and probably a slow recovery too. He told the House of lords economic committee that: It is not obvious that there will be an immediate bounce back. It takes time to get back to the habits that they had. There are still restrictions in place. Even if we can re-open retail, which I would very much like to be able to do on 1 June, there will still be restrictions on how people can shop, which will have an impact likely on how much they spend. Our main UK liveblog has more details. The US stock market has opened a little lower, after Monday\u2019s monster rally. The Dow Jones industrial average has dipped by 143 points or 0.5% to 24,454, after leaping by over 900 points on Monday. Investors seem to be a little more cautious, having got caught up in excitement about Moderna\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine trials yesterday (going well, but early days!). Much to my surprise, economic confidence in Germany has jumped to a five-year high. At least, that\u2019s what ZEW, the economic think tank, has found. Its index of economic sentiment has rocketed to 51.0 in May from 28.2 in April, indicating confidence that things will get better later this year. However, things are pretty grim now. The assessment of the current economic situation, however, slumped to minus 93.5 in May, from minus 91.5 points in April. Here\u2019s some reaction. Ben Chu of the Independent shows how vacancies in the UK, and claims for unemployment benefit, both moved dramatically last month: The World Bank president David Malpass has expressed his frustration that the private sector creditors of poor countries have failed to join the governments of richer nations in providing emergency debt relief. Last month, the G20 group of developed and developing nations announced a moratorium on debt payments until the end of 2020 and urged commercial creditors to embrace the idea too. Malpass said the participation of private creditors had been \u201cfrustratingly slow\u201d and that they were still taking debt payments from the poorest countries - many of whom have been badly hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. His remarks came as the World Bank warned that an extra 60m people would be plunged into extreme poverty this year, wiping out the human development gains of the past three years. Malpass said the debt relief would free up crucial resources for the world\u2019s poorest countries and urged them to come clean about how the money was being spent. \u201cThis will increase the confidence in the investment climate and encourage more beneficial debt and investment in the future.\u201d Malpass said the World Bank was expecting the global economy to shrink by 5% this year - a sharper decline than the 3% predicted by the International Monetary Fund last month - but was helping 100 countries to protect poor people, bolster health systems and boost the chances of economic recovery. The Bank has set a target of increasing its lending to poor countries by $160bn by the middle of next year. Malpass said an initial $6bn had been dispersed. Over in Washington, US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin has predicted that America\u2019s economy will recover in the second half of 2020. But in testimony to the Senate, Mnuchin also predicts large unemployment numbers and other negative economic indicators during the second quarter. He says: \u201cWorking closely with governors, we are beginning to open the economy in a way that minimizes risks to workers and customers. We expect economic conditions to improve in the third and fourth quarters.\u201d America\u2019s labor market has been hit particularly hard since the pandemic began, with 36 million people filing new \u2018initial jobless claims\u2019. The Covid-19 lockdown is buffeting troubled high street chain French Connection. French Connection, which closed all its 68 stores and concessions in March, says it will run out of cash within the next few months unless it secures a cash injection or sees an improvement in sales soon. Compass Group, the world\u2019s biggest catering firm,has unveiled plans to raise \u00a32bn from investors to shore up its finances, as the schools, offices and sporting venues it previously supplied with food remain largely closed. After soaring yesterday, European stock markets are a more mixed picture today. The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 has dropped by about 0.5% to 6020 points, having surged over 4% on Monday. Italy and Spain\u2019s markets have dropped by around 2% Yeterday\u2019s rally was driven by biotech firm Moderna reporting early Covid-19 vaccine success, and Germany and France surprisingly backing a new \u20ac500bn rescue fund backed by collective borrowing. Bill Blain, market strategist at Shard Capital, argues that this European recovery fund isn\u2019t big enough to tackle the economic crisis in the region. What the agreement is\u2026. is a commitment by France and Germany to allocate the European Union budget in the form of grants to the \u201cworst-hit regions and sectors.\u201d What \u20ac500bnn of budget looks like \u2013 is a significant underspend. If the US is spending upwards of $3 trillion, then the years of austerity damage to Europe\u2019s soft underbelly require a similar, if not greater amount.\u201d Chris Giles of the Financial Times has picked out the key warning signs in today\u2019s UK unemployment report - namely the drop in vacancies and hours worked. Housing and homelessness charity Shelter has warned that the huge jump in unemployment benefit claims in April will be followed by a spike in evictions. Shelter fears that many of the 857,000 people who joined the claimant count list are now struggling to pay their rent. Under the government\u2019s emergency legislation, tenants who fall into rent arrears are protected from eviction until late June - but campaigners say more protections are needed. Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, says the government must increase benefit levels quickly, or face a surge of evictions: \u201cWith a huge surge in people applying for benefits and early warning signs of major job losses to come, it\u2019s clear that Covid-19 is going to send shockwaves through our economy like never before. \u201cWe know from our services that thousands of renters are suddenly scrambling to stay afloat, and for those who\u2019ve become unemployed, the furlough scheme is no help at all. Many are turning to Universal Credit in a desperate bid to pay their rent but are quickly finding out housing benefit levels are too low to break their fall. \u201cPeople paying average rents face huge shortfalls and many are racking up serious debts that put their homes at risk. Without more support, they will be swept up in a tidal wave of evictions when the government ban lifts. To prevent this, housing benefit must be increased to cover average rents and the benefit cap lifted \u2013 to give people a fighting chance.\u201d Newsflash: Budget airline easyJet has suffered a cyber attack affecting nine million of its customers. In a statement to the City, easyJet says that a \u201chighly sophisticated source\u201d accessed its systems, exposing the email addresses and travel details of approximately 9 million people. They are now being contacted by the airline over the next week. In addition, the credit card details of 2,208 customers were also accessed. EasyJet has already contacted these customers to alert them, and offer support. The airline says: There is no evidence that any personal information of any nature has been misused, however, on the recommendation of the ICO [Information Commissioner\u2019s Office], we are communicating with the approximately 9 million customers whose travel details were accessed to advise them of protective steps to minimise any risk of potential phishing. We are advising customers to continue to be alert as they would normally be, especially should they receive any unsolicited communications. We also advise customers to be cautious of any communications purporting to come from easyJet or easyJet Holidays. We\u2019re sorry that this has happened, and we would like to reassure customers that we take the safety and security of their information very seriously. NIESR, the think tank, has predicted that UK pay packets will fall in the months ahead as the Covid-19 pandemic continues, particularly in the private sector. They\u2019ve analysed this morning\u2019s unemployment data, and found signs that the government\u2019s furlough scheme is limiting job losses, but leading to pay cuts: In the final week of March, the total number of hours worked was around 25% smaller than in other weeks within the quarter. This reflects the large number of people being furloughed. Furloughing has helped to limit the rise in unemployment. The unemployment claimant count rose by 850,000 to 2.10 million in April. The number of vacancies fell to 351,000 in April, from 750,000 in March. By early May a quarter of paid employees had been furloughed, with 80 per cent of their pay (up to \u00a32,500 per month) being met by the government. This will mean that measured average earnings will fall in the short term, reflecting the lower pay of those who have been furloughed. An early sign of this was that median monthly pay fell by \u00a355 in April to \u00a31789 per month. Pay growth had been running at over 3% per annum, but the 2.5% month-on-month drop in April shows that earnings are now falling (although not yet on an annual basis) Garry Young, Deputy Director of NISER, explains: \u201cThe extent of the economic fallout from Covid-19 is becoming clearer. Many businesses are under severe financial pressure and are only able to retain staff because of the government\u2019s furlough scheme which is currently supporting 7\u00bd million jobs. Despite this, claimant unemployment rose above two million in April, the highest level since 1996, and it is very likely that we will see falls in pay in the months ahead.\u201d NIESR also predict that private sector employees will be hit harder than the public sector, where many essential workers are employed. By June, total private sector pay (including bonuses) could be falling by 4.5% per year, it estimates, while public sector pay will be broadly flat. UK luggage brand Antler has fallen into administration, making it the latest corporate victim of the Covid-19 crisis. Antler, which was founded in 1914, has suffered a slump in demand for its suitcases, carry-on bags and travel sets since travel restrictions were imposed. Antler employed nearly 200 people, but 164 have been made redundant by restructuring firm KPMG which took control of the firm. Will Wright, partner at KPMG and joint administrator, says the shutdown on the high street and the cancellation of most flights triggered Antler\u2019s collapse. \u201cAlthough the business was trading well prior to the virus outbreak, restrictions imposed at the start of the lockdown period prompted the closure of Antler\u2019s retail and wholesale outlets, while the impact on international travel has also significantly affected sales,\u201d said \u201cWith uncertainty over the lifting of travel restrictions placing further financial strain on the business, the directors concluded that they had no option but to appoint administrators.\u201d The UK\u2019s unemployment problems have deepened this morning with Ovo Energy, Britain\u2019s second biggest energy supplier, announcing 2,600 job cuts and several office closures around the UK. The move is at least partly driven by the pandemic, which has forced Ovo to stop checking customers\u2019 energy meters, for example. But it also follows Ovo\u2019s recent acquisition of SSE\u2019s household supply division in a \u00a3500m deal. My colleague Julia Kollewe explains: The decision comes just four months after Ovo bought SSE\u2019s retail division for \u00a3500m, instantly increasing its customer base from 1.5m to 5m homes. Announcing the cuts on Tuesday, Ovo said the Covid-19 pandemic had accelerated a shift in customer behaviour, with more people going online, which had permanently reduced the need for some functions and roles. The job losses will affect gas engineers, electricians, meter readers, and call centre staff and the company will close its offices in Glasgow\u2019s Waterloo Street, Selkirk and Reading. Jobs are also expected to go at offices in Perth, Cumbernauld and Cardiff. The GMB union accused Ovo of betrayal, saying it had promised that there would be no job losses after the takeover of SSE\u2019s retail business. Peter Briffett, CEO of the income streaming provider Wagestream, fears the UK is heading for \u201cseventies-style unemployment\u201d, with vacancies vanishing just as more people seek work. \u201cNot only are people losing their existing jobs, but the prospect of finding a new job is decreasing sharply as employers dig in for a turbulent few years ahead. The claimant count soaring to over 2m suggests a new generation are facing a potentially long time without work or, as people during the latter stages of the 20th Century referred to it, on the dole. \u201cUnsurprisingly, the hospitality sector has been hit especially hard, and could take many years to recover from the impact of Covid-19.\u201d Resolution Foundation have tweeted a handy thread of the key charts from today\u2019s UK labour market report, including the drop in employees, the rise in the claimant count, the plunge in vacancies, and the drop in pay last month. They also flag up that younger workers have been hit hard by the downturn: Here\u2019s our economics correspondent Richard Partington on today\u2019s UK unemployment report: The number of people claiming unemployment benefits increased by the most since records began in April to reach almost 2.1 million, according to official figures capturing the onset of the coronavirus crisis. The Office for National Statistics said about 856,500 people signed up for universal credit and jobseeker\u2019s allowance benefits in April, driving up the overall UK claimant count by 69% in a single month. Economists said the surge marked the biggest monthly increase since comparable records began in the early 1970s, while the overall number of people claiming for benefits due to unemployment had risen above 2 million for the first time since 1996. The first official attempts to gauge the economic fallout from the coronavirus crisis also revealed the number of employees on company payrolls plunged by 450,000 at the start of April, in a reflection of staff being let go and reduced hiring. The number of vacancies posted by companies looking for new staff also halved. More here: Amid all the gloom, we shouldn\u2019t forget that the UK unemployment rate did dip to 3.9% in January-March (nearly its lowest levels since the 1970s). The employment rate hit at a joint-record high of 76.6% in the first quarter of 2020 too, the ONS reports. That may feel like another age, before Covid-19 hit the global economy. But minister for employment Mims Davies MP argues it\u2019s an encouraging sign, as the UK looks to recover from the coronavirus shock. Here\u2019s her take on today\u2019s unemployment figures: \u201cClearly these figures are behind on our current struggle but the impact of this global health emergency is now starting to show \u2013 and we\u2019re doing everything we can to protect jobs and livelihoods. \u201cWhat these statistics do highlight is that heading into the pandemic, we had built strong foundations in our economy, which will be crucial as we gradually move forward as the lockdown eases and look to bounce back.\u201d You can read more about the drop in vacancies here on the ONS website [Figure 2 shows how they halved in April]. The drop in pay in April is covered here [in the \u201cMedian monthly pay\u201d section] Early estimates suggest the number of hours worked in Britain collapsed in the last two weeks of March, with the amount of time spent working collapsing to around 25% below normal levels. Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the ONS, said: \u201cThis is a huge fall, and evidence of employers either putting staff on furlough and/or cutting the hours of those still working.\u201d More bad news (sorry): The number of vacancies in the UK appears to have halved in April. Today\u2019s preliminary labour market data shows there were probably roughly 350,000 unfilled positions across the economy last month. That\u2019s down from 750,000 in March, and even lower than during the depths of the financial crisis. Again, that\u2019s a staggering slump, showing how parts of the economy basically froze as the lockdown was enforced and non-essential businesses halted work. The ONS says: Whilst the experimental single-month estimates should not be considered accurate estimates of vacancies in the reported months, it does indicate a decrease of approximately 50% of vacancies compared with the estimate in March 2020. Large slumps in vacancies were reported in accommodation and food service activities (as restaurants, pubs and hotels closed), arts, entertainment and recreation (as sporting events were cancelled, parks locked, and cinemas shuttered), wholesale and retail trade (as shops closed) and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles (as non-essential driving was curbed). Nye Cominetti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, says Britain faces its worst unemployment crisis this century: \u201cToday\u2019s figures highlight the speed and scale of Britain\u2019s job crisis. Employee numbers have fallen by nearly half a million in just one month, while the number of vacancies has halved. \u201cThese shocking figures would be far worse were it not the Job Retention Scheme, which has so far protected 7.5 million jobs. \u201cBut even despite widespread furloughing, Britain could still be facing the highest unemployment levels it has had in over a quarter of the century.\u201d The poorer parts of the UK are being hurt particularly badly by the spike in unemployment. The Institute for Employment Studies has crunched through this morning\u2019s data, and found that in Blackpool, one in nine residents (11%) are now claimant unemployed, up from 7% in March. One in eleven residents are claimant unemployed in Middlesbrough, South Tyneside, Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Thanet. You can see this experimental data for April yourself here. Claimant unemployment has increased fastest in the North West (up by 3.1 percentage points), the North East (3.0) and Northern Ireland (2.9). It has increased least in the South East and the East of England (both up by 2.1%), the IES adds. Tony Wilson, Director of the Institute for Employment Studies, explains: \u201cThese figures give us the first official confirmation of what we\u2019ve known for some time, which is that unemployment is rising faster now than at any point in our lifetimes. But they also paint a deeply worrying picture about how the crisis is playing out across the country \u2013 with clear evidence now emerging that those areas that were worst off before the crisis have seen the biggest rises in unemployment. If anything, today\u2019s data underplays the depth of the crisis that we\u2019re in, as it only counts those who had successfully claimed benefits for unemployment as at 9 April, so excluding many young unemployed and more recent claimants. In reality, unemployment today is likely to already be close to three million. With millions of UK workers now furloughed, it\u2019s no surprise that the number of hours worked has dropped - by the most in a decade. The ONS explains: Between January to March 2019 and January to March 2020, total actual weekly hours worked in the UK decreased by 12.4 million, or 1.2%, to 1.04 billion hours. This was the largest annual decrease since November 2009 to January 2010. The decrease in total actual weekly hours worked over the year was mainly driven by the decrease in men\u2019s total hours worked (down 16.0 million hours). Jonathan Reynolds MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, says the surge in the claimant count shows the severity of the UK\u2019s economic crisis. He warns: \u201cUnfortunately these claimants will now discover the UK has one of the weakest out of work safety nets in the developed world. We support the changes the Government has made so far during the outbreak, but they do not match the scale of the crisis. Labour is pushing the government to make \u201cfive immediate changes to our social security system to make sure no one is forced into hardship,\u201d Reynolds adds. They are: Convert Universal Credit advances into grants instead of loans, ending the five-week wait Remove the \u00a316,000 savings limit which disqualifies individuals from accessing Universal Credit Suspend the benefit cap Abolish the two-child limit in Universal Credit and tax credits Uprate legacy benefits to match the increase in Universal Credit, providing an immediate increase in Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance and Employment Support Allowance The UK government has warned that unemployment will rise sharply in the months ahead. Reuters has the details: Britain said on Tuesday that people should be prepared for unemployment to increase significantly after the number of people claiming unemployment benefits in Britain soared to its highest level since 1996. The claimant count rose by 856,500 - the biggest ever month-on-month leap - to 2.097 million, a 69% increase, the Office for National Statistics said. \u201cI think we should be prepared for the unemployment rate to increase significantly,\u201d Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey told BBC radio. In another blow, pay also fell in April. The ONS estimates that median monthly pay in April fell to \u00a31,789 - down from \u00a31,844 in March. That\u2019s a drop of almost 3% month-on-month. The UK government is currently paying 80% of the wages of furloughed workers, up to \u00a32,500 per month. Employers can make up the difference, but don\u2019t have to. The number of job vacancies in the UK has tumbled, in another sign that the labour market is weakening fast. The ONS estimates there were 637,000 vacancies in the UK in February to April 2020 -- 170,000 fewer than the previous quarter. This is the biggest fall since this data series began in 2001. The previous record was 106,000 in the three months to January 2009, after the financial crisis. The Claimant Count increased dramatically in the South West - where claims almost doubled during April. The West Midlands had the smallest increase, but even here the number of people receiving people receiving universal credit and jobseekers allowance rose by over 50% Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. We start with some bad economic news: the number of people claiming unemployment benefits in the UK jumped sharply last month, and the number in work fell, as the Covid-19 lockdown hit the economy Preliminary data just released by the Office for National Statistics show that the UK claimant count surged in April by around 856,000, a rise of 69% in a single month. That lifted the claimant count to nearly 2.1m people, from 1.24m in March. That\u2019s an astonishing increase: economist Rupert Seggins has calculated that it\u2019s the biggest monthly rise since at least the early 1970s. The ONS points out that these are early estimates - they don\u2019t have all the data for April, so it could be revised. Plus, the government has relaxed the rules to allow more people to claim Universal Credit benefits if they\u2019re affected by Covid-19 - which could also push the claimant count up. But it\u2019s clear that the labour was hit hard by the coronavirus last month. In another blow, the ONS has also reported that the number of paid employees in the UK dropped by around 457,000 people in April. That takes the total down to around 28.557 million from just over from just over 29 million in March. That\u2019s a drop of around 457,000 people, or over 1.5%, in a single month. And it shouldn\u2019t include workers who have been furloughed. Early estimates for April 2020 also indicate that median monthly pay fell by 0.9% compared with the same period of the previous year The ONS has also reported that the UK unemployment rate dropped in January-March to 3.9%, lower than expected. But that doesn\u2019t include the impact of the measures taken in mid-March to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Details and reaction to follow....

Seven of the 10 F1 teams are based in the UK \u2013 if the quarantine restrictions were imposed it would make the British GP untenable and planning any calendar difficult.</p> <p>The government is taking advice from a ministerial group and scientific advisers. A DCMS spokesperson said no decision had yet been made but that it was likely to be announced before the end of this week. It was also confirmed that Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, was in favour of F1\u2019s exemption.</p> <p>With the decision looming, F1 made its position clear on Tuesday. \u201cIf all elite sport is to return to TV, then exemptions must be provided,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cA 14-day quarantine would make it impossible to have a British Grand Prix this year. Additionally, it has a major impact on literally tens of thousands of jobs linked to F1 and supply chains.\u201d</p> <p>F1\u2019s intention is to create a closed biosphere for personnel at races. All those attending would be tested for coronavirus before leaving and then every three days at the meeting, while attempting to achieve the minimum of interaction with local communities.</p> <p>It is believed the government does not look favourably on granting exemptions for sport for fear it would face similar demands from other sectors. If the quarantine is imposed it is understood F1 will look to host two races at Hockenheim in Germany to replace the double-header at Silverstone and immediately after Austria, before teams return to the UK and enter quarantine.</p> <p>Should the restrictions remain in place, travel to the other European meetings would be made similarly complex by enforced two-week break periods.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The fate of this year\u2019s British Grand Prix, and the calendar for Formula One\u2019s return to racing in general, is likely to be decided by the end of this week. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport is waiting on a decision on whether certain sports will be granted exemptions from government plans to impose a 14-day quarantine on entry into the UK. It is expecting a decision in the next few days. DCMS is arguing in favour of F1 being given dispensation to travel freely, subject to specific requirements. F1 plans to open the season on 5 July with two races on back-to-back weekends in Austria, followed by a double-header at Silverstone with meetings on 26 July and 2 August. Seven of the 10 F1 teams are based in the UK \u2013 if the quarantine restrictions were imposed it would make the British GP untenable and planning any calendar difficult. The government is taking advice from a ministerial group and scientific advisers. A DCMS spokesperson said no decision had yet been made but that it was likely to be announced before the end of this week. It was also confirmed that Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, was in favour of F1\u2019s exemption. With the decision looming, F1 made its position clear on Tuesday. \u201cIf all elite sport is to return to TV, then exemptions must be provided,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cA 14-day quarantine would make it impossible to have a British Grand Prix this year. Additionally, it has a major impact on literally tens of thousands of jobs linked to F1 and supply chains.\u201d F1\u2019s intention is to create a closed biosphere for personnel at races. All those attending would be tested for coronavirus before leaving and then every three days at the meeting, while attempting to achieve the minimum of interaction with local communities. It is believed the government does not look favourably on granting exemptions for sport for fear it would face similar demands from other sectors. If the quarantine is imposed it is understood F1 will look to host two races at Hockenheim in Germany to replace the double-header at Silverstone and immediately after Austria, before teams return to the UK and enter quarantine. Should the restrictions remain in place, travel to the other European meetings would be made similarly complex by enforced two-week break periods.",

      "bodyText": "Brazil has overtaken the United Kingdom to become the country with the third-highest number of confirmed coronavirus infections, amid warnings from its former health minister that three painful months lie ahead. Latin America\u2019s largest economy has now recorded 254,220 cases, placing it behind only the United States and Russia, and ahead of the UK, which on Monday had 247,706. Meanwhile, in Mexico \u2013 the region\u2019s No 2 economy \u2013 allegations that Covid-19 deaths were being dramatically undercounted added fuel to an increasingly acrimonious political battle over the government\u2019s response to the pandemic. Brazil has officially suffered 16,792 Covid-19 deaths \u2013 the world\u2019s sixth-highest number \u2013 although underreporting and low testing rates mean the true figure is likely to be considerably higher. One leading newspaper, O Globo, has claimed that Brazil\u2019s former health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, feared the death toll could eventually reach 150,000. Despite the intensifying public health crisis, Brazilian front pages continue to be dominated by the political turmoil engulfing the far-right presidency of Jair Bolsonaro. Two health ministers have left Bolsonaro\u2019s administration in the space of a month, with the latest, Nelson Teich, resigning last Friday after clashing with the president. Teich\u2019s predecessor, Mandetta, was sacked in mid-April after publicly questioning Bolsonaro\u2019s flouting of social distancing guidelines. In an interview with the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper on Monday, Mandetta painted a bleak portrait of the situation his country faced. \u201cThe health ministry is a ship that has lost its way,\u201d Mandetta said, warning that Brazil was only two months into a traumatic five-month period that would only begin normalizing in September. Mandetta predicted at least three major cities \u2013 Manaus and Bel\u00e9m in the Amazon and Fortaleza in the north-east \u2013 would have to impose lockdowns because of the rapid spread of the coronavirus. Authorities in Manaus have been forced to dig mass graves for Covid-19 victims because of the soaring number of deaths. Bolsonaro\u2019s deliberate undermining of social distancing and quarantine measures has sparked outrage and seen opposition to his government rise \u2013 although the rightwing populist continues to boast a hardcore of support. Miguel Lago, the director of Brazil\u2019s Institute for Health Policy Studies, said he feared the political upheaval was compromising efforts to save lives. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible to see that Brazil is more worried about politics than with health \u2026 It\u2019s absurd that in the middle of a humanitarian crisis we are discussing petty politics so much,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think this is Bolsonaro\u2019s strategy,\u201d Lago added, arguing that the president was trying to distract from and disown the negative human and economic impact of the pandemic. \u201cThere are many important discussions we should be having. How can we fight the economic crisis? How can we fight the health crisis? How can we improve our health system during and after the coronavirus crisis? How can we deal with the loss of 10% of our GDP? But none of those discussions are taking place. All we are discussing is politics,\u201d Lago complained. The pandemic has also become the subject of a bitter political row in Mexico, which has so far officially registered 51,633 coronavirus infections and 5,332 deaths. But a review of death certificates in Mexico City published by investigative journalists suggests an undercounting of Covid-19 deaths by a factor of three \u2013 at a time when the country is preparing to reopen and the president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, is speaking confidently of \u201ctaming\u201d the coronavirus. Reporters from the anti-graft group Mexicans Against Corruption and Impunity gained access to Mexico City death certificates and found 4,577 cases where physicians listed the probable or possible cause of death as Covid-19 or coronavirus. That figure is more than triple the 1,332 confirmed deaths in Mexico City that are acknowledged by the federal government. The investigation follows a series of stories alleging that Mexico is undercounting its Covid-19 deaths. Mexico City\u2019s government has denied any deliberate undercounting and the country\u2019s coronavirus tsar, Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell, has admitted Mexico probably has more than eight times more Covid-19 deaths than officially recorded. \u201cWe have a bureaucratic and Jurassic system for data capture,\u201d said Xavier Tello, a physician and healthcare analyst, offering a partial explanation for the difficulties in compiling the Covid-19 death toll. Information is often handwritten, he added, and prone to errors and discretion. \u201cWe have a 21st-century pandemic, followed by 1980s means.\u201d On Tuesday, L\u00f3pez Obrador again dismissed criticism of his government\u2019s response. \u201cFor us, the strategy has been successful,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus pandemic continued to grip much of the world on Tuesday, as cases grew from India to South Africa and Brazil overtook the UK to become the country with the third-highest number of confirmed infections. The US, Russia and Brazil now top the international table for confirmed cases, followed by the UK, Spain and Italy. Brazil has reported over 250,000 infections despite limited testing. Hospital officials say more than 85% of intensive care beds in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo are full. Brazil accounts for more cases than any other country in Latin America, which has seen 480,000-plus cases and 31,000 dead. Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has snubbed physical distancing rules and has called for gyms, hair salons and other businesses to reopen. Two of Bolsanaro\u2019s health ministers have resigned in a month after falling out with the president. According to opinion polls about two thirds of Brazilians agree with quarantines and support public health measures introduced by regional governors to slow the disease\u2019s spread. According to Johns Hopkins University global cases have now surpassed 4.8 million. The death toll stands at 318,534. India has topped 100,000 cases. Iran \u2013 which saw a drop-off in April \u2013 has seen infections increase in May. The surge in Latin America and Asia came as European countries continued to soften Covid-19 restrictions. On Monday, Italy permitted cafes, restaurants and bars to reopen for the first time in two months. Worshippers went back to churches and local markets sold produce. People across 70% of Spain are now allowed to eat or drink on terraces outside restaurants and bars, and the city council in Barcelona announced that locals will be able to return to the sand to sunbathe from Wednesday. They will be able to make \u201crecreational use\u201d of the Catalan capital\u2019s beaches, as long as they respect physical distancing, according to the deputy mayor for safety, Albert Batlle. However, people will not be allowed to swim and must spend no longer than an hour on the beach. The Madrid region, the Barcelona metropolitan area and parts of of Castilla y Le\u00f3n are still in the preliminary phase of lockdown de-escalation, and accounted for the majority of the new deaths and hospital admissions over the past 24 hours.

Of the 166 people admitted to hospital for the virus over the previous 24 hours, 67 of them were in Madrid and 38 in Catalonia. The government has announced the wearing of face masks is to be compulsory as it prepares to seek a fifth, two-week extension of the state of emergency that has been in effect since 14 March. \u201cMasks will be obligatory on public transport \u2013 as they already are \u2013 but also in enclosed spaces and on the streets if the minimum safety distance of two metres can\u2019t be observed,\u201d the government said in a statement.

These include: cheaper gas and electricity, a highly skilled workforce, reduced red tape, greater collaboration between research and industry, support to commercialise \u201cgood ideas\u201d, improved access to export markets and \u201clower taxes and a stronger economy\u201d. \u201cOne of the other areas which I believe is crucial is simplifying red tape and regulation to fast-track interaction with all levels of government. \u201cThat\u2019s perhaps the biggest positive impact we can make without further demand on taxpayer support.\u201d Andrews says it is \u201cnot good enough\u201d that \u2013 according to Manufacturing Australia \u2013 a factory can be approved and built in the US in less time than it can be approved in Australia. \u201cI see a big role for governments in streamlining those processes and facilitating new project approvals or upgrades.\u201d Government should \u201cfacilitate rather than over-regulate\u201d, Andrews says, suggesting that the national cabinet process can help \u201creduce the hurdles businesses face when they are seeking to invest\u201d. The minister proposes aligning government programs, so that governments are not \u201cduplicating\u201d or competing with each other to attract industry, wasting taxpayer funding. Andrews says the government will not nationalise industries or propose government ownership, but cites a $215m manufacturing modernisation fund as a measure to \u201cback businesses that back themselves\u201d. Andrews says Australia should focus on areas of comparative advantage including mining and agriculture technologies, minerals processing, food and beverage manufacturing and \u201careas of national priority\u201d including pharmaceuticals, medical technology, defence, energy, space, waste and recycling. Andrews says the Covid commission is \u201cfeeding into the strong work my department and I have put in over the past 18 months\u201d. On Monday Jane Halton, a commissioner of the Covid commission, said the body would \u201cturn our focus to what is actually going to get our economy kickstarted\u201d. \u201cWhat we want to be able to see is an increase in productivity in our economy,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we will be working with the government on what some of those ideas might be.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s the trade dispute that has soured relations between Australia and China and threatens a $500m a year blow to the Australian economy. But what is at the heart of China\u2019s decision to slap 80% tariffs on Australian barley exports? And will Australia follow through on its threats to go to the trade umpire to challenge the decision? How important is China to Australia\u2019s barley industry? China is the largest export market for Australian barley, where it is used to make beer and feed livestock, so the tariffs are likely to bring significant pain to the industry. China imported 2.5m tonnes of barley from Australia last financial year, which is down from a peak of 5.9m tonnes in 2016-17, but still very significant. Industry data show China made up more than half of Australian barley exports in 2018-19. The next biggest export market was Japan, with 746,000 tonnes, while other (much smaller) destinations were Vietnam, Thailand, South Korea and the Philippines. The Australian grain industry has warned the new tariffs will at the very least disrupt, but more likely completely halt, shipments of barley to China because the impost will drive the price up to prohibitive levels. \u201cIt is estimated this dispute could cost Australian grain industry and notably rural and regional economies at least $A500m per annum,\u201d a statement issued by Australian grain industry groups said. Pat O\u2019Shannassy, the chief executive of Grain Trade Australia, warned that the impact would be broad and \u201cthere will be additional reverberations through regional economies\u201d. Why is China imposing tariffs on Australian barley? There has been a lot of speculation about the role of Australia\u2019s strong advocacy for an independent investigation into the origins and early handling of the coronavirus outbreak, a stance that has attracted strong pushback from China, which interpreted it as a political \u201cmanoeuvre\u201d against Beijing. But the official reasons for the tariffs are much more mundane, and stem from investigations China launched in late 2018. Australia\u2019s trading practices have \u201ccaused material injury\u201d to China\u2019s domestic barley industry, according to two determinations published by China\u2019s commerce ministry on Monday. The main issues cited are \u201cdumping\u201d \u2013 when a product is sold at a lower price overseas than it is in the country where it is produced \u2013 and government subsidies. Which companies are named? China\u2019s commerce ministry has specifically named four companies, including the Iluka Trust, a family farming business in the south coast of Western Australia whose crops include barley, canola and wheat. The named companies are Kalgan Nominees Pty Ltd, JW &amp; JI Mcdonald &amp; Sons, and Haycroft Enterprises. Industry sources have told Guardian Australia these are farming businesses that represent just a small subset of the country\u2019s barley growers. Even though those four farming businesses are named in the anti-dumping announcement, China\u2019s move also applies broadly to \u201call others\u201d \u2013 and is levied at the import stage of the process. Any companies importing barley from Australia will pay the same 73.6% duty from 19 May onwards. In addition, a tariff of 6.9% will be applied across the board based on claims the Australian industry gained an unfair advantage from government subsidies. How long will the exporters be affected? The new tariffs are to be imposed for a period of five years starting from 19 May 2020 \u2013 although there is a provision for affected parties to seek an interim review. How has the Australian government responded so far? The Australian government and the industry strongly reject the Chinese commerce ministry\u2019s recent findings on dumping and subsidies. The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, said, for example, it was \u201ccompletely ridiculous\u201d for the Chinese government to consider measures such as Murray-Darling Basin infrastructure upgrades as a type of subsidy to barley exporters, when the bulk of the barley production was in Western Australia and South Australia and involved dry-land farming. But what are Australia\u2019s options? In the first instance, the Australian government will keep trying to lobby the Chinese government to cancel the tariffs. It plans to spend the next couple of days talking with the Australian farming sector and industry to work out the next steps. Birmingham said it was \u201cvery disappointing that China has, to date, refused to schedule minister-to-minister discussions\u201d as this would be the best way to resolve disagreements. But if there is no breakthrough, he has made clear that the government would \u201creserve our rights\u201d when it came to seeking to having the dispute resolved through the World Trade Organization. The agriculture minister, David Littleproud, said the government was \u201cserious\u201d about the possibility of going to the WTO, noting it had previously taken Canada to the global trade umpire over wine and had taken India to the body over sugar. What are the downsides of a WTO referral? Taking action through the WTO is not a quick fix, because such disputes can drag on for years and the top appellate body\u2019s functioning has been under strain as the US has blocked appointments. The freeze had led Australia to work with China and the European Union in recent months to set up a temporary mechanism to rule on disputes, replicating the WTO\u2019s top umpire\u2019s functions. China has been the third most active member in the WTO\u2019s dispute settlement system, having been involved in 65 disputes between 2002 and 2019. In two-thirds of those disputes, China was the respondent, according to analysis by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). China had a high-profile victory late last year when an WTO arbitrator ruled China could impose tariffs on up to $3.6bn of American goods over a US failure to abide by anti-dumping rules. But according to the CSIS ChinaPower Project, Beijing has a \u201cmixed record of compliance with WTO dispute rulings\u201d because in some cases it has found creative ways to demonstrate legal compliance \u201cwhile sidestepping the spirit of certain decisions\u201d. What other factors could be behind the move? The move comes amid broader tensions over Covid-19, but the Australian government says it takes at face value the Chinese government\u2019s claims that there is no link. There is, however, increasing attention on China\u2019s announcement last week that it would immediately allow barley imports from the US, which was seen as a measure to meet commitments in the first phase of Beijing\u2019s trade deal with Donald Trump. In January, China pledged to buy an extra $US200bn of American farm products and other goods and services over two years. On Tuesday the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, called on the government to seek clarity from the US about the arrangements \u201cand whether that has disadvantaged Australia\u201d. The move last week was framed by Chinese state media as a potential problem between Australia and the US, with the Global Times asking: \u201cIf US agricultural products take over Australia\u2019s share in the Chinese market, then who is the antagonist of Australian businesses, China or the US?\u201d However, the US produced just a third as much barley as Australia did in 2018, according to data compiled by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. And China\u2019s own domestic barley output is small: 1.5m tonnes a year, compared with 9.3m tonnes in Australia in 2018. China imported a total of 8.9m tonnes of barley in 2017 \u2013 indicating it heavily relies on barley sourced from overseas rather than its small domestic market.",

Johnson rolled the dice and began to unlock \u2013 at least for England, while Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/stay-alert-or-stay-home-how-covid-19-lockdown-rules-differ-across-uk\">stuck with the \u201cstay home\u201d</a> recommendation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/19/distanced-drop-offs-and-protective-bubbles-englands-new-school-rules\">Distanced drop-offs and protective bubbles: England's new school rules</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The verdict on each man\u2019s decision may take months but the extent of divergence is already apparent.</p> <p>On Monday, when Ireland started phase one of its gradual easing, new daily cases had tumbled to about 11% of the country\u2019s late April peak.</p> <p>When England started its first phase five days earlier on 13 May, new daily cases had fallen but were still about 75% of its late-April to early-May peak.</p> <p>There was another stark difference. Ireland started lifting lockdown only after testing and contact-tracing systems were fully scaled up. England took the plunge before its systems were ready.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d say it was recklessly premature,\u201d said Se\u00e1n L\u2019Estrange, a social scientist at University College Dublin, who has <a href=\"http://www.ucd.ie/sociology/t4media/Testing%20Matters.pdf\">written </a>about testing and studied tracing. \u201cI honestly fear [the level of cases in the UK] will go up fast in the coming weeks.\u201d</p> <p>That was especially concerning because the UK appeared to lack sufficient testing and contact-tracing capacity for such a surge, said L\u2019Estrange. \u201cPerhaps they can get it up and running quickly. But they\u2019re behind the curve and playing catch-up. You have to have sufficient testing and contact-tracing capacity ready to go before you ease restrictions. They\u2019ve put the cart before the horse. They released the virus without having the apparatus in place to control it, and they\u2019ve released it at a high level.\u201d</p> <p>Ireland\u2019s lockdown easing started after England\u2019s and is scheduled to go more cautiously and slowly, with the last phase starting on 10 August, and schools opening in September. England\u2019s plan envisages schools starting to open on 1 June and the final phase of lifting starting on 4 July.</p> <p>John Edmunds, a professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Sage, the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, told the House of Lords science committee on Tuesday that the decision about schools was political. \u201cIt is not a scientific decision. Scientists can offer some advice.\u201d</p> <p>Downing Street has defended its lockdown exit strategy as science-based and an expression of confidence in the public\u2019s ability to \u201cstay alert\u201d while returning to work and interacting with others.</p> <p>This week Matt Hancock, the health minister, announced that everyone over the age of five in the UK with symptoms could now be tested for coronavirus. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, said the government had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/17/uk-contact-tracing-applicants-wrongly-told-hiring-paused-in-latest-misstep\">recruited 17,000 contact tracers</a> \u2013 on course to reach its 18,000 target \u2013 and that the first tracers started work on Monday.</p> <p>However, L\u2019Estrange fears the system will struggle because as the public becomes more mobile, the number of infections and number of contacts for each infected person rises. \u201cOnce you\u2019re allowed out and about again the chance of you getting infected increases and so does your number of contacts. That\u2019s why you need lots of surplus at the time of release.\u201d</p> <p>The UK is betting heavily on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/nhs-preparing-to-roll-out-covid-19-contract-tracing-app-by-end-of-may\">contact-tracing app</a> that has been trialled on the Isle of Wight and is due for national rollout at the end of May.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Ireland has been working on a similar app that relies on Bluetooth technology but officials are now playing down its importance amid privacy concerns and other obstacles. Both governments may end up dropping the technology, said L\u2019Estrange. \u201cI suspect the app is a white elephant.\u201d</p> <p>An <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/369/bmj.m1932\">editorial</a> in the British Medical Journal this week excoriated the UK\u2019s record on testing and tracing. \u201cMeaningless political soundbites promising to recruit 18,000 contact tracers, test 200,000 people a day, or invest in unjustified contact tracing apps, divert focus and could lead to more deaths. These headline grabbing schemes should be replaced by locality-led strategies rooted in communicable disease control,\u201d it said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Earlier this month Leo Varadkar, Ireland\u2019s taoiseach, and Boris Johnson, Britain\u2019s prime minister, each faced a fraught dilemma. Coronavirus infection rates were falling and the economic devastation from lockdowns was rising, tilting the calculus towards easing restrictions. But some experts said it was too soon, that infection rates were still too high, that testing and contact-tracing systems were not ready and that the pandemic would roar back. Varadkar extended Ireland\u2019s lockdown to 18 May. Johnson rolled the dice and began to unlock \u2013 at least for England, while Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland stuck with the \u201cstay home\u201d recommendation. The verdict on each man\u2019s decision may take months but the extent of divergence is already apparent. On Monday, when Ireland started phase one of its gradual easing, new daily cases had tumbled to about 11% of the country\u2019s late April peak. When England started its first phase five days earlier on 13 May, new daily cases had fallen but were still about 75% of its late-April to early-May peak. There was another stark difference. Ireland started lifting lockdown only after testing and contact-tracing systems were fully scaled up. England took the plunge before its systems were ready. \u201cI\u2019d say it was recklessly premature,\u201d said Se\u00e1n L\u2019Estrange, a social scientist at University College Dublin, who has written about testing and studied tracing. \u201cI honestly fear [the level of cases in the UK] will go up fast in the coming weeks.\u201d That was especially concerning because the UK appeared to lack sufficient testing and contact-tracing capacity for such a surge, said L\u2019Estrange. \u201cPerhaps they can get it up and running quickly. But they\u2019re behind the curve and playing catch-up. You have to have sufficient testing and contact-tracing capacity ready to go before you ease restrictions. They\u2019ve put the cart before the horse. They released the virus without having the apparatus in place to control it, and they\u2019ve released it at a high level.\u201d Ireland\u2019s lockdown easing started after England\u2019s and is scheduled to go more cautiously and slowly, with the last phase starting on 10 August, and schools opening in September. England\u2019s plan envisages schools starting to open on 1 June and the final phase of lifting starting on 4 July. John Edmunds, a professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Sage, the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, told the House of Lords science committee on Tuesday that the decision about schools was political. \u201cIt is not a scientific decision. Scientists can offer some advice.\u201d Downing Street has defended its lockdown exit strategy as science-based and an expression of confidence in the public\u2019s ability to \u201cstay alert\u201d while returning to work and interacting with others. This week Matt Hancock, the health minister, announced that everyone over the age of five in the UK with symptoms could now be tested for coronavirus. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, said the government had recruited 17,000 contact tracers \u2013 on course to reach its 18,000 target \u2013 and that the first tracers started work on Monday. However, L\u2019Estrange fears the system will struggle because as the public becomes more mobile, the number of infections and number of contacts for each infected person rises. \u201cOnce you\u2019re allowed out and about again the chance of you getting infected increases and so does your number of contacts. That\u2019s why you need lots of surplus at the time of release.\u201d The UK is betting heavily on a contact-tracing app that has been trialled on the Isle of Wight and is due for national rollout at the end of May. Ireland has been working on a similar app that relies on Bluetooth technology but officials are now playing down its importance amid privacy concerns and other obstacles. Both governments may end up dropping the technology, said L\u2019Estrange. \u201cI suspect the app is a white elephant.\u201d An editorial in the British Medical Journal this week excoriated the UK\u2019s record on testing and tracing. \u201cMeaningless political soundbites promising to recruit 18,000 contact tracers, test 200,000 people a day, or invest in unjustified contact tracing apps, divert focus and could lead to more deaths. These headline grabbing schemes should be replaced by locality-led strategies rooted in communicable disease control,\u201d it said.",

      "bodyText": "The UK government has banned large corporations that access its revamped Covid-19 bailout loan scheme from paying shareholder dividends after it raised the borrowing limit from \u00a350m to \u00a3200m. Ministers said investors should not benefit directly from dividend payouts when firms borrow from the more generous coronavirus large business interruption loan scheme, to be launched next week. Companies that use the extended scheme will also face restrictions on the bonus payments to board directors and the level of share buybacks during the period of the loan. The move comes after the Treasury faced criticism for allowing Tesco to pay a \u00a3635m dividend while accepting a similar-sized tax break through the business rates holiday which forms part of the taxpayer-funded emergency coronavirus support package. Business groups welcomed the higher \u00a3200m borrowing limit for the so-called Coronavirus large business interruption loan scheme (CLBILS) \u2013 which had attracted criticism after only 100 firms successfully accessed loans \u2013 saying it filled a gap in the range of rescue measures put in place by the government over the last two months. The Treasury said the extension would ensure organisations that failed to qualify for the Covid corporate financing facility (CCFF) loan scheme managed by the Bank of England would have access to enough finance to meet cashflow needs during the outbreak. But the Treasury\u2019s refusal to ban bonuses outright as a condition of a loan was condemned as \u201cpaying lip service\u201d to concerns that company boardrooms continue to receive large pay awards while millions of workers face pay cuts or redundancy following the lockdown and mothballing of much of the economy. The rules of the revamped scheme allow executives to receive bonus rewards if they are agreed ahead of applying for a loan or if payments are the same level as in previous years. Firms can also continue to maintain share buyback schemes, in effect increasing the value of shares held by investors, after an agreement with the Treasury. Luke Hildyard, the executive director of the anti-poverty campaign group, the High Pay Centre, accused \u201csupine\u201d Treasury ministers of succumbing to business lobbying to protect bonus payments. \u201cBy allowing so many loopholes, the government risks doing little more than paying lip service to entirely understandable concerns about money intended to support jobs and businesses being used to maintain executive bonus payments. \u201cAllowing pay awards to be maintained at historic levels is particularly supine.\u201d The scheme allows company boards to borrow up to 25% of turnover, up to a maximum of \u00a3200m.

Still, she continued showing up to work.</p> <p>Forbes tested Covid-positive just after Easter. Chills, body aches and a fever kept her from attending family dinner that Sunday. By the following weekend, she struggled to breathe and couldn\u2019t walk on her own.

Employees sometimes used trash bags as an added layer of protection, worn over a disposable gown, according to the representative.</p> <p>Forbes appeared to do what she wanted even in her final moments.

After studying in Egypt, Austria and Spain, he immigrated to New Jersey in 1972 and bought Noble Pharmacy a decade later.</p> <p>The pharmacy became a fixture in the community, known as a place immigrants could go for help and advice, often in their native language, as Titi spoke Spanish and German in addition to English and his native Arabic. If they couldn\u2019t afford medication, he would give it to them for free. \u201cAll different types of people from different cultures would come and they would instantly fall in love with him,\u201d Justin says.</p> <p>Active in the local Arab-American community, Titi gave to charity and sent money home regularly.

Filled with grief and gratitude, Karen cried as she peered out of an upstairs window at the glittering lines of cars crawling in both directions past her home. </p> <p><em>\u2013 C</em><em>J</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"665c80451266fcdf7644bdb9c996ae2afd2c00e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/665c80451266fcdf7644bdb9c996ae2afd2c00e4/230_133_645_645/500.jpg\" alt=\"A photo of Debbie Accad\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Debbie Accad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The family of Debbie Accad</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Debbie Accad, 72<br></strong><em>Accad was the \u2018pillar\u2019 of her family back in the Philippines and spent decades caring for US veterans</em></p> <p><strong>Occupation:</strong> Clinical nursing coordinator<br><strong>Place of work:</strong> Detroit VA medical center in Detroit, Michigan<br><strong>Date of death:</strong> 30 March 2020</p> <p>Nurse Divina \u201cDebbie\u201d Accad cared for military veterans for over 25 years and was just a few weeks from retiring when the virus struck.</p> <p>On 16 March, Accad, 72, a clinical nursing coordinator at the Detroit VA medical center, told relatives that she felt ill.

      "bodyText": "America\u2019s healthcare workers are dying. In some states, medical staff account for as many as 20% of known coronavirus cases. From doctors to hospital cleaners and from nursing home aides to paramedics, those most at risk have already helped save thousands of lives. Not all these medical professionals survive their encounters with patients. Hospitals are overwhelmed, workers lack protective equipment and some staff suffer from underlying health conditions that make them vulnerable to this pernicious virus. Health authorities in the US have no consistent way of tallying the deaths of healthcare workers. As of 14 April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 27 deaths among health workers \u2013 but our reporting shows that is likely a vast undercount. Lost on the frontline is a collaboration between the Guardian and Kaiser Health News that aims to document the lives of healthcare workers in the US who die from Covid-19, and to understand why so many are falling victim to the pandemic. These are some of the first tragic cases. We are creating a database and will investigate and record new cases as this project unfolds. Nina Forbes, 56 Memory care nurse worked through the pandemic, despite fears Occupation: Licensed practical nurse Place of work: Silverado memory care facility in Alexandria, Virginia Date of death: 25 April 2020 Nina Forbes refused to let fear stop her from living her life. She was terrified of flying. But a few years ago, Forbes got on a plane for the first time to watch her younger daughter Jennifer play volleyball. Covid-19 also scared Forbes, and as a nurse at an assisted living facility, she knew the virus posed a serious risk. Still, she continued showing up to work. Forbes tested Covid-positive just after Easter. Chills, body aches and a fever kept her from attending family dinner that Sunday. By the following weekend, she struggled to breathe and couldn\u2019t walk on her own. An ambulance took her to the hospital. Her older daughter, Jessica, said her mother didn\u2019t have the necessary protection at work. Forbes sometimes wore trash bags to protect herself, she said. In a statement, a representative for the facility said it met CDC guidelines for personal protective equipment. Employees sometimes used trash bags as an added layer of protection, worn over a disposable gown, according to the representative. Forbes appeared to do what she wanted even in her final moments. Jennifer was able to visit her mother in the hospital, and Forbes died shortly after she left, Jessica said. \u201cIt was like she waited for her to leave.\u201d \u2014 Carmen Heredia Rodriguez Saif Titi, 72 His warmth and generosity brought diverse clients to his pharmacy Occupation: Pharmacist Place of work: Noble Pharmacy in Jersey City, New Jersey Date of death: 7 April 2020 When the pandemic hit, Saif Titi was working six days a week at his Jersey City pharmacy and had no interest in slowing down. As was his way, he wanted to be helpful. \u201cHe didn\u2019t really run it as a business,\u201d says Titi\u2019s son, Justin. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t trying to make profit. He was really just trying to help people.\u201d Titi was born in Jaffa in the last days of British rule in Palestine and grew up a refugee in the Gaza Strip. After studying in Egypt, Austria and Spain, he immigrated to New Jersey in 1972 and bought Noble Pharmacy a decade later. The pharmacy became a fixture in the community, known as a place immigrants could go for help and advice, often in their native language, as Titi spoke Spanish and German in addition to English and his native Arabic. If they couldn\u2019t afford medication, he would give it to them for free. \u201cAll different types of people from different cultures would come and they would instantly fall in love with him,\u201d Justin says. Active in the local Arab-American community, Titi gave to charity and sent money home regularly. A Facebook tribute included dozens of stories of his generosity and mentorship. \u201cWe all lost the sweetest and the most noble man on earth,\u201d wrote one relative. Titi, a father of three and grandfather of two, developed symptoms of Covid-19 in late March. He died in the hospital on 7 April. His wife, Rachelle, also became infected and has taken some six weeks to recover. In quarantine, the family has been unable to grieve together. -Noa Yachot Gerald Welch, 56 Social worker was a \u2018big voice\u2019 in his community Occupation: Social worker and behavioral specialist Place of work: Opportunity Behavioral Health in Reading, Pennsylvania Date of death: 15 April 2020 Donna Welch had sworn she would \u201cnever, ever, ever get married again\u201d. Then Gerald appeared. They met on MySpace, and she quickly realized that \u201cour spirits connected\u201d. On their first date, at Donna\u2019s house in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Gerald proposed \u2013 and Donna said yes. \u201cIt was like he came down on a bolt of lightning from heaven,\u201d she said. Gerald\u2019s fiery passion and courage to speak out served him well as a boardroom advocate for underperforming students in the school district, and at the St Paul Missionary Baptist Church, where he resurrected a scholarship now named in his honor. \u201cHe had a big voice,\u201d Donna said, \u201cand he was not afraid to use it.\u201d His Families, Organizations and Communities United in Service podcast combined Gerald\u2019s lived experience overcoming drugs and his spirituality to support others struggling with addiction. So even as the state\u2019s Covid-19 cases mounted, Gerald was a dutiful companion for his clients with severe autism \u2013 he took them to the supermarket in Lancaster and the laundromat in Lebanon. \u201cWherever they needed to go, he went,\u201d Donna said. \u201cHe cared so much for them, and they loved him dearly.\u201d \u201cWe all did,\u201d she added. \u2015 Eli Cahan Jesus Manuel Zambrano, 54 Dominican pediatrician realized his dream to practice medicine in US Occupation: Pediatrician Place of work: Private practice in Freeport, New York; attending physician at Mount Sinai South Nassau hospital Date of death: 30 March 2020 Jesus Manuel Zambrano studied medicine in his native Dominican Republic and immigrated to New York in the 1990s. He hustled, working in fast food and as a school bus driver between studies, said his wife, Sandra. He completed his residency in 2010. In the meantime, they had two children: Jesus Manuel Jr, 22, and Angelyne Ofelia, 18. Jesus Manuel Jr, who uses a wheelchair, never veered far from his father during family outings to restaurants and parks, and Holy Week vacations. Zambrano\u2019s bond with his son informed his care for his patients. \u201cThere was not a single day we met and talked when we didn\u2019t talk about his son,\u201d said Dr Magda Mendez, a former colleague. Zambrano spent days in private practice, Sandra said, and in the evenings treated others at the hospital, which saw Covid-19 cases. In early March, he felt ill. He took the next day off \u2013 a rare occurrence, Sandra said. He was taken to the hospital where he worked, where he died after a week and a half of care. In becoming a physician in the United States, Zambrano had realized his lifelong dream. He wished the same for his family. \u201cHe had a lot of plans for his children, a lot of dreams,\u201d Sandra said. \u2014 Carmen Heredia Rodriguez Matthew \u2018Matty\u2019 Moore, 52 \u2018Sitting on the sidelines was never in his DNA\u2019 Occupation: Radiologic technologist Place of work: Northwell Health\u2019s GoHealth Urgent Care in Eltingville, Staten Island, New York Date of death: 17 April 2020 Matthew Moore \u201cwould give the shirt off his back to help others,\u201d said his sister, Erin Esposito. A former firefighter and Staten Island native, Matthew Moore volunteered as a first responder for weeks after 9/11, \u201ceven when everyone else stopped going\u201d, Esposito said. Moore was known as \u201ca gentle giant\u201d in Prince\u2019s Bay, his brother-in-law Adam Esposito said. He was a devoted churchgoer and a beloved member of \u201cThe Beach Boys\u201d firehouse (as Engine 161/81 was nicknamed). He even came through as Santa Claus, delivering gifts on Christmas morning to the children of two firefighters who died on 9/11. Moore became an X-ray technologist, cherishing the ability to help those seeking urgent care. When Covid-19 emerged, he continued showing up to work. \u201cSitting on the sidelines was never in his DNA,\u201d Esposito said. At the time, the family was reassured that he was receiving the personal protective equipment he needed. Despite his precautions, when Matty contracted Covid-19, it tore through his lungs, which had been damaged at Ground Zero. As Matty lay dying, Esposito sought to reassure her brother. \u201cYou\u2019ve done enough for us,\u201d she told him, over the phone. Moments later , Matty\u2019s heart stopped beating. \u2015 Eli Cahan David Martin, 52 A family man who loved Disney, he took risks to help others Occupation: Paramedic Place of work: AMR Southwest Mississippi, covering Amite and Wilkinson counties Date of death: 22 April 2020 On 22 March, David Martin changed his Facebook profile picture. Around his smiling face, the frame read, \u201cI can\u2019t stay home \u2026 I\u2019m a healthcare worker.\u201d Outside of work, he was a dedicated family man with two children, known for his love of Disney. Martin, who covered 1,420 square miles across two rural counties, had cared for people with suspected Covid-19 in the weeks leading up to his death, said Tim Houghton, chief of operations for AMR Southwest Mississippi. \u201cWe do what we do knowing the risks,\u201d Houghton said. But he said Martin\u2019s death was \u201ca hard hit\u201d. On 23 March, at the end of a shift, Martin told a supervisor he had mild flu symptoms. A month later, he died at a hospital in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. AMR paramedics had N95 masks and protective gear and followed CDC guidelines, Houghton said. \u201cWe have not yet had a shortage.\u201d In Facebook posts honoring Martin, colleagues described his excitement before trips to Disney World. In his memory, his fiancee, Jeanne Boudreaux, shared a photo of the two of them on a hot air balloon ride at Disney Springs. \u2014 Michaela Gibson Morris Robert Zerman, 49 Quick-witted firefighter \u2018always had your back\u2019 Occupation: Volunteer firefighter Place of work: Pioneer Hose Company No 1 in Robesonia, Pennsylvania Date of death: 16 April 2020 Anyone who met Robert Zerman would see two things: He was devoted to firefighting and emergency medical services, and he had a quick sense of humor. \u201cHe probably went on tens of thousands of calls,\u201d said Anthony Tucci, CEO of the Western Berks Ambulance Association. Tucci, who knew Zerman for over three decades, added, \u201che always had your back, always knew his stuff.\u201d Most recently, Zerman was a volunteer assistant fire chief. He responded to an emergency in March in which the patient had Covid-19 symptoms. \u201cThat was before there was really any guidance to wear PPE,\u201d Tucci said. Soon Zerman became sick, leading the family to suspect that he had contracted the coronavirus on that call, Tucci said. Zerman tested positive and was hospitalized. He seemed to be improving before taking a bad turn. Representatives from two dozen first responder agencies lined the streets for Zerman\u2019s funeral procession. \u2015 Maureen O\u2019Hagan Neftali \u2018Neff\u2019 Rios, 37 \u2018Gentle soul\u2019 had a brilliant mind and big heart Occupation: Registered nurse Place of work: St Francis Hospital\u2019s intensive care unit in Memphis, Tennessee Date of death: 26 April 2020 Hospital colleagues loved working with Neftali \u201cNeff\u201d Rios. He was humble, kind and capable, a \u201cgentle soul\u201d who always strived to learn something new. Not just smart \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m talking extremely intelligent,\u201d his brother Josue Rios said. And he loved people. Neff worked at a small hospital in Clarksdale, Mississippi, then earned his master\u2019s in business administration with an emphasis on health care, and moved to St Francis. He hoped to enter management. In mid-April, he came down with fever, body aches, a terrible cough and tested positive for the virus. Several family members got sick, too. His parents were both hospitalized. On 26 April, Neff collapsed at home, unable to catch his breath. His wife, Kristina, called 911, started CPR and waited for the EMTs. When they arrived, he had already died. The family believes he was exposed at work. A spokesperson for the hospital declined to comment, citing family privacy. \u201cNeff was never scared\u201d of catching the virus at work, Josue said. \u201cYou take an oath to take care of people, no matter what.\u201d \u2014 Maureen O\u2019Hagan Ali Yasin, 67 A hands-on pharmacist who made the big city feel smaller Occupation: Pharmacist Place of work: New York City pharmacy in New York, New York Date of death: 4 May 2020 Ali Yasin was a small-town druggist in a city filled with impersonal, chain-store pharmacies. He managed to operate a robust business and remain on a first-name basis with his customers. Over the years, he became their medical consultant, insurance whisperer and friend. Jen Masser said the first time she stumbled into Yasin\u2019s pharmacy, her arms were covered in hives. \u201cSee someone right away,\u201d Yasin advised. \u201cThis could be a serious disease.\u201d He turned out to be right \u2013 she was ultimately diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. Born in Pakistan, Yasin moved to the US in 1979 and worked in various pharmacies before opening his own in 2001. He ran it with the help of his four sons. In March, after serving customers in hard-hit Manhattan in his typical hands-on manner, Yasin developed a cough and tested positive for Covid-19. By month\u2019s end, he was in the hospital on a ventilator. He died on 4 May. The storefront window of the Yasin family pharmacy is pasted with condolence cards. Zair Yasin, one of his sons, said the outpouring has been immense: \u201cI didn\u2019t realize until he was gone how many people he touched.\u201d \u2013 Kathleen Horan Sheila Faye Christian, 66 Nurse\u2019s death ripples through an extended community Occupation: Registered nurse Place of work: Care Pavilion nursing and rehabilitation center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Date of death: 19 April 2020 So many people are mourning the death of Sheila Christian, her daughter set up a website to comfort them all. Christian was a longtime friend of Tina Knowles-Lawson \u2013 the mother of Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 who posted about her death on Instagram. But Christian was also a superstar at the center where she worked for 26 years and among those who knew her. She was the kind of person who brought lunch to a new co-worker and hosted a baby shower for someone without close family, according to her daughter and a memorial board. At the outset of the Covid-19 crisis, Christian was not given personal protective equipment, her daughter, Courtney Christian, said. She said her mother only received a mask in late March. A lawyer for the rehab center acknowledged Christian\u2019s death and said that the center had followed federal guidelines, but didn\u2019t respond to specific questions. Christian was diagnosed on 2 April. She endured more than a week of fever, chills and coughing, but seemed to be on the mend. She had been cleared to return to work when she collapsed at home. An outpouring of grief followed, her daughter said. \u201cShe just helped and cared for so many people,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople I had never met.\u201d \u2013 JoNel Aleccia Alfredo Pabatao, 68 He tried to reassure his family until the end Occupation: Orderly Place of work: Hackensack Meridian Health Palisades medical center in North Bergen, New Jersey Date of death: 26 March 2020 After 44 years of marriage, Alfredo Pabatao still bought his wife, Susana, flowers. \u201cThey were that type of couple that you rarely see nowadays,\u201d their youngest daughter, Sheryl Pabatao, 30, said. \u201cThey set such a high standard for us, their kids \u2013 that may be the reason why I\u2019m still single.\u201d She said her father was a patient man who could fix just about anything. The Pabataos came from Quezon City, just outside Manila, in the Philippines. Alfredo worked at a car dealership, and Sheryl said she and her siblings grew up comfortably. But the couple wanted more for their five children, and immigrated to the United States in October 2011. \u201cThe first year that we were here, was really, really tough,\u201d Sheryl remembered. Her oldest two siblings, already adults by the time the Pabataos\u2019 immigration application cleared, had to stay behind. Alfredo found a job as an orderly at a hospital in New Jersey, where he worked for nearly two decades. In mid-March, he told his family he had transported a patient with signs of Covid-19; he fell ill days later. (In a statement, his employer wrote, \u201cWe have policies and procedures in place to protect our team members and patients that are all in accordance with CDC guidelines.\u201d) Sheryl said the family\u2019s last conversation with her father was via FaceTime, with him on his hospital bed. Connected to oxygen, he insisted he wasn\u2019t gravely ill. He made jokes and even demonstrated yoga poses to reassure his wife and children. \u2013 Danielle Renwick Susana Pabatao, 64 A \u2018selfless\u2019 mother who \u2018always had the right words\u2019 Occupation: Assistant nurse Place of work: Bergen New Bridge medical center in Paramus, New Jersey Date of death: 30 April 2020 Susana Pabatao became a nurse in her late 40s, after her family immigrated to the United States. It eased some of her longing for her own mother, whom she had left behind in the Philippines, her daughter, Sheryl Pabatao said. \u201cIt helped her to know that she was helping other people \u2013 something that she couldn\u2019t do for my grandmother,\u201d Sheryl said. Susana treated her elderly patients as if they were her own parents, she added. Susana was warm, selfless and a constant source of comfort. Sheryl said, \u201cMy mom always had the right words.\u201d Susana\u2019s husband, Alfredo Pabatao, began showing symptoms of Covid-19 in mid-March, and Susana became ill soon after. Sheryl, who described the two as \u201cinseparable\u201d, said: \u201cWhen my dad got sick, it\u2019s like part of her was not there any more.\u201d Alfredo was hospitalized, and Susana spent her last days at home resting and speaking with him on FaceTime. Sheryl, who lived with her parents, said she overheard the two console each other one morning. \u201cMy mom was telling my dad, \u2018We\u2019ve gone through so many things, we\u2019re going to get through this.\u201d Alfredo died on 26 March. Susana died four days later. \u2013 DR Roy Chester Coleman, 64 At work, church and home, army veteran gave it his all Occupation: Emergency medical technician Place of work: Overton Brooks VA medical center in Shreveport, Louisiana Date of death: 6 April 2020 Shlonda Clark calls her father her \u201cfavorite superhero\u201d. It was one of Roy Coleman\u2019s many roles. For the past 11 years, the army veteran and emergency medical technician worked as a housekeeper at the VA hospital in his home town. He was a church deacon, Sunday school teacher and usher. He also volunteered with special-needs adults. Roy had a big family, with three children, eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. \u201cHe was funny, he was kind, he was giving,\u201d said Mabel Coleman, his wife of 40 years. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t like you, something was wrong with you,\u201d added Clark. Coleman fell ill on 23 March. After three trips to the emergency room, he was admitted on 27 March, with a fever and labored breathing. He tested positive for Covid-19 and died at the hospital where he worked. His family said he was concerned about the lack of personal protective equipment. The VA medical center said by email that it provides protective gear \u201cin accordance with CDC guidelines\u201d. \u2013 Katja Ridderbusch Marsha Bantle, 65 As she lay dying, she asked for other patients\u2019 names so she could pray for them Occupation: Registered nurse Place of work: Signature Healthcare in Newburgh, Indiana Date of death: 1 May 2020 Marsha Bantle\u2019s family begged her to quit after a resident in the nursing home where she worked was diagnosed with Covid-19. But she wouldn\u2019t leave. \u201cMy patients can\u2019t leave their rooms, they can\u2019t see their families. They really need me right now,\u2019\u201d she told her cousin Carol Isaacs. Bantle tried to reassure relatives she would limit her exposure, but on 17 April, her temperature spiked. Bantle, who lived alone, holed up at home. She finally called her family when it was clear she needed to be hospitalized. \u201cThat\u2019s Marsha for you,\u201d her cousin John Isaacs said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t want us to worry.\u201d Even while hospitalized, Bantle was selfless, said Shay Gould, an ICU nurse who cared for her. She offered to turn off her medication pump to save the nurse a trip. She asked for other patients\u2019 names so she could pray for them. After about a week, Bantle had a stroke, probably brought on by the Covid-19 infection. Within days, she died. Since April, the nursing home has had 52 positive cases and 13 Covid-19 deaths, including Bantle\u2019s. In a statement, Signature Healthcare said, \u201cThe loss of any of our residents or staff, for any reason, is devastating.\u201d \u2013 Michelle Crouch Michael Giuliano, 64 An old-fashioned family doctor who still made house calls Occupation: Family practice physician Place of work: Mountainside medical group in Nutley, New Jersey Date of death: 18 April 2020 For 39 years, Michael Giuliano practiced old-fashioned family medicine. He made house calls. He visited his patients in the hospital rather than asking another physician to check in on them. He saw generations of the same family. \u201cSome patients would show up here at the house,\u2019\u201d said Giuliano\u2019s wife, Marylu, a nurse and the office manager of his solo practice. \u201cPatients would call and he\u2019d say: \u2018Come on over, I\u2019ll check you out.\u2019\u201d A father of five and grandfather of four, Giuliano was jovial, with a quirky sense of humor and love of Peanuts characters, especially Charlie Brown. He liked to tell patients, \u201cI\u2019ll fix you up.\u201d \u201cHe treated all of his patients like family,\u201d said Nutley\u2019s mayor, Joseph Scarpelli. When Covid-19 hit the US, Giuliano ordered N95 masks, his family said, but suppliers were out and sent surgical masks instead. Giuliano wore two at a time. The week of 16 March, Giuliano saw four patients with respiratory symptoms who later tested positive for Covid-19. About two weeks later, he tested positive. Giuliano continued to see patients via telemedicine until he was hospitalized. He died 11 days later. \u2013 MC Rosemary Sell, 80 She jumped at the chance to lend her nursing skills to her beloved New York Occupation: Pediatric nurse practitioner Place of work: New York City public schools Date of death: 17 April 2020 Rosemary Sell was a New Yorker through and through. Born in Washington Heights in northern Manhattan, she went to nursing school in Greenwich Village and raised her five boys on the Lower East Side. In the 1960s, she traveled to Berlin, where she worked as a nurse for the British army and met her future husband, Peter. A lifelong love of travel was born. Gregarious and high-energy by nature, she loved meeting new people. \u201cWherever she\u2019d go, she\u2019d make a new friend,\u201d said her son, also named Peter. In later years, Sell spent much of her time in Florida. But she jumped at opportunities to lend her nursing skills to her home city and see her grandchildren and friends. In February, she was contacted by a firm that places nurses on temporary assignments. Her children were concerned about the encroaching pandemic, especially given her age. \u201cBut they need a nurse,\u201d she responded. She traveled to New York to fill in as a nurse at several schools citywide just as the pandemic took hold. The firm, Comprehensive Resources, did not respond to questions on protections for its contractors. Sell began developing symptoms in mid-March, just before the citywide school closure went into effect. She returned home to Florida, where she died from pneumonia caused by Covid-19. Before Rosemary died, she had been hatching her next adventure with a friend: to travel to India. She wanted to see the Taj Mahal. \u2013 Noa Yachot Sheena Miles, 60 A semi-retired nurse, she took on extra shifts as Covid-19 threat grew Occupation: Registered nurse Place of work: Scott regional hospital in Morton, Mississippi Date of death: 1 May 2020 Sheena Miles was semi-retired. She usually worked every other weekend, but as Covid-19 emerged in Mississippi, she worked four weekends in a row in March and April. She told her son, Tom Miles, that it was her duty. The economy where she lived is dominated by poultry plants, and the county has emerged as a coronavirus hotspot. Sheena was diligent with protective gear, wearing her mask and doubling up on gloves, Tom said. She stayed home when she wasn\u2019t working. \u201cLosing Sheena has been a tragic loss, as she had been a part of our hospital for 25 years,\u201d said Heather Davis, a hospital administrator. Sheena became ill on Easter Sunday. By Thursday, Tommy Miles, her husband of 43 years, drove her to the University of Mississippi medical center in Jackson. Two long weeks passed. The family was allowed to say goodbye in person, and on their way into her room, an ICU nurse told them that years ago, Sheena had cared for his infant daughter. \u201c\u2018Your mom saved her life,\u2019\u201d the nurse said. \u201cThat was a little comfort in the storm,\u201d Sheena\u2019s son said. \u2013 Michaela Gibson Morris Steven Perez, 68 An air force doctor, he served in the White House early in his career Occupation: Internal medicine physician Place of work: Medical Center of Annandale in Annandale, Virginia Date of death: 7 May 2020 When George HW Bush announced his 1988 run for the presidency, Steven Perez was one of the doctors who gave him a clean bill of health. An \u201cair force brat\u201d who was born in the UK, Perez served as a flight surgeon and medical director in the air force medical service corps before practicing as a physician in the White House from 1986 to 1990, according to a statement from his family. \u201cIt was the honor of his life,\u201d his son, Benjamin Perez, said. Perez went into private practice in San Antonio, Texas, in the early 90s before opening his own clinic in northern Virginia. He also taught at the University of Virginia. According to his family, he made a promise to God and \u201cnever refused medical aid to the poor who came to his office, even accepting yams as payment on occasion\u201d. Perez\u2019s family describes him as a proud grandfather to his three grandchildren (with two more on the way); he loved the University of Southern California Trojan football, the Dallas Cowboys and the Nationals. \u201cHe could make anyone laugh, knew just what to say, and showed profound love for his friends and family,\u201d his family wrote in an obituary. \u201cEvery person he met felt like they were the reason he was there.\u201d \u2013 DR Linda Bonaventura, 45 Lighthearted nurse \u2018lit up the room\u2019 Occupation: Licensed practical nurse Place of work: Wildwood healthcare center in Indianapolis, Indiana Date of death: 13 April 2020 Even on bad days, Linda Bonaventura\u2019s lighthearted sense of humor made people feel better, her sister Alisa Bowens said. Bonaventura dedicated her career to children with special needs and seniors. She did her best to keep her spirits up while working 16-hour days. \u201cWe like to say she was laughter,\u201d Bowens said. \u201cShe lit up the room.\u201d In a statement, Ethan Peak, executive director of Wildwood, called Bonaventura a dedicated nurse who \u201cwould do anything for her residents and co-workers\u201d. As the list of patients and employees with Covid-19 grew longer at Wildwood, Bonaventura refused to live in fear, Bowens said. Bowens recalled the day her sister confessed she was spraying herself with Lysol to kill the germs on her clothes. She did the same for a co-worker. A Wildwood spokesperson said the nursing home had sufficient personal protective equipment for employees. The sisters, in one of their last conversations, told each other they would be at peace if death came during the pandemic. A short time later, Bonaventura tested positive. Just a week after coming down with a sore throat and fever, she died. \u201cShe believed in fate,\u201d Bowens said. \u201cWe shared that belief. But it was still a shock.\u201d \u2013 Cara Anthony Marilyn Howard, 53 \u2018She was a mother to many\u2019 Occupation: School nurse Place of work: Spring Creek community school in Brooklyn, New York Date of death: 4 April 2020 Marilyn Howard was known for her generosity and for never missing a party. Born in Guyana, she came to the US as a teenager. She helped raise her five brothers and put her own ambitions on hold for them. \u201cShe was a mother to many,\u201d her brother Haslyn said. In her mid-30s, she turned to her own career goals. She started university and steadily racked up four different nursing degrees. She had recently begun studying to become a nurse practitioner. Howard, who lived in Queens, New York, was a school nurse in Brooklyn, where she regularly treated children with chronic illnesses associated with poverty. The week before schools closed, a fellow nurse had a fever and a cough. Days later, Howard developed the same symptoms. After initially improving, she took a sudden turn on 4 April. As her brother drove her to the hospital, her heart stopped. She was declared dead at the hospital. In tribute, hundreds turned out on Zoom to mark Nine-Night \u2013 a days-long wake traditional to the Caribbean \u2013 where loved ones shared photos, sang songs and recounted Marilyn\u2019s impact on their lives. The pandemic has since ripped through Marilyn\u2019s extended family, infecting at least a dozen relatives. (One cousin was hospitalized but has since been released and is recovering.) The family has evolved into a sprawling triage team, monitoring one another\u2019s temperatures, delivering food, charting emergency contacts and nearby hospitals. Howard\u2019s brothers said they wanted to start a foundation in her name to help aspiring nurses in the US and West Indies. \u201cThe best way to honor her spirit and her memory is to bring more nurses into this world,\u201d said her brother Rawle. \u201cWe need more Marilyns around.\u201d \u2013 Noa Yachot Jesus Villaluz, 75 He took the time to put patients at ease Occupation: Patient transport worker Place of work: Holy Name medical center in Teaneck, New Jersey Date of death: 3 April 2020 After Jesus Villaluz died from Covid-19 complications, colleagues lined the hallway at Holy Name medical center in Teaneck, New Jersey, to say goodbye. They\u2019d never done that for anyone else. \u201cJesus knew many and meant a lot to all of us, so this gesture felt like the right thing to do,\u201d said Nicole Urena, a hospital spokesperson. The hospital and surrounding Bergen county have been hit hard by the pandemic. By 8 May, Holy Name had treated more than 6,000 Covid patients, 181 of whom died. Villaluz worked at Holy Name for 27 years. In a Facebook post, the hospital memorialized Villaluz\u2019s generosity: he once won a raffle and shared the winnings with colleagues, an anecdote the New Jersey governor, Phil Murphy, later repeated. Family members declined requests for an interview. A co-worker, Hossien Dahdouli, said Villaluz\u2019s compassion was exemplary. He never rushed anyone, took the time to chat with patients and was always concerned for their privacy and safety, Dahdouli said. Years ago, after a stressful day caring for ICU patients, Dahdouli asked Villaluz why he always appeared so happy. \u201cHe said, \u2018My worst day at work is better than someone\u2019s best day as a patient.\u2019\u201d \u2013 Anna Almendrala Sean Boynes, 46 The pharmacist didn\u2019t want to let patients down Occupation: Pharmacist Place of work: AbsoluteCare medical center and pharmacy in Greenbelt, Maryland Date of death: 2 April 2020 When the coronavirus began circulating in the Washington DC region, Sean Boynes went to work. \u201cPatients need their medicine,\u201d he told his wife, Nicole. The medical center where he worked bills itself as \u201ca medical home for the sickest of the sick\u201d; many of its patients struggle with chronic illness and poverty. Boynes was the Greenbelt branch\u2019s first pharmacist. He was an \u201cincredible, loving guy\u201d, said Dr Gregory Foti, chief of innovative operations at AbsoluteCare. Boynes was a proud Howard University alumnus and had three degrees \u2013 a BS in biology, a master\u2019s in exercise physiology and a doctorate in pharmacy \u2013 from the institution. In early March, Boynes and his wife began feeling sick. Boynes didn\u2019t want to stop working but thought \u201ctaking a sick day might be OK\u201d, Nicole said. He also took a break from being a jungle gym to his eight- and 11-year-old girls. Nicole called him \u201cSuper Dad\u201d. Nicole got better, but Sean, who had asthma, saw his breathing deteriorate. On 25 March, Nicole dropped him at the hospital doors. The medical staff confirmed that he had Covid-19. The family never saw him again. Foti said AbsoluteCare follows CDC recommendations, such as providing staff with face masks, and declined to comment on where Boynes was infected. He said \u201cit was literally impossible to tell\u201d where Boynes had contracted the virus. To honor him, AbsoluteCare is naming the Greenbelt pharmacy after Boynes. \u2013 Sarah Jane Tribble John Careccia, 74 A spry EMT, he made \u2018the ultimate sacrifice\u2019 Occupation: Emergency medical technician and rescue squad chief Place of work: Woodbridge Township Ambulance and Rescue Squad in Iselin, New Jersey Date of death: 17 April 2020 \u201cThat\u2019s not the way you throw a curveball!\u201d John Careccia famously told his grandson at a family picnic, according to his daughter, Toni Lorenc. Careccia then threw the ball so wide that it broke a window in her shed. \u201cThat\u2019s how you throw the batter off,\u201d he said, brushing off the mishap. \u201cTypical Pop-Pop,\u201d Lorenc said. \u201cHe had so much confidence in himself.\u201d Careccia, who worked for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for 30 years, brought this confidence with him into a second career. In 1993, after two medics saved his son\u2019s life, he became a volunteer EMT. An enthusiastic educator, he taught CPR, mentored young EMTs, and gave catechism classes at his church, Lorenc said. A spry 74, Careccia responded to 911 calls as chief of his rescue squad. On 25 March, he evaluated a patient who had Covid-19, said Ed Barrett, squad president. Careccia died of Covid-19 several weeks later. At his firehouse memorial service, Careccia was summoned over a loudspeaker for his \u201clast call\u201d. \u201cHaving heard no response from Chief Careccia, we know that John has made the ultimate sacrifice,\u201d said Steve Packer, a former squad president. \u201cHis leadership, dedication, compassion and friendship will be greatly missed.\u201d \u2013 Melissa Bailey Nancy MacDonald, 74 She came back from retirement and contracted Covid-19 Occupation: Receptionist Place of work: Orchard View Manor, a nursing home and rehabilitation center in East Providence, Rhode Island Date of death: 25 April 2020 Nancy MacDonald tried retiring, but she couldn\u2019t make it stick. For 20 years, she was a middle school teaching assistant and cheerleading coach. At home, she loved painting rocks and watching shows like Blue Bloods and American Idol. She was married and had two adult children. A lifelong Rhode Islander, Nancy was a people person, her daughter, Bethany MacDonald, said. \u201cShe always wanted to help others.\u201d So in 2017, she went back to work, this time at a nursing home. As Orchard View\u2019s Covid-19 case count grew, MacDonald worried. Still, she kept coming in \u2013 washing and reusing her N95 respirator and having her temperature taken daily. A spokesperson for Orchard View said the facility had \u201cextensive infection control\u201d, satisfying government guidelines. He would not say how often employees received new N95 respirators. On 13 April, MacDonald began coughing. By 16 April, she was hospitalized and diagnosed with Covid-19. She died 10 days later \u2013 almost a week after she had last spoken with her daughter. \u201cI said, \u2018Mama, we love you,\u2019\u201d Bethany said. \u201cThe last words she said to me were, \u2018I love you, too.\u2019\u201d \u2013 Shefali Luthra Kevin Graiani, 56 Police officer turned nurse practitioner was pursuing a doctorate Occupation: Family nurse practitioner Place of work: Rockland medical group in Garnerville, New York Date of death: 30 March 2020 Kevin Graiani had always wanted to work in healthcare, according to Dennis Graiani, one of his three sons. But his mother told him he needed a pension, so he became a cop. Graiani, who grew up in the Bronx, served five years on the New York City housing authority police force, then 15 on a suburban police force in Spring Valley, New York. He was a \u201cbrilliant officer\u201d, said Lt Jack Bosworth of Spring Valley. Known for his dry sense of humor, Graiani often rattled off quotes from movies. He played bagpipes for the Rockland county Police Emerald Society. When he retired from police work, he began nursing school and became a nurse practitioner in 2018. Graiani, who worked at a private practice, became sick on 10 March and was later diagnosed with Covid-19, Dennis said. He loved learning and was set to finish classes this summer for his doctorate of nursing practice, said Lynne Weissman, his professor and program director at Dominican College. He was an \u201cextremely bright student\u201d with a 3.7 GPA, Weissman said. She has nominated him for a posthumous degree. \u2013 MB Anjanette Miller, 48 A nurse who was living out her dream of working in the United States Occupation: Registered nurse Places of work: Community First medical center and Kindred Lakeshore in Chicago, Illinois and Bridgeway Senior Living in Bensenville, Illinois Date of death: 14 April 2020 As a child, Anjanette Miller dreamed of becoming a nurse and immigrating to the United States. She studied in her native Philippines and worked briefly in Saudi Arabia before fulfilling her wish in 2001. Miller settled in Chicago, dividing her time between three care facilities, where she worked as a supervising nurse. Her sister, Venus Donasco-Delfin, said Miller was dedicated to her job and got along well with co-workers who shared her work ethic. \u201cAt work, I think she was strict, but beyond work, she\u2019s a great friend,\u201d Donasco-Delfin said. She said Miller, one of five siblings, was the \u201cpillar of the family\u201d and supported relatives back home. \u201cI studied psychology for two years, but she kept calling me \u2013 and it\u2019s a long-distance call from the US to the Philippines \u2013 and said, \u2018No Venus, you\u2019re making the wrong decision. You have to pursue nursing. You will make a difference,\u2019\u201d she said. Donasco-Delfin, who now lives in Canada, became a nurse. Miller started feeling sick in mid-March and was diagnosed with Covid-19 in early April. She self-isolated at home, where she chronicled her illness on YouTube and Facebook, imploring healthcare workers to take Covid-19 seriously. She was hospitalized on 5 April and died nine days later. A few years before she died, Miller told her family she had hoped to retire early and move back to the Philippines, where she wanted to pursue her other passion, film-making. Last year she traveled back home to shoot scenes for a project. \u201cThe movie she was making is about her life story,\u201d Donasco-Delfin said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not finished yet.\u201d \u2013 Danielle Renwick Joshua Bush, 30 A nursing student, he and his wife shared a love for travel Occupation: Licensed practical nurse Place of Work: Benton House of Aiken in Aiken, South Carolina Date of Death: 17 April 2020 Joshua Bush never let his wife, LaKita, forget that she was five hours late for their first date. \u201cHe never held back telling the truth,\u201d LaKita said. They met online in 2011, each attracted to the other\u2019s lust for travel. For Joshua\u2019s 30th birthday, they took a cruise to Bermuda. He yearned to go farther afield to Tokyo to revel over anime. Joshua began his nursing career after high school, eventually ending up at Benton House of Aiken, an assisted living facility. Joshua and LaKita, who works in human resources for a hospital, both fell ill in late March, but initially thought they were experiencing allergies. Benton House had no confirmed Covid-19 cases at the time, LaKita said. Even still, the staff was taking precautions. A doctor prescribed Joshua flu medication, but his symptoms \u2013 fever and aches but no cough \u2013 worsened, and he was admitted to a hospital in Augusta, Georgia, on 4 April. \u201cThat was the last time I saw him alive,\u201d LaKita said. Over the next few days, both tested positive for the coronavirus. Joshua was sedated in the hospital for two weeks and died on 17 April. LaKita recovered at home. Joshua was earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in nursing at the University of South Carolina-Aiken. May would have marked the couple\u2019s fifth anniversary. \u2013 Sarah Varney Tomas Pattugalan, 70 His children wanted him to retire, but he wasn\u2019t ready to slow down Occupation: Internal medicine physician Place of work: Private practice in Jamaica, Queens, New York Date of death: 29 March 2020 Tomas Pattugalan\u2019s kids had been encouraging him to retire. But even after practicing medicine for 45 years, he wasn\u2019t ready to slow down. \u201cHe loved his patients. He loved to work. He loved to help others,\u201d said Giancarlo Pattugalan, his son. \u201cHe had an enormous capacity to give of himself.\u201d A father of three, Pattugalan grew up in the Philippines and emigrated to the US in the 1970s. He was a devout Catholic who attended Mass weekly and a \u201ckaraoke master\u201d, Giancarlo said. In early March, Pattugalan began testing patients for Covid-19. His medical history, including a family history of strokes and high blood pressure, heightened his own risk. So after the tests of two patients returned positive, he got tested himself. On 24 March, he learned he had the coronavirus. \u201cHe made a joke and said Prince Charles had tested [positive] too, and he was sharing royalty,\u201d Giancarlo said. \u201cHe was making light of it, not trying to get any of us worried.\u201d Pattugalan had a cough. Then came wheezing. His oxygen levels dropped. He tried hydroxychloroquine, an experimental treatment touted by Donald Trump that has yielded mixed results. Nothing helped. On 29 March, at his family\u2019s urging, Pattugalan agreed to seek hospital care. He died that day. \u2013 SL Maurice Dotson, 51 His Facebook page portended tragedy Occupation: Certified nursing assistant Place of work: West Oaks nursing and rehabilitation center in Austin, Texas Date of death: 17 April 2020 Maurice Dotson\u2019s sister knew something was wrong when her older brother didn\u2019t post his daily Facebook update. \u201cWe knew he was good as long as he posted every morning,\u201d Felicia Dodson-Hill said. Dodson-Hill, who lives in Arkansas, said her brother kept in touch with his family via Facebook. He often posted affirmations, memes and inspiring quotes. Dotson, 51, a veteran certified nursing assistant, had begun caring for patients with Covid-19. (According to his employer, \u201csafety protocols to protect against Covid-19 at West Oaks have been in place since early March\u201d.) On 1 April, his family in Arkansas couldn\u2019t reach him. Two days later, he went to the hospital, where he was tested but sent home, he told Dodson-Hill. Her mother reached him a few days later. He barely had the energy to speak, Dodson-Hill said. Dotson\u2019s cousin, Dawunna Wilson, said that Dotson called an ambulance on 8 April. The next day he was diagnosed with Covid-19. \u201cFrom there, it was pretty much downhill,\u201d she said. \u2013 Sharon Jayson Karen Carmello, 57 Her death blindsided her family Occupation: Licensed practical nurse Place of work: Maryhaven Center of Hope in Port Jefferson Station, New York Date of death: 16 April 2020 During the workweek, Karen Carmello lived alone in a condo in order to shorten her commute. But she called home every day to speak with her 26-year-old son. Steven, who lived at home with his parents, would recount everything he did in precise detail \u2013 a feature of his autism spectrum disorder \u2013 as she listened intently. \u201cShe could do no wrong in his eyes, ever,\u201d her husband, Vincent Carmello, said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very special bond, but it\u2019s one that she earned.\u201d Her work with intellectually disabled patients and others relied on that sensitivity. When Karen became ill, she discovered that a patient in her ward had tested positive for Covid-19. (Her employer did not respond to requests for comment.) She was hospitalized on 23 March. Eight days later, she texted Vincent to let him know she was going to the ICU. It was the last text she sent. On 16 April, after she had spent more than two weeks on a ventilator, hospital staff called Vincent and asked whether he would be comfortable signing a do-not-resuscitate order. He hadn\u2019t been able to see his wife, so he didn\u2019t completely grasp the gravity of her condition. He assumed the call was simply a formality. \u201cI authorized it,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I got a call within two hours that she passed. I was stunned.\u201d Sharing the news of her death with Steven was shattering. \u201cIt was the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever had to do,\u201d Vincent said. \u2013 Shoshana Dubnow Barbara Finch, 63 A beloved small-town nurse and ardent baseball fan Occupation: Licensed practical nurse Place of work: Southern Virginia Regional medical center in Emporia, Virginia Date of death: 29 March 2020 When Barbara Finch got excited, she\u2019d scrunch her hands into fists and wave them around like a kid at Christmas. She did it when the Atlanta Braves scored, or while watching her grandkids play baseball. Finch, who had four children, spent her 37-year nursing career in her hospital\u2019s emergency department. Leigh Ann Lewis, her daughter, knew her mother was well-liked. When Lewis worked as an EMT, patients she transported away from the hospital would rave that Finch had been sweet and compassionate. Finch fell ill on 17 March and died in an ICU 12 days later. As a hearse carried her casket to the graveyard, Lewis said, people in their tight-knit community filed out at driveways, churches and stores, holding signs that read: \u201cWe love you\u201d, \u201cPraying for you\u201d, \u201cHugs\u201d. Hospital employees released balloons to the sky. \u201cIt seemed like, in our area, she knew everybody \u2013 either she worked with them, or they were a patient of hers at some point,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIt was a very, very large outpour of love and comfort and solidarity.\u201d \u2013 MB Darrin Santos, 50 \u2018He was my backbone\u2019 Occupation: Transportation supervisor Place of work: New York-Presbyterian Westchester Behavioral health center in White Plains, New York Date of death: 4 April 2020 Melissa Castro Santos had just started a new treatment for multiple myeloma when her husband, Darrin, got sick. For nearly two weeks, he isolated in their bedroom, while she recuperated from chemotherapy on the couch downstairs. After he began gasping for air, he went to the hospital. He died from Covid-19 several days later. \u201cIt\u2019s just unbelievable,\u201d Castro Santos said. As a transportation supervisor, Santos transported healthcare workers and equipment between hospitals in the New York metropolitan area. He loved his job, Castro Santos said, and was known to drive doctors wherever and whenever they were needed, through heavy traffic and snowstorms. Castro Santos, who has been battling cancer since 2012, said her husband doted on their three teenage children, all avid athletes. He arranged his work schedule in order to attend as many of their games as possible. When he couldn\u2019t make it, she would call him on FaceTime so he could catch glimpses of the action. Castro Santos and her children buried Santos five days after he died, unable to hold a funeral. Their friends lined the streets in their cars in a show of support as the family drove to and from the cemetery. Now Castro Santos is confronting cancer without her husband. \u201cHe was my backbone. He was the one who took me to chemotherapy and appointments.\u201d \u2013 Anna Jean Kaiser Don Ryan Batayola, 40 Family vacations and reggae gave rhythm to his life Occupation: Occupational therapist Place of work: South Mountain healthcare and rehabilitation center in Vauxhall, New Jersey Date of death: 4 April 2020 Don and Nina Batayola had planned to leave for Europe on 4 April for a 10-day vacation. The couple loved to travel on their own or with their children, Zoie, 10, and Zeth, 8. Disney World. Road trips to Canada. Every year they spent a week on North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks. Don\u2019s love of reggae music prompted a 2016 trip to Jamaica to visit Bob Marley\u2019s birthplace. The Batayolas, both occupational therapists, moved to New Jersey from the Philippines 13 years ago. \u201cHe loved to help,\u201d Nina said. \u201cHe had such the ability to make everybody smile or laugh.\u201d Don worked with at least one patient and a handful of colleagues who subsequently tested positive for Covid-19, and in late March, he developed symptoms. On 31 March, Nina came home from work to find her husband struggling to breathe. She dialed 911. Nina developed symptoms soon after her husband was hospitalized. Self-isolating at home, Nina spoke with Don every day. She thought he seemed to be improving but, on 4 April \u2013 the day they had once planned to depart for Europe \u2013 his heart suddenly stopped. \u2013 Michelle Andrews Brittany Bruner-Ringo, 32 \u2018It could be the saddest day, and she could make you laugh\u2019 Occupation: Licensed vocational nurse Place of work: Silverado Beverly Place in Los Angeles, California Date of death: 20 April 2020 When it was Brittany Bruner-Ringo\u2019s turn to choose the family vacation, it was always New Orleans, a city so full of life. That is how family members described the young nurse who left the Oklahoma plains for the excitement of southern California. \u201cShe always made the best of things,\u201d her mother, Kim Bruner, said. \u201cIt could be the saddest day, and she could make you laugh.\u201d Bruner-Ringo worked at a dementia care center. On 19 March, she admitted a patient flown in from New York. She suspected he might have Covid-19, and she was nervous. She hadn\u2019t been allowed to wear a mask or gloves, for fear of frightening the patients, she told her mom by phone that night. (A spokesperson from her employer said, \u201cWe have no issues in our environment using appropriate masking and gloves and have followed CDC guidelines throughout this pandemic. We have always had adequate PPE to protect our residents and associates.\u201d) The following day, Bruner-Ringo\u2019s patient grew worse, and the nurse checked into a hotel to isolate from her roommate. She later tested positive for Covid-19, but when she developed symptoms she remained optimistic. \u201cShe would say: \u2018I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m going to beat this. Don\u2019t worry about me,\u2019\u201d Bruner said. After getting off the phone with her daughter, Bruner, a veteran nurse herself, called the hotel front desk to ask for help getting an ambulance. Bruner-Ringo, who insisted she was fine, was struggling to breathe. \u2013 Samantha Young, California Healthline Lisa Ewald, 53 An animal lover who loved comic book conventions, she died alone at home Occupation: Registered nurse Place of work: Henry Ford hospital in Detroit, Michigan Date of death: 1 April 2020 Lisa Ewald was a nurse to many living things, human and otherwise. When her neighbor Alexis Fernandez\u2019s border collie had a stomach blockage, Ewald hooked the dog up to an IV four times a day. \u201cShe was this dedicated nurse who nursed my dog back to health,\u201d said Fernandez. Ewald also loved gardening, aerospace and comic book conventions. Ewald told Fernandez that a patient she had treated later tested positive for Covid-19, and that she was not wearing a mask at the time. Two days after seeing the patient, she got sick. After delays in accessing a test, she learned on 30 March that she was infected with the coronavirus. A hospital spokesperson acknowledged that staff who treat coronavirus patients have a higher risk of exposure, but said there was \u201cno way to confirm\u201d how a staff person contracted the virus. On 31 March, Ewald didn\u2019t answer when Fernandez texted her. The next day, Fernandez and a hospital nurse went to her home to check on her and found her unresponsive on the couch. \u201cI said: \u2018Aren\u2019t you going to go take her pulse or anything?\u2019\u201d Fernandez said. \u201cThe nurse just said: \u2018She\u2019s gone.\u2019\u201d \u2013 MB Scott Geiger, 47 An ardent EMT who seemed to have nine lives Occupation: Emergency medical technician Place of work: Atlantic health system in Mountainside and Warren, New Jersey Date of death: 13 April 2020 Scott Geiger wasn\u2019t always enthusiastic about school, but at 16 he brought home a tome the size of two phone books. It was a manual for emergency medical technicians, and he devoured it, said his younger brother, Ben. Scott was certified as an EMT at 17. He never married or had kids, but did not seem to miss those things. \u201cHe was so focused on being an EMT and helping people in their most vulnerable and desperate moments,\u201d Ben said. \u201cThat\u2019s really what made him feel good.\u201d Geiger loved playing pool each week with friends. He was a loyal New York Jets football fan, content to joke about their follies and watch them lose. He was quiet. And he seemed to have nine lives, his brother said, surviving hospitalizations for epilepsy as a child and blood cancer as an adult. When the coronavirus began to tear a path through northern New Jersey, he faced his work with resolve. He downplayed his symptoms when he first fell ill, in late March, but wound up spending 17 days on a ventilator before he died. The family has had to mourn separately, with the brothers\u2019 father, who lived with Scott, in quarantine, and their mother confined to her room in a nursing home that has Covid-19 cases. \u2013 Christina Jewett Theresa Lococo, 68 Caring nurse \u2018always put others first\u2019 Occupation: Pediatric nurse Place of work: Kings county hospital in Brooklyn, New York Date of death: 27 March 2020 Theresa Lococo spent most of her life at the hospital, working as a pediatric nurse for almost 48 years. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a day that goes by she wouldn\u2019t come home and tell me about her patients,\u201d said her daughter, Lisa Lococo. \u201cShe had to be forced to take her vacation days.\u201d New York City\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, publicly saluted her lifelong service to New Yorkers, saying: \u201cShe gave her life helping others.\u201d Theresa had dogs \u2013\u2013 \u201csometimes too many\u201d, Lisa said \u2013\u2013 and lived with her son, Anthony, in the home she owned for decades. She loved cooking and watching cooking shows, reading and following soap operas. Theresa wasn\u2019t tested for Covid-19. But Kings county hospital, in Brooklyn, was hit hard by the coronavirus. Days before dying, she described nausea. Friends recalled a cough. Her supervisor encouraged her to stay home from work, her daughter said. Lisa called her mother on 27 March, just as Anthony was dialing 911 for help. \u201cShe always put others first,\u201d Lisa said. \u201cShe always put herself last.\u201d \u2013 SL Felicisimo \u2018Tom\u2019 Luna, 62 Vivacious New Jersey nurse was planning his family\u2019s next vacation Occupation: Emergency room nurse Place of work: Trinitas Regional medical center in Elizabeth, New Jersey Date of death: 9 April 2020 Tom Luna was a joker, a lively and outgoing man who thrived on the fast-paced and varied action of the emergency room. He also adored his three daughters, something clear to all who knew him. \u201cTom was a fantastic emergency nurse. He was well-liked and loved by his peers,\u201d a spokesperson for the Trinitas emergency department said in a statement. \u201cHis greatest love was for his wife and daughters, who he was very proud of.\u201d His oldest daughter, Gabrielle, 25, followed his path to become an ER nurse. When Tom fell ill with the coronavirus, he was admitted at the hospital where she works. At the end of her 12-hour night shifts, she made sure he had breakfast and helped him change his clothes. She propped a family photo next to his bed. Tom\u2019s wife, Kit, also a nurse, said that when some of his symptoms appeared to let up, they talked about him recovering at home. He was a planner, she said, and was already talking about their next family vacation, maybe to Spain. \u2013 CJ Michael Marceaux, 49 Air force veteran who went \u2018above and beyond for patients\u2019 Occupation: Registered nurse Place of work: Christus Highland medical center and Brentwood hospital in Shreveport, Louisiana Date of death: 16 April 2020 After Michael Marceaux retired from the air force, he went back to school. In 2018 he launched a new career as an emergency room nurse. \u201cEveryone who worked with him said he was so happy,\u201d said Drake Marceaux, one of his four sons. \u201cHe was willing to go above and beyond for patients.\u201d As coronavirus spread throughout Louisiana, Michael developed a cough and fever. Soon after he tested positive for Covid-19. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem too worried,\u201d Drake said. \u201cHe just wanted to make sure not to give it to other people.\u201d A spokesperson for Christus Health said Marceaux would be missed for his \u201cpositive attitude, even after a hard shift. His laughter brought joy to others.\u201d The spokesperson declined to answer questions about workplace safety conditions. Drake said he wanted his father to be remembered for how much he was loved. His funeral was live-streamed on Facebook. \u201cAt one point, there were 2,000 viewers watching his service,\u201d Drake said. \u201cAs much as he didn\u2019t want attention, it gravitated toward him.\u201d \u2013 Victoria Knight Francis \u2018Frankie\u2019 Molinari, 70 A \u2018hero among heroes\u2019, he cared for generations of patients Occupation: Internal medicine physician Places of work: Private practice, with admitting privileges at Clara Maass medical center in Belleville, New Jersey Date of death: 9 April 2020 In late March, Dr Francis \u201cFrankie\u201d Molinari told his sister Lisa he was \u201cdown for the count\u201d, with chills, fever and trouble breathing. \u201cFrankie, you know what you have,\u201d she recalled telling him. Two days later, he collapsed at home and was rushed to Clara Maass medical center. Colleagues stayed by his side as he succumbed to Covid-19. \u201cWe take solace in the fact that he was cared for by colleagues and friends who deeply loved and respected him,\u201d his sister Janice wrote in a blog. \u201cHe died a hero among heroes.\u201d Frankie, a New Jersey native who was married with an adult daughter, was the oldest of four siblings. His sisters described him as an optimist who loved music, fishing and telling tall tales: he went to medical school in Bologna, Italy, and he liked to say he had played pinochle with the pope. \u201cA friend had once described us as four different legs of the same table,\u201d Janice wrote. \u201cNow I\u2019m stuck on the fact that we are only a three-legged table. Less beautiful, less sturdy. Broken.\u201d He practiced medicine for over four decades, caring for generations of patients in the same family. His family suspects he contracted the coronavirus at his private practice. \u2013 Laura Ungar Celia Lardizabal Marcos, 61 Deeply generous, she never forgot her hometown Occupation: Telemetry charge nurse Place of Work: CHA Hollywood Presbyterian medical center in Los Angeles, California Date of Death: 17 April 2020 Whenever she traveled to her hometown of Tagudin in the Philippines, Celia Lardizabal Marcos showered family with gifts and delighted in planning weekend outings for everyone, said her eldest son, Donald. And when she returned home to California, she brought presents for her sons. \u201cShe always thought of how her family could be happy,\u201d he said. Trained as a nurse in her home country, Marcos emigrated to the United States in 2001 and settled in Los Angeles. Three years later, she became a telemetry charge nurse, a specialist who tracks patients\u2019 vital signs using hi-tech equipment. On 3 April, she was one of three nurses who responded after a suspected coronavirus patient went into cardiac arrest. Wearing a surgical mask, she intubated the patient. Three days later, she had a headache, body aches and difficulty breathing. Her symptoms worsened, and she was admitted on 15 April to the hospital where she had worked for 16 years. Two days later, she went into cardiac arrest and died. Her sons say they plan to honor her wishes to be cremated and buried in Tagudin, alongside her parents. \u2013\u2013 Christina M Oriel, Asian Journal Celia Yap-Banago, 69 5-ft-tall \u2018fireball\u2019 was a prankster to her sons Occupation: Registered nurse Place of work: Research medical center in Kansas City, Missouri Death of death: 21 April 2020 Celia Yap-Banago was a 5-ft-tall \u201cfireball\u201d, said one co-worker. She had moved to the US from the Philippines in 1970 and worked for nearly 40 years for the HCA Midwest Health system. Her family said she was planning for retirement. Her son Josh said she showed her love through practical jokes. \u201cYou knew she loved you if she was yelling at you or if she was pranking you,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was very outspoken,\u201d said Charlene Carter, a fellow nurse. \u201cBut I later learned that\u2019s a really good quality to have, as a nurse, so you can advocate for your patients and advocate for yourself.\u201d In March, Yap-Banago treated a patient who later tested positive for Covid-19. Carter said Yap-Banago was not given personal protective equipment because she was not working in an area designed for coronavirus patients. She spent her final days in isolation to protect others. A spokesperson for HCA Midwest Health said that medical staff received adequate personal protective equipment in line with CDC guidelines. Josh said she spoke with reverence of her patients and their families. \u201cShe was always focused on the family as a whole, and that the family was taken care of, not just the patient in the bed,\u201d he said. \u2013 Alex Smith, KCUR Israel Tolentino Jr, 33 He was an unflappable first responder with an ever-ready smile Occupation: Emergency medical technician and firefighter Places of work: Saint Clare\u2019s Health and the Passaic fire department, Passaic, New Jersey Date of death: 31 March 2020 When Israel Tolentino Jr arrived for his EMT shift one morning in March, he seemed fine. Then he got a headache, and then a fever. He was sent home, said Vito Cicchetti, a director at Saint Clare\u2019s Health. Izzy, as he was called, was an EMT who fulfilled his dream to become a firefighter. In 2018, the former marine took a job with the Passaic fire department but continued to take shifts at Saint Clare\u2019s. He was husband to Maria Vazquez, whom he\u2019d met at church, according to nj.com. They had two young children. Tolentino and his partner worked brutal, 12-hour shifts during the pandemic. They were dispatched to one emergency after another, each typically lasting under an hour but requiring nearly as long to decontaminate their gear and truck. Izzy died in hospital care. The coronavirus tore through his EMT team. Most eventually recovered. But his friend and co-worker Kevin Leiva also died. Cicchetti said he missed Izzy\u2019s unflappable, cheerful presence. \u201cNo matter how mad you were, he\u2019d come up with a smile and you\u2019d be chuckling to yourself,\u201d he said. Cicchetti hasn\u2019t replaced either man. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m ready for that yet,\u201d he said. \u2013 MA Rose Taldon, 63 A former bus driver, she became a nurse at age 38 Occupation: Registered nurse Place of work: New England Baptist hospital, Boston, Massachusetts Date of death: 12 April 2020 Rose Taldon was just 5ft tall. But when she bellowed their names out the window, her kids ran right home. \u201cShe didn\u2019t take any crap,\u201d said her daughter, Teadris Pope. Taldon and her husband raised three children on the same street where she grew up, in Boston\u2019s Dorchester neighborhood. Strong-willed and commanding respect, she earned a nursing degree while working in public transit for 23 years. Though she could be stern, she was quick to play-fight and tickle her eight grandkids, Pope said. Taldon was generous: even as she lay in a hospital in April, exhausted from the coronavirus, she arranged to pay bills for an out-of-work friend, her daughter said. It\u2019s unclear whether Taldon caught the virus at her hospital, which was designated for non-Covid patients. Hospital officials said three patients and 22 staff had tested positive. At 2am on Easter morning, a doctor offered to go into Taldon\u2019s hospital room and connect Pope to her mother on a video call, since she couldn\u2019t visit in person. \u201cI just talked until I had no words,\u201d Pope said. \u201cI was just telling her, \u2018We\u2019re so proud of you. You worked so hard raising us \u2026 You\u2019ve gone through a hell of a fight.\u2019\u201d An hour later, her mother was gone. \u2013 MB Kevin Leiva, 24 He was the second of his EMT crew to die of Covid-19 Occupation: Emergency medical technician Place of work: Saint Clare\u2019s Health in Passaic, New Jersey Date of death: 7 April 2020 When Kevin Leiva died of Covid-19 in early April, it was a second crushing loss to his close-knit team of EMT workers. Their colleague, Israel Tolentino Jr, had died one week before. \u201cPeople were scared that everyone was going to die from it,\u201d said Vito Cicchetti, a director at Saint Clare\u2019s Health, where the men worked. \u201cAfter Izzy died, we all started getting scared for Kevin.\u201d Leiva, according to an obituary, \u201cwas always worried about his crew\u201d. He was proud of his work and said: \u201cBecoming an EMT was an act of God.\u201d He met his wife, Marina, online while they were in high school. He loved spending time at their home, playing guitar and tending to his tegu lizards, AJ and Blue. As Covid-19 spread, the station\u2019s three ambulances each handled up to 15 dispatches a shift, roughly twice as many as usual. EMTs often responded to calls continuously, stopping only to clean their personal protective equipment and disinfect the ambulance. Leiva \u201calways had a joke\u201d that helped to defuse stressful situations and bring his co-workers together, Cicchetti said. \u2013 MA Billy Birmingham Sr, 69 In ministry and rescue missions, \u2018he put his all into it\u2019 Occupation: Emergency medical technician Place of work: Kansas City, Missouri, fire department Date of death: 13 April 2020 Bill Birmingham Jr remembers the year his father took on a new career. The whole family studied, even acting out scenes to ensure Billy Birmingham Sr, a minister, was ready for his emergency medical technician exam. \u201cHe put his all into it,\u201d the son recalled. Billy Birmingham passed the test. And from the late 1990s on, he served as an EMT and a minister. His family rallied again when he pursued a doctorate in pastoral theology, which he earned in 2005. During nearly four decades as a minister, he opened two churches. \u201cHe had a heart for other people,\u201d his son said. \u201cWhatever he could do for other people, he would do it.\u201d As a fire department EMT, he was exposed to the coronavirus. The cough came in March. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m just tired.\u2019 That\u2019s what he kept saying,\u201d his son said. His dad went to the hospital twice. The first time he told the staff about his symptoms and underlying health conditions, then they sent him home. The second time he arrived in an ambulance. Just over two weeks later, as he lay dying, hospital staff set up a video chat so his family could see him one last time. \u2013 Cara Anthony John Schoffstall, 41 Firefighting and \u2018helping people\u2019 were in his blood Occupation: Paramedic and firefighter Place of work: Terre Haute fire department in Terre Haute, Indiana Date of death: 12 April 2020 John Schoffstall grew up around firehouses, and it was at his own firehouse in Terre Haute, Indiana, that he was exposed to the coronavirus. A paramedic and firefighter with the Terre Haute fire department for almost 12 years, Schoffstall died on 12 April at age 41. Glen Hall, the deputy chief, said the department has been responding every day to calls from patients showing symptoms of Covid-19, although investigations by the county health department and his own department determined Schoffstall contracted the virus from another firefighter. Four other firefighters became mildly ill. Jennifer Schoffstall, his wife of 18 years, said her husband went to the hospital on 28 March. \u201cHis breathing was so bad in the ER, they just decided to keep him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe regressed from there.\u201d Hall said Schoffstall loved spending time with his family; the couple had a 17-year-old son and 13-year-old daughter. Schoffstall\u2019s father had been a volunteer firefighter, Jennifer said, and her husband signed up for the New Goshen volunteer fire department when he turned 18. \u201cHe loved the fire service and everything about it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe loved helping people.\u201d \u2013 SJ Luis Caldera-Nieves, 63 The jovial \u2018Puerto Rican Santa Claus\u2019 trained scores of other OB-GYNs Occupation: Obstetrician-gynecologist Place of work: University of Miami and Jackson health systems, Miami, Florida Date of death: 8 April 2020 \u201cSomos felices.\u201d That was Dr Luis Caldera-Nieves\u2019 signature sign-off after a cesarean section or at the end of a difficult shift. \u201cWe\u2019re happy,\u201d he meant, and often, when he was around, it was true. Caldera-Nieves, a popular OB-GYN, trained scores of doctors and helped bring thousands of babies into the world in his 25 years at the University of Miami and Jackson health systems. Born in Bayam\u00f3n, Puerto Rico, he worked at an air force base before joining UM, said Dr Jaime Santiago, a longtime co-worker. Caldera-Nieves was so devoted to his patients that he often gave them his private phone number \u2013 and his wife\u2019s, Santiago said. Because he was so jovial, he earned the nickname \u201cthe Puerto Rican Santa Claus\u201d, Santiago said. \u201cHe was truly loved and admired by everyone who worked with him, and will be remembered for his humor and never-ending positive energy,\u201d said Dr Jean-Marie Stephan, who trained under Caldera-Nieves. In a statement, UM and Jackson confirmed Caldera-Nieves died from complications of Covid-19 and said they \u201cgrieve the loss of our esteemed and beloved colleague.\u201d He is survived by his wife and six adult children. \u2013 MB Capt Franklin Williams, 57 \u2018It\u2019s a nightmare\u2019 Occupation: Firefighter and medical first responder Place of work: Detroit fire department in Detroit, Michigan Date of death: 8 April 2020 Capt Franklin Williams stood at the altar on his wedding day and pretended to hunt for the ring. He patted his chest, then his pockets and looked up at his soon-to-be wife with a \u201cmillion-dollar smile\u201d. He was always clowning and \u201cso silly\u201d, said Shanita Williams, his wife, recalling how he always tried to make her laugh. Williams died from complications of the novel coronavirus on 8 April \u2013 one month before the couple\u2019s 10th wedding anniversary. Williams had been on an emergency call with a verified Covid-19 patient before falling ill, according to the Detroit fire department chief, Robert Distelrath. Crews are equipped with personal protective equipment including a gown, N95 mask and gloves, he said. But it\u2019s easy for a mask to slip \u2013 \u201cwhen you\u2019re giving [chest] compressions, your mask isn\u2019t staying in place all the time,\u201d said Thomas Gehart, president of the Detroit Fire Fighters Association. When Williams fell sick on 24 March, he moved to his home\u2019s guest bedroom to avoid infecting his wife. He never returned to work. \u201cI\u2019m thankful and thank God for having him in my life,\u201d Shanita said, adding that she keeps thinking, \u201cit\u2019s a nightmare and I\u2019m going to wake up. But it\u2019s not.\u201d \u2013\u2013 SJT Aleyamma John, 65 \u2018We\u2019re failing miserably without her\u2019 Occupation: Registered nurse Place of work: Queens hospital center in Queens, New York Date of death: 5 April 2020 Aleyamma John\u2019s family wanted her to retire. Her husband, John, an MTA transit worker, had stopped working a few years earlier. He and their son Ginu urged her to follow suit. \u201cWe told her, \u2018I\u2019m sure dad wants to see the world with you \u2013\u2013 you need to give him that opportunity,\u2019\u201d Ginu said. She demurred. \u201cI think she found fulfillment in being able to serve,\u201d Ginu said. \u201cShe was able to hold people\u2019s hands, you know, even when they were deteriorating and be there for them.\u201d She began her career as a nurse in India 45 years ago; she and her husband emigrated to the United Arab Emirates, where their two sons were born, and moved to New York in 2002. Ginu said his mother, a devout Christian, found joy in tending to her vegetable garden and doting on her two grandchildren. She cooked dishes from her native India and filled the Long Island home she shared with John, Ginu and Ginu\u2019s family with flowers. In March, as Queens hospital center began to swell with Covid-19 patients, Aleyamma sent her family of a photo of herself and colleagues wearing surgical hats and masks, but not enough personal protective equipment. Days later she developed a fever and tested positive for the virus. Johnny, Ginu and Ginu\u2019s wife, Elsa, a nurse practitioner, also became ill. When Aleyamma\u2019s breathing became labored, her family made the difficult decision to call 911. It would be the last time they saw her. \u201cWe\u2019re 17 days in, and I feel like we\u2019re failing miserably without her,\u201d Ginu said. \u2013 Danielle Renwick Mike Field, 59 A 9/11 first responder, he answered the call during the pandemic Occupation: Volunteer emergency medical technician Place of work: Village of Valley Stream, New York Date of death: 8 April 2020 Mike Field had a strong sense of civic duty. An emergency medical technician, he was a first responder with the New York fire department (FDNY) on 9/11. He was also a member of his community\u2019s all-volunteer fire department since 1987. After he retired from FDNY in 2002, he took a job making and posting street signs with his local public works department. He continued to volunteer with Valley Stream\u2019s fire department and mentored the junior fire department. When he wasn\u2019t responding to emergencies or training future emergency technicians he led a Boy Scout troop and volunteered for animal causes. \u201cHere\u2019s somebody who cares about the community and cares about its people,\u201d said Valley Stream\u2019s mayor, Ed Fare, who had known Mike since the seventh grade. Stacey Field, his wife, said he found his calling early, after his own father experienced a heart attack. \u201cWhen the fire department EMTs came and helped his dad, he decided that\u2019s what he wanted to do,\u201d she said. Their three sons \u2013 Steven, 26; Richie, 22; and Jason, 19 \u2013\u2013 have followed in their father\u2019s footsteps. Steven and Richie are EMTs in New York; Jason plans on training to become one as well. All three volunteer at the same fire station their father did. In late March, Mike and fellow volunteer responders were called to an emergency involving a patient showing symptoms of Covid-19. Field died on 8 April. \u2013 SJ Valeria Viveros, 20 She was just starting on a path to becoming a nurse Occupation: Nursing assistant Place of Work: Extended Care hospital of Riverside, California Date of Death: 5 April 2020 Valeria Viveros was \u201cbarely blooming\u201d, developing the skills and ambition to pursue a nursing career, said Gustavo Urrea, her uncle. Working at Extended Care hospital of Riverside was her first job. Viveros, born in California to Mexican immigrants, grew attached to her patients at the nursing home, bringing them homemade ceviche, Urrea said. About a month ago, as he watched her cook, play and joke with her grandmother, he noticed how much her social skills had grown. When she would say \u201cHi, t\u00edo,\u201d in her playful, sweet, high-pitched voice, \u201cit was like the best therapy you could have,\u201d Urrea recalled. Viveros, who lived with her parents and two siblings, was enrolled in classes at a community college. Viveros began to feel sick on 30 March, went to a nearby hospital and was sent home with Tylenol, Urrea said. By 4 April, she was too weak to get out of bed on her own. She left in an ambulance and never came back. \u201cWe\u2019re all destroyed,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t even believe it.\u201d On 5 April, county health officials reported a coronavirus outbreak had sickened 30 patients and some staff at the nursing home where she worked. Trent Evans, general counsel for Extended Care, said staffers were heartbroken by her death. Viveros was \u201chead over heels in love with the residents that she served\u201d, he said. \u201cShe was always there for them.\u201d \u2013 MB Pamela Hughes, 50 She remembered the small \u2013 but meaningful \u2013 details about those in her care Occupation: Nursing assistant and medication aide Place of Work: Signature HealthCARE at Summit Manor, Columbia, Kentucky Date of Death: 13 April 2020 Pamela Hughes lived her entire life in rural Columbia, Kentucky, but longed for wide, sandy beaches. For vacation, Hughes and her daughter, Brie, 26, eagerly drove 14 hours to Daytona Beach, Florida, or Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Hughes worked at Summit Manor, a nursing home in Columbia, for 32 years. She knew which residents preferred chocolate milk or applesauce with their medication; she remembered their favorite outfits and colors. Hughes\u2019s usually shy demeanor vanished each December when she and co-worker Angie McAllister built a float for the town\u2019s Christmas parade competition. \u201cWe built 10 floats over 10 years,\u201d McAllister said. \u201cWe got second place every year.\u201d Even after several residents tested positive for the coronavirus, Hughes dismissed her worsening cough as allergies or bronchitis. The nursing home was short on help and she wanted to serve her patients, Brie said. Days later, the public health department suggested her mother get tested. She tested positive, and her health worsened \u2013 food tasted bitter, her fever soared, her hearing dulled. On 10 April, Hughes was taken by ambulance to a hospital, then by helicopter to Jewish hospital in Louisville. Barred from visiting, Brie said goodbye over FaceTime. \u2013 SV James House, 40 An eager student, he wanted to become a physician assistant Occupation: Registered nurse Place of work: Omni Continuing Care in Detroit, Michigan Date of death: 31 March 2020 James House had a voracious appetite for learning about and a fascination with the human body. His sister, Catrisha House-Phelps, traces it back to childhood visits to a dialysis center where their father received treatments. \u201cThat was what tugged at his heart,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just always wanted to know \u2018why\u2019.\u201d House-Phelps said her brother adored his five children, treasured his anatomy and physiology books, and got a kick out of the residents he cared for at Omni Continuing Care. \u201cHe thought they were family; he just said they were funny people,\u201d she said. He had hoped to go back to school to become a physician assistant. House came down with what he thought was the flu in mid-March. His sister said he tried to get tested for Covid-19 but was turned away because he was not showing textbook symptoms and had no underlying health issues. On 31 March, after resting at home for over a week, House returned to work. Hours later, he collapsed and was rushed to the hospital. He texted his sister with updates on his condition. \u201cI\u2019m about to be intubated now,\u201d he wrote. It was the last message he sent her. \u2013 DR Thomas Soto, 59 A loving grandfather, Soto was looking forward to spending more time with his family Occupation: Radiology clerk Place of work: Woodhull medical center in Brooklyn, New York Date of death: 7 April 2020 After more than 30 years at one of New York City\u2019s busy public hospitals, Thomas Soto loved his job but was looking forward to retiring, said his son, Jesse Soto, who lived with him. Thomas looked forward to visits with his four-year-old grandson. \u201cThey did everything together,\u201d said Jesse. He often shared meals with the little boy and took him to a local toy store. At Thomas\u2019s busy station near the emergency room, he greeted patients and took down their information. \u201cEverybody saw him before their X-rays,\u201d Jesse, 29, said. \u201cHe smiled all day, made jokes. He was a kind man.\u201d As Covid-19 patients began to overwhelm Woodhull and other emergency rooms across the city, Jesse said that at first, his father didn\u2019t have any protective gear. (The hospital did not respond to requests for comment.) He eventually got a mask. But he soon grew sick, developing a high fever, body aches and a cough. After a week, Soto said, \u201che couldn\u2019t take it any more\u201d. He was admitted at Woodhull and died two days later. \u2013 MA Ali Dennis Guillermo, 44 A nurse who fought for his life in the ICU where he worked Occupation: Registered nurse Place of work: Long Island community hospital in East Patchogue, New York Date of death: 7 April 2020 In 2004, Ali Dennis Guillermo, his wife, Romielyn, and their daughter uprooted their lives in the Philippines and moved to New York. Everything fell into place. The former nursing instructor landed a job at Long Island community hospital, often working in intensive care or the emergency room. He enjoyed the intensity of ER work, his wife said. As years passed, the couple had two sons and settled into a close-knit Filipino community on Long Island. He was devoted to his three children. \u201cHe was such a lovely and good father,\u201d Romielyn said. As Covid-19 emerged, he was assigned to patients who were transitioning out of intensive care. Many of the nurses on his floor had gotten sick, and \u201ceverybody was scared,\u201d Romielyn said. In late March, he began to feel achy, with a fever that soared to 102F (38.9C). Within days, his blood oxygen level plummeted. His nails turned blue, an effect of low blood oxygen levels, and he asked his wife to take him to the ER. That was the last time they spoke. Guillermo was intubated in the ICU unit where he had worked. Nearly two weeks later, he died. \u2013\u2013 MA Gary Sclar, 66 A whip-smart neurologist, Sclar was endlessly fascinated with the brain Occupation: Neurologist Place of work: Mount Sinai Queens in Queens, New York Date of death: 12 April 2020 Gary Sclar was a whip-smart neurologist who loved comic books, Game of Thrones and Star Wars, said his daughter, Jennifer Sclar. He was deeply compassionate with a blunt bedside manner. \u201cMy dad was fascinated with the brain and with science,\u201d Jennifer Sclar said. \u201cHis work was his passion, and it\u2019s what made him the happiest, besides my brother and me.\u201d Set to retire in June, he was looking forward to writing about politics and neurology. Gary Sclar saw patients who were showing Covid-19 symptoms and knew his age and underlying health conditions \u2013\u2013 he had diabetes \u2013\u2013 put him at risk for developing complications from the illness. His daughter pleaded with him to stop going in to the hospital. In early April, he mentioned having lost his sense of smell, and on 8 April, he collapsed in his home. He was hospitalized a few days later and agreed to be intubated. \u201cI don\u2019t think he realized like that this was the end,\u201d Sclar said. \u201cHe brought his keys. He brought his wallet.\u201d \u2013 DR Rose Harrison, 60 Selfless and sassy, Alabama nurse cared for a Covid-19 patient at a nursing home Occupation: Nurse Place of work: Marion Regional nursing home in Hamilton, Alabama Date of death: 6 April 2020 Rose Harrison lived to serve others \u2013 her husband, three daughters, grandchildren and the residents of the nursing home where she worked. Though the Alabama nurse was selfless, she also had a sassy edge to her personality and was given to fits of pique behind the wheel, her daughter, Amanda Williams said. \u201cHer personality was so funny, you automatically loved her,\u201d Williams said. \u201cShe was so outspoken. If she didn\u2019t agree with you, she\u2019d tell you in a respectful way.\u201d Williams was not wearing a mask when she cared for a patient who later tested positive for Covid-19 at Marion Regional nursing home in Hamilton, Alabama, her daughter said. She later developed a cough, fatigue and a low-grade fever, but kept reporting to duty all week. Officials from the nursing home did not return calls for comment. On 3 April, Williams drove her mother to a hospital. The following evening, Harrison discussed the option of going on a ventilator with loved ones on a video call, agreeing it was the best course. Williams believed that her mother fully expected to recover. \u2013\u2013 CJ Monica Echeverri Casarez, 49 A surgical technician who made friends everywhere she went Occupation: Surgical technician Place of work: Detroit medical center Harper University hospital in Detroit, Michigan Date of death: 11 April 2020 Monica Echeverri Casarez was in constant motion, said her husband, Jorge Casarez. The daughter of Colombian immigrants, she worked as a Spanish-English interpreter in clinical settings. She was the kind of person whose arrival at a mom-and-pop restaurant would elicit hugs from the owners. She also co-founded Southwest Detroit Restaurant Week, a not-for-profit that supports local businesses. Twice a month, she scrubbed in as a surgical technician at Harper University hospital. \u201cShe liked discovering the beauty of how the body works and how science is clear and orderly,\u201d Casarez said. She was organized and intuitive, qualities that are assets in the operating room. On 21 March, she posted a photo of herself in protective gear with the caption: \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t at least a bit nervous to be there now.\u201d Since many elective surgeries had been canceled, Echeverri Casarez was tasked with taking the temperatures of people who walked into the hospital and making sure their hands were sterilized. Soon after, Echeverri Casarez and Casarez began feeling ill. Quarantined together, Echeverri Casarez tried to make the best of the situation. She baked her husband a cake \u2013\u2013 chocolate with white frosting. She died a few days later. \u2013 DR Kim King-Smith, 53 King-Smith was driven by a desire to help others until the end Occupation: Electrocardiogram technician Place of work: University hospital in Newark, New Jersey Date of death: 31 March 2020 Kim King-Smith was a natural caregiver. An only child, she grew up close to her extended family, including her cousins Hassana Salaam-Rivers and Sharonda Salaam. After Salaam developed multiple sclerosis, King-Smith visited her every day. \u201cShe\u2019d bring her sweets that she wasn\u2019t supposed to have and share them with her,\u201d Salaam-Rivers said. King-Smith\u2019s desire to care for others was the reason she became an electrocardiogram technician, her cousin added. \u201cIf a friend of a friend or family member went to the hospital, she would always go and visit them as soon as her shift was over,\u201d she said. In March, King-Smith cared for a patient she said had symptoms of Covid-19; she soon fell ill herself and tested positive for the virus. It seemed like a mild case at first, and she stayed in touch with family via FaceTime while trying to isolate from her husband, Lenny. On 29 March, Salaam-Rivers checked in on her cousin and noticed she was struggling to breathe. She urged her to call an ambulance. After King-Smith was hospitalized, she exchanged text messages with her mother and cousin. As the day progressed, her messages carried increasingly grave news, Salaam-Rivers said. Then she stopped responding. \u2013 DR Marion \u2018Curtis\u2019 Hunt, 57 A social worker with panache who helped people struggling with addiction Occupation: Social worker Place of work: Cornell Scott-Hill health center and New Reach in New Haven, Connecticut Date of death: 23 March 2020 At a shelter for adults recovering from addiction, residents looked forward to the days when Marion \u201cCurtis\u201d Hunt would take the stage, emceeing talent shows and belting out Broadway and gospel tunes. It wasn\u2019t part of his job description as a social worker. It was just one of the ways he went \u201cabove and beyond\u201d, said Daena Murphy, his supervisor at Cornell Scott-Hill health center. \u201cHe had a beautiful voice,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was just a wonderful person \u2013\u2013 funny, engaging, always a huge smile on his face.\u201d Hunt, the youngest of four brothers, earned his master\u2019s in social work from Fordham University at 52, and was baptized at his brother\u2019s Pentecostal church at 54. He was a devoted uncle who doted on his dog and cat, Mya and Milo. It\u2019s unclear how Hunt got infected, but one patient he worked with tested positive for Covid-19, as did two co-workers, according to Dr Ece Tek, another supervisor at Cornell Scott-Hill health center. Hunt died on 23 March, one week after developing flu-like symptoms, said his brother John Mann Jr. \u2013 MB Araceli Buendia Ilagan, 63 An exacting but loving aunt, she was a mentor until the end Occupation: Intensive care unit nurse Place of work: Jackson Memorial hospital in Miami, Florida Date of death: 27 March 2020 For Jhoanna Mariel Buendia, her aunt was a constant \u2013\u2013 if distant \u2013\u2013 presence. Araceli Buendia Ilagan emigrated from their hometown Baguio, in the Philippines, to the US before Buendia was born, but she remained close to her family and communicated with them nearly every day. \u201cShe was one of the smartest people I ever knew,\u201d Buendia, 27, said. Buendia Ilagan, who at one point looked into adopting her niece so she could join her and her husband the United States, encouraged Buendia to become a nurse, and talked her through grueling coursework in anatomy and physiology. Buendia is now a nurse in London. Buendia Ilagan was also demanding. \u201cWhenever she visited the Philippines, she wanted everything to be organized and squeaky clean,\u201d Buendia said. The last time the two spoke, in late March, Buendia Ilagan didn\u2019t mention anything about feeling ill. Instead, the two commiserated over their experiences of treating patients with Covid-19; as always, her aunt offered her advice on staying safe while giving the best possible care. She died four days later. \u2013 DR Leo Dela Cruz, 57 A beloved geriatric psychiatrist and church musician remembered for his cooking skills Occupation: Geriatric psychiatrist Place of work: Christ hospital and CarePoint health in Jersey City, New Jersey Date of death: 8 April 2020 Dr Leo Dela Cruz was nervous about going to work in the weeks before he died, his friends said. Like many in the region, Christ hospital had an influx of Covid-19 patients and faced a shortage of ventilators and masks. Dela Cruz was a geriatric psychiatrist and didn\u2019t work in coronavirus wards. But he continued to see patients in person. In early April, Dela Cruz, who lived alone, complained only of migraines, his friends said. Within a week his condition worsened, and he was put on a ventilator at a nearby hospital. He died soon after. Friends said he may have been exposed at the hospital. (In a statement, hospital representatives said he didn\u2019t treat Covid-19 patients.) Dela Cruz, the oldest of 10 siblings, came from a family of healthcare professionals. His friends and family \u2013 from Cebu, Philippines, to Teaneck, New Jersey \u2013 remembered his jovial personality on Facebook. He won \u201cbest doctor of the year\u201d awards, played tennis, and cooked traditional Cebu dishes. Nida Gonzales, a colleague, said he always supported people, whether funding a student\u2019s education or running a church mental health program. \u201cI feel like I lost a brother,\u201d she said. \u2013 Ankita Rao J Ronald Verrier, 59 Verrier was so committed to fighting the virus, he called into work meetings even after he got sick Occupation: Surgeon Place of work: St Barnabas hospital in the Bronx, New York Date of death: 8 April 2020 Dr J Ronald Verrier spent the final weeks of his life tending to a torrent of patients infected with Covid-19. Workers at St Barnabas hospital struggled to find masks and gowns as staff set up makeshift morgues in the parking lot. (Many nurses continue to make cloth masks.) Born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Verrier emigrated to the United States and had worked at St Barnabas for the last two decades, overseeing the general surgery residency program. A towering presence with a wide, dimpled smile, Verrier was a natural mentor who was known to drop into patients\u2019 rooms for impromptu birthday parties. \u201cHe kept pushing me forward,\u201d said Dr Christina Pardo, Verrier\u2019s cousin and an obstetrician and gynecologist in New York. \u201cI would call him and say, \u2018I swear I failed that test,\u2019 and he would laugh. He was my confidence when I didn\u2019t have it.\u201d The Verrier family stretches across continents and Verrier kept them close, zipping around to a niece\u2019s wedding in Belgium, a baptism in Florida and another wedding in Montreal in recent years. He had recently ferried medical supplies to Haiti, a decade after he had traveled to his homeland to tend to victims of the country\u2019s devastating 2010 earthquake. Verrier helped steer St Barnabas\u2019s efforts to increase its capacity as Covid-19 cases increased. \u201cHe was at the hospital every day,\u201d Dr Ridwan Shabsigh, the surgery department\u2019s chair, said. \u201cThis was a nonstop effort.\u201d In early April, Verrier discovered he was infected. After developing symptoms, he continued to call into meetings from his home in Woodmere, New York. Shabsigh spoke with Verrier on 7 April, and said his spirits were high. The next day, he was rushed to a nearby hospital where he died. \u2013 SV Vianna Thompson, 52 Thompson texted from the bedroom: \u2018Call the ambulance, I can hardly breathe\u2019 Occupation: Nurse Place of work: VA Sierra Nevada health care system and Northern Nevada medical center in Reno, Nevada Date of death: 7 April 2020 In late March, Vianna Thompson spent two night shifts caring for a co-worker who was suffering from Covid-19. Two weeks later, she was lying in an intensive care unit, with a colleague holding her hand. Thompson and Bruce McAllister, the man she treated, were among three VA healthcare workers in Reno, Nevada, who died within a two-week span from the novel coronavirus. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty devastating. It\u2019s surreal. Reno\u2019s not that big of a city,\u201d said Robyn Underhill, a night nurse who worked with Thompson. Thompson was born Vianna Fye in Port Huron, Michigan. She met her husband, Bob, in 1991 on the Osan airbase in South Korea, where she was a veterinary technician and cared for military police dogs. They bonded over two-step dancing and country music. Vianna was a proud mother who worked long hours to provide for her three sons, buying them saxophones, drums and keyboards so they could play jazz and country music. \u201cShe was just sweet, big-hearted, caring, unselfish,\u201d Bob Thompson said. Vianna came to work with a cough on 29 March, a day after McAllister died. \u201dWe were all very concerned,\u201d Underhill said. \u201cCall it intuition, call it \u2018Spidey sense\u2019, but I knew that moment that she was coughing that this was not going to end well.\u201d That shift was Thompson\u2019s last. Over the next four days, she wrestled with fever, weakness and shortness of breath. The following Thursday, she texted her husband from the bedroom: \u201cCall the ambulance, I can hardly breathe.\u201d She was taken to the VA hospital and put on a ventilator. On 17 March, as her organs began to fail, Thompson\u2019s colleagues connected to Bob on FaceTime so he could say goodbye. As a veteran, she qualified for an \u201chonor flight\u201d, in which the patient\u2019s body is covered with a black box and wheeled through the hospital while others line up and salute. Because of the infectious nature of the coronavirus, a US flag could not be safely draped over her body, so a family friend walked in front of her and carried it. Thompson said the ceremony drew more people lining the hallways than staff had seen in 20 years. \u201cGod\u2019s getting a hell of a nurse,\u201d he said. \u2013 MB Alvin Simmons, 54 After some struggles, Simmons turned his life around Occupation: Environmental service assistant Place of work: Rochester general hospital in Rochester, New York Date of death: 17 March 2020 Alvin Simmons started working as a custodian at Rochester general hospital, in New York state, only weeks before he fell ill. \u201cHe loved helping people and he figured the best place to do that would be in a hospital,\u201d his sister Michelle Wilcox said. An army veteran who had served in the first Gulf war, Simmons loved karaoke and doted on his three grandchildren, Wilcox said. \u201cHe was a dedicated, hard-working individual who had just changed his life around\u201d since a prison stint, she said. According to Wilcox, Simmons began developing symptoms shortly after cleaning the room of a woman he believed was infected with the novel coronavirus. (In an email, a hospital spokesperson said it had \u201cno evidence to suggest that Mr Simmons was at a heightened risk of exposure to Covid-19 by virtue of his training or employment duties\u201d and that he was the hospital\u2019s first diagnosed case of Covid-19.) On 11 March, he visited the emergency room with flu-like symptoms, Wilcox said. Over the next few days, his breathing became more labored and he began to cough up blood. He was rushed to the hospital on 13 March, where he subsequently received a Covid-19 diagnosis. Simmons died on 17 March. \u2013 DR Daisy Doronila, 60 Doronila was among dozens of people infected with the coronavirus at a Hudson county jail Occupation: Nurse Place of work: Hudson county correctional facility in Kearny, New Jersey Date of death: 5 April 2020 Daisy Doronila treated her patients at the Hudson county correctional facility, a New Jersey prison, with the utmost kindness, no matter what they had done. \u201cThere would be people there for the most heinous crimes,\u201d said her daughter, Denise Rendor, 28, \u201cbut they would just melt towards my mother because she really was there to give them care with no judgment.\u201d Doronila emigrated from the Philippines as a young nurse. She loved fashionable clothes and eating seafood on the waterfront in New York City, her daughter said. \u201cDaisy could handle herself,\u201d said the county director of corrections, Ron Edwards, describing her as sophisticated, intelligent and compassionate. \u201cIf someone got obnoxious with her, she\u2019d put them in their place and call for help if she needed to.\u201d Like many jails and prisons, the facility where Doronila worked has been hit hard by the virus: as of 10 April, 27 inmates and 68 staff members had tested positive. Four people who worked at the jail, including Doronila, have died, according to officials. Doronila, a devout Catholic who had been planning a trip to Israel with friends from church, developed a cough in mid-March. One doctor told her she probably had strep throat; another said fever wasn\u2019t high enough to merit a coronavirus test. She offered to return to work, but as the days went by, her condition grew worse. On 21 March, she was hospitalized for shortness of breath. The next day, she was put on a ventilator. Two weeks later, she passed away. Rendor said she and her mother were looking forward to sharing the next chapters in life together. For her mother, retirement at 65. For Rendor, marriage and perhaps starting her own family. \u201cIt was about to get really, really good,\u201d she said. \u2013 CJ Jeff Baumbach, 57 Unable to gather to mourn, Baumbach\u2019s friends drove by his house shining flashlights in his honor Occupation: Nurse Place of work: St Joseph\u2019s medical center in Stockton, California Date of death: 31 March 2020 Jeff Baumbach knew the risks of coronavirus, but as a nurse for 28 years he was also accustomed to being around infectious disease. \u201cHe\u2019d worked in the ICU. He was exposed to so many things, and we never got anything,\u201d said his wife and fellow nurse, Karen. Baumbach even sent a dry text to Karen: \u201cI love wearing a mask every day.\u201d In March, Baumbach was notified that a co-worker had Covid-19. He soon began to develop symptoms; he and Karen tested positive. Karen came down with body aches and congestion. Jeff had a fever and cough. Their home, once the site of countless family brunches and barbecues, where Jeff and his children solved huge jigsaw puzzles, was now sealed off from the outside world. Their daughter Kaila, 26, moved out as a precaution, and she didn\u2019t communicate with her dad when he was sick. \u201cI thought he was invincible,\u201d Kaila said. On 26 March, Karen brought Baumbach to the emergency room, where he was diagnosed with pneumonia. He chose to recuperate at home. On 31 March, he collapsed in the bathroom. \u201cIt went downhill really fast,\u201d said Karen, who took him to the hospital. Unable to enter the building, she stayed in her car and received updates by phone. Kaila waited in another car nearby. Baumbach was connected to a ventilator, but it had little effect. Eventually, Karen was allowed to don full protective gear and say goodbye in person. She returned home alone, still in quarantine. The next evening, Kaila asked dozens of friends and family members to drive along her parents\u2019 street and shine their phone flashlights. Filled with grief and gratitude, Karen cried as she peered out of an upstairs window at the glittering lines of cars crawling in both directions past her home. \u2013 CJ Debbie Accad, 72 Accad was the \u2018pillar\u2019 of her family back in the Philippines and spent decades caring for US veterans Occupation: Clinical nursing coordinator Place of work: Detroit VA medical center in Detroit, Michigan Date of death: 30 March 2020 Nurse Divina \u201cDebbie\u201d Accad cared for military veterans for over 25 years and was just a few weeks from retiring when the virus struck. On 16 March, Accad, 72, a clinical nursing coordinator at the Detroit VA medical center, told relatives that she felt ill. Four days later, she was hospitalized with pneumonia. She told her family that she had tested positive for Covid-19, and asked them to pray for her. The family felt helpless watching their beloved matriarch suffer from afar, said her niece, April Amada, who lives in the Philippines. Accad was born in Alimodian, a Philippine town known for its sweet bananas. The eldest of four children, she graduated from Central Philippine University with a nursing degree in 1969. Two years later, she moved to Chicago through a \u201cfly now, pay later\u201d program, joining tens of thousands of Filipino nurses who have migrated to the United States. She later relocated to Taylor, Michigan, where she married William Accad, with whom she raised four children. Accad was the \u201cpillar of the family\u201d, Amada said. She sent money home to relatives, and put Amada\u2019s mother through nursing school. A visit from Accad \u2013 known to relatives as Tita Debbie \u2013 meant unli-kainan, or \u201cunlimited food\u201d. Accad served up big American breakfasts and spicy kielbasa with cabbage. Mark, Accad\u2019s son, said his mother had diabetes, a risk factor for Covid-19 complications. He believes his mother was exposed by infected co-workers, though that has not been confirmed. The Department of Veterans Affairs is facing serious shortages in personal protective equipment for workers, according to internal memos obtained by the Wall Street Journal, though the VA has told reporters that it was taking proper precautions. Accad \u201cdied doing what she loved most \u2013 caring for people\u201d, said Mark. \u2013 MB \u2022 We are aiming to document the life of every healthcare worker in America who dies from Covid-19.

      "bodyText": "Labour\u2019s annual autumn conference in Liverpool has been cancelled because of the coronavirus outbreak, with an online event planned to replace it. The party conference, which would have been the first with Sir Keir Starmer as leader, was to be held at the ACC convention venue in mid-September. The Liberal Democrats are also expected to replace their conference with a virtual version. A Labour spokesperson said: \u201cOur priority is the safety of members, staff and visitors to our events and the need to protect the public\u2019s health. In light of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, we have therefore decided to postpone this year\u2019s annual and women\u2019s conferences.\u201d Plans for the online conference would be released at a later date, the party said. The decision was made by members of Labour\u2019s national executive committee during an online meeting on Tuesday. Members had told the Guardian they were anticipating friction between Starmer\u2019s supporters and those loyal to his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, on the party\u2019s left. One Labour source said Starmer had a lot to lose if the conference did not take place. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time for him to rally and show he\u2019s the members\u2019 choice,\u201d they said. \u201cIt\u2019s also a place where there\u2019s things that could revive [unsuccessful deputy leader candidate] Richard Burgon \u2026 all those leftwing events. With no conference there\u2019s fewer opportunities for the socialist campaign group. You\u2019d also have the media looking for disgruntled members asking: \u2018What does the new leader stand for?\u2019\u201d One MP said cancelling the conference meant a loss of income for the party and a missed \u201copportunity for our new leader and shadow cabinet to present a fresh start to the country\u201d. The Conservatives say planning for their conference is still under way but is being regularly reviewed. A report by the Lib Dem federal conference committee to be presented to the party\u2019s board suggests the event in Brighton from 26-29 September be cancelled and plans made for an online format instead. The pandemic has thrown the annual political fixtures, which attract thousands of people, into doubt owing to the current ban on mass gatherings and suggestions from the government to prepare for physical distancing to be in place for some time. The Lib Dems have investigated various software packages to make a virtual conference work. Current advice to members is to not book accommodation or transport for the event, and registration is closed. As well as being a focal point for developing policy with rounds of voting and speeches by senior party members, the Lib Dem conference hosts niche events, such as its popular Glee Club, and generates between \u00a3400,000 and \u00a3500,000 a year. A Conservative party spokesperson said its event, scheduled for 4-7 October at the Birmingham International Convention Centre, was still going ahead. \u201cAt present, planning for the party conference is continuing. We will keep this under review in light of the outbreak of coronavirus. Any decisions taken will be guided by the latest science and medical advice and government guidance,\u201d the spokesperson said.",

It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics.</p>\n    <p>How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is being watched very carefully.

      "bodyText": "The number of excess deaths registered in the UK during the Covid-19 outbreak has risen to just under 55,000, according to official figures, as a leading scientist suggested the country could experience days without deaths attributable to the virus by the end of June. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) figure for excess deaths, revealed on Tuesday, records the number above the five-year average, including \u2013 but not limited to \u2013 those caused by coronavirus since the outbreak began in March. It represents another grim milestone in the human toll of the virus but experts said the ONS data provided some cause for optimism. It was the third week in a row that the ONS recorded a reduction in the number of deaths in England and Wales and the second consecutive week all regions in England and Wales showed a decline in Covid-19 mortality. Although experts voiced caution, given the week ending 8 May included a bank holiday, on which only 88 deaths were registered, it continued a downwards trend.

      "body": "<p>The litany of government failures on social care during the Covid-19 emergency has become grimly familiar. But the mistakes bear repetition, as the latest <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/office-for-national-statistics\" title=\"\">figures</a> <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/releases/deathswithinthecaresectorinvolvingcovid19englandandwales\" title=\"\">record</a> that close to 15,000 care home residents have died in England and Wales from the disease.</p> <p>There is <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/thanks-to-nhs-managers-ive-now-got-two-care-homes-infected-with-covid-19-xk2n8f6nx\" title=\"\">clear</a> evidence that care homes were pressured into accommodating discharged hospital patients who had not been tested for coronavirus. Some turned out to be carrying it. Personal protective equipment was <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/2020/05/follow-our-coverage-care-sector-leaders-give-evidence-mps-coronavirus-pandemic\" title=\"\">lethally slow to arrive</a>. In some cases where homes did have functioning supply lines, these were commandeered to funnel PPE to hospitals. An absence of proper testing capacity meant care workers were operating in the dark as the virus spread. Access to hospital for residents was limited.</p> <p>In the House of Commons on Tuesday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6afb06d6-abd6-4281-ac16-74f500f096d0\" title=\"\">yet again insisted</a> that \u201ca protective ring\u201d was thrown around the nation\u2019s care homes from the start of this crisis. But before Mr Hancock spoke, MPs on the health select committee heard <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/05/19/lockdown-uk-news-coronavirus-boris-johnson-update/\" title=\"\">expert evidence</a> outlining what such protection would truly look like. In South Korea, they were told, early testing of residents took place, followed by quarantine measures or hospitalisation of those infected. Not a single Covid-19 death has taken place inside a South Korean care home.</p> <p>A future public inquiry will devote much of its time to these sins of commission and omission. But the structural neglect laid bare over the past weeks has deeper roots; it requires a response that goes beyond holding ministers to account, vital though that process will be.</p> <p>This week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/agency-staff-were-spreading-covid-19-between-care-homes-phe-found-in-april\" title=\"\">a Guardian investigation</a> revealed that agency workers, often on zero-hours contracts, may have inadvertently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/agency-staff-were-spreading-covid-19-between-care-homes-phe-found-in-april\" title=\"\">spread</a> Covid-19 between care homes. To cope with an ongoing recruitment crisis, private care providers have long relied on a \u201cbank\u201d of agency carers to fill gaps. As care home staff have self-isolated, a bigger proportion of this reserve army has been deployed, in some cases, apparently, taking the virus with them.</p> <p>Belatedly, the government has <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/care-home-support-package-backed-by-600-million-to-help-reduce-coronavirus-infections\" title=\"\">provided an extra \u00a3600m</a> to allow care homes to fund additional staff, or pay agency workers to reduce the number of providers they visit. But this is a problem that should never have arisen. The recruitment crisis in care homes is in large part a result of rock-bottom levels of pay. It reflects a lack of societal recognition which is shaming, given the role care workers perform. The care of our vulnerable and elderly is a demanding vocation, and should be rewarded as such. High-quality training and well-paid, stable employment should come as a matter of course to those who choose it as a career. Zero-hours employment contracts should have no place in the fragile ecology of this world, in which continuity and the quality of relationship between care workers and those cared for is fundamental.</p> <p>Acute <a href=\"https://members.tortoisemedia.com/2020/05/18/coronavirus-care-homes-ian-birrell/content.html?sig=ib7IMB50KsZlLLbh07KepUmwy6wlZHkkoA-7Kiswzwc\" title=\"\">underfunding</a> throughout the past decade, a <a href=\"https://www.health.org.uk/blogs/better-health-and-social-care-integration-a-fundamental-question-hangs-unanswered\" title=\"\">second-class status</a> compared to the NHS and unscrupulous <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/952317a6-36c1-11ea-a6d3-9a26f8c3cba4\" title=\"\">profit-seeking by some private providers</a> have combined to undermine the social care sector. Yes, the government must eventually answer for the grievous errors it has made in this crisis. But it is just as important that the age of the poorly paid zero-hours care worker, and all it symbolises about our past priorities, is consigned to history.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The litany of government failures on social care during the Covid-19 emergency has become grimly familiar. But the mistakes bear repetition, as the latest figures record that close to 15,000 care home residents have died in England and Wales from the disease. There is clear evidence that care homes were pressured into accommodating discharged hospital patients who had not been tested for coronavirus. Some turned out to be carrying it. Personal protective equipment was lethally slow to arrive. In some cases where homes did have functioning supply lines, these were commandeered to funnel PPE to hospitals. An absence of proper testing capacity meant care workers were operating in the dark as the virus spread. Access to hospital for residents was limited. In the House of Commons on Tuesday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, yet again insisted that \u201ca protective ring\u201d was thrown around the nation\u2019s care homes from the start of this crisis. But before Mr Hancock spoke, MPs on the health select committee heard expert evidence outlining what such protection would truly look like. In South Korea, they were told, early testing of residents took place, followed by quarantine measures or hospitalisation of those infected. Not a single Covid-19 death has taken place inside a South Korean care home. A future public inquiry will devote much of its time to these sins of commission and omission. But the structural neglect laid bare over the past weeks has deeper roots; it requires a response that goes beyond holding ministers to account, vital though that process will be. This week a Guardian investigation revealed that agency workers, often on zero-hours contracts, may have inadvertently spread Covid-19 between care homes. To cope with an ongoing recruitment crisis, private care providers have long relied on a \u201cbank\u201d of agency carers to fill gaps. As care home staff have self-isolated, a bigger proportion of this reserve army has been deployed, in some cases, apparently, taking the virus with them. Belatedly, the government has provided an extra \u00a3600m to allow care homes to fund additional staff, or pay agency workers to reduce the number of providers they visit. But this is a problem that should never have arisen. The recruitment crisis in care homes is in large part a result of rock-bottom levels of pay. It reflects a lack of societal recognition which is shaming, given the role care workers perform. The care of our vulnerable and elderly is a demanding vocation, and should be rewarded as such. High-quality training and well-paid, stable employment should come as a matter of course to those who choose it as a career. Zero-hours employment contracts should have no place in the fragile ecology of this world, in which continuity and the quality of relationship between care workers and those cared for is fundamental. Acute underfunding throughout the past decade, a second-class status compared to the NHS and unscrupulous profit-seeking by some private providers have combined to undermine the social care sector. Yes, the government must eventually answer for the grievous errors it has made in this crisis. But it is just as important that the age of the poorly paid zero-hours care worker, and all it symbolises about our past priorities, is consigned to history.",

It is a less toxic version of chloroquine, another malaria drug, which itself is related to quinine, an ingredient in tonic water.</p>\n    <p>A widely publicized study in France where 40 coronavirus patients were given hydroxychloroquine, with more than half experiencing the clearing of their airways within three to six days has led to it being touted in some quarters as a potential cure for Covid-19. This apparent improvement is important as it would curtail the timeframe in which infected people could spread Covid-19 to others.</p>\n    <p>However, experts have warned that the study is small and lacks sufficient rigour to be classed as evidence of a potential treatment. The French study followed work by Chinese researchers which suggested that hydroxychloroquine can slow infections by blocking the virus behind Covid-19 from entering cells in the body. But more recent, albeit small-scale, research from China has shown that patients who were treated with the drugs fought off coronavirus no more quickly than those who didn\u2019t get it. Indeed, one patient given hydroxychloroquine severely worsened in condition while four patients on the medicine developed signs of liver damage and experienced diarrhoea.

      "bodyText": "Hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malarial drug being taken by Donald Trump as an unproven protection against coronavirus, is being bought in bulk by the UK in case it does turn out to be an effective Covid-19 treatment. Ministers are seeking 16m tablets in packets of up to 100 as part of a \u00a335m contract put out to tender on Friday. The drug is being tested by government scientists, health officials said. They are securing additional supplies so it can be distributed among the population if required. The contract, which was uploaded to a government website on 15 May, is an \u201copen opportunity\u201d for pharmaceutical suppliers to supply more than 33m tablets of various drugs between June and next January. There is no evidence hydroxychloroquine can prevent coronavirus, and regulators have warned the drug could cause heart problems. However, there were concerns that Trump\u2019s endorsement would prompt a worldwide shortage of the drug, which can be used to treat lupus and other conditions. Trump told a White House press conference: \u201cI\u2019m taking it for about a week and a half now and I\u2019m still here, I\u2019m still here.\u201d According to the contract, the government is asking for the drug to be supplied in either 220mg or 250mg form. \u201cIn accordance with the terms of this invitation to offer the authority may accept offers for alternative strengths of tablets,\u201d the contract says. Studies are under way across the UK, Europe and the US to examine if the drug and a similar one, chloroquine, are effective against the coronavirus. UK scientists have been examining whether the drug can be used to treat the disease, rather than prevent it. The UK does not at present recommend its use. A source with knowledge of the contract said the drug was being bought in bulk so that if it proves to be effective as a treatment there is a ready supply. \u201cAll of the drugs being purchased can be used to treat other conditions too so they don\u2019t really go to waste if they aren\u2019t proved effective for Covid,\u201d the source said. Other drugs being bought as part of the \u00a335m contract include 1.4m tablets of lopinavir-ritonavir, which is used to treat people who are HIV positive; dexamethasone as an oral solution; and 20m azithromycin capsules in packs of up to six. A Whitehall source said the purchase of hydroxychloroquine was related to current clinical trials to evaluate it as a treatment for people with Covid-19, adding that it should only be taken on prescription or as part of a controlled clinical trial. The World Health Organization has said it is concerned by reports of individuals self-medicating and causing themselves serious harm. Trump was hosting a meeting about the struggling restaurant industry on Monday when he caught reporters unawares by revealing he was taking the drug. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at how many people are taking it, especially the frontline workers before you catch it, the frontline workers, many, many are taking it,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI happen to be taking it.\u201d The drug was also endorsed by the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro. The Guardian disclosed last week that the UK government had entered into 16 contracts for chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and chloroquine phosphate, and placed orders for lopinavir-ritonavir. Contracts with British-based firms were entered into without going to tender on the grounds of \u201cextreme urgency\u201d, according to an online record of the deals. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK is leading the way on research in the race to find and fast-track potential treatments, and clinical trials are under way to assess whether existing medicines are safe and effective for treating Covid-19. \u201cThis includes hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, dexamethasone and azithromycin, and we have procured these medicines to support clinical trials. \u201cBut until we have clear, definitive evidence these treatments are safe and effective, we do not recommend the use of hydroxychloroquine outside of a clinical trial.\u201d",

Labour MP and her committee have produced what is <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/human-rights-committee/news-parliament-2017/covid-contact-tracing-app-draft-bill-19-21\">effectively a private member\u2019s bill</a> \u2013 a proposed law submitted by a backbencher \u2013 aimed at improving privacy standards and boosting public confidence in the novel system.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element

</figure> \n  <p>In a briefing on Wednesday, Harman said she had sent the digital contact tracing (data protection) bill to the health secretary, <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Matt Hancock</strong>, and to <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Jacob Rees-Mogg</strong>, leader of the Commons.</p> \n  <p>Specific legislation, she urged, is required rather than the existing \u201cmishmash\u201d of standards involving the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), case law, the European convention on human rights and the Data Protection Act because the contact-tracing app is more ambitious than anything previously envisaged.</p> \n  <p>The JCHR bill would prevent data being used for other purposes, stop anybody not authorised gaining access to it, delete the data after the pandemic and establish a contact-tracing human rights commissioner.</p> \n  <p>Harman said she would personally download the app, which is already being piloted on the Isle of Wight, but her committee\u2019s view was that it should not go ahead without new privacy protections.</p> \n  <p>Those protections should apply whether or not the government continued with its existing centralised model or whether it eventually opted for the type of \u201cdecentralised\u201d app being used more widely on the continent.</p> \n  <p>Only Australia, she had acknowledged, has so far passed data protection legislation specifically applying to a contact-tracing app. \u201cI have asked Jacob Rees-Mogg to make time in parliament to bring [the bill] forward,\u201c Harman said. \u201cIf not they should allow parliament to say whether [should have a vote on it.]\u201d</p> \n  <p>Asked whether safeguards should be relaxed during an emergency, Harman said it was a matter of balancing the right to life with privacy protections.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T15:06:06.395Z\">at 4.06pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec3f34b8f0886ce4f5d66d5\"

If we look at the UK as a whole, that is just under 55,000 excess deaths.</p> \n   <p>So the gap between Covid-related and excess is about 25% of excess deaths are not explained by Covid being on the death certificate. And that is now a key area of research for us to get underneath that, to understand that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Stripe said that within the next couple of weeks the ONS planned to publish more research looking at why the excess deaths figure was so high. But he said <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsinvolvingcovid19englandandwales/deathsoccurringinapril2020\">a report published by the ONS on Friday</a>, on deaths in April, did shed some light on what was happening. He went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That showed that deaths from dementia and Alzheimer disease had gone up very, very significantly during April, as had deaths from something known as \u201cill-defined conditions\u201d. That is often where the certifying doctor puts things like frailty or old age on the death certificate. Usually in the very old, where there might not be a specific morbidity, but the patient has been unwell, you\u2019ll often get these ill-defined conditions. And they were up significantly as well in April.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Stripe said there could be two reasons for this increase. First \u201cnormal care pathways\u201d could be disrupted; ie, fewer patients were going to hospital, because the hospitals were concentrating on coronavirus. Second, coronavirus might be a factor in these deaths, without doctors being able to confirm that. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There may be some cases where Covid is present but it is not obvious to the certifying doctor that that is the case.</p> \n   <p>And it may be the case that this big jump in the number of dementia and Alzheimer deaths could explain part of that reason there. It could well be that in the very old, if the patient is not able to describe their symptoms very well, there may be many other co-morbidities, that perhaps the doctor has not felt able, in the absence of a positive test, to put Covid on the death certificate.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T09:24:35.231Z\">at 10.24am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec39a3c8f0864e579f1391f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T08:44:36.983Z\">9.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Excess deaths in England and Wales running at 3,081 in first week of May, ONS says</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <strong>Office for National Statistics</strong> has just published <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending8may2020\">the latest weekly death figures for England and Wales.</a> They cover the week up to Friday 8 May (or week 19, as the ONS calls it).</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Overall deaths in England and Wales in the week up to 8 May were down for the third week in a row, at 12,657. </strong>But they were still 3,081 above the five-year average for that week.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Some 31.1% of the deaths in the week up to 8 May involved coronavirus being mentioned on the death certificate, down from 33.6% the previous week.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Overall deaths in care homes in the week up to 8 May were down, from 6,409 to 4,248.</strong> But the proportion involving coronavirus was up from 37.8% the previous week to 39.2%.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec399148f08a1782fa7d569\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T08:34:12.466Z\">9.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Britain\u2019s farmers and carmakers will be protected under a new post-Brexit trade regime that will result in 60% of goods coming into the country tariff-free from the start of next year, the government has announced.

Health and care jobs generally require a high level of training, which means that workers who have been furloughed or made unemployed will struggle to fill these jobs. For those who remain employed, the collapse in job vacancies will severely limit their ability to move between jobs, which is an important channel for wage progression especially among younger workers.</p> \n   <p>The fact that there has been no recovery in vacancies in the most deprived local authorities is also worrying, especially because it will be risky to travel far for work on public transport.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec393018f0864e579f138e4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T08:11:42.842Z\">9.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">There are 'substantial number' of job vacancies, says work and pensions secretary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The work and pensions secretary, <strong>Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey</strong>, has been speaking to broadcasters this morning.

More than one in three 18 to 24-year-olds, and three in 10 workers in their early 60s, are receiving less pay than they did at the start of the year.

      "bodyText": "UK Covid-19 death toll riseS by 545 to 35,341, according to latest figures Speaking at Downing Street\u2019s daily press conference, the environment secretary, George Eustice, urged Britons to apply for jobs as fruit pickers to compensate for the fact that only a third of the eastern Europeans who normally come to the UK to do this work are expected to arrive. The UK is facing a \u201csevere recession the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen\u201d, says Rishi Sunak Giving evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee earlier today, the chancellor said that by the end of the year he expected the percentage of the population in unemployment to be in double figures. It is not obvious that there will be an immediate bounce back, he added. \u201cWe are likely to face a severe recession, the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen, and of course that will have an impact on employment,\u201d he said. Number of people claiming unemployment benefits surged in April as lockdown hit economy, figures show The UK claimant count jumped by 69% during the month, as 856,000 more people received universal credit and jobseeker\u2019s allowance benefits in April. That lifted the claimant count to nearly 2.1 million people, from 1.24 million in March. In the south-west, the claimant count almost doubled during the month. Meanwhile, more than 2m households have applied for universal credit, the UK\u2019s main social security benefit, since the coronavirus lockdown started to hit the economy in mid-March, according to the latest figures from the Department for Work and Pensions. Excess deaths in UK reached almost 55,000 in early May, according to Office for National Statistics Nick Stripe, the head of the health analysis and life events division at the ONS, told the BBC the total number of excess deaths in the UK - the number above what might be expected at this time of year, judged by a five-year average \u2013 was just under 55,000 by early May. Scientists, and ministers, have repeatedly said that the excess death figures will ultimately prove the most reliable guide as to how badly the UK has been hit by coronavirus. Three Premier League football clubs hit by positive Covid-19 tests before top-flight return Half a dozen people from three Premier League football clubs have tested positive for Covid-19 in two days. With hopes of top-flight football resuming next month, the Premier League announced six players or staff returned positive results in its first two days of testing. Health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, pressed over government\u2019s \u2018slow\u2019 handling of impact of pandemic in care homes Facing an urgent question from the shadow minister for social care, Liz Kendall, Hancock defended the government\u2019s approach, saying deaths in care homes were falling. Kendall highlighted that more than 23,000 more people had died in care homes in the first four months of this year compared with last, accusing ministers of being \u201ctoo slow\u201d to tackle the impact of the virus in social care. Commons science and technology committee criticises government for \u2018inadequate\u2019 coronavirus testing capacity throughout pandemic The group of MPs identified several lessons to learn from the UK\u2019s handling of the outbreak, and criticised a lack of transparency over some crucial decision-making. They called on the government to \u201curgently\u201d build up capacity for contact tracing, a key tactic in helping ease existing lockdown measures. Here\u2019s more on the news earlier that Labour\u2019s annual party conference has been cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The conference, which would have been Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s first as leader and was due to be attended by 13,000 people in Liverpool in September, will be replaced with online events. \u201cOur priority is the safety of members, staff and visitors to our events and the need to protect the public\u2019s health,\u201d a spokesman for the party said. \u201cIn light of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, we have therefore decided to postpone this year\u2019s annual and women\u2019s conferences.\u201d Labour\u2019s decision to cancel casts doubt on the conference season for the other main parties. A Liberal Democrat source told PA Media that a decision on the party\u2019s own conference, due to be held in Brighton, would be made this evening and it was expected to also be moved online. Here are the main points from the press conference. Prof Dame Angela McLean, the government\u2019s deputy chief scientific adviser, said that scientists have told ministers that they should only relax the lockdown when a proper contact tracing system is in place. She said: Scientists have been very clear in our advice that changes to lockdown, as we modelled them, need a highly effective track, trace and isolate system to be in place. And we\u2019re also very clear that any change to the social distancing measures should be based upon observed levels of incidents in places where those are going to be changed, not on a fixed date. Downing Street has implied that the lockdown could be relaxed further without a contact tracing system being rolled out across England. A contact tracing app is being trialled on the Isle of Wight, and the government has hired 21,000 people to do contact tracing. But the government has not been able to commit to having a countrywide contact tracing system up and running by 1 June, which is when it wants to move to the next stage of easing the lockdown, including with some primary school pupils returning to school in England. McLean\u2019s comment is unlikely to be welcomed by No 10. These are from my colleague Peter Walker. McLean said scientific advisers were due to be told this Thursday when the government would be able to roll out the \u201ctrack and trace\u201d contact tracking system. (See 5.29pm.) She said that the government had to limit the extent of testing in March because it did not have the capacity to test everyone with suspected coronavirus. She said: The advice that we gave certainly took account of what testing was available. It was the best thing to do with the tests that we had. We could not have people in hospital with Covid symptoms not knowing whether or not they had Covid. It is only recently that officials have said explicitly that capacity was the problem; previously it was claimed that there were policy reasons for the decision to abandon widespread testing. But even at this press conference George Eustice, the environment secretary, was not quite as open about capacity being the problem as McLean. (See 5.23pm.) Eustice dismissed as a \u201ccaricature\u201d claims that the government did not protect people in care homes from coronavirus. But he accepted that some patients with coronavirus were discharged into care homes. He said: We don\u2019t accept the caricature that we took an approach that was wrong. Very early on in this epidemic we had protocols in place for care homes, there was guidance as to how they should approach things. As the situation developed then more stringent policies were introduced by way of policy around discharge and we got to the point where everybody was tested before discharge. But in those early weeks there will have been some instances where people may have been discharged who were asymptomatic, there may have been some \u2013 a small number of instances \u2013 where they may have been showing symptoms but would have been isolating. That was the guidance at the time that was in place but we have strengthened that very much ever since then, we now have testing and a rigorous discharge policy that\u2019s in place and that is getting stronger all the time. Eustice urged Britons to apply for jobs as fruit pickers to compensate for the fact that only a third of the eastern Europeans who normally come to the UK to do this work are expected to arrive. But he advised people interested to try a new Pick for Britain website that has not been working this afternoon. He said: Every year large numbers of people come from countries such as Romania or Bulgaria to take part in the harvest, harvesting crops such as strawberries and salads and vegetables. We estimate that probably only about a third of the people that would normally come are already here, and small numbers may continue to travel. But one thing is clear and that is that this year we will need to rely on British workers to lend a hand to help bring that harvest home. This is from LBC\u2019s Ben Kentish. McLean said government advisers were looking in detail at whether lockdown measures should be eased at different times in different places. Asked if there was a case for treating remote island communities differently, she replied: I can tell you for sure location is a huge focus of ours at the moment. Islands are a very special case which is, of course, particularly interesting but there are also other parts of the country that have ... the spread of the infection across the country is really quite diverse, quite heterogeneous and that does, of course, raise interesting questions, particularly as we get incidents right, right down about what should we do about that. MSPs have voted to repeal controversial measures which gave the Scottish government and public bodies the right to take up to three months to answer freedom of information requests. To the dismay of civil rights groups and opposition MSPs, the Scottish government pushed through emergency legislation in April which gave public bodies up to 60 working days to answer requests. Ministers claimed the coronavirus pandemic was an exceptional case which put the public sector under too great a strain to respond to requests within 20 days, even though no other government in the UK or Europe followed suit. MSPs on the Scottish parliament\u2019s Covid-19 committee backed amendments to a further emergency bill, Coronavirus (Scotland) (No 2), from the Scottish Greens on Tuesday to return to the original rules under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002. The Greens\u2019 measures were supported by Scottish National party MSPs on the committee, after SNP amendments were voted down, implying that the SNP minority government will back the amendments when the bill is finally voted on on Thursday. Ross Greer, a Scottish Green MSP, said: Confidence in government is critical right now but it depends on transparency. Restricting freedom of information was wrong and unnecessary, reflected by the fact that no other country in Europe has taken this step. The Greens are glad to have brought Scotland back in line with common standards of openness and transparency. The Labour party has cancelled its conference this autumn, according to Sienna Rodgers from LabourList. McLean says it is important to have a rapid and reliable testing system. Q: Are you confident that we have got one? It is getting better, says McLean. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Eustice says the government has provided extra funding for coronavirus. He says he accepts they will say they need more. But they have funds set aside, he says, referring to reserves. And he says he thinks the \u00a33.2bn already allocated is the right decision. Q: What will you prioritise in the Brexit talks? The City, which contributes greatly to the UK economy, or the fishing industry, which contributes much less? Eustice says the government wants the UK to be an independent country. He says the EU expects the UK, uniquely, to give it unlimited access to its waters. He says the government should not go into the negotiation planning to sacrifice one industry to help another. Q: Are you considering easing the lockdown in island communities more quickly? McLean says she cannot comment on policy, but she says whether to treat islands differently is an interesting issue. Q: In February a WHO report said community tracing was the best way to combat coronavirus. So why was that not followed? And who takes ultimate responsibility - the politicians or the scientists? McLean says the advice in March was based on the testing capacity available. It was not acceptable not to test people in hospital, she says. Eustice says the government has been increasing capacity. And he says it was right to prioritise hospital testing. Q: So are you saying that the advice given in March was the best advice possible in the context at the time. McLean says that is what she is saying. In his opening remarks Eustice urged people interested in fruit picking work to use a pickforbritain website. As my colleague Fran Lawther points out, it does not seem to be working. Q: Can you understand why teachers don\u2019t trust the government on the safety of re-opening schools? Eustice says he does not accept that the government has mishandled the crisis. On schools, he says the government is working closely with unions and school leaders. He says countries like Denmark have shown it is possible to re-open schools. Q: Track and trace won\u2019t be in place by 1 June. Does that affect the decision? McLean says there will be an update on Thursday as to what will be in place (in terms of track and trace) and when. Q: Do you accept this is a political decision? Eustice says the government is following the science. But he says we will have to live alongside this virus for some time to come. Q: You say you are inspired by contact tracing in South Korea. Do you regret the decision to abandon it in March? Eustice says the government is ramping it up now. More than 20,000 people have been recruited to help, he says. McLean says in March it was right to focus the testing capacity that was available on the people who really needed it in hospital. Q: So you admit that capacity, not need, was the issue? Eustice says they have been building capacity. Another member of the public asks if the government will extend payment holidays on mortgages and loans for people who lose work. Eustice says the government has offered unprecedented help. Those schemes will evolve, he says. The Treasury will be thinking about how the job retention scheme can evolve. The first question comes from a member of the public who wants to know what the government is doing to learn lessons from other countries about how to ease the lockdown. Eustice says the government is looking at the experience in other countries. McLean says two countries stand out. South Korea has used contact tracing particularly well to drive numbers down. They now just have a handful. The UK would like to emulate that, she says. And she says she would like to learn from Germany\u2019s record on testing. McLean is now introducing the daily slides. She starts with one about transport use. Here are the hospital figures. She says the hospital admissions figures are falling, but not as quickly as people might have expected. And here are the regional hospital figures. Here are the death figures. Eustice is now talking about the availability of foreign labour for the harvest. Normally workers from countries like Romania and Bulgaria come. But only around a third of them are here, he says. He says the government is encouraging Britons to take these jobs. He says staff who are furloughed may want to supplement their income with a second job. Eustice starts by reading out the latest figures. He says there have been a further 545 UK deaths, taking the total to 35,341 George Eustice, the environment secretary, is taking the UK government\u2019s afternoon press conference. It is about to start. He will be with Prof Dame Angela McLean, the government\u2019s deputy chief scientific adviser. Half a dozen people from three Premier League football clubs have tested positive for Covid-19 in two days. With hopes of top-flight football resuming next month, the Premier League announced six players or staff returned positive results in its first two days of testing. The league carried out 748 tests on Sunday and Monday as part of a process designed to allow matches to restart next month. It means that just under 1% of those tested returned positive results. A recent survey of 11,000 people suggests one in 400 people \u2013 0.27% \u2013 in England is infected. Squads were allowed to return to training today, carried out according to physical distancing. It is understood the league is awaiting results from at least one more club. The league said in a statement: \u201cThe Premier League can today confirm that, on Sunday 17 May and Monday 18 May, 748 players and club staff were tested for Covid-19. Of these, six have tested positive from three clubs. Players or club staff who have tested positive will now self-isolate for a period of seven days. The Premier League is providing this aggregated information for the purposes of competition integrity and oversight. No specific details as to clubs or individuals will be provided by the Premier League due to legal and operational requirements. The league had been hoping that matches would resume on 12 June, but there is now an expectation this will be pushed back until at least the end of the month if not later. Germany\u2019s Bundesliga saw action behind closed doors at the weekend for the first time since the lockdown, while South Korea\u2019s top flight has also resumed. Alongside the draft text of a proposed trade treaty with the EU, No 10 has also published this afternoon an open letter (pdf) from David Frost, the PM\u2019s chief Europe adviser, to Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator. In the four-page letter, which is written in a tone of polite indignation (feigned or genuine, it\u2019s hard to tell), Frost sets out in detail why the UK government thinks the EU\u2019s demands are unreasonable. He says: Overall, at this moment in negotiations, what is on offer is not a fair free trade relationship between close economic partners, but a relatively low-quality trade agreement coming with unprecedented EU oversight of our laws and institutions. The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the prison estate continues to rise, daily figures from the Ministry of Justice show. As at 5pm on Monday, 422 prisoners had tested positive for the coronavirus across 74 prisons, a 3% increase in 24 hours, while there were 542 infected prison staff across 72 prisons, an increase of just 0.4% in the same period. There are around 80,300 prisoners in England and Wales across 117 prisons, while around 33,000 staff work in the public sector prisons. At least 21 prisoners are known to have contracted Covid-19 and died, as well as nine prison staff, including one Pecs (prison escort and custody services) worker. The Duke of Cambridge has highlighted the strain of the Covid-19 pandemic on the mental health of frontline workers looking after others, urging them: \u201cTake care of yourself too.\u201d In a video message, Prince William thanked those working in the emergency services, hospitals or care homes, calling on them to seek support if their mental wellbeing is suffering. \u201cWhen you spend all day taking care of others it is easy to forget that you need to take care of yourself too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s OK to say when you\u2019re not feeling OK. There is support available to you, if and when you need it.\u201d The message is part of the recently launched Our Frontline initiative, supported by his Royal Foundation, which provides one-to-one support and online resources for a range of workers whose psychological wellbeing may be under pressure. In the video, posted on Our Frontline Twitter account, William said: \u201cI want to say a huge thank you from myself and Catherine for all that you are doing to keep everyone safe. You and your families are making huge sacrifices, and we want you to know that the whole country is enormously proud of you. The challenges you are facing, day in, day out, are unprecedented. Even in normal circumstances, frontline work can take its toll not just on your physical health, but also on your mental wellbeing.\u201d The duke, who was a pilot with the East Anglian Air Ambulance and has spoken in the past about the mental pressures that came with the job, added: \u201cFrom my time with the air ambulance, I know all too well how determined frontline workers are to put a brave face on and keep going.\u201d In a 2018 interview, William said the experience of attending traumatic emergencies involving children and having his own children \u201ctipped me over the edge\u201d, but speaking to his crew helped him cope with the \u201cenormous sadness\u201d he had witnessed. The duke and duchess have pledged to make the mental health of frontline workers their \u201ctop priority\u201d in the months ahead. Mind, Samaritans, Shout - a text messaging helpline supporting people in crisis - Hospice UK and the Royal Foundation launched Our Frontline a few weeks ago, with William and Kate\u2019s charitable body helping to raise awareness. In the Lords economic affairs committee Sunak says debt will obviously be higher after the coronavirus crisis. But he says he has not made a decision yet as to what a sustainable debt level would be. At the Lords economic affairs committee Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has just been engaged in a minor spat with Lord Forsyth, the committee chair, about social care. Forsyth said there was a consensus about adult social care needing much higher funding. Sunak affected surprise, and said that if there was a consensus, he would like to hear about it (implying that he thought no such consensus existed). Forsyth said that his committee published a report last summer saying the sector needed another \u00a315bn. The report said the money should come from general taxation, but it did not make specific recommendations as to which taxes should go up. Sunak said he thought the plans would require income tax rising by either 2p or 3p in the pound. He implied that he thought it would be hard to get consensus support for tax increases on that scale. David Henig, a former civil servant and trade specialist who now heads the UK Trade Policy Project for the European Centre for International Political Economy, has been looking at the UK government\u2019s draft text for a proposed trade deal with the EU. He has posted a detailed Twitter thread on it starting here. And here are his conclusions. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine has published some new research today suggesting the people with chronic medical conditions, like obesity, hypertension and lung disease, have been disproportionately likely to reduce the amount of exercise they take during the lockdown. Dr Nina Rogers, the lead author of the study, said: Low levels of physical activity put adults at increased risk of chronic diseases like obesity, cardiovascular disease and stroke which are also potential risk factors for more severe complications if someone develops Covid-19. It is concerning that in the mid to long term, multiple lockdowns might lead to prolonged periods of low physical activity which could increase the size of the population that is most vulnerable to severe complications from Covid-19. Harriet Harman, the chair of parliament\u2019s joint committee on human rights (JCHR), has called for MPs to be allowed to vote on a data protection bill safeguarding widespread use of the government\u2019s contact-tracing app. The Labour MP and her committee have produced what is effectively a private member\u2019s bill \u2013 a proposed law submitted by a backbencher \u2013 aimed at improving privacy standards and boosting public confidence in the novel system. In a briefing on Wednesday, Harman said she had sent the digital contact tracing (data protection) bill to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and to Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of the Commons. Specific legislation, she urged, is required rather than the existing \u201cmishmash\u201d of standards involving the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), case law, the European convention on human rights and the Data Protection Act because the contact-tracing app is more ambitious than anything previously envisaged. The JCHR bill would prevent data being used for other purposes, stop anybody not authorised gaining access to it, delete the data after the pandemic and establish a contact-tracing human rights commissioner. Harman said she would personally download the app, which is already being piloted on the Isle of Wight, but her committee\u2019s view was that it should not go ahead without new privacy protections. Those protections should apply whether or not the government continued with its existing centralised model or whether it eventually opted for the type of \u201cdecentralised\u201d app being used more widely on the continent. Only Australia, she had acknowledged, has so far passed data protection legislation specifically applying to a contact-tracing app. \u201cI have asked Jacob Rees-Mogg to make time in parliament to bring [the bill] forward,\u201c Harman said. \u201cIf not they should allow parliament to say whether [should have a vote on it.]\u201d Asked whether safeguards should be relaxed during an emergency, Harman said it was a matter of balancing the right to life with privacy protections. Back in the Lords economic affairs committee, asked if he agrees that promoting growth should take precedence over addressing debt after the crisis is over, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, says that of course he wants to promote growth. Welcome news for Italian food lovers as Pizza Express becomes the latest restaurant chain to cautiously reopen restaurants to offer home delivery across the capital. The firm will start delivering from 13 sites in London over the next 10 days, offering a limited menu to ensure staff can work safely in kitchens and prep areas. It follows an earlier announcement from Wagamama, which is expanding delivery across the nation, and comes in the wake of KFC, McDonald\u2019s, Greggs and Subway all making similar plans or starting trading again after shutting due to the Covid-19 Zoe Bowley, the managing director of Pizza Express in the UK and Ireland, said the chain would offer an edited menu from restaurants in \u201cLondon villages\u201d, including Notting Hill, Balham and Fulham, where demand is highest. Writing in industry newsletter Propel, she said: \u201cWe will do this to test and learn, and then it will enable us to programme the roll-out and ultimately pave the way for dine in the future.\u201d Restaurants and bars have been allowed to remain open for takeaways and deliveries under government rules but many larger chains chose to shut completely, to protect staff from travelling to work. Bowley added in the piece: \u201cThere has been huge rigour around all the right safety protocols so our teams feel comfortable, and then we can really demonstrate to customers how we are looking after the teams and ensure they trust the quality of the pizza they receive.\u201d Meanwhile, service station business Moto said it will reopen seven Costa drive-throughs and have 27 Burger Kings open for takeaway to the public by Thursday. Michael Russell, the Scottish government\u2019s constitution secretary, has issued this statement following the publication of the UK government\u2019s draft text of a proposed free trade treaty with the EU. (See 3.08pm.) He said: People in Scotland will be utterly dismayed that the UK government is pressing ahead with these complex negotiations when all their efforts should be focused on tackling the current unprecedented crisis. Despite making many requests to see these texts, the Scottish government only received these legal texts a few hours before publication so we have not yet had the opportunity to analyse in any detail what is proposed. But it is clear the UK government\u2019s plans for only a basic trade deal or what increasingly seems to be their preferred option of no deal will be a devastating blow for Scotland\u2019s economy already hit hard by coronavirus. Yet again the UK government has chosen to treat Scotland\u2019s interests and views with contempt and they have failed to involve any of the devolved governments in any meaningful way. In the Lords committee Lord Forsyth, the former Conservative cabinet minister who chairs the committee, says the reproduction number, R, is lower in London. So, given that London is the motor of the economy, would it make sense to lift the lockdown in London first? Sunak says his understanding is that that is not what the scientists are advising at the moment. Q: Why won\u2019t you tell employers what percentage of the furlough scheme they will have to pay from August? And why didn\u2019t you take a sectoral approach? Sunak says the change will come into effect in August. He says he will publish his plans by the end of this month. That will give employers ample time to prepare, he says. And he says he looked at adopting a sectoral approach to the furlough scheme. But he decided it would be very difficult to enforce, particularly taking into account supply chains. So he went for a wider, more generous approach, he says. At the Lords committee hearing Sunak said that the longer the recession went on, the more likely there was to be \u201cscarring\u201d (ie, people suffering a permanent to their wages or income). In the Lords committee Sunak says it is not obvious that there will be an immediate bounce back. Asked about the likely shape of the recovery, he said: We all would hope that it is as swift and strong as it can be. We are getting data from around Europe and around the world as countries are progressively easing and lifting restrictions. It is not obvious that there will be an immediate bounce back. It takes time to get back to the habits that they had. There are still restrictions in place. Even if we can re-open retail, which I would very much like to be able to do on 1 June, there will still be restrictions on how people can shop, which will have an impact likely on how much they spend. And those things will all take time. So I think, in all cases, it will take a little bit of time for things to get back to normal, even once we\u2019ve re-opened currently closed sectors. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has just started giving evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee. He said that by the end of the year he expected unemployment to be in double figures. He also said Britain was facing \u201ca severe recession the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen\u201d. He told the peers: Although we have put unprecedented mitigating actions in place, I certainly won\u2019t be able to protect every job and every business. We\u2019re already seeing that in the data, and no doubt there will be more hardship to come. This lockdown is having a very significant impact on our economy. We are likely to face a severe recession, the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen, and of course that will have an impact on employment. The UK has published its terms for a free trade agreement with the European Union as it looks to increase pressure on Brussels to back down over its demands. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, told MPs in response to an urgent question earlier that the government had decided to make public the UK\u2019s draft legal texts, with a 291-page draft comprehensive free trade agreement among the 12 documents to be published this afternoon. The draft treaty is here (pdf). And the rest of the documents being published today (mostly related draft treaty agreements) are here. And the health department in Northern Ireland has recorded a further seven deaths, taking the total to 489. The details are here. Public Health Wales has recorded a further 17 deaths, taking the total to 1,224. More than 2m households have applied for universal credit, the UK\u2019s main social security benefit, since the coronavirus lock down started to hit the economy in mid-March, latest figures from the Department for Work and Pensions show. Between 16 March, when social distancing guidance came into effect, and 12 May, there were 2,042,560 \u201cdeclarations\u201d \u2013 where people signed up for universal credit help because they had lost their job or had taken a big cut in pay. Since 23 March, when lockdown was formally announced, there have been 1,771,910 household applications. Not all will be followed through or successful \u2013 either because claimants move back into work, or they are ineligible because they have more than \u00a316,000 in savings. Universal credit applications reached a daily peak on 27 March of 103,310. Although volumes have dipped \u2013 there were 23,680 on 12 May \u2013 they remain significantly higher than pre-crisis levels. On 1 March there were just 4,090 applications. The government heralded the record figures as proof that the digital universal credit system was holding up under pressure. However, the DWP has come under fire after reports that new claimants were worse off after applying for universal credit because the application automatically triggered the cancellation of existing in-work benefits. When claimants realised they were ineligible for universal credit because their savings levels were too high, they found that DWP rules prevented their tax credit award being reinstated, leaving them hundreds of pounds out of pocket, the BBC reported. A child of seven was among 174 new Covid-19 deaths, NHS England has said. The new fatalities bring the number of people who have died in hospitals in England after testing positive for coronavirus \u2013 or where Covid-19 is documented as a cause of death \u2013 to 24,913. The full details are here (pdf). NHS England said six patients \u2013 aged 45 to 90 \u2013 of the 174 who died had no known underlying health conditions, suggesting the seven-year-old who died had some form of existing medical issue. Yesterday, the Department of Health and Social Care released figures saying the UK\u2019s Covid-19 death toll, including fatalities in the community, was 34,796. Children as young as 11 could be recruited in \u201clarge numbers\u201d by county lines drugs gangs if secondary schools do not fully reopen until September, a police and crime commissioner has said. The West Midlands\u2019 Labour commissioner David Jamieson, who is also a former teacher, said children aged 11-14 could be \u201cswept up\u201d by criminals because they were not in lessons during the Covid-19 lockdown. It comes as the government has announced it wants some primary school pupils to be back in lessons \u201cat the earliest\u201d by 1 June, and \u201cface-to-face support\u201d for older secondary pupils with upcoming exams. But local authorities have instructed schools not to reopen because of safety concerns. Jamieson, speaking at the region\u2019s strategic policing and crime board, said he was also concerned about boys who may find themselves out of work after furlough ends, falling into crime. Commenting on the reopening of some schools in England from June, he said: I very much welcome the reopening, as long as it\u2019s safe to do so. But I have a concern that one group of children was not mentioned and that\u2019s children in earlier secondary years, 11 to 14 years of age. Years 7, 8 and 9, there was no intention of them going back to school before September. Now that is profoundly concerning to me \u2013 large numbers of younger children, those more likely to be swept up by the gangs and taken into county lines getting into all sorts of other things, very undesirable things. Those children will be available for those criminals to take them on. I think the government needs to urgently look at that. That if the schools are going to reopen there is going to have to be some ongoing education for those younger teenagers as well. It could be making provision for them to have good-quality distance learning or having some time in the school so they keep contact with their studies. And here are two of the main lines from the Downing Street lobby briefing. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman rejected claims that care homes were forced to take coronavirus patients without proper support. The spokesman said: No care home should be forced to take back recovering Covid patients if they don\u2019t feel that they can provide the appropriate care. We have been clear on that throughout. The NHS are now testing all people leaving hospital in advance of their discharge to care homes. The allegation that care homes were forced to take patients with coronavirus being discharged from hospital, who then spread the infection, has been made repeatedly. Two articles have put the case particularly powerful. In this one (paywall) in the Sunday Times this weekend an anonymous care home boss said: On March 17, Sir Simon Stevens, the NHS chief executive, said hospitals had to get 90,000 beds cleared, so they needed to get 30,000 people out. So they sent patients with no tests into care homes. They said: \u201cWe don\u2019t need tests \u2014 you\u2019ve just got to take them.\u201d Well, I\u2019ve now got two homes with Covid-19. We can trace it. In both homes it came from residents bringing the virus from hospital. So when the manager of another of my homes rang to tell me he\u2019d refused, I said categorically: \u201cWell done.\u201d That home has 90 beds, and to this day it is still Covid-free. And in this Telegraph column (paywall) cited by Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs last week Ambrose Evans-Pritchard wrote: A Covid cardiologist at a top London hospital \u2013 friendly to Boris \u2013 has been so incensed by the daily charade of bogus omniscience that he vented his spleen in an email to me on Sunday night. It is a poignant indictment, so I pass along a few snippets. Basically, every mistake that could have been made, was made. He likened the care home policy to the Siege of Caffa in 1346, that grim chapter of the Black Death when a Mongol army catapulted plague-ridden bodies over the walls. \u201cOur policy was to let the virus rip and then \u2018cocoon the elderly\u2019,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou don\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry when you contrast that with what we actually did. We discharged known, suspected, and unknown cases into care homes which were unprepared, with no formal warning that the patients were infected, no testing available, and no PPE to prevent transmission. We actively seeded this into the very population that was most vulnerable.\u201d The spokesman confirmed that ministers are ultimately responsible for government decisions. This was promoted by a question about Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey\u2019s comment this morning suggesting scientists were to blame for bad government decisions. (See 9.32am.) The spokesman said: The prime minister is hugely grateful for the hard work and expertise of the UK\u2019s world-leading scientists, we\u2019ve been guided by their advice throughout and we continue to do so. Scientists provide advice to the government, ministers ultimately decide. This will be seen as an attempt to persuade government scientists that they are not being lined as the scapegoats for the widely-anticipated inquiry into the UK\u2019s handling of this crisis. Whether the scientists will feel reassured or not is another matter. Access to places of worship will have to be \u201csupervised\u201d when they reopen as the country eases out of the Covid-19 lockdown, according to the head of the Catholic church in England and Wales. Speaking on a Zoom panel about the safe reopening of places of worship, Cardinal Vincent Nichols suggested different sections of churches could be closed off each day to allow cleaning to take place. Acknowledging that supervision will be required, he explained that \u201cit\u2019s not as if the church doors will be flung open and say: \u2018come in when you want.\u2019\u201d Places of worship come under step three of the government\u2019s recovery strategy, meaning they cannot open until 4 July at the earliest. Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster, said: \u201cI think one thing is very clear, access to a church in the foreseeable future will be supervised, so it\u2019s not as if the church doors will be flung open and say: come in when you want. There will have to be people there, the whole process will have to be supervised.\u201d He added: \u201cEach day a different section of the church might be made available, it doesn\u2019t have to be the whole church, the whole time. \u201cSo you could have the right hand back part for one day, and then the next day it will be the next session, so that would enable a cleaning routine to be more feasible, and it would leave parts of the church unused for maybe three days, which would help in terms of the hygiene.\u201d Nichols said last week that Catholic churches should be allowed to reopen before Pentecostal churches, or mosques owing to their different styles of worship. At at Commons committee this morning Ros Pritchard, the director general of the British Holiday and Home Park Association, said \u201cvigilante\u201d members of the public had been reporting people staying in holiday homes - not knowing they were key workers, not holidaymakers. Asked about a nervousness among communities at the prospect of visitors, she said: We\u2019ve had vigilantes. When we\u2019ve got holiday parks, say with NHS workers because we\u2019ve been accommodating key workers when we could, we\u2019ve had vigilantes checking up and reporting them to the council and the police - who are these people on your holiday park, what are they doing there? That negative, anti-feeling is going to be an issue. Pritchard also said that seasonal tourism businesses were effectively looking at \u201cthree winters in a row\u201d and that, while businesses were \u201changing in there\u201d, some could start \u201cgoing to the wall\u201d in October without ongoing support. At the Lords science committee this morning (see 12.19pm) Prof John Edmunds, professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of the governments\u2019 Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, said the study of other coronaviruses suggested \u201cpotentially bad news\u201d for hopes that humans could develop a long-term immunity from Covid-19. He explained: You can see that antibodies decline over time from survivors of Sars [severe acute respiratory syndrome, a form of coronavirus]. So after a couple of years, their antibodies have declined quite significantly. We can also see from other coronaviruses, from ones that cause coughs and colds, that individuals again do seem to not have particularly long-term immunity to many of those viruses, allowing them to get reinfected later. So that\u2019s potentially bad news for us, that immunity may not last that long against this virus. Here are some of the main points from Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s press conference in Edinburgh. Sturgeon rejected suggestions that the Scottish government was engaged in a cover-up when it failed to notify people who might have been infected with coronavirus at the Nike conference in Edinburgh in February. At least 25 people at the conference contracted coronavirus, but people who may have been in contact with them at the venue were not told. Sturgeon said that an incident management team was in charge, and that it acted independently. She said other people were not alerted out of concerns for patient confidentiality. She said that to have publicised the incident at that stage could have led to individuals being identified. This was not a \u201cdeliberate attempt to cover up\u201d, she said. She said she could understand why people thought that had been the wrong decision. But she would not go as far as saying herself that it had been the wrong decision given the circumstances at the time. Dr Gregor Smith, the interim chief medical officer for Scotland, said he was not aware of any active cases in Scotland of children having a serious condition like Kawasaki disease, that may be related to coronavirus. Sturgeon insisted that there had been \u201cgood cooperation between the different nations of the UK\u201d in handling coronavirus. She defended the decision to discharge patients into Scottish care homes when there was not a proper testing regime in place. She said at the time it was vital to free up hospital capacity. Matt Hancock has acknowledged the importance of learning from other countries in dealing with coronavirus after an MP highlighted that there have been no deaths in care homes in Hong Kong or South Korea. In the Commons, Labour\u2019s Sarah Owen asked: \u201cThe health and social care select committee just heard evidence that there has been not one single care home death in Hong Kong or South Korea, despite their close proximity to China and shorter time to prepare for this crisis. In comparison, the UK has now tragically seen over 10,000 deaths of loved ones in care homes. How can the government describe this as a success and isn\u2019t it time now to learn from other countries who have genuinely put a protective ring around their care homes?\u201d In response, Hancock said: \u201cWell yes absolutely, it is important to learn from everywhere around the world and this epidemic has had a different shape in different parts of the world, and as she knows, a very significant impact throughout Europe.\u201d Calderdale council in Yorkshire has become the latest local authority to advise its schools not to open on 1 June, defying government policy. The Labour council leader, Tim Swift, said: \u201cthe clear professional advice we have\u201d is that not all of the government\u2019s five tests for opening schools were being met, citing concerns over the local rate of infection and limited access to testing. He added: There is not enough evidence that the levels of infection in the community are low and falling; and we are not confident that there is guaranteed access to testing, so that in the event of a case both the individual concerned and all their contacts can be identified and rapidly tested for the virus. Our priority as a council and as a Labour group throughout this crisis has been to put the safety and wellbeing of our community first. For these reasons, whilst we want our schools to plan for opening up to more children when it is safe to do so, we are strongly advising schools that they should not be doing this as soon as the 1 June. Matt Hancock has been forced to explain why there was no requirement to test people for Covid-19 who were being discharged from hospital into care homes until weeks into the lockdown. Asked by the shadow health minister Liz Kendall in the Commons about the apparent delay in implementing testing for those going back to care homes from hospitals, Hancock highlighted the importance of infection-control procedures. It comes amid fears that care homes may have unknowingly received Covid-19 patients hospitals early in the crisis. Kendall asked: \u201cNHS England rightly asked hospitals to free up at least 30,000 beds to cope with the virus, but can he explain why there was no requirement to test those being discharged to care homes, the very group most at risk, until 15 April?\u201d In response, Hancock said: She raises the question of discharges, and I understand the questions that have been asked about discharges into care. It\u2019s important to remember that hospital can be a dangerous place for people, as well as saving lives. It also can carry risks and does and so it is appropriate \u2026 in many cases for people to be discharged from hospital and safer for them to go to a care home. What\u2019s important is that infection control procedures are in place in that care home and those infection control procedures were put in place at the start of this crisis and have been strengthened \u2026 as we\u2019ve learned more and more about the virus as we\u2019ve gone along. In the Commons, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been pressed over the government\u2019s \u201cslow\u201d handling of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic in care homes. As the Office for National Statistics figures released this morning showing there have been nearly 10,000 coronavirus-related deaths in care homes in England and Wales, Hancock faced an urgent question from shadow health minister Liz Kendall. Hancock defended the government\u2019s approach, saying deaths in care homes were falling. The ONS figures show care home deaths fell to 1,666 in the week ending 8 May, from 2,423 deaths in the previous seven days \u2013 a decrease of 31%. Kendall highlighted that more than 23,000 more people had died in care homes in the first four months of this year compared with last, accusing ministers of being \u201ctoo slow\u201d to tackle the impact of the virus in social care. She challenged Hancock to explain why guidance stating care homes were \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to be infected was not withdrawn until 12 March. (the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, previously raised this issue with Boris Johnson last week). In response, Hancock said: \u201cShe refers to the 13 March guidance, that was only a matter of days immediately after the risk to the public was raised on medical advice. And the guidance that was in place until then, as she probably knows, explicitly stated that... that guidance was in place while community transmission was low and said it would be updated as soon as community transmission went broader and that\u2019s exactly what we did.\u201d In her opening statement at the press conference Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, also said that the Scottish government was spending an extra \u00a333m on measures to get people back to work. Most of the money would go to Fair Start Scotland and would be used to support young people, disabled people and lone parents, she said. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, has just started giving her daily briefing. She says a further 29 coronavirus deaths have been registered in Scotland, taking the total to 2,134. At the start of the coronavirus crisis politicians and their scientific advisers seemed united, an impression created by Boris Johnson appearing with Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, its chief scientific adviser, at the first government press conferences. But these days Johnson rarely shows up and the scientists and the politicians are engaging in the preliminary rounds of a \u2018blame game\u2019 battle that will no doubt come to a grim and acrimonious conclusion at the long-awaited public inquiry. Ministers stress they have been following the science, and this morning Th\u00e9r\u00e9se Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, took that formula to its logical conclusion by effectively saying it meant that, if the wrong decisions were taken, that was because the scientists gave the wrong advice. (See 9.32am.) This morning Prof John Edmunds, professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and a member of Sage, the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, has been giving evidence to the Lords science committee and he offered a different perspective. His department has been responsible for some of the modelling that has helped to inform government decision making. But, when asked about whether schools should open, he insisted that ultimately this was a decision for politicians, not scientists. He said: Clearly the decision to open primary schools or not is a political one. It is not a scientific decision. Scientists can offer some advice. It looks like the risk to children is low and that the vast majority don\u2019t have significant symptoms ... It may be that they are less likely to transmit to others as well, and so the risk to others may be relatively low. But, overall, you have to weigh up those risks with other things, risks to the community, problems with children - clearly, we can\u2019t keep children off school forever. Weighing all of those things needs to be done by politicians. The National Trust expects to take a \u00a3200m hit to its finances after closing all its properties during the lockdown. Hilary McGrady, director general of the National Trust, told a parliamentary committee the financial blow had come after the charity shut its properties on 20 March. The \u00a3200m figure represents nearly a third of the charity\u2019s total income in the last financial year, meaning the organisation is facing a significant shortfall. While McGrady said that National Trust parks and gardens would be first to reopen, the charity\u2019s houses are unlikely to reopen before late August. She told the digital, culture, media and sport select committee that the estimated impact of Covid-19 \u201cis going to be in the region of about \u00a3200m to the trust this year\u201d. The trust is \u201cdesperate to open\u201d as soon as it is safe to do so, she said, highlighting the value of the spaces for the nation\u2019s mental wellbeing. She added: Our members want us to be open, but they do want us to open safely. And we will do this in a really controlled and careful way, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve introduced the booking system. \u201cBut it is incredibly important just for, apart from anything else, the mental wellbeing of the nation that they can get out, and access places like the National Trust. \u201cWe offer incredibly safe spaces for people to be able to visit and just, you know, have a bit of space and have access to nature and we think it\u2019s really important to get doing that sooner rather than later.\u201d The trust received a total income of \u00a3634m in 2019, according to its accounts, up from \u00a3595m the year before. In 2019 it banked \u00a3192m from investment income. The market value of its investments totalled \u00a31.3bn last year. Wagamama is to reopen dozens of its restaurants across the country to expand its home delivery service. The Japanese-inspired restaurant chain, which has been forced to shut its doors to customers amid the Covid-19 pandemic, launched a trial at five of its delivery kitchens earlier this month. After the \u201csuccessful\u201d trials in London and Leeds, the company will reopen 24 more sites on Thursday with a further 20 next week. In total, the chain hopes to have 49 sites open for delivery by the start of June, expanding to 67 by the end of the month. Sites opening on Thursday include those in Newcastle, Sheffield city centre, Liverpool, Manchester Spinningfields, as well as several in London. Wagamama said it had devised a schedule of reopening new sites that would allow staff to slowly return to delivery-only work at their own discretion. Emma Woods, the Wagamama chief executive, said: Over the past couple of months our focus has been on creating a safe working environment for our team members and our two-week trial has enabled our teams to return to work safely. The next logical step for us is to open additional sites throughout the UK, this will still very much form a test and learn approach for the business. The Queen has discussed \u201cthe state of the world\u201d and the Covid-19 pandemic with the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau. The 94-year-old monarch, who is also Queen of Canada, spoke to Trudeau yesterday \u2013 the day of her official birthday in the country. Trudeau tweeted: We talked about the state of the world, Covid-19, and more. I also thanked her for the hopeful messages she has sent during these difficult times, and I wished her the very best this Victoria Day.\u201d Victoria Day - 18 May - is the Queen\u2019s official birthday in Canada. As monarch of the Commonwealth, the Queen has a strong bond with Canada. It has been her most frequent overseas destination, visiting it more than 20 times. As a young child in the 1970s, Trudeau met the Queen several times through his father, Pierre Trudeau, who was one of Canada\u2019s longest-serving prime ministers. The government has issued a response to the ONS death figures figures out today. (See 9.44am, 10.11am, 10.42am and 10.56am.) A spokesperson for the Department for Health and Social Care said: Every death from this virus is a tragedy and our deepest sympathies go out to the families who have sadly lost relatives. Supporting the social care sector throughout this pandemic is a priority. We are working around the clock to give the social care sector the equipment and support they need. We are ensuring millions of items of PPE are available to care workers, using our increased testing capacity to test care home residents and staff regardless of symptoms and introducing our new \u00a3600m infection control fund to help prevent the spread in care homes. The Treasury has quadrupled the value of loans available to larger businesses affected by coronavirus. In an announcement this morning it said that companies would now be able to receive up to \u00a3200m from the coronavirus large business interruption loan scheme, which previously had a maximum payout of \u00a350m. It said that loans under the expanded scheme would be made available to firms from Tuesday 26 May. So far only \u00a3359m has been made available to businesses through the coronavirus large business interruption loan scheme. But almost \u00a319bn has been made available through the Covid corporate financing facility, more than \u00a38bn through bounce-back loans, and \u00a36bn through the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme. And here are two charts from the ONS report that illustrate excess death figures. The figures relate to England and Wales. This chart tracks the figures for all deaths, and the figures for coronavirus deaths. Excess deaths are those above the five-year average. And this chart shows that, although deaths not involving coronavirus were above average for six weeks in early spring, in the week ending 8 May deaths not involving coronavirus were actually below the long-term average. But, overall, the death rate that week was still well above the long-term average because of the coronavirus deaths. Today\u2019s ONS figures show that the proportion of coronavirus deaths taking place in care homes rose in early May, with care home deaths accounting for 42.4% of coronavirus-related fatalities registered in England and Wales in the week ending 8 May. This was up from 40% the previous week. This chart from the ONS report helps to illustrate this point. The Treasury has this morning published new figures about the impact of its various coronavirus job and business support schemes showing, among other things, that 8m jobs have now been furloughed, at a cost so far of \u00a311.1bn. A \u201csignificant percentage\u201d of patients admitted to hospital with Covid-19 had blood clots in their lungs, a study has revealed. As PA Media reports, research carried out by a team at the Brighton and Sussex Medical School (BSMS) has found infection caused by coronavirus to be associated with a high incidence of venous thromboembolism, a condition in which a blood clot forms in the deep veins of the leg, groin or arm and can travel to the lungs, leading to pulmonary embolism. Of the 274 consecutive cases of Covid-19 admitted to hospital, 21 (7.7%) were diagnosed with venous thromboembolism. Blood clot on the lungs was seen in 16 of those 21 of these cases. The study, published in the Clinical Medicine Journal, was carried out at the Brighton and Sussex university hospitals NHS trust, including two acute hospital sites in southern England. The figure given by the ONS statistician Nick Stripe for UK excess deaths (see 10.11am) is broadly in line with the forecasts for this number that other specialists have been producing. Yesterday the Financial Times\u2019 Chris Giles, who has been doing his own modelling for excess deaths, posted these on Twitter. And yesterday Jamie Jenkins, a former ONS official, produced his own latest daily estimate. Nick Stripe, head of the health analysis and life events division at the Office for National Statistics, told the BBC a few minutes ago that the total number of excess deaths in the UK - the number above what might expected at this time of year, judged by a five-year average, was just under 55,000 by early May. Scientists, and ministers, have repeatedly said that the excess death figures will ultimately prove the most reliable guide as to how badly the UK has been hit by coronavirus. Stripe told the BBC: Across England and Wales up to 8 May we are now looking at an excess deaths figure of just under 50,000. If we look at the UK as a whole, that is just under 55,000 excess deaths. So the gap between Covid-related and excess is about 25% of excess deaths are not explained by Covid being on the death certificate. And that is now a key area of research for us to get underneath that, to understand that. Stripe said that within the next couple of weeks the ONS planned to publish more research looking at why the excess deaths figure was so high. But he said a report published by the ONS on Friday, on deaths in April, did shed some light on what was happening. He went on: That showed that deaths from dementia and Alzheimer disease had gone up very, very significantly during April, as had deaths from something known as \u201cill-defined conditions\u201d. That is often where the certifying doctor puts things like frailty or old age on the death certificate. Usually in the very old, where there might not be a specific morbidity, but the patient has been unwell, you\u2019ll often get these ill-defined conditions. And they were up significantly as well in April. Stripe said there could be two reasons for this increase. First \u201cnormal care pathways\u201d could be disrupted; ie, fewer patients were going to hospital, because the hospitals were concentrating on coronavirus. Second, coronavirus might be a factor in these deaths, without doctors being able to confirm that. He explained: There may be some cases where Covid is present but it is not obvious to the certifying doctor that that is the case. And it may be the case that this big jump in the number of dementia and Alzheimer deaths could explain part of that reason there. It could well be that in the very old, if the patient is not able to describe their symptoms very well, there may be many other co-morbidities, that perhaps the doctor has not felt able, in the absence of a positive test, to put Covid on the death certificate. The Office for National Statistics has just published the latest weekly death figures for England and Wales. They cover the week up to Friday 8 May (or week 19, as the ONS calls it). Here are the main points. Overall deaths in England and Wales in the week up to 8 May were down for the third week in a row, at 12,657. But they were still 3,081 above the five-year average for that week. Some 31.1% of the deaths in the week up to 8 May involved coronavirus being mentioned on the death certificate, down from 33.6% the previous week. Overall deaths in care homes in the week up to 8 May were down, from 6,409 to 4,248. But the proportion involving coronavirus was up from 37.8% the previous week to 39.2%. Britain\u2019s farmers and carmakers will be protected under a new post-Brexit trade regime that will result in 60% of goods coming into the country tariff-free from the start of next year, the government has announced. Our colleague Larry Elliott has the full story here. The government news release on the announcement is here. And here is the government\u2019s UK global tariff tool, where businesses can check the proposed tariff on any particular item. Sir Adrian Smith, the incoming president of the Royal Society, has given an interview to the Times, saying that ministers should not say \u201cwe are simply doing what scientists tell us\u201d. He said: The danger is if the politicians keep saying: \u2018We\u2019re simply doing what the scientists tell us\u2019 that could be awkward. Politicians ultimately must make the decisions. There will be a postmortem on this. But I think the use of science and the re-establishment of experts is something that won\u2019t go away. And I think it won\u2019t be the backlash that, you know, the scientists, got it wrong. Smith starts as head of the Royal Society in November and said he expected his term in the role to be marked an in-depth review into Britain\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis. I wonder what Smith will make of comments by the work and pensions secretary to Sky News this morning that \u201cif the science was wrong, advice at the time was wrong\u201d. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, joining the blog for the day. The Institute for Fiscal Studies will probably be surprised to hear Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, saying this morning that there are a \u201csubstantial number\u201d of job vacancies around. (See 9.11am.) The IFS has published what it plans to be the first of regular reports on the number of job vacancies available. \u201cJob vacancies are an early indicator of economic activity,\u201d it explains. And as Frances reported earlier, it found that when the lockdown was first announced, job vacancies dried up almost entirely. \u201cNew postings on 25 March were just 8% of their levels in 2019,\u201d it says. The report says that there has been some improvement since mid-April, but that \u201cthis has been entirely driven by vacancies in health and social care\u201d. Xiaowei Xu, one of the authors of the IFS report, said: Job vacancies almost completely dried up in March and are now only tentatively recovering in the health and social care sector and barely at all in other parts of the economy. Health and care jobs generally require a high level of training, which means that workers who have been furloughed or made unemployed will struggle to fill these jobs. For those who remain employed, the collapse in job vacancies will severely limit their ability to move between jobs, which is an important channel for wage progression especially among younger workers. The fact that there has been no recovery in vacancies in the most deprived local authorities is also worrying, especially because it will be risky to travel far for work on public transport. The work and pensions secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, has been speaking to broadcasters this morning. She insisted that people who had lost their jobs in the coronavirus crisis could find roles in the agricultural sector this summer. She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that we should be prepared for the unemployment rate to \u201cincrease significantly\u201d, but insisted \u201cthere are a substantial number of vacancies already\u201d. Asked where the vacant roles were, she said: There\u2019s an aspect of retail. There are quite a lot of vacancies or employment wanted in our agricultural sector to help in our near future. Those very much need to be filled as well. Research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) published today found a sharp fall in job vacancies since the beginning of the coronavirus crisis. They found that, by the time the lockdown was announced, firms had stopped posting new vacancies almost entirely, with new postings on 25 March just 8% of their levels in 2019. Coffey defended the government\u2019s coronavirus testing record as having improved from a \u201cstanding start\u201d. Asked about criticism by the Commons science and technology committee (see 8.13am), she told BBC Breakfast: We had a small amount of capacity at the very start, it was solely based on Public Health England\u2019s capability of being able to have about 2,000 tests a day. We had little capacity early on, I recognise that, we have got a lot of capacity now. I think from pretty much a standing start, roughly in about mid-February I think it was, to get to a capacity and actual tests being done of 100,000 within about six weeks, I think is pretty full-on and actually I think something we can look on with pride. Plans to restore the Houses of Parliament \u2013 at a cost of \u00a34bn \u2013 have been put on hold, due to the \u201cimpact of the current health crisis on public finances\u201d. The independent body set up to manage the project said it would reassess the decision to relocate MPs and peers while the work was under way. The announcement comes after the National Audit Office (NAO) warned last month that costs for the scheme should not be allowed to slip in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Sarah Johnson, CEO of the Sponsor Body, said: The restoration and renewal of the Houses of Parliament will be the biggest and most complex heritage project ever undertaken in the UK. The Sponsor Body has been set up to ensure that the project is delivered in the most efficient way that delivers value for money. It is entirely appropriate that we should pause at this time to consider the validity of recommendations made over five years ago before either the Sponsor Body or Delivery Authority was formed. The impact of the current health crisis on public finances and parliament\u2019s ways of working has made it even more essential that we review both the strategy for relocating the two houses and the scope of the restoration of the palace. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits surged in April as the coronavirus lockdown hit the economy, figures released this morning show. The UK claimant count jumped by 69% during the month, as 856,000 more people received universal credit and jobseeker\u2019s allowance benefits in April. That lifted the claimant count to nearly 2.1 million people, from 1.24 million in March. In the south-west, the claimant count almost doubled during the month. The Office for National Statistics cautions that this is only preliminary data, and will include some people still in work who can now apply for universal credit after chancellor Rishi Sunak relaxed the entitlement rules to help people affected by the pandemic. But economists say it\u2019s a very alarming increase \u2013 the biggest since the 1970s \u2013 showing the economic damage caused to the UK in the last few months. The ONS has also found that the number of paid employees fell by over 457,000 in April, to around 28.57 million people \u2013 another sign that unemployment is rising as the UK falls into recession. The unemployment rate for January-March dropped to 3.9%, but that mostly covers the period before the lockdown began. Our business live blog has more details and reaction \u2013 Guardian economics correspondent Richard Partington reports that employers\u2019 groups have been warned that government wage subsidies for disabled and vulnerable workers could be drastically scaled back from August under Treasury plans to wind down its Covid-19 furlough scheme. Charities and social enterprise employers have been told by the government that its plan to bring the coronavirus job retention scheme to an eventual close this autumn does not currently include an exemption for vulnerable workers. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, announced last week that the furlough scheme \u2013 under which the government pays 80% of staff wages up to \u00a32,500 a month \u2013 would be extended until October. However, state support will be scaled back from August, with employers expected to contribute to maintain a wage packet of at least 80% for furloughed workers. Although a final decision has yet to be taken, the chancellor is believed to favour a universal approach to scaling back the scheme for all employers, without tailoring it to reflect a gradual return to work for firms and workers. The Commons science and technology committee has criticised the government for what it described as \u201cinadequate\u201d coronavirus testing capacity throughout the pandemic. The group of MPs identified several lessons to learn from the UK\u2019s handling of the outbreak, and criticised a lack of transparency over some crucial decision-making. They called on the government to \u201curgently\u201d build up capacity for contact tracing, a key tactic in helping ease existing lockdown measures. In a letter to the prime minister assessing evidence to the committee during the pandemic, its chairman Greg Clark \u2013 the Tory former business secretary \u2013 said: Testing capacity has been inadequate for most of the pandemic so far. Capacity was not increased early enough or boldly enough. Capacity drove strategy, rather than strategy driving capacity. Clark also said Public Health England (PHE) had repeatedly failed to answer questions over the \u201cpivotal\u201d decision to ignore mass testing in favour of other tactics. The decision to pursue an approach of initially concentrating testing in a limited number of laboratories and to expand them gradually, rather than an approach of surging capacity through a large number of available public sector, research institute, university and private sector labs is one of the most consequential made during this crisis. From it followed the decision on 12 March to cease testing in the community and retreat to testing principally within hospitals. He said the decision meant that residents in care homes and care home workers could not be tested at a time when the spread of the virus was at its most rampant. Clark wrote: Had the public bodies responsible in this space themselves taken the initiative at the beginning of February, or even the beginning of March, rather than waiting until the secretary of state imposed a target on 2 April, knowledge of the spread of the pandemic and decisions about the response to it may have made more options available to decision makers at earlier stages. Here\u2019s a little summary of some of what we can expect today. The work and pensions secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, is out speaking to broadcasters this morning. I\u2019ll bring you the highlights from that. At 9.30am, experts in social care from around the world will give evidence to the Commons health and social care committee about Covid-19 in care homes. Also at 9.30, we will also get new data from the Office for National Statistics about the number of coronavirus-related deaths registered in England and Wales for the week ending 8 May. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, will be summoned to the commons chamber at 12.30 for an urgent question on care homes. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will give evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee at 3pm. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s UK coronavirus live blog. A study by the Resolution Foundation thinktank has found that younger and older workers are being hardest hit by the squeeze on earnings during the coronavirus crisis. More than one in three 18 to 24-year-olds, and three in 10 workers in their early 60s, are receiving less pay than they did at the start of the year. This compares with less than a quarter of workers aged 35 to 49. The report \u2013 based on a survey of more than 6,000 UK adults between May 6 and 11 \u2013 warned that younger workers risk their pay being scarred for years to come, while older workers may end up involuntary retired well before reaching their state pension age. Maja Gustafsson, a researcher at the Resolution Foundation, said: While young people are in the eye of the storm, they are not the only group who are experiencing big income shocks. Britain is experiencing a U-shaped living standards crisis, with workers in their early 60s also badly affected. That is why the government\u2019s strategy to support the recovery should combine targeted support to help young people into work, with more general stimulus to boost demand across the economy and help households of all ages. Official figures just out show that unemployment increased by 50,000 to 1.35 million in the three months to the end of March. (Important to note that lockdown didn\u2019t start until 24 March.) Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Iain Duncan Smith \u2013 former Tory leader and former work and pension secretary \u2013 said \u201cthere was always going to be a big hit to the economy by locking down the economy\u201d. He warned that there was a lag effect, so the numbers would get worse. I\u2019m Frances Perraudin and I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest developments in the pandemic in the UK today.

But on Tuesday, those charges were <a href=\"https://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/news/2020/dufferin-and-wilson-avenue\">upgraded</a> to \u201cmurder \u2013 terrorist activity\u201d.</p> <p>The suspect appeared in court via video link on Tuesday as prosecutors updated the charges.</p> <p>Federal authorities started investigating the case after Toronto police discovered evidence of \u201cterrorist activity\u201d tying the suspect to the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/25/what-is-incel-movement-toronto-van-attack-suspect\">\u201cincel\u201d movement</a>.</p> <p>Incels \u2013 virtually all of whom are male \u2013 are self-described \u201cinvoluntary celibates\u201d, who subscribe to an ideology that the world is unjustly stacked against unattractive heterosexual men.</p> <p>In recent years, a spike in killings in Canada and the United States associated with the moment have led to <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/incels-americas-newest-domestic-terrorism-threat\">greater scrutiny</a> from law enforcement and security experts.</p> <p>The use of terrorism charges against the minor \u2013 probably the first for an act of violence not tied to Islamic extremism \u2013 indicates the federal government views the movement as a growing threat in Canada.</p> <p>Authorities have so far been wary of deploying terrorism-related charges in similar cases \u2013 even in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/27/alek-minassian-toronto-van-attack-interview-incels\">the case of Alek Minassian</a>, the Toronto man who killed 10 pedestrians and wounded 14 others when he plowed a delivery van on to a crowded sidewalk.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/04/mass-shooting-1989-montreal-14-women-killed\">\u2018Hate is infectious\u2019: how the 1989 mass shooting of 14 women echoes today</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After his arrest, Minassian told police officers that he was virgin who had never had a girlfriend, admitted to using the van as a weapon and said he wanted to inspire more attacks.

      "bodyText": "Police in Canada are treating a machete attack in which a woman was murdered and two others injured as an act of terrorism, after discovering evidence suggesting that it was motivated by violent misogyny. The move is thought to be the first time that terrorism charges have been brought in a case connected to the so-called \u201cincel\u201d ideology. \u201cTerrorism comes in many forms and it\u2019s important to note that it is not restricted to any particular group, religion or ideology,\u201d the RCMP said in a statement announcing the updated charges on Tuesday. The suspect, who has not been named because he is a minor, is alleged to have entered a massage parlour in northern Toronto in February brandishing a machete. He is alleged to have killed Ashley Noell Arzaga, a 24-year-old mother, injuring the owner as she tried to subdue him. Police initially charged the suspect with first degree and attempted murder. But on Tuesday, those charges were upgraded to \u201cmurder \u2013 terrorist activity\u201d. The suspect appeared in court via video link on Tuesday as prosecutors updated the charges. Federal authorities started investigating the case after Toronto police discovered evidence of \u201cterrorist activity\u201d tying the suspect to the so-called \u201cincel\u201d movement. Incels \u2013 virtually all of whom are male \u2013 are self-described \u201cinvoluntary celibates\u201d, who subscribe to an ideology that the world is unjustly stacked against unattractive heterosexual men. In recent years, a spike in killings in Canada and the United States associated with the moment have led to greater scrutiny from law enforcement and security experts. The use of terrorism charges against the minor \u2013 probably the first for an act of violence not tied to Islamic extremism \u2013 indicates the federal government views the movement as a growing threat in Canada. Authorities have so far been wary of deploying terrorism-related charges in similar cases \u2013 even in the case of Alek Minassian, the Toronto man who killed 10 pedestrians and wounded 14 others when he plowed a delivery van on to a crowded sidewalk. After his arrest, Minassian told police officers that he was virgin who had never had a girlfriend, admitted to using the van as a weapon and said he wanted to inspire more attacks. Asked how he felt about the death of 10 people, he replied: \u201cI feel like I accomplished my mission.\u201d Minassian told his interrogators that he had been \u201cradicalized\u201d online and began to fantasize about starting his own \u201crebellion\u201d. \u201cI was thinking that I would inspire future masses to join me in my uprising as well,\u201d he said. Minassian was due to appear in court in early April, but fears of the coronavirus have delayed numerous trials. \u2022 This article was amended on 20 May 2020. An earlier version incorrectly stated that the attack took place in \u201cdowntown Toronto\u201d.",

Industry leaders called for ministers to think carefully before bringing in rules that would make it harder for seasonal and migrant workers to enter the UK to take up jobs in fields, farms and food processing plants. They made their remarks moments before the environment secretary, George Eustice, called for British people to apply for jobs that would normally be done by foreign workers. He acknowledged that only about a third of workers from eastern European countries who would normally come to the UK for the work were here already and only \u201csmall numbers\u201d would continue to travel. \u201cOne thing is clear and that is that this year we will need to rely on British workers to lend a hand to help bring that harvest home,\u201d he told the daily Downing Street press conference. Embarrassingly, as Eustice made his appeal, the Pick For Britain website set up by the government in conjunction with farming and agriculture bodies was not working. Earlier in the day, Prince Charles had called for a second world war-style army of workers to come forward to stop crops going to waste. The challenges the pandemic has presented to food producers were the focus of a hearing of the environment, food and rural affairs select committee n Tuesday. Industry leaders explained that shops and supermarkets ran out of food early on because the algorithms used by suppliers did not take into account the dramatic change in shopping habits that the coronavirus crisis caused. Ian Wright, the chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, told the hearing the food distribution network in the UK was \u201ccompletely banjaxed\u201d by the change in consumer behaviour in the early stages of the crisis. \u201cThe fantastic just-in-time processes rely on using immediate previous behaviour as a predictor of the next behaviour, which is fine unless the next behaviour is completely different \u2013 which it was,\u201d Wright said. \u201cSo the algorithms were completely banjaxed and as a consequence of that shelves were empty and the distribution system began to be incapable of dealing with the demand.\u201d Wright said the crisis had shown how vital the food industry was. \u201cIf you can\u2019t feed a country, you don\u2019t have a country,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has been borne out in this crisis in massive order. \u201cWe don\u2019t think the current immigration bill addresses the sort of country we want to be.

      "bodyText": "According to the American psychologist Gary Klein, desperation is a driver of creativity, a means to unlock insight or solutions that might otherwise have been untried or not even considered. Right now, English football is in a precarious place, particularly lower down the leagues, where sobering financial realities have bitten and, to some powerful people, Klein\u2019s theory has resonated. How can everyone adapt to survive in the coronavirus-scarred landscape, they have asked? Could radical opportunity arise? Some in executive positions at Premier League clubs have seen one. It is a reprise of an idea that Greg Dyke, in his then-role as the Football Association chairman, advanced in 2014. Could top-flight clubs develop mutually beneficial partnerships with those in the lower divisions? Or could they set up B teams in, say, League Two for their under-23s? The Guardian understands the notions were raised during a recent conference call of an influential football working group comprising representatives of a handful of clubs plus the FA, Premier League and English Football League. It is important to say that there have been numerous calls and webinars during the pandemic and many ideas floated. The varying degrees of traction have been difficult to discern but, like the ripples from a stone in the water, this one has reached people who were not a part of the original conversation. And they are receptive to it. Dyke\u2019s goal had been to improve the prospects of young English players and he set out three options: strategic loan partnerships between Premier League clubs and those further down; partnerships that were more all-encompassing; and B teams, broadly along the lines of the Spanish model. Top-flight clubs have long fretted about the playing opportunities for their academy graduates when they are aged between 18 and 21 and, even though Dyke\u2019s plan failed to garner the requisite support, it did not wither on the vine. At the very least, clubs have continued to see whether they can build relationships with one another, some involving the exchange of expertise. Some Premier League executives now want to try again.

The opportunism is jarring, unpalatable. Welcome to capitalism.

When the EFL allowed Premier League under-21 teams to enter the Checkatrade Trophy in 2016-17, it was a move to help the young players at those clubs to gain experience. But it would go no further. This was not a Trojan horse for the Premier League to infiltrate the EFL. The reason why B teams have long felt like a non-starter comes down to the integrity of the competition.

It\u2019s a key measure to ensure boards cannot grant favours to their chums or friendly institutions.</p> <p>The Financial Conduct Authority relaxed the rules during the pandemic for reasons everybody understands: companies will often need cash faster than a conventional rights issue would allow. But boards \u2013 until now \u2013 have mostly ignored the FCA\u2019s parallel instruction that \u201csoft\u201d pre-emption rights should be incorporated where possible.</p> <p>Compass has shown it can be done. Small investors were able to participate via the PrimaryBid.com website at no extra cost and on equal terms. The solution is imperfect since the structure caps aggregate demand from retail investors at \u20ac8m under EU rules. But the key point is that the technology works.</p> <p>The issue is persuading boards to use it. Fear of the unknown, plus the presence of over-cautious lawyers, seem to have been the main stumbling block. The likes of Asos to WH Smith have simply bypassed small investors, often issuing shares at heavy discounts, the situation that most disadvantages those who are excluded.</p> <p>An impressive crew of City big-hitters \u2013 including Martin Gilbert, lately of Aberdeen Standard Life, and Anne Richards of Fidelity \u2013 wrote an open letter last month calling on companies to think of small investors and employee-shareholders. Well done, it changed the debate.</p> <p>Now Compass has set a good example.

The Financial Conduct Authority relaxed the rules during the pandemic for reasons everybody understands: companies will often need cash faster than a conventional rights issue would allow. But boards \u2013 until now \u2013 have mostly ignored the FCA\u2019s parallel instruction that \u201csoft\u201d pre-emption rights should be incorporated where possible. Compass has shown it can be done. Small investors were able to participate via the PrimaryBid.com website at no extra cost and on equal terms. The solution is imperfect since the structure caps aggregate demand from retail investors at \u20ac8m under EU rules. But the key point is that the technology works. The issue is persuading boards to use it. Fear of the unknown, plus the presence of over-cautious lawyers, seem to have been the main stumbling block. The likes of Asos to WH Smith have simply bypassed small investors, often issuing shares at heavy discounts, the situation that most disadvantages those who are excluded. An impressive crew of City big-hitters \u2013 including Martin Gilbert, lately of Aberdeen Standard Life, and Anne Richards of Fidelity \u2013 wrote an open letter last month calling on companies to think of small investors and employee-shareholders. Well done, it changed the debate. Now Compass has set a good example. There should be no more woolly excuses elsewhere. EasyJet has another battle on its hands EasyJet says it was hacked by \u201ca highly sophisticated source\u201d, which is what they all say. No company has ever confessed to being outwitted cyber-wise by a rank amateur trying his, or her, luck. Thus we will have to await the view of Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) on whether easyJet left its back door wide open. But the emails and travel details of 9 million customers were accessed, which is a big breach. By way of comparison, the ICO is still trying to stick a \u00a3183m fine on British Airways for a case last year involving 500,000 customers; like easyJet, BA argued there was no evidence of fraudulent activity connected to the breach. So one can more confidently predict the outcome of easyJet\u2019s showdown on Friday with its disaffected founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who is trying to unseat half the directors. The board should win that one comfortably. The ICO may be trickier.",

      "body": "<p>Up to 1,500 primary schools in England are expected to remain closed on 1 June after a rebellion by at least 18 councils forced the government to say it had no plans to sanction them.</p> \n<p>As the backlash escalated over the government\u2019s policy of lifting the coronavirus lockdown on schools in a fortnight, a number of new local authorities said on Tuesday they would not force primary schools in their area to follow the plan. Councils joining those already in opposition included Birmingham, Calderdale council in Yorkshire, and Conservative-controlled Solihull. In total they represent more than 1,500 maintained primaries.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/schoolsmap-zip/giv-3902SFzoR95XGrIH\" data-alt=\"Map of councils opposed to reopening schools\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/schoolsmap-zip/giv-3902SFzoR95XGrIH\">Map of councils opposed to reopening schools</a> \n</figure> \n<p>With more councils likely to join them on Wednesday, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, met union leaders to address concerns that the plan could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/18/is-it-safe-to-go-back-to-school-england-coronavirus\">put staff at risk and contribute to the spread of coronavirus</a>. Downing Street said its aim was to work \u201cin a consultative way\u201d rather than impose penalties on schools or councils that rejected the reopening date.</p> \n<p>Reports earlier this week suggested councils that refused to comply could be subject to legal action or even financial penalties, but the prime minister\u2019s spokesman told reporters: \u201cWe are continuing to work closely with teachers, schools and the unions, as we have done for the past eight weeks, and remain keen to hear any concerns they may have.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are preparing for the possible opening of schools for more children from 1 June at the earliest, but that will only happen if it is safe to do so. But we do also have to bear in mind the harm which can be done to children by missing out on important education.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked if there could be any sanctions for those who disagreed, he said: \u201cYou can see what the focus of our attention is at the moment, which is trying to work with them in a consultative way in order to be able to open schools to more pupils in a way that is safe.\u201d</p> \n<p>The government has said it wants children in nursery, reception, years 1 and 6 to begin a phased return to schools from 1 June, with other years following soon after, so primary children are in school for a month before the summer holidays, as long as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/06/have-the-governments-five-tests-for-easing-lockdown-been-met\">the government\u2019s five tests for easing lockdown</a> have been met.</p> \n<p>However, another obstacle to the 1 June target emerged on Tuesday when the deputy chief scientific adviser Dame Angela McLean said all changes to lockdown would require an effective system for tracing and isolating new cases to be in place, effectively adding a sixth test. McLean said changes should be based on \u201cobserved levels of infection \u2026 and not of a fixed date\u201d. </p> \n<p>Apart from the councils that have said they will not be opening primary schools according to the government timetable, others, including Bristol, Southampton and Newcastle, said they would leave it to individual schools to decide based on risk assessments.</p> \n<p>The Labour leader of Calderdale council, Tim Swift, said the \u201cclear professional advice\u201d they have is that not all of the government\u2019s five tests for opening schools are being met. He cited concerns over the local rate of infection and limited access to testing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7bb26bfc-05df-4557-a9be-5e1c95185a79\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The UK government has said that these five tests have to be met before they will consider easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>The NHS has sufficient capacity to provide critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK</li>\n     <li>A sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths from Coronavirus</li>\n     <li>Reliable data to show that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board</li>\n     <li>Operational challenges including testing and personal protective equipement (PPE) are in hand with supply able to meet future demand</li>\n     <li>Confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThere is not enough evidence that the levels of infection in the community are low and falling; and we are not confident that there is guaranteed access to testing so that, in the event of a case, both the individual concerned and all their contacts can be identified and rapidly tested for the virus,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur priority as a council and as a Labour group throughout this crisis has been to put the safety and wellbeing of our community first. For these reasons, whilst we want our schools to plan for opening up to more children when it is safe to do so, we are strongly advising schools that they should not be doing this as soon as 1 June.\u201d</p> \n<p>Labour-held Leeds city council said the government reopening date was impossible. \u201cDue to a variety of factors, it would be impossible for all schools to operate to the government\u2019s timetable of opening reception, year 1 and year 6 from 1 June,\u201d said Cllr Jonathan Pryor, an executive member for learning and skills. \u201cWhile some schools will begin to gradually expand their intake from this date, Leeds will not expect all our schools to open to all those pupils from day one.\u201d</p> \n<p>Birmingham city council wrote to parents saying schools would only open to more pupils when it was safe. <strong>\u201c</strong>We all know how valuable regular attendance at school is, particularly for the most vulnerable children, and we are committed to having due regard to the guidance that has been issued by the government. However, we recognise that for some schools, opening to more pupils safely may not be possible on 1 June, while parents and guardians must also feel reassured.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Ian Courts, the leader of Solihull council, said the priority was to ensure the safety of every child and staff member. \u201cThe reality in Solihull is that schools will need to use that first week in June to ensure they are completely ready for more pupils to attend. So places may only be available from the week beginning 8 June.\u201d</p> \n<p>In Bradford, Cllr Imran Khan, portfolio holder for education, employment and skills, said: \u201cBradford council has no intention of directing schools to open on 1 June or to force parents to send their children back and we are committed to working in partnership with school leaders, families and trade unions so that they can make sure their schools are safe environments for our children whenever they choose to open.\u201d</p> \n<p>Wakefield, in West Yorkshire, Barking and Dagenham, and Redbridge \u2013 both in London \u2013 have also expressed reservations about the 1 June date.</p> \n<p>As councils contacted parents, the NASUWT teaching union warned the government it would have to do more to win the trust of teachers, after a poll of almost 300,000 members found<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/only-5-of-teachers-think-it-safe-to-reopen-english-schools-poll-shows\"> just 5% believed it was safe for more children to return</a> from 1 June.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, a recording emerged of the National Education Union chief, Dr Mary Bousted, telling members that while its \u201cnegotiating position\u201d was that it would not engage with the 1 June plan, that could change if public support for its stance waned.</p> \n<p>Secondary school pupils preparing for exams are expected to get some \u201cface time\u201d with teachers where possible. Schools have been closed since 20 March, except for the children of key workers and vulnerable pupils.</p> \n<p>\u2022 The headline and subheading of this article were amended on 20 May 2020 to more accurately reflect the information set out in the article.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Up to 1,500 primary schools in England are expected to remain closed on 1 June after a rebellion by at least 18 councils forced the government to say it had no plans to sanction them. As the backlash escalated over the government\u2019s policy of lifting the coronavirus lockdown on schools in a fortnight, a number of new local authorities said on Tuesday they would not force primary schools in their area to follow the plan. Councils joining those already in opposition included Birmingham, Calderdale council in Yorkshire, and Conservative-controlled Solihull. In total they represent more than 1,500 maintained primaries. With more councils likely to join them on Wednesday, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, met union leaders to address concerns that the plan could put staff at risk and contribute to the spread of coronavirus. Downing Street said its aim was to work \u201cin a consultative way\u201d rather than impose penalties on schools or councils that rejected the reopening date. Reports earlier this week suggested councils that refused to comply could be subject to legal action or even financial penalties, but the prime minister\u2019s spokesman told reporters: \u201cWe are continuing to work closely with teachers, schools and the unions, as we have done for the past eight weeks, and remain keen to hear any concerns they may have. \u201cWe are preparing for the possible opening of schools for more children from 1 June at the earliest, but that will only happen if it is safe to do so. But we do also have to bear in mind the harm which can be done to children by missing out on important education.\u201d Asked if there could be any sanctions for those who disagreed, he said: \u201cYou can see what the focus of our attention is at the moment, which is trying to work with them in a consultative way in order to be able to open schools to more pupils in a way that is safe.\u201d The government has said it wants children in nursery, reception, years 1 and 6 to begin a phased return to schools from 1 June, with other years following soon after, so primary children are in school for a month before the summer holidays, as long as the government\u2019s five tests for easing lockdown have been met. However, another obstacle to the 1 June target emerged on Tuesday when the deputy chief scientific adviser Dame Angela McLean said all changes to lockdown would require an effective system for tracing and isolating new cases to be in place, effectively adding a sixth test. McLean said changes should be based on \u201cobserved levels of infection \u2026 and not of a fixed date\u201d. Apart from the councils that have said they will not be opening primary schools according to the government timetable, others, including Bristol, Southampton and Newcastle, said they would leave it to individual schools to decide based on risk assessments. The Labour leader of Calderdale council, Tim Swift, said the \u201cclear professional advice\u201d they have is that not all of the government\u2019s five tests for opening schools are being met. He cited concerns over the local rate of infection and limited access to testing. \u201cThere is not enough evidence that the levels of infection in the community are low and falling; and we are not confident that there is guaranteed access to testing so that, in the event of a case, both the individual concerned and all their contacts can be identified and rapidly tested for the virus,\u201d he said. \u201cOur priority as a council and as a Labour group throughout this crisis has been to put the safety and wellbeing of our community first. For these reasons, whilst we want our schools to plan for opening up to more children when it is safe to do so, we are strongly advising schools that they should not be doing this as soon as 1 June.\u201d Labour-held Leeds city council said the government reopening date was impossible. \u201cDue to a variety of factors, it would be impossible for all schools to operate to the government\u2019s timetable of opening reception, year 1 and year 6 from 1 June,\u201d said Cllr Jonathan Pryor, an executive member for learning and skills. \u201cWhile some schools will begin to gradually expand their intake from this date, Leeds will not expect all our schools to open to all those pupils from day one.\u201d Birmingham city council wrote to parents saying schools would only open to more pupils when it was safe. \u201cWe all know how valuable regular attendance at school is, particularly for the most vulnerable children, and we are committed to having due regard to the guidance that has been issued by the government. However, we recognise that for some schools, opening to more pupils safely may not be possible on 1 June, while parents and guardians must also feel reassured.\u201d Ian Courts, the leader of Solihull council, said the priority was to ensure the safety of every child and staff member. \u201cThe reality in Solihull is that schools will need to use that first week in June to ensure they are completely ready for more pupils to attend. So places may only be available from the week beginning 8 June.\u201d In Bradford, Cllr Imran Khan, portfolio holder for education, employment and skills, said: \u201cBradford council has no intention of directing schools to open on 1 June or to force parents to send their children back and we are committed to working in partnership with school leaders, families and trade unions so that they can make sure their schools are safe environments for our children whenever they choose to open.\u201d Wakefield, in West Yorkshire, Barking and Dagenham, and Redbridge \u2013 both in London \u2013 have also expressed reservations about the 1 June date. As councils contacted parents, the NASUWT teaching union warned the government it would have to do more to win the trust of teachers, after a poll of almost 300,000 members found just 5% believed it was safe for more children to return from 1 June. On Tuesday, a recording emerged of the National Education Union chief, Dr Mary Bousted, telling members that while its \u201cnegotiating position\u201d was that it would not engage with the 1 June plan, that could change if public support for its stance waned. Secondary school pupils preparing for exams are expected to get some \u201cface time\u201d with teachers where possible. Schools have been closed since 20 March, except for the children of key workers and vulnerable pupils. \u2022 The headline and subheading of this article were amended on 20 May 2020 to more accurately reflect the information set out in the article.",

      "bodyText": "The US economy risks \u201cpermanent damage\u201d if coronavirus lockdowns continue for months, the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, has warned Congress. Mnuchin\u2019s comments came in a joint appearance before the Senate banking committee with Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Appearing via video link, the pair offered a stark assessment of the fragile state of the economy and warned of worse to come. \u201cI think the jobs numbers will be worse before they get better,\u201d Mnuchin said, adding that the overall economy too was likely to weaken in the near term before starting to recover towards the end of the year. After the hearing the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its own bleak outlook for economic growth, predicting a 38% decline in economic growth in the second quarter on an annualized basis. Congress has already approved a near $3tn package of measures aimed at reducing the impact of a crisis that has led to an unprecedented surge in job losses, and which threatens to push unemployment up to heights unseen since the 1930s Depression. The Fed has cut interest rates to zero and launched nine lending programs to support businesses, cities, states and financial markets. Mnuchin and Powell said more action would be needed. In recent weeks, the Trump administration has tried to move the debate from containment to the need to reopen the economy. The move has been criticized by epidemiologists and other experts who remain concerned the coronavirus is not yet under control. The Democratic senator Sherrod Brown pressed Mnuchin on the White House\u2019s push to rapidly reopen parts of the economy. \u201cHow many workers should give their lives to increase our [gross domestic product] by half a percent?\u201d Brown asked Mnuchin. Mnuchin replied: \u201cNo workers should give their lives to do that, Mr Senator, and I think your characterization is unfair.\u201d Mnuchin and Powell said economic data from states that are beginning to reopen will be key to determining the next steps in the federal response. Powell said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to see here fairly quickly how the opening goes. It\u2019s very hard to know. We\u2019re going to be getting a lot of information fairly quickly in terms of what might be needed.\u201d Brown countered that \u201cfrom what we know so far, it does not appear that this administration or the Federal Reserve are making workers their priority\u201d. Brown said he wanted to know \u201cnot about what you\u2019re doing for big banks or big corporations, and how you expect that money to trickle down, but how you\u2019re making sure the money and authority Congress gave you actually help the people who make this country work?\u201d Mnuchin acknowledged the \u201cunprecedented challenges the American people are experiencing\u201d and defended the administration\u2019s record. He said: \u201cPresident Trump and the entire administration are committed to providing necessary relief to help people get through this time.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson has made much of being at the helm of a supposed \u201cwartime\u201d government during the coronavirus crisis. The enemy is deadly, he tells us, and we have all been enlisted in the fight.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/19/unions-call-national-recovery-council-rebuild-uk-economy\">TUC boss calls for new council to build fairer economy after Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, has had enough of the bombast. \u201cBut if we\u2019re using war analogies,\u201d she says, \u201cthere have been times during this crisis which have had the feeling of the first world war, with the army generals camped hundreds of miles from the front line ordering troops over the top.\u201d</p> <p>In O\u2019Grady\u2019s view, it is the collaboration and progressive spirit of the post-1945 years that provides a better model. To that end, on Wednesday, alongside the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, she will call for a \u201cnational recovery council\u201d of unions, government and business. The next few years must see an increase in the minimum wage, a ban on zero-hours contracts and a job guarantee scheme \u2013 particularly for young people facing a bleak future, she says.</p> <p>\u201cThe big challenge is what happens next and it\u2019s important to have representatives of the workforce at the table to figure that out,\u201d says O\u2019Grady, speaking exclusively to the Guardian. \u201cWe can be architects, I think, of the next stage.\u201d</p> <p>This has been an extraordinary time for the TUC, which since the crisis struck has collaborated with the government to an extent unimaginable a few months ago. But with teaching unions in a deadlock with ministers over the proposed limited return to schools at the start of June and employees who can\u2019t work from home already told to return to their workplaces, does she worry unions could be used as a scapegoat for the UK\u2019s stilted exit from lockdown?</p> <p>\u201cI think the public trusts us and our members trust us,\u201d she says. \u201cOur first duty of care is to working people, and there is nothing more fundamental than people staying healthy and safe.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Grady is insistent that \u201cthere can be no going back to business as usual\u201d when the crisis passes and the fallout begins. Cuts to the welfare state and public services over a decade of austerity left the UK unable to deal with the seismic shock of a global pandemic, she argues. Black people in England and Wales are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\">more than four times as likely to die</a> of coronavirus, with poverty and health inequality mooted as possible reasons.</p> <p>\u201cWe now know the real price of inequality,\u201d says O\u2019Grady. \u201cThis time working people can\u2019t pay the price for recovery. People will not put up with that. I think the big issue is how do we grow our way out of this and what kinds of industries and jobs will help us do that.\u201d</p> <p>Rebuilding will require investment, not cuts \u2013 and that will have to mean fairer taxes, she adds. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get that safety net strung again, we\u2019ve got to invest in our public services, which may have to build resilience for a long time to come,\u201d she says. \u201cUnions are back \u2026 but the state is back too.\u201d</p> <p>The need for \u201ca healthy, secure and green economy\u201d with quality skilled jobs is \u201cnot a pipe dream, it\u2019s a necessity,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have built hospitals in days, have had to radically transform the way we live and work within days. I think we\u2019ve run out of excuses about creating a carbon-free economy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ceec57ff66625a40518ab5d6e9bd051d53fb6467\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ceec57ff66625a40518ab5d6e9bd051d53fb6467/0_53_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frances O\u2019Grady, seen here at last year\u2019s TUC Congress in Brighton, is calling for a 'national recovery council' of unions, government and business.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frances O\u2019Grady at last year\u2019s TUC Congress in Brighton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In practice that will mean building domestic supply chains, expanding renewable power, manufacturing batteries for electric cars, she says. If critical industries like aviation need bailing out, there must be strings attached.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has made much of being at the helm of a supposed \u201cwartime\u201d government during the coronavirus crisis. The enemy is deadly, he tells us, and we have all been enlisted in the fight. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, has had enough of the bombast. \u201cBut if we\u2019re using war analogies,\u201d she says, \u201cthere have been times during this crisis which have had the feeling of the first world war, with the army generals camped hundreds of miles from the front line ordering troops over the top.\u201d In O\u2019Grady\u2019s view, it is the collaboration and progressive spirit of the post-1945 years that provides a better model. To that end, on Wednesday, alongside the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, she will call for a \u201cnational recovery council\u201d of unions, government and business. The next few years must see an increase in the minimum wage, a ban on zero-hours contracts and a job guarantee scheme \u2013 particularly for young people facing a bleak future, she says. \u201cThe big challenge is what happens next and it\u2019s important to have representatives of the workforce at the table to figure that out,\u201d says O\u2019Grady, speaking exclusively to the Guardian. \u201cWe can be architects, I think, of the next stage.\u201d This has been an extraordinary time for the TUC, which since the crisis struck has collaborated with the government to an extent unimaginable a few months ago. But with teaching unions in a deadlock with ministers over the proposed limited return to schools at the start of June and employees who can\u2019t work from home already told to return to their workplaces, does she worry unions could be used as a scapegoat for the UK\u2019s stilted exit from lockdown? \u201cI think the public trusts us and our members trust us,\u201d she says. \u201cOur first duty of care is to working people, and there is nothing more fundamental than people staying healthy and safe.\u201d O\u2019Grady is insistent that \u201cthere can be no going back to business as usual\u201d when the crisis passes and the fallout begins. Cuts to the welfare state and public services over a decade of austerity left the UK unable to deal with the seismic shock of a global pandemic, she argues. Black people in England and Wales are more than four times as likely to die of coronavirus, with poverty and health inequality mooted as possible reasons. \u201cWe now know the real price of inequality,\u201d says O\u2019Grady. \u201cThis time working people can\u2019t pay the price for recovery. People will not put up with that. I think the big issue is how do we grow our way out of this and what kinds of industries and jobs will help us do that.\u201d Rebuilding will require investment, not cuts \u2013 and that will have to mean fairer taxes, she adds. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get that safety net strung again, we\u2019ve got to invest in our public services, which may have to build resilience for a long time to come,\u201d she says. \u201cUnions are back \u2026 but the state is back too.\u201d The need for \u201ca healthy, secure and green economy\u201d with quality skilled jobs is \u201cnot a pipe dream, it\u2019s a necessity,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have built hospitals in days, have had to radically transform the way we live and work within days. I think we\u2019ve run out of excuses about creating a carbon-free economy.\u201d In practice that will mean building domestic supply chains, expanding renewable power, manufacturing batteries for electric cars, she says. If critical industries like aviation need bailing out, there must be strings attached. As firms slash entry level jobs by a quarter , job guarantee schemes \u2013 \u201cproper ones, not Mickey Mouse schemes\u201d \u2013 particularly for young people, will have to be put in place. It should mean, she adds, an increase in the minimum wage to \u00a310 an hour, plus an end to zero-hours contracts and \u201cfalse\u201d self-employment where workers have no rights. TUC analysis shows women make up three-quarters of key workers, who are worse paid, on average, than those in other sectors (four in 10 key workers earn less than \u00a310 an hour, compared to three in 10 non key workers). In social care \u2013 where one in four workers are on zero-hours contracts \u2013 that figure rises to seven. \u201cThese are people doing some of the most valuable work in society for the least money, who are still even today wrapping themselves in bin bags because of a lack of PPE,\u201d says O\u2019Grady. \u201cWhat does that say about us?\u201d O\u2019Grady is not a tub-thumper.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too much to ask to protect livelihoods and lives.\u201d O\u2019Grady says the prime minister was \u201cclearly irresponsible\u201d to tell those who could not work from home to return to their workplaces without a clear plan in place.

      "bodyText": "The leader of the Trades Union Congress has declared \u201cthe state is back\u201d as the UK\u2019s biggest unions urged the government to form a national recovery council in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The TUC, which represents 48 unions in England and Wales, has called in a report for the establishment of the body, which it argues would bring together government, unions and employers to create a greener and fairer economy. In an interview with the Guardian, the TUC general secretary said there could be no return to business as usual after the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get that safety net strung again, we\u2019ve got to invest in our public services, which may have to build resilience for a long time to come,\u201d Frances O\u2019Grady said. \u201cUnions are back \u2026 but the state is back too.\u201d Launching the report alongside the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, on Wednesday, the TUC is calling for a return of the unity shown in the years after the second world war, arguing that the post-conflict decade of social investment created growth of 3.3%, but a decade of austerity after the banking crash resulted in growth of 1.9%. \u201cThis can\u2019t be about working people paying the price again,\u201d said O\u2019Grady. \u201cI think there is a real sense that this has got to be a people\u2019s effort. It can\u2019t just be left to employers or politicians, we\u2019ve got to step up too.\u201d The TUC, which represents 5.5 million members, is also calling for an overhaul of the UK\u2019s business model \u2013 which it argues is based on low-paid, insecure jobs and the exclusion of workers from decision-making. It has called for an increase in the minimum wage to \u00a310 an hour, a public sector pay rise, a ban on zero-hours contracts and a job guarantee scheme \u2013 particularly for young people facing a bleak future. In the far-reaching document the TUC argues that systems for trade and finance damage the interests of poorer countries and drive unfair pay, and calls for changes to international rules and institutions, as well as a plan to tackle discrimination faced by black and minority ethnic people, women and disabled people. It praises the government\u2019s \u201cconstructive\u201d work with unions on the creation of the job retention scheme, adding that the ability of local authorities to take homeless people off the street, the emergence of mutual support groups and the adaptability of the workforce, as well as government interventions, \u201cshow the speed and scale of what can be done when it is necessary\u201d. It adds that the same commitment and urgency must be applied to tackling the climate emergency. \u201cWe\u2019ve run out of excuses about creating a carbon-free economy,\u201d said O\u2019Grady. Industry bailouts and any state investment in the next few months must come with an \u201cOlympics-style plan\u201d for jobs and a minimum requirement for the use of UK products and services to rebuild UK manufacturing, says the report. With unemployment levels set to increase dramatically, it argues jobless people should be given a \u201cfunded individual learning account\u201d to learn new skills, with the promise of a job at the end of training. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to build back brick by brick, but it has to be fair, decent rewards, fair taxes \u2013 all of that has got to be back on the agenda,\u201d said O\u2019Grady. \u201cI think the centre of gravity has shifted and people are remembering why equality matters.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Emilie Gramenz bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday, 20 May. Top stories Fossil fuel industry groups have applauded new climate change measures proposed by the Morrison government, while environmentalists say they direct emissions-reduction funding to polluting companies. The government has agreed to 21 out of 26 recommendations from a panel asked to find new ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at low cost. Global carbon dioxide emissions had fallen dramatically by early April, according to a definitive study, but experts say the lockdown-related fall is no cause for celebration. China\u2019s decision to impose tariffs on Australian barley imports has highlighted how reliant some sectors are on Chinese demand, with wool producers now \u201cparticularly exposed\u201d by the threat of a further escalation in trade tensions. Meanwhile, the industry minister, Karen Andrews, will today call on governments to streamline project approvals and foreshadow plans to develop a stronger manufacturing sector. Andrews will address the National Press Club and chart plans for economic recovery out of the coronavirus crisis. Senior fellow at thinktank Per Capita, David Hetherington, writes that Australia risks returning to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d rather than using the crisis as an opportunity to reform. Australia\u2019s death toll from coronavirus rose to 100 yesterday. Brazil has overtaken the United Kingdom to become the country with the third-highest number of confirmed coronavirus infections, behind only the United States and Russia. Cases are growing in South Africa and India and the World Bank is warning the crisis could push 60 million people into poverty. The UK\u2019s chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has warned Britain is facing a \u201csevere recession the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen\u201d. Experts fear Boris Johnson\u2019s efforts to ease England\u2019s lockdown are \u201crecklessly premature\u201d compared with a more cautious approach in Ireland, Scotland and Wales. And in the United States, the White House has confirmed Donald Trump is taking an unproven malaria drug as a defence against Covid-19, despite his own administration\u2019s warnings the drug could have dangerous side effects. Australia Queensland\u2019s former deputy premier and treasurer, Jackie Trad, who resigned from the cabinet last week amid an integrity scandal says she has been targeted because of her progressive views. In an exclusive interview with Guardian Australia, she says she has been the focus of a campaign by political and media opponents. A man who rescued a whale calf trapped in nets off the Gold Coast from a small boat may face a fine of almost $27,000. The man rescued the stricken animal on Tuesday morning as officials took more than two hours to respond. The world Police in Canada are treating a machete attack in which a woman was murdered and two others injured as an act of terrorism, after allegedly discovering evidence suggesting it was motivated by violent misogyny. It\u2019s thought to be the first time terrorism charges have been brought in a case connected to the so-called \u201cincel\u201d ideology. Hungary\u2019s parliament has voted to end legal recognition for trans people. The new law defines gender as based on chromosomes at birth, removing previous provisions whereby trans people could alter their gender and name on official documents. Thousands of visitors descended on Yellowstone national park in the US, which opened for the first time since March. America\u2019s oldest national park and the nearby Grand Teton national park are the most recent to have partially reopened with the support of the Trump administration. A court in Madrid has dismissed an appeal from a woman claiming to be Salvador Dal\u00ed\u2019s daughter. Tarot card reader and psychic Pilar Abel was ordered to pay for the 2017 exhumation of the artist\u2019s body for a failed paternity test. Recommended reads With the prospect of increased socialising on the horizon, Deirdre Fidge is facing up to the fact she\u2019ll never complete her own \u201cquarantine syllabus\u201d. While she\u2019d set what seemed like realistic goals in the first blush of isolation \u2013 daily exercise, learning Spanish, finally knocking over that to-be-read pile \u2013 the reality was more like days wiled away in a mixture of anxiety and lethargy. But she writes that\u2019s a perfectly appropriate response to the times: \u201cUnless you are hoarding essential groceries or stealing hospital hand sanitiser, now is the time to relinquish judgment of ourselves.\u201d Although Nadine Cohen has hardly seen anyone in months, she says she\u2019s never felt less alone. While she used to be \u201cparalysed with dread\u201d when she saw call notifications and feel too self-conscious to video chat, during the pandemic she has actually been picking up \u2013 providing a way to connect with friends she\u2019d otherwise rarely see. While the world went into lockdown, Sam West went somewhere he could escape: the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. The once maligned D&amp;D was already experiencing a boost in popularity after Game of Thrones and its bit part on Stranger Things, but the pandemic has made its opportunities for adventure and imagination even more absorbing. Listen Today Full Story examines how an audacious coup attempt in Venezuela backfired. An attempt earlier this month to remove Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power ended in farcical failure as a seaborne invading force was captured easily following a series of mishaps. World affairs editor Julian Borger tells the bizarre story. Full Story is Guardian Australia\u2019s news podcast.

Brian Aubusson didn\u2019t reach the greatest heights of NRL, but proved there are more important things in life than kicking a footy. The English Premier League has revealed that six players or staff across the league tested positive for coronavirus over two days of testing. The league carried out 748 tests in recent days as part of a process to allow matches to restart in June. Media roundup Regional travel in NSW will be allowed for any reason from 1 June, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. The Mercury reports there\u2019s still no start date for an independent review of the deadly coronavirus outbreak in north-west Tasmania. And as the Northern Territory\u2019s dry season sets in, the NT News says caravan parks are struggling to survive without the flood of grey nomads. Coming up There will be a public hearing in a federal parliamentary inquiry into the auditor-general\u2019s report on Australia\u2019s future submarines project. And if you\u2019ve read this far \u2026 Covid-19 has taken so much from us, but now it\u2019s come for our emojis too. The Unicode Consortium, which sets standards for digital typography, has had to delay the next set of updates \u2013 from March until September 2021. That means Apple and Google will struggle to implement new designs on their normal timescale, so 2021 may bear no new emojis. Blushing wide-eyed face, side-eye face, gushing tears face!

The prime minister recommended the Bedfordshire pensioner for the honour, which will be formally announced on Wednesday. \u201cColonel Tom\u2019s fantastic fundraising broke records, inspired the whole country and provided us all with a beacon of light through the fog of coronavirus,\u201d Boris Johnson said. \u201cOn behalf of everyone who has been moved by his incredible story, I want to say a huge thank you.

He turned 100 at the end of April, shortly after becoming the oldest artist to claim a UK No 1 single after collaborating with Michael Ball and the choir NHS Voices of Care on a cover of You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone.

      "bodyText": "Nearly 9m attempts to access child sexual abuse material online were made in the UK last month during the coronavirus lockdown, according to an internet watchdog. The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), a British charity that identifies child sexual abuse content online, said it had blocked and filtered at least 8.8m attempts by UK internet users to access videos and images of children suffering sexual abuse during April alone. The figures come after stark warnings from law enforcement and child protection organisations that paedophiles are seeking to take advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic to search for and carry out abuse online. The National Crime Agency last month revealed it believes there are a minimum of 300,000 individuals in the UK posing a sexual threat to children, either through physical \u201ccontact\u201d abuse, or via the internet. The IWF provides a list of child sexual abuse URLs that companies use to block and filter so that criminal content is not available through their services. Three companies that use the list helped to compile the data that revealed the 8.8m UK attempts to access child sexual abuse imagery on URLs in April. Susie Hargreaves, chief executive of the IWF, said: \u201cThis is the first time we have had this data made available to us and it just goes to show how important the URL list is.

Malpass said his bank had so far loaned money to about 100 countries, accounting for 70% of the world\u2019s population.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>The World Health Organization\u2019s annual assembly passed a resolution on the need to investigate the global response to the pandemic</strong>. None of the WHO\u2019s 194 member states raised objections to the resolution brought by the EU on behalf of more than 100 countries.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK reported 545 more deaths, taking its total to 35,341</strong>. The environment secretary, George Eustice, announced the latest figure at the government\u2019s daily briefing on the epidemic. The UK remains the world\u2019s second-worst affected country by deaths after the US.</li> \n   <li><strong>Rishi Sunak, the UK\u2019s chancellor, said the country is facing \u201ca severe recession the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen\u201d</strong>. Giving evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee, he said he expects the unemployment rate to be in double figures by the end of the year.</li> \n   <li><strong>Cambridge University will not hold traditional lectures in the 2020/21 academic year.</strong>There will be no \u201cface-to-face lectures\u201d at the University of Cambridge in the 2020/21 academic year, the institution has said. Lectures will continue virtually, while it may be possible for smaller teaching groups to take place in person if it conforms to social distancing requirements. </li> \n   <li><strong>Afghanistan recorded its biggest one-day rise in infections </strong>as about half of tests done in a 24-hour period came back positive. The health ministry confirmed 581 new cases out of 1,200 tests, marking the country\u2019s worst day of the crisis \u2013 the previous high was 414.</li> \n   <li><strong>The border between Canada and the US will remain closed</strong> to non-essential travel until 21 June. The closure was set to expire this week after the two governments announced a 30-day extension of the restrictions last month.</li> \n   <li><strong>Spain reported a death toll below 100 for the third consecutive day</strong>, confirming 83 deaths from coronavirus in the past 24 hours. The latest figures from the health ministry showed the majority of the latest deaths were in some of the hardest-hit areas of the country.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam\u2019s third holiest site, will reopen next week</strong>, authorities said. The Islamic endowment overseeing the site in Jerusalem under Jordanian custodianship had taken the unprecedented step of closing it to worshippers in March.</li> \n   <li><strong>People living within a kilometre of Barcelona\u2019s beaches will be able to return to the sand from Wednesday</strong>, as the local lockdown eases. People will be able to make \u201crecreational use\u201d of the Catalan capital\u2019s beaches as long as they respect physical distancing.</li> \n   <li><strong>Half a dozen people from three English Premier League football clubs tested positive for Covid-19</strong> in the space of two days, dealing a blow to hopes of top-flight English football resuming next month.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec45b8c8f0864e579f14105\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/maanvi-singh\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T22:23:34.794Z\">11.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Trump has signed an executive order encouraging agencies to cut regulations in the name of economic recovery.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAgencies must continue to remove barriers to the greatest engine of economic prosperity the world has ever known: the innovation, initiative, and drive of the American people,\u201d the order states.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1262843201305616385\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">President Trump signs Executive Order giving Cabinet members authority to cut regulations.<br><br>Full video here: <a href=\"https://t.co/1NXrzbhqNL\">https://t.co/1NXrzbhqNL</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/P6j6ikzavC\">pic.twitter.com/P6j6ikzavC</a></p>\u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1262843201305616385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 19, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec45a478f0886ce4f5d6b09\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T22:17:54.723Z\">11.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Hi, Helen Sullivan with you now.

What do we know about these drugs?</p> \n  <h2><strong>What is </strong>hydroxychloroquine<strong>?</strong></h2> \n  <p>Hydroxychloroquine, which Trump says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/trump-taking-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-fda-warnings\">he has been taking</a> for about two weeks, was developed as an antimalarial but it is also used to treat conditions like lupus, an anti-immune disease, and arthritis, where it can help combat inflammation. It has been licensed for use in the US since the mid 1950s and is listed by the World Health Organization as an \u201cessential\u201d medicine.</p> \n  <h2><strong>What\u2019s the state of the current evidence?</strong><br></h2> \n  <p>In May, the British Medical Journal reported on a randomised (although still problematic) clinical trial in China that found little evidence hydroxychloroquine worked, with serious adverse events noted in two patients.</p> \n  <p>A second study reported in the BMJ last week on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/vital-drug-people-lupus-coronavirus-covid-19-link-hydroxychloroquine\">French trial</a> also concluded that hydroxychloroquine does not significantly reduce admission to intensive care or improve survival rates in patients hospitalised with pneumonia owing to Covid-19. Overall, 89% of those who received hydroxychloroquine survived after 21 days, compared with 91% in the control group.</p> \n  <p>The US Food and Drug Administration in a safety alert issued on 24 April warned that it had received reports that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine could have serious side-effects and that the drugs should be taken only under the close supervision of a doctor in a hospital setting or a clinical trial.</p> \n  <h2>What are the risks in taking hydroxychloroquine?</h2> \n  <p>There are several side-effects. The most serious is that it can interfere with the rhythm of the heart. Other side-effects include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, skin rash or itching or hair loss. Research published by the Mayo Clinic has suggested that \u201coff-label\u201d repurposing of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine could lead to \u201cdrug-induced sudden cardiac death\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Although Trump\u2019s official physician has said he was in \u201cvery good health\u201d at his last official checkup, the president is 73 and his recorded weight would put him in a BMI category of \u201cclinically obese\u201d.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec443a08f0886ce4f5d6a4c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-19T20:49:28.592Z\">9.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the US, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> has claimed that scientists carried out a study of the effects of hydroxychloroquine, the results of which suggested he is wrong to tout it, because they oppose him politically.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.16.20065920v2\">The study</a> of hundreds of patients at US veterans health administration medical centers showed that those who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% death rate, while those who did not had an 11.4% death rate.

Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/julianborger\">Julian Borger</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alison-rourke\">Alison Rourke</a> report:</em> </p> \n  <p>Donald Trump has threatened to cut funding to the World Health Organization permanently and even pull the US out of the global body altogether unless it makes \u201cmajor substantive improvements\u201d which the president did not explain.</p> \n  <p>On Monday night, the president published the letter, citing a timeline of the organisation\u2019s alleged failings, which was based on a selective version of the pandemic, highlighting where the WHO had publicised Chinese findings on the nature of the disease, but ignoring or glossing over clear warnings from the organisation about the dangers of the contagion.</p> \n  <p>The move came hours after the US president told reporters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/trump-taking-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-fda-warnings\">he had been taking hydroxychloroquine for a couple of weeks</a>, despite warnings from his administration that it is dangerous. \u201cI think it\u2019s good, I heard a lot of good stories \u2026 I take a pill every day,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>The letter is the latest salvo in a war of words between Trump and the WHO that has unfolded in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The US president, who is under pressure at home over his response to the pandemic, temporarily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-trump-halts-funding-to-world-health-organization\">froze funding to the WHO</a> in April, accusing the global body of \u201cseverely mismanaging and covering up\u201d the threat. At the time, critics were stunned at the move to cut money from a critical UN agency during a global pandemic.</p> \n  <p>Before Trump\u2019s letter, Tedros acknowledged there had been shortcomings and told the virtual assembly he welcomed calls for a review. \u201cI will initiate an independent evaluation at the earliest appropriate moment to review experience gained and lessons learned, and to make recommendations to improve national and global pandemic preparedness and response,\u201d he said. \u201cBut one thing is abundantly clear.

More than 90% of intensive care beds were full last week in Chile\u2019s capital, Santiago, whose main cemetery dug 1,000 emergency graves to prepare for a wave of deaths, AP reports. In Lima, Peru, patients took up 80% of intensive care beds as of Friday. Peru has the world\u2019s 12th-highest number of confirmed cases, with more than 90,000. \u201cWere in bad shape,\u201d said Pilar Mazzetti, head of the Peruvian governments Covid-19 task force. \u201cThis is war.\u201d In some cities, doctors say patients are dying because of a lack of ventilators or because they couldn\u2019t get to a hospital fast enough. With intensive care units swamped, officials plan to move patients from capitals like Lima and Santiago to hospitals in smaller cities that aren\u2019t as busy running the risk of spreading the disease further. Latin American countries halted international flights and rolled out social distancing guidelines around the same time as the US and Europe, delaying the arrival of large-scale infection, said Dr. Marcos Espinal, director of communicable diseases at the Pan American Health Organization. Latin America is the worlds most unequal region, a reality that Espinal said made it difficult to balance health and economic growth, with millions facing increased poverty during quarantines, curfews and shutdowns. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: The Covid-19 crisis could push 60 million people into poverty, the head of the World Bank, David Malpass, said. Malpass said his bank had so far loaned money to about 100 countries, accounting for 70% of the world\u2019s population. The World Health Organization\u2019s annual assembly passed a resolution on the need to investigate the global response to the pandemic. None of the WHO\u2019s 194 member states raised objections to the resolution brought by the EU on behalf of more than 100 countries. The UK reported 545 more deaths, taking its total to 35,341. The environment secretary, George Eustice, announced the latest figure at the government\u2019s daily briefing on the epidemic. The UK remains the world\u2019s second-worst affected country by deaths after the US. Rishi Sunak, the UK\u2019s chancellor, said the country is facing \u201ca severe recession the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen\u201d. Giving evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee, he said he expects the unemployment rate to be in double figures by the end of the year. Cambridge University will not hold traditional lectures in the 2020/21 academic year.There will be no \u201cface-to-face lectures\u201d at the University of Cambridge in the 2020/21 academic year, the institution has said. Lectures will continue virtually, while it may be possible for smaller teaching groups to take place in person if it conforms to social distancing requirements. Afghanistan recorded its biggest one-day rise in infections as about half of tests done in a 24-hour period came back positive. The health ministry confirmed 581 new cases out of 1,200 tests, marking the country\u2019s worst day of the crisis \u2013 the previous high was 414. The border between Canada and the US will remain closed to non-essential travel until 21 June. The closure was set to expire this week after the two governments announced a 30-day extension of the restrictions last month. Spain reported a death toll below 100 for the third consecutive day, confirming 83 deaths from coronavirus in the past 24 hours. The latest figures from the health ministry showed the majority of the latest deaths were in some of the hardest-hit areas of the country. The Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam\u2019s third holiest site, will reopen next week, authorities said. The Islamic endowment overseeing the site in Jerusalem under Jordanian custodianship had taken the unprecedented step of closing it to worshippers in March. People living within a kilometre of Barcelona\u2019s beaches will be able to return to the sand from Wednesday, as the local lockdown eases. People will be able to make \u201crecreational use\u201d of the Catalan capital\u2019s beaches as long as they respect physical distancing. Half a dozen people from three English Premier League football clubs tested positive for Covid-19 in the space of two days, dealing a blow to hopes of top-flight English football resuming next month. Trump has signed an executive order encouraging agencies to cut regulations in the name of economic recovery. \u201cAgencies must continue to remove barriers to the greatest engine of economic prosperity the world has ever known: the innovation, initiative, and drive of the American people,\u201d the order states. Hi, Helen Sullivan with you now. I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest coronavirus news from around the world for the next few hours. Please do get in touch with any comments, questions, tips, stories or jokes on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com. Two months ago, he was simply Capt Tom Moore. When his fundraising exploits inspired the nation, he was made an honorary colonel to mark his 100th birthday. And now, the British war veteran whose sponsored walks in his garden raised \u00a333m for NHS charities, is to receive a knighthood. Donald Trump has reignited a controversy over the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine after telling reporters he was taking the latter to protect himself against coronavirus. What do we know about these drugs? What is hydroxychloroquine? Hydroxychloroquine, which Trump says he has been taking for about two weeks, was developed as an antimalarial but it is also used to treat conditions like lupus, an anti-immune disease, and arthritis, where it can help combat inflammation. It has been licensed for use in the US since the mid 1950s and is listed by the World Health Organization as an \u201cessential\u201d medicine. What\u2019s the state of the current evidence? In May, the British Medical Journal reported on a randomised (although still problematic) clinical trial in China that found little evidence hydroxychloroquine worked, with serious adverse events noted in two patients. A second study reported in the BMJ last week on a French trial also concluded that hydroxychloroquine does not significantly reduce admission to intensive care or improve survival rates in patients hospitalised with pneumonia owing to Covid-19. Overall, 89% of those who received hydroxychloroquine survived after 21 days, compared with 91% in the control group. The US Food and Drug Administration in a safety alert issued on 24 April warned that it had received reports that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine could have serious side-effects and that the drugs should be taken only under the close supervision of a doctor in a hospital setting or a clinical trial. What are the risks in taking hydroxychloroquine? There are several side-effects. The most serious is that it can interfere with the rhythm of the heart. Other side-effects include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, skin rash or itching or hair loss. Research published by the Mayo Clinic has suggested that \u201coff-label\u201d repurposing of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine could lead to \u201cdrug-induced sudden cardiac death\u201d. Although Trump\u2019s official physician has said he was in \u201cvery good health\u201d at his last official checkup, the president is 73 and his recorded weight would put him in a BMI category of \u201cclinically obese\u201d. In the US, Donald Trump has claimed that scientists carried out a study of the effects of hydroxychloroquine, the results of which suggested he is wrong to tout it, because they oppose him politically. The study of hundreds of patients at US veterans health administration medical centers showed that those who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% death rate, while those who did not had an 11.4% death rate. Trump said: Joanna Walters writes that Trump also falsely claimed evidence suggests hydroxychloroquine does not have negative side effects. In reality, the Food and Drug Administration has said it should only be used as a coronavirus treatment in hospital settings due to \u201creports of serious heart rhythm problems\u201d in virus patients who had received the drug. When a reporter mentioned the FDA guidance, Trump said, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I was told.\u201d *We originally inaccurately reported that this study was published in the New England Journal of Medecine. The research was published as a pre-print \u2014 it has not yet gone through a rigorous process of peer review. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 933 more deaths and 24,481 more cases, taking the totals to 90,340 and 1,504,830, respectively. Donald Trump has announced that he will sign an executive order directing federal agencies to eliminate \u201cunnecessary regulations that impede economic recovery\u201d. According to Reuters, he told a Cabinet: I\u2019m directing agencies to review the hundreds of regulations we\u2019ve already suspended in response to the virus and make these suspensions permanent where possible. Trump also tweeted this. Hand-shaking, back-slapping, not a mask in sight: This as the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said any action on a new pandemic response bill could be weeks away. There will be no \u201cface-to-face lectures\u201d at the University of Cambridge in the 2020/21 academic year, the institution has said. Lectures will continue virtually, while it may be possible for smaller teaching groups to take place in person if it conforms to social distancing requirements. A spokesman for the university said: The university is constantly adapting to changing advice as it emerges during this pandemic. Given that it is likely that social distancing will continue to be required, the university has decided there will be no face-to-face lectures during the next academic year. Lectures will continue to be made available online and it may be possible to host smaller teaching groups in person, as long as this conforms to social distancing requirements. This decision has been taken now to facilitate planning but, as ever, will be reviewed should there be changes to official advice on coronavirus. Officials in the Bolivian city of Trinidad are to give out free doses of the anti-parasite drug ivermectin in a bid to combat the epidemic. Authorities will go house-to-house to pass out about 350,000 doses of the drug in an area that has seen 581 confirmed cases and 41 deaths. The Ministry of Health said it can be used under proper medical protocol, while noting the lack of evidence for it as a treatment for Covid-19. The health minister Marcelo Navajas told local media: It is a product that does not have scientific validation in the treatment of the coronavirus. It does serve to treat parasitic diseases and other types of diseases. Therefore, we ask our medical colleagues who are going to use this product to do so with informed consent. McDonald\u2019s has been accused of endangering employees and their families by failing to adopt government safety guidance during the pandemic. Five workers in Chicago have filed a class action lawsuit against the chain, saying it failed to provide adequate hand sanitiser, gloves and masks. They also allege that McDonald\u2019s has not been notifying staff when an employee became infected. McDonald\u2019s said the allegations were inaccurate and that safety, including wellness checks and protective gear, was a top priority. The Trump administration is poised to extend non-essential travel restrictions at the land borders with Canada and Mexico, the acting US Department of Homeland Security chief Chad Wolf has indicated. We really have to see what is the health care situation like in Mexico and Canada, how are their cases, have they hit their curve? What we don\u2019t want to do is try to open up parts of our economy and have a lot of folks coming across the border that we haven\u2019t seen in the past 50 or 60 days. Canada\u2019s prime minister Justin Trudeau had already said his country and the US have agreed to extend the ban at their shared border by another 30 days, after reports earlier in the day suggested such a move was likely. South Africa is also easing its lockdown measures, resume classes for some pupils on 1 June. Those in grades seven and 12, usually aged 13 and 18, will return to class and the country\u2019s minister of basic education Angie Motshekga said that, under strict social distancing rules, other grades would be able to attend lessons in schools with fewer than 150 pupils. Larger schools will open for other grades at a later date. The Netherlands will press ahead with a further easing of lockdown measures in June due to a steadily declining number of infections and hospital admissions, its prime minister Mark Rutte has said. The country\u2019s 17 million inhabitants have been living under the lockdown measures for about two and a half months. Rutte told them: We earned the space we are getting for sticking to the guidelines. We have to stick to the rules because we know the virus can flare up again. The number of infections rose by 108 to 44,249 on Tuesday, with 21 new deaths over the last 24 hours. The death toll stood at 5,715, national health authorities said. Here are the latest headlines from our global coronavirus coverage: The Covid-19 crisis could push 60 million people into poverty, the head of the World Bank, David Malpass, said. Malpass said his bank had so far loaned money to about 100 countries, accounting for 70% of the world\u2019s population. The World Health Organization\u2019s annual assembly passed a resolution on the need to investigate the global response to the pandemic. None of the WHO\u2019s 194 member states raised objections to the resolution brought by the EU on behalf of more than 100 countries. The UK reported 545 more deaths, taking its total to 35,341. The environment secretary, George Eustice, announced the latest figure at the government\u2019s daily briefing on the epidemic. The UK remains the world\u2019s second-worst affected country by deaths after the US. Rishi Sunak, the UK\u2019s chancellor, said the country is facing \u201ca severe recession the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen\u201d. Giving evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee, he said he expects the unemployment rate to be in double figures by the end of the year. Afghanistan recorded its biggest one-day rise in infections as about half of tests done in a 24-hour period came back positive. The health ministry confirmed 581 new cases out of 1,200 tests, marking the country\u2019s worst day of the crisis \u2013 the previous high was 414. The border between Canada and the US will remain closed to non-essential travel until 21 June. The closure was set to expire this week after the two governments announced a 30-day extension of the restrictions last month. Spain reported a death toll below 100 for the third consecutive day, confirming 83 deaths from coronavirus in the past 24 hours. The latest figures from the health ministry showed the majority of the latest deaths were in some of the hardest-hit areas of the country. The Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam\u2019s third holiest site, will reopen next week, authorities said. The Islamic endowment overseeing the site in Jerusalem under Jordanian custodianship had taken the unprecedented step of closing it to worshippers in March. People living within a kilometre of Barcelona\u2019s beaches will be able to return to the sand from Wednesday, as the local lockdown eases. People will be able to make \u201crecreational use\u201d of the Catalan capital\u2019s beaches as long as they respect physical distancing. Half a dozen people from three English Premier League football clubs tested positive for Covid-19 in the space of two days, dealing a blow to hopes of top-flight English football resuming next month. That\u2019s it from me, Damien Gayle, until tomorrow. Covid-19 continues to sweep across the Peruvian Amazon with deadly ferocity. Pucallpa, on the country\u2019s eastern border with Brazil, follows Iquitos as the second Peruvian Amazon city to be ravaged by the deadly virus, writes Dan Collyns. Social media images showed sick people lying in motorised rickshaws outside one hospital which had shut its doors and refused to take more patients. Other images showed doctors and nurses protesting about the lack of PPE, medicines and oxygen. At least 45 members of the 30,000-strong Shipibo Konibo indigenous people have died from the coronavirus in Ucayali, the Amazon region of which Pucallpa is the capital, according to the local indigenous federation Feconau. Many more are sick as Covid-19 has penetrated villages that self-isolated when the pandemic reached South America. \u201cIn Pucallpa there is a total collapse of the three public hospitals, the private clinics are shut, and people are dying here every day,\u201d said Miguel Hilario-Manenima, a local university professor with a PhD from Stanford university. As desperate patients gasp for air, an oxygen plant lies inoperative in the city, part of newly built hospital that was never completed, an investigation by El Comercio newspaper revealed. As in Iquitos, oxygen has become a precious and overpriced resource in the hands of private companies who have quintupled the cost of a typical 10m3 canister, all sources consulted by The Guardian concurred. Aoife Bennett, an honorary research associate from Oxford University working in Pucallpa, said indigenous communities were clubbing together to try to buy oxygen which had reached \u201cextortionate\u201d prices. A cylinder which cost about 600 soles (\u00a3144) before the pandemic began now costs between 3,500 soles (\u00a3843) and 5,000 soles (\u00a31,205). \u201cI put money towards buying a ridiculously expensive cylinder of oxygen because I\u2019m trying to save a friend\u2019s life,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cBut it\u2019s absolutely disgusting that this should happen.\u201d Peru\u2019s state social security body EsSalud said last week it expected to build a 100-bed field hospital in Pucallpa for Covid-19 patients which would be ready in three weeks. Official figures for Ucayali report 2,032 coronavirus cases and 91 deaths but local accounts report hundreds of deaths. One local cemetery reported 421 deaths above the average number of deceased during the last month. Coronavirus cases in Peru rose to more than 94,000 on Monday, with a death toll of 2,789 according to official figures. Only Brazil has a higher infection rate in Latin America, surging to third place in the world with 257,396 confirmed cases and sixth place for coronavirus deaths with 16,941, according to John Hopkins University. Ireland has reported sixteen more deaths from Covid-19, bringing the country\u2019s total death toll to 1,561. According to the department of health, 51 more people have tested positive for the coronavirus. The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, has recommended that the annual gathering of world leaders in late September be scaled back because of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Associated Press reports. In a letter to the president of the UN general assembly, Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, Guterres suggested that only one New York-based diplomat from each of the 193 UN member nations gather in the general assembly hall, with heads of state and government instead delivering pre-recorded messages. Tijjani Muhammad-Bande has said a decision on the annual gathering will be made after consultations with member states. This year was expected to bring an especially large number of leaders to UN headquarters to celebrate the founding of the supranational body in 1945 on the ashes of the second world war. Twenty-eight more people have died from Covid-19 in Turkey, while 1,022 more have tested positive for the coronavirus, continuing a downward trajectory in new deaths and infections, the Associated Press reports. The health minister, Fahrettin Koca, tweeted new figures showing a total of 4,199 deaths and 151,615 reported positive cases since 11 March, when the first infection was confirmed. Koca said the decrease in patients needing intensive care continued and the number of patients who recovered reached 112,895. Turkey has opted for partial lockdowns, contact tracing and early treatment in combating the novel coronavirus. Fifteen provinces, including Istanbul, are in the final day of a four-day lockdown. The president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said on Monday that he hoped the upcoming nationwide lockdown during the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr from 23-26 May would be the final round. Brazil has overtaken the UK to become the country with the third-highest number of confirmed coronavirus infections, amid warnings from its former health minister that three painful months lie ahead, write Tom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro and David Agren in Mexico City. Latin America\u2019s largest economy has now recorded 254,220 cases, placing it behind only the US and Russia, and ahead of the UK, which on Monday had 247,706. Meanwhile, in Mexico \u2013 the region\u2019s number two economy \u2013 allegations that Covid-19 deaths were being dramatically undercounted added fuel to an increasingly acrimonious political battle over the government\u2019s response to the pandemic. Brazil has officially suffered 16,792 Covid-19 deaths \u2013 the world\u2019s sixth-highest number \u2013 although under-reporting and low testing rates mean the true figure is likely to be considerably higher. Coronavirus shutdowns around the world could undo three years of gains in alleviating poverty, the president of the World Bank has said. In the latest apocalyptic prediction by a member of the global financial elite, David Malpass said that up to 60 million people could be pushed below the poverty line, according to World Bank estimates, as the global economy shrinks by around 5%. Malpass said that the World Bank group had so far loaned money for emergency programmes in 100 countries, accounting for about 70% of the world\u2019s population, in response to the crisis. He said the money would \u201creinforce healthcare systems\u201d as well as pay for medical equipment and supplies. According to a transcript of his speech on the World Bank website, he said: The health and economic impacts that the Covid-19 pandemic and shut down have inflicted on developing countries are severe. Our estimate is that up to 60 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty \u2013 that erases all the progress made in poverty alleviation in the past three years. And our forecasts indicate deep recession this year as much as minus five percent recession for the global economy. Families have lost loved ones, millions of jobs and livelihoods are lost, the health systems are under enormous strain worldwide. UFC president Dana White has taken a leaf out of his friend Donald Trump\u2019s playbook, and launched an attack on the media for its reporting on the promotion, the Guardian\u2019s sport desk reports. UFC recently resumed competition without live audiences. However, many publications \u2013 including the New York Times and the Guardian \u2013 expressed concern about Covid-19 safety protocols at the fights as well as the fact that UFC tried to silence fighters and journalists covering the events. White said in an appearance on Fox News\u2019s Hannity show We were trying to figure out solutions to the problems [of enforcing coronavirus protocols] and [asking] how do you bring sports back safely and health and safety is an issue for us. Every single weekend when we were leading up to these events, we had so many, you know, New York Times and so many other media people trying to sabotage the events so that it couldn\u2019t happen. Jamie Dimon, the billionaire chief executive of JP Morgan, said on Tuesday that the coronavirus pandemic must serve as a \u201cwake-up call\u201d to build a fairer society, writes Dominic Rushe for the Guardian US in New York. He wrote in a memo issued ahead of his bank\u2019s annual shareholder meeting: It is my fervent hope that we use this crisis as a catalyst to rebuild an economy that creates and sustains opportunity for dramatically more people, especially those who have been left behind for too long ... The last few months have laid bare the reality that, even before the pandemic hit, far too many people were living on the edge. This is not the first time that Dimon has criticised the system that built his $1.2bn fortune. Last year, when leftwing Vermont senator Bernie Sanders was leading in Democratic polls, he acknowledged the \u201cflaws\u201d in capitalism, but warned that socialism led to \u201cstagnation, corruption and often worse\u201d. Dimon has been tipped as a possible treasury secretary should Joe Biden be successful in his presidential bid. Biden is also reportedly considering his former presidential rival Michael Bloomberg, the multi-billionaire founder of the Bloomberg news service, as a future head of the World Bank. There were 162 fatalities from coronavirus in Italy on Tuesday, up from 99 on Monday, bringing the death count to 32,169, writes Angela Giuffrida, the Guardian\u2019s Rome correspondent. There were 813 new infections, up from 451 in the last 24 hours, according to the civil protection authority. More than half of the new cases were in the Lombardy region. Civil liberties were extended on Monday, with people allowed to travel within their regions, while bars, restaurants, shops, museums and libraries reopened. People must maintain social distancing, however police said a crowd of 300 gathered without face masks in Foggia, Puglia, to celebrate the feast of the Madonna del Soccorso, on Monday night, while another group commemorated a local mafia boss. The Italian government has warned of an immediate return to lockdown if the epidemic curve increases again. The country has registered 226,699 cases to date. The UK has reported 545 more deaths from Covid-19, taking its total to 35,341. The environment secretary, George Eustice, announced the latest figure for Europe\u2019s current coronavirus hotspot at the government\u2019s daily briefing on the coronavirus outbreak. The UK remains the world\u2019s second-worst affected country by deaths after the US. Sweden has had more deaths per capita from Covid-19 than any country in Europe over the past seven days, Reuters reports. Most schools, restaurants and businesses in Sweden have remained open throughout the pandemic, after it decided to eschew a wide-ranging lockdown of the economy to try to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Critics of Sweden\u2019s approach are likely to use the latest figures as ammunition against a policy they say has left its population exposed to Covid-19. While deaths are on the decline Sweden had 6.25 deaths per million inhabitants per day in a rolling seven day average to 19 May, according to Ourworldindata.org. It was the highest in Europe and just above the UK, which had 5.75 deaths per million despite having closed schools and most businesses, and imposing restrictions on people\u2019s movement outside their homes. Overall, Sweden still has fewer deaths per capita from Covid-19 than the UK, Spain, Italy, Belgium and France, which have all opted for lockdowns, but much higher than Nordic neighbours Denmark, Norway and Finland. Sweden\u2019s strategy, mostly based on voluntary measures regarding social distancing and basic hygiene, has been criticised by some as a dangerous experiment with peoples lives but also been put forward as a future model by the World Health Organization. Sweden\u2019s open strategy seems to have softened the blow on the economy, with growth shrinking much less than in Denmark and Norway in the first quarter. Singapore is to begin easing its coronavirus restriction on 2 June, although government said the relaxing of measures will likely see a rise in daily cases, Reuters reports. Businesses that operate in settings with lower transmission risks may resume activities, such as those in manufacturing, finance, insurance and wholesale trade. A third of the workforce will resume on-site operations, while the remainder would work from home, the trade and industry minister, Chan Chun Sing, told a news conference. The plan is the first phase of lifting of Singapore\u2019s so-called \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d restrictions to stem the spread of the coronavirus, which expire on 1 June. \u201cThis will be done in phases to reduce the risk of a second wave of cases of infections, as many countries have experienced, after they lifted their control measures,\u201d the health minister, Gan Kim Yong, said. \u201cAs we begin to resume more activities, we do expect to see a rise in daily new cases.\u201d Schools will also start reopening in the city-state from next month. The announcement came as Singapore reported that 451 more people had tested positive for the coronavirus, all but one of whom were migrant workers. UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov says his father is in critical condition after being infected by Covid-19, and he has lost several relatives to the virus. Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov has played a large part in his son\u2019s wildly successful mixed martial arts career, and encouraged his son to wrestle from when he was young. Khabib is undefeated in all 28 of his professional fights. Nurmagomedov said during an Instagram live chat on Monday: There is a lot written on the internet about my father. My father, right now, is in a hospital. He is in critical condition as a result of this virus. It impacted his heart because last year he had a surgery there, and right now, they did another surgery. He is in a very difficult situation, very difficult. We are asking Allah that he returns him to us. Eighty-three people have died from the coronavirus in Spain over the past 24 hours, making Tuesday the third consecutive day on which the death toll has been below 100, writes Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent. However, the latest figures from the health ministry show that the majority of the latest deaths were in some of the hardest-hit areas of the country: 31 in the Madrid region; 25 in Catalonia, and seven were in Castilla y Le\u00f3n. Of the 166 new hospital admissions for Covid-19, 67 were in Madrid and 38 in Catalonia. The Madrid region, the Barcelona metropolitan area and parts of Castilla y Le\u00f3n remain in the preliminary phase of Spain\u2019s lockdown de-escalation, while 70% of the country has moved to the next phase. The continuing lockdown has sparked protests in wealthy parts of the capital and in other cities. To date, Spain has reported 232,037 cases using PCR tests, and recorded 27,778 deaths. On Wednesday, Pedro S\u00e1nchez\u2019s Socialist-led coalition government will seek a fifth, two-week extension of the state of emergency that has been in force since 14 March. The wearing of face masks in all public places where social distancing cannot be observed is also to become compulsory. According to the Associated Press, the border between Canada and the US will remain closed to non-essential travel until 21 June. Ahead of the announcement by Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister (see last post), the agency spoke to a senior government official who confirmed the extension of the agreement, which had been set to expire this week. The two governments announced a 30-day extension of the restrictions last month. The US president, Donald Trump, has said that the U.S. and Canada are doing well in handling the pandemic. But with the US counting more confirmed deaths and cases than any other country in the world, Canadians have feared a reopening. Essential cross-border workers such as healthcare professionals, airline crews and truck drivers are still permitted to cross. Truck drivers are critical as they move food and medical goods in both directions. Much of Canada\u2019s food supply comes from or via the US. Most people in Spain support the lockdown and believe it should be extended, a survey showed on Tuesday, AFP reports. Figures from a survey by the state-run Centre for Sociological Studies (CIS) showed 95% of respondents believed the measures to fight the epidemic were necessary or very necessary. Despite the widespread approval of the lockdown there have been angry protests in Madrid and elsewhere denouncing the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis. Spain has suffered one of the most-deadly outbreaks of the epidemic, counting more than 231,000 cases and nearly 28,000 deaths, although the numbers peaked on 2 April. Six out of 10 respondents said they believed the strict conditions of the lockdown, which was imposed on 14 March but is being slowly eased, should be extended for longer, while 29% said they wanted more freedom of movement. But the population appears divided over how the government of prime minister Pedro Sanchez has handled the crisis, with 46% saying they had a lot, or quite a lot, of confidence in its policies, while 48% said they had little or none. Carried out between 4 and 13 May among a sample of 3,800 respondents, the survey was published days after anti-government demonstrations took place in several districts of Madrid and in other cities, some involving hundreds of people. Banging saucepans, waving Spanish flags and calling for \u201cfreedom\u201d, the demonstrators demanded Sanchez resign in a series of protests firmly backed by rightwing and far rightwing parties. Carbon dioxide emissions have fallen dramatically since lockdowns were imposed around the world due to the coronavirus crisis, writes Fiona Harvey, the Guardian\u2019s environment correspondent. Daily emissions of the greenhouse gas plunged 17% by early April compared with 2019 levels, according to the first definitive study of global carbon output this year. The findings show the world has experienced the sharpest drop in carbon output since records began, with large sections of the global economy brought to a near standstill. When the lockdown was at its most stringent, in some countries emissions fell by just over a quarter (26%) on average. In the UK, the decline was about 31%, while in Australia emissions fell 28.3% for a period during April. International cooperation should be a no-brainer during a global pandemic, the president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Tuesday, in an apparent dig at the US. \u201cThe greatest act of courage is to play as a team,\u201d she told a virtual World Health Assembly. France\u2019s foreign minister has said the country hopes to begin easing its border restrictions with EU countries from mid-June, writes Kim Willsher, the Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent. French borders have been closed to all but essential crossings since early April and only those with \u201ccompelling professional and personal reasons\u201d or French residents returning home are allowed in. Jean-Yves Le Drian said any changes would be on the basis of a reciprocal arrangement with France\u2019s neighbours. \u201cI think progressively from 15 June we can arrive at a general easing (of restrictions), at least that is what I hope,\u201d Le Drian told French radio. Le Drian said from tomorrow \u2013 Wednesday 20 May \u2013 French nationals returning from outside the EU would be asked to self-quarantine for two weeks, but added this would be \u201cvoluntary\u201d. Earlier, Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, the transport secretary, said if the \u201cconditions were right\u201d, Orly airport, closed since the end of March, could reopen around 26 June. Djebbari told BFMTV French police had carried out 200,000 checks on roads and issued 950 fines for those in contravention of the regulation limiting journeys to 100km without a compelling reason. The rule was introduced last Monday (11 May) at the end of France\u2019s strict eight-week lockdown. France has reported 28,239 deaths in hospital and care homes attributed to Covid-19. There are fewer than 2,000 people in intensive care in French hospitals with the virus, the lowest number since March. Member states have backed a resolution strongly supportive of the World Health Organization, after Donald Trump issued a fresh broadside against the UN body, giving it 30 days to make unspecified reforms or lose out on US funding, write Patrick Wintour and Julian Borger. A resolution that backed the WHO\u2019s leadership and said there needed to be an investigation into the global response to the coronavirus pandemic won endorsement at the WHO\u2019s annual ministerial meeting on Tuesday. The US president launched his attack late on Monday, sending a lengthy letter outlining America\u2019s belief that the WHO had not been sufficiently independent of China, and had been too willing to accept its explanations for the origins of the coronavirus outbreak. As the pandemic worsens in the US, and other countries begin a tentative recovery, Trump has sought to blame China and the WHO. The letter accused the WHO of making repeated mistakes, meaning thousands of lives had been lost, and America\u2019s interests not served. For nearly five full years, Virginia Pe\u00f1a Zamudio has been searching: trawling prisons, markets and forensic records for the slightest trace of her missing son, writes Madeleine Wattenbarger in Mexico City. Rosendo Vazquez Pe\u00f1a was kidnapped from a car repair shop in Mexico\u2019s Veracruz state in September 2015 and has not been seen here since. Since then Pe\u00f1a Zamudio has, like thousands of Mexican parents and spouses, thrown herself into a life of hunting, joining a search \u201cbrigade\u201d of grieving relatives determined to find their loved ones, dead or alive. But the coronavirus, which has killed at least 5,000 people in Mexico, has brought the hunt for its desaparecidos to a sudden and traumatic halt. \u201cWe\u2019re shut inside, we can\u2019t even move,\u201d said Pe\u00f1a Zamudio. \u201cAs a mother, I want to be able to break all of these barriers, but I can\u2019t.\u201d The Covid-19 crisis has exposed the stark inequality in access to effective health services between developed and undeveloped countries, the Red Cross\u2019s chief medic has said. In a statement on Tuesday, Esperanza Martinez, the head of health for the International Committee of the Red Cross, also said that healthcare workers were also coming under attack while working in the midst of the pandemic. She said: This crisis underlines the chasm between health services in developed and developing countries. We talk about increasing ICU beds in one while a clinic in another has no running water. You can\u2019t prevent and control this disease without the basics, including water and essential supplies. Strengthening health systems in developing and conflict-affected countries must now become a global priority. We\u2019ve also seen a worrying increase in attacks against health-care workers and facilities linked to Covid -- more than 200 globally -- right when communities need these services the most. Ensuring that health-care workers are safe and able to carry out their jobs is crucial for stemming the spread of this disease and caring for the people affected. This is an urgent call for collective action. The condition of a British man who is Vietnam\u2019s most seriously ill Covid-19 patient has improved, with portions of his lungs improving. However, doctors believe his best hope of survival still lies in a lung transplant. \u201cAbout 20 to 30% of his lungs have recovered, which gives us faint hope,\u201d Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n V\u0129nh Ch\u00e2u, director of Ho Chi Minh City\u2019s hospital for tropical diseases, was reported as saying by Vietnam News on Tuesday. The 45-year-old patient, a pilot with Viet Nam Airways, has been kept alive on an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (Ecmo) machine for 43 days. So far, 40 people, including a 70-year-old war veteran, have registered to donate lungs to the patient, Vietnam\u2019s transplant authority has said. The country has so far recorded no deaths from Covid-19. World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is addressing the World Health Assembly in Geneva. He said he welcomes the adoption of the EU resolution calling for an independent evaluation of the international response to the coronavirus pandemic, \u201cincluding but not limited to WHO\u2019s performance\u201d. Ghebreyesus said the WHO \u201cwants accountability more than anyone\u201d and that his organisation would continue \u201cproviding strategic leadership\u201d the world on the issue. This comes after Donald Trump\u2019s attack on the body, calling for it to make unspecified reforms or risk losing out on US funding within 30 days. We will post a fuller report on Ghebreyesus\u2019 speech later but here are some more of his words: Italy\u2019s prime minister has been addressing a virtual meeting of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Geneva. Earlier today, the World Health Assembly agreed to an independent investigation into the WHO\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic (see here). Giuseppe Conte said he was cautiously optimistic about the next phase of the pandemic as the country eases coronavirus measures, Reuters reports. He said: \u201cWe are entering this phase with cautious optimism and a sense of responsibility. We know that our struggle is far from being over.\u201d He also said that global health should be a \u201cshared priority\u201d shortly after the assembly adopted an EU resolution on the pandemic. Twenty one more people have died from Covid-19 in the Netherlands, the lowest number reported on a Tuesday since March, taking the total death toll in the country to 5,715. According to the latest update from the Dutch national institute for public health and the environment (RIVM), a further 108 people tested positive for the virus, the lowest number of new daily infections recorded since 10 March. So far, 44,249 confirmed cases have been reported. In a statement accompanying Tuesday\u2019s figures, RIVM said there had been a decrease in the number of people sick due to coronavirus. The number of people who have fallen ill due to the novel coronavirus in the Netherlands has been decreasing since the end of March. This is apparent from the decrease in the number of newly reported patients, hospital admissions, ICU admissions and deaths per day. The number of people who visit their GP because of symptoms that are consistent with the coronavirus is still decreasing. This is evident from figures provided by the Netherlands Institute for Health Services Research (Nivel). The virological daily updates show that, despite a broader testing policy, the number of people who were tested due to symptoms remained around 30,000 in the last three weeks. The percentage of confirmed Covid-19 cases in these people who were tested is steadily decreasing. Last week this figure was 5%, but at the end of March, 29% of tests were positive for the coronavirus. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus across Africa has passed 86,000, the regional office of the World Health Organization has said. Unlike in Europe, a widespread outbreak seems yet to happen in Africa, a continent of 1.3 billion people. There had been fears that its comparatively limited healthcare infrastructure would be overrun by patients with Covid-19. Sweden\u2019s public health authority on Tuesday reported a further 45 deaths from coronavirus, bringing the total death toll in the country, which controversially chose not to impose a lockdown, to 3,743. According to the latest update, 422 more people tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the country\u2019s total number of confirmed cases to 30,799. Death toll figures in Sweden generally fall over the weekend, due to a lack of reporting, then increase again during the week as health authorities catch up. Today\u2019s figure was the lowest reported on a Tuesday for six weeks, suggesting the outbreak in the country is now in abeyance despite a relative lack of measures to curb the spread of the virus. Basing its approach on a so-called \u201cprinciple of responsibility\u201d, Sweden has kept schools open (indeed compulsory) for children under the age of 16, along with cafes, bars, restaurants and businesses, and urged people to respect social distancing guidelines. Statistics released on Monday showed that Sweden had its deadliest month in almost three decades in April, with a total of 10,458 deaths recorded in the country of 10.3 million people. \u201cWe have to go back to December 1993 to find more dead during a single month,\u201d Tomas Johansson, population statistician at Statistics Sweden, said in a statement. In total, 97,008 deaths were recorded in Sweden during the whole of 1993, which in turn was the deadliest year since 1918, when the Spanish flu pandemic ravaged the country. Johansson told AFP there was no official breakdown explaining the high death toll in December 1993 but said there was a flu epidemic at the time. A resolution on the need to investigate the global response to the coronavirus pandemic won endorsement at the World Health Organization\u2019s annual ministerial meeting on Tuesday, Reuters reports. None of the WHO\u2019s 194 member states - which include the US \u2013 raised objections to the resolution brought by the European Union on behalf of more than 100 countries including Australia, China and Japan. \u201cIs the (World) Health Assembly prepared to adopt the draft resolution as proposed? As I see no requests for the floor, I take it that there is no objection and the resolution is therefore adopted,\u201d said Keva Bain, the Bahamas ambassador who serves as the assembly\u2019s president. People living within a kilometre of Barcelona\u2019s beaches will be able to return to the sand to sunbathe from Wednesday, the city council has announced, writes Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent. From tomorrow, people will be able to sunbathe and make \u201crecreational use\u201d of the Catalan capital\u2019s beaches - as long as they respect social distancing, according to the deputy mayor for safety, Albert Batlle. However, people will not be allowed to swim and must spend no longer than an hour on the beach. They must also adhere to the time slots for different age groups and activities: 6am to 10am for adult exercise and walking; 10am to 12pm and 7pm to 8pm for older people and those who require assistance; 12pm to 7pm for children accompanied by an adult, and 8pm to 11pm for professional sportspeople. Like the Madrid region and parts of Castilla y Le\u00f3n, the Barcelona metropolitan area remains in the preliminary phase of lockdown de-escalation, whil 70% of Spain has passed into the next stage. In the midst of a city-wide lockdown to try to contain the spread of coronavirus, police moved into clear protesters in southern Santiago, Chile, on Monday, as local officials warned of food shortages in poor neighbourhoods. According to Reuters, protesters threw rocks, shouted and burned piles of wood along a street in a destitute neighbourhood on Santiago\u2019s southern fringe. Images on social media and local television showed police spraying tear gas and water cannons to disperse the growing crowd. The municipality said in a statement that families were going hungry in the poorest sectors of El Bosque, a district where many work informally, or not at all. The city district has been under quarantine since mid-April, city officials said in a statement. States of emergency are being used to attack indigenous peoples around the world, the UN rapporteur for indigenous peoples has said. In a statement published on Monday, Jos\u00e9 Francisco Cali Tzay said he was receiving reports every day about how the Covid-19 pandemic is affecting indigenous communities, \u201cand it deeply worries me to see it is not always about health issues,\u201d he said. There have been a number of reports about the danger that the pandemic could pose to indigenous groups, but Tzay said greater danger lay in governments using the crisis as an excuse to marginalise and dispossess them. In his statement, Tzay went on: States of emergency are exacerbating the marginalisation of indigenous communities, and in the most extreme situations, militarisation of their territories is taking place. Indigenous peoples are being denied their freedom of expression and association, while business interests are invading and destroying their lands, territories and resources. In some countries, consultations with indigenous peoples and also environmental impact assessments are being abruptly suspended in order to force through megaprojects relating to agribusiness, mining, dams and infrastructure. Indigenous peoples who lose their lands and livelihoods are pushed further into poverty, higher rates of malnutrition, lack of access to clean water and sanitation, as well as exclusion from medical services, which in turn renders them particularly vulnerable to the disease. Ireland began phase one of its emergence from its coronavirus lockdown yesterday, expanding the number of shops that could open and easing restrictions on social contact. Eleven more people have tested positive for coronavirus in Zambia. The southern-central African country has so far reported 772 cases of coronavirus and seven deaths from Covid-19. The Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, the third holiest site in Islam, will reopen next week, after weeks of closure aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus, authorities said Tuesday, according to the Associated Press. The Islamic endowment overseeing the site under Jordanian custodianship had taken the unprecedented step of closing it to worshippers in March as other major holy sites were shuttered across the Middle East. The endowment said that in light of the relative decline of the spread of the virus it would reopen the site to worshippers after the Eid al-Fitr holiday marking the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which will begin this weekend and last for three days. A mechanism and procedures regarding lifting the suspension will be announced later, it added. Wildcat strikes, walkouts and protests over working conditions have erupted across the US throughout the coronavirus pandemic as \u201cessential\u201d workers have demanded better pay and safer working conditions, Michael Sainato reports for Guardian US. Working conditions, low pay and lack of safety protections have triggered protests throughout the pandemic as workers across various industries, including food service, meat processing, retail, manufacturing, transportation and healthcare have come together to protest about issues, many of which were apparent before the coronavirus. Deborah Berkowitz, director of worker safety and health for the National Employment Law Project, said: There are no federal mandates or requirements to implement the social distancing guidance or anything else. It\u2019s only guidance and employers can choose to implement them or not. And that is why, in an unprecedented way, they are walking out to bring public attention to the fact that their companies are not protecting their safety and health. Afghanistan has recorded its biggest one-day rise of new infections to Covid-19 as around half of tests came back positive in last 24 hours, amid a continued surge of transmissions in Kabul and intensified war across the country, writes Akhtar Mohammad Makoii for the Guardian from Herat. The health ministry confirmed 581 new cases out of 1,200 tests, marking the war-torn country\u2019s worst day of the crisis - the previous high record number was 414. Five patients also died of Covid-19 overnight, taking death toll to 178. Out of a total 7,653 infections there have been 850 recoveries. The heath ministry has pledged to increase number of daily tests. So far 24,697 suspected patients have been tested. Wahid Majroh, the deputy health minister, has warned citizens if they continue to break lockdown rules there will be another wave of the virus in the country. Despite a government imposed lockdown in several provinces, streets are still crowded. Meanwhile, the health minister, Ferozuddin Feroz, who was infected to the virus, has recovered and will soon back to his work, the ministry said. He was isolated at home. Kabul, which is the country\u2019s worst affected area, and the eastern province of Nangarhar recorded 299 new cases combined. The total number of infections in Kabul is 2,231 and in Nangarhar it stands at 444. Concerns are high in Nangarhar as the virus has spread in the province\u2019s prison. More than 80 prisoners and prisons\u2019 employees have so far been tested positive in Afghanistan. The remote province of Zabul reported its first death. Zabul\u2019s only hospital was destroyed in a Taliban attack last year. The province has recorded 38 confirmed cases so far. At least four civilians, including two children were killed in the province on Monday when a roadside bomb hit their vehicle, the interior ministry said. The northern city of Kunduz, which was under attack from the Taliban last night, reported 4 new cases. At least 11 Taliban fighters were killed and eight others were wounded in the attack on Kunduz city as the Taliban attack was pushed back by Afghan forces, the defence ministry said, while at least two people were killed in the explosion of a bomb placed in a bicycle, Tuesday afternoon. In response to an attack on a maternity hospital last week, the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, ordered a resumption of a full offensive against the Taliban and other militant groups, ending a period of reduced military activity ahead of US-brokered peace talks that had been expected to start this year. Deborah Lyons, the UN secretary general\u2019s special representative for Afghanistan, asked warring sides on Tuesday to halt the fighting and to \u201crespect humanitarian law\u201d. More than three times as many people may have died from Covid-19 in Mexico City than have been accounted for in official estimates, according to death certificates issued since the start of Mexico\u2019s epidemic, the Associated Press reports. The anti-corruption group Mexicans Against Corruption said in a report on that it got access to a database of death certificates issued in Mexico City between 18 March and 12 May. It showed doctors had included the words SARS, COV2, COV, Covid 19, or new coronavirus in explanatory notes attached to 4,577 certificates. The federal government acknowledges only 1,332 confirmed deaths from Covid-19 in Mexico City. Sars-CoV-2 is the technical name of the virus. The notes the group counted included terms like \u201csuspected,\u201d \u201cprobable\u201d, or \u201cpossible\u201d role of the virus in the deaths. In 3,209 of the certificates, it was listed as a suspected contributing factor along with other causes of death, like pneumonia, respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure. Only 323 certificates list confirmed coronavirus as a cause of death; 1,045 other death certificates listed COVID-19 but didn\u2019t specify if it was suspected or confirmed. On Tuesday Mexico reported 155 more deaths from Covid-19, bringing the total official death toll in the country to 5,332. According to the latest update, 2,414 more people tested positive for the coronavirus, bring the total number of confirmed cases to 51,633. The prime minister of Thailand has announced the government will not fund the continuing operation of Thai Airways, instead putting the flag carrier into court-supervised restructuring. In a speech on Tuesday, Prayut Chan-o-cha said he wanted to save the country\u2019s money \u201cto help the public in the months ahead,\u201d warning that the economic crisis to come would be \u201ceven more serious\u201d than the pandemic, which has had a limited impact in Thailand. According to a transcript of his speech, published on Facebook, he said: We have made good progress in trying to control the health crisis from Covid, especially when compared with other countries. But, the Covid crisis is not just about health. We are about to enter an even more serious crisis: the financial crisis that is hitting every person in Thailand. People have lost their livelihoods and still do not know when they may be able to go back to earning a normal income. This is an economic crisis that is likely to get even more serious. This is why I must save the people\u2019s money for programmes that can directly help them survive and then rebuild their lives, and the country\u2019s economy. Sixty-two more people in Iran have died from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, a similar number to that reported nearly every day this month, bringing the total death toll in the country to 7,119, the health ministry has said. In his daily televised address, Kianoush Jahanpour, the health ministry spokesman, said that 2,111 more people had tested positive for Sars-CoV-2. The total number of confirmed cases in Iran, which was one of the first countries outside China to suffer a major outbreak, is 124,603. Of those, 97,173 have recovered while 2,698 remain in a critical condition in hospital. Jahanpour said 716,176 tests have so far been carried out in Iran, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. Fourteen more people - 11 men and three women - have tested positive for coronavirus in Ethiopia, the ministry of health reported on Tuesday. According to a report circulated by Lia Tadesse, the health minister, on Twitter, 3,271 have been tested for the virus in the past 24 hours. The total number of confirmed cases in the country is now 365. So far five patients have died from Covid-19 and 120 have recovered, according to the report. Greece has signalled it will announce its hotly-awaited operational plan reviving the tourism sector tomorrow, writes Helena Smith, the Guardian\u2019s Athens correspondent. Media reports this morning suggest that the country\u2019s borders may be re-opened by mid-June, two weeks earlier than expected. Under the plan, to be announced by prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, travellers from across the EU as well as Israel would be allowed into Greece. It is unclear whether they would be subjected to a Covid-19 blood test or be asked to adhere to other health protocols. Greek outlets reported that travellers would be obliged to maintain social distancing rules at airports and wear masks during flights. The news came as RyanAir, the no-frills airline, announced that it would be resuming flights to destinations in Greece, including Corfu. In a country where tourism accounts for 25 percent of GDP, the government is hoping to capitalise on its successful handling of the pandemic to attract what Mitsotakis has called \u201ca larger piece of Europe\u2019s smaller tourism pie.\u201d \u201cGiven the importance of tourism and the catering sector for the country\u2019s economy, particularly during the second half of the year, our plan will have a three-pronged strategy covering employment, taxation and liquidity,\u201d the government spokesman, Stelios Petsas said on Monday. \u201cThis summer will not be like last year.\u201d In 2019 a record 33 million tourists visited Greece \u2013 the equivalent of three times its population. On Monday some 200 archaeological sites, closed to contain the spread of the virus, were re-opened to the public as Greece began preparing for the tourism season. Hi, this is Damien Gayle, taking charge on the live blog for the next eight or so hours, with the latest headlines and breaking stories from the coronavirus crisis around the world. As usual, I\u2019m keen to hear your comments, tips and suggestions for coverage. If you want to get in touch, please do drop me a line, either via email to damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or via Twitter direct message to @damiengayle. That\u2019s all from me today, I\u2019m now handing over to my colleague Damien Gayle - thanks for reading along. Global cases pass 4.8 million. There are 4,817,105 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins university data. The death toll stands at 318,775. US deaths, the highest worldwide, passed 90,000, and the number of cases climbed above 1.5m. Trump threatens to make WHO funding freeze \u2018permanent\u2019. Late on Monday evening, Donald Trump tweeted a letter addressed to World Health Organization director general saying that if the WHO \u201cdoes not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary [funding] freeze permanent and reconsider our membership of the organization\u201d. He also claimed the WHO had shown an \u201calarming lack of independence\u201d from China. In response, China accused Trump of trying to \u201csmear China\u201d and \u201cshirk responsibility and bargain over its international obligations to the WHO\u201d, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said. WHO chief promises review of coronavirus response. Before Trump\u2019s letter was released, the World Health Organization said an independent review of the global coronavirus response would begin as soon as possible. A resolution drafted by the European Union calling for an independent evaluation of the WHO\u2019s performance appeared to have won consensus backing among the WHO\u2019s 194 states. The motion is expected to be voted on on Tuesday. Trump says he is taking hydroxychloroquine. His doctor released a letter confirming that they had discussed the use of the drug and \u201cconcluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks\u201d. The US Food and Drug Administration has cautioned against use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for Covid-19 outside of a hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems. Brazil cases overtake UK to become third-highest worldwide. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Brazil stands at 255,368, according to Johns Hopkins University figures, making the country the third-worst affected in terms of cases. UK jobless claims soar by nearly 70% in April. The number of people claiming unemployment benefits increased in April by the most since records began, to reach almost 2.1 million. The Office for National Statistics said about 856,500 people signed up for universal credit and jobseeker\u2019s allowance benefits in April, driving up the overall UK claimant count by 69% in a single month. Russia coronavirus cases edge towards 300,000. Health officials reported 9,263 new infections, bringing the total to 299,941 - the fourth day in a row new cases fell below 10,000. The prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, who returned to work today after testing positive for the virus, said the country had stopped the growth of new infections but cautioned that the situation remains \u201cdifficult\u201d. Hong Kong blocks Tiananmen Square vigil with gathering ban. It has in effect banned the annual vigil by extending its physical distancing measures for another 14 days. The restrictions were due to expire this week but will now end no earlier than 5 June, the day after the event commemorating the Chinese army\u2019s brutal crackdown on protesters in 1989. Czech coronavirus cases show biggest jump in four weeks. The number of new cases climbed above 100 for the first time this month, partly due to an outbreak at a coal mine in Karvina. Chinese authorities have sealed off the north-eastern city of Shulan, home to about 700,000 people, after an outbreak of coronavirus, imposing measures similar to those used in Wuhan. All villages and residential compounds in the city were closed off, and only one person from each household allowed out for two hours every second day for essentials. The development came as Beijing signalled it could ease some border restrictions as it prepares for the start of its signature political event on Thursday, the Communist party\u2019s delayed annual congress, also known as the \u201ctwo sessions\u201d. In Shulan, residential compounds were restricted to just one entry and exit for emergency vehicles, and banned non-residents and vehicles from entering. If there are confirmed cases in a community residence, no one can enter or leave. Last week, the city was reclassified as high risk after a cluster of cases emerged connected to a woman with no known history of travel or exposure to the virus. In response, authorities ordered the temporary closure of public places, schools and public transport. With Portugal easing out of confinamento, Porto\u2019s residents are enjoying cafes once again, but miss the tourists more than they were expecting. Today\u2019s reopening is not as I\u2019d imagined it. Confined to home since mid-March, I\u2019d played over this moment many times. My first sip of machine-made espresso; a look over the newspaper; perhaps a cheeky pastel de nata. In my mind\u2019s eye, it would be a joyous moment, full of noise and merriment, but this relative quiet is disconcerting. On reflection, it\u2019s perhaps not so surprising. People are still wary. There\u2019s a nervous guardedness about the city, like we\u2019re enduring a collective first day back at school. I\u2019m surprised also by the emotions stirred up by the lack of tourist crowds. I thought their absence would be, well, liberating. A chance to seize back the city; a welcome break from hearing English spoken at every turn. But it\u2019s not like that. Tourists may be here today and gone tomorrow but, in a way that I\u2019d never appreciated before today, they\u2019re an intrinsic part of the city. An annoying one, at times, certainly. On my cycle into work, someone will almost always step into my path while staring down at a map or city tracking App. But today, nothing. A dispatch from Wilfredo Miranda Aburto in Managua: Shortly after midnight, five ambulances pull up at the German Nicaraguan hospital in Managua \u2013 lights flashing, but no sirens wailing. The gates quickly close behind them, but reopen after less than half an hour, and the convoy heads out again into the dark streets. All through the night, ambulances come and go from the hospital, which has become a key battleground in Nicaragua\u2019s fight against the coronavirus. And alongside them, there is a constant traffic of hearses and pickup trucks, driven by men in full protective gear, ferrying away victims of the pandemic. Unlike other Central American leaders, president Daniel Ortega has consistently downplayed the scale of the coronavirus threat, refusing to impose social distancing measures and encouraging mass gatherings of supporters. Officials claim the country has seen just a handful of deaths and insist that there is no community transmission. Now, however, the government appears to have gone one step further, and is actively attempting to cover up the scale of the disaster. Doctors and health workers say that deaths from Covid-19 are attributed to hypertension, diabetes or respiratory illnesses \u2013 and the victims are rushed away for burial in the dead of night. These \u201cexpress burials\u201d involve sealed caskets and bodies wrapped in plastic \u2013 as recommended by the country\u2019s health ministry in coronavirus deaths \u2013 but the dead are not included in the official Covid-19 death toll. Hong Kong has effectively banned an annual vigil for the Tiananmen Square massacre by extending its social distancing measures for another 14 days. After two consecutive days without local transmissions of Covid-19, the city state\u2019s authorities announced some restrictions would ease, but those limiting gatherings to a maximum of eight would be extended for another 14 days. The restrictions were due to expire this week but will now end no earlier than 5 June, the day after Hong Kong\u2019s annual vigil commemorating the Chinese army\u2019s brutal crackdown on protesters in 1989. The event has been held every year since 1990. It is the biggest and traditionally the only major commemoration of the incident allowed in China, sometimes drawing more than 100,000 people. Macau has traditionally held a photo exhibit on \u201ctank man\u201d, but last week authorities withdrew approval. At a press briefing on Tuesday afternoon, Hong Kong\u2019s secretary for food and health, Sophia Chan, said the city didn\u2019t have the right conditions yet to relax social-distancing laws and denied the extension was designed to stop the vigil. \u201cAll along we have extended bans by 14 days,\u201d she said. \u201cOur overall consideration is about public health and there is no other factor coming into account.\u201d The Russian prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, is back at work today after being diagnosed with Covid-19, the Kremlin has said. The Kremlin said president Vladimir Putin had signed a decree cancelling a temporary transfer of Mishustin\u2019s duties to the first deputy prime minister, Andrey Belousov, who had been Russia\u2019s acting prime minister since 30 April. Germany\u2019s national rail operator, Deutsche Bahn, is to double the number of train cleaners during journeys over the summer. So-called Unterwegsreiniger or \u2018in transit cleaners\u2019 will be increased to 500 in July, and to 600 in August, when summer travel is expected to be at its peak. This is in addition to its regular team of over 4,000 cleaners. Usually the cleaners concentrate on emptying rubbish bins and cleaning the toilets, but they will now have to pay particular attention to any contact surfaces such as door handles, vertical poles and grips, ticket machines and any surface such as tables or armrests on chairs, as well as toilets, where the virus might be present. On platforms, particular attention will be paid to the regular cleaning of ticket and snack machines, according to a report seen by the news network Funke Mediengruppe. DB is also planning to install free disinfectant dispensers at 180 railway stations to encourage individuals to take care of their own hygiene. While passengers are encouraged to bring their own face coverings with them, in compliance with the requirement for every passenger to wear one on public transport, DB has acquired 19m face masks, which it will sell on board. The United Kingdom\u2019s official Covid-19 death toll has reached nearly 43,000, according to a Reuters tally of data that includes suspected cases, and confirms the country\u2019s status as the worst-hit in Europe. New figures from the Office for National Statistics for England and Wales brought the death toll to at least 42,990, the tally showed, including previously published data from Scotland and Northern Ireland, as well recent hospital deaths data in England. The wearing of facemasks is to become compulsory in Spain, the government has announced. The decision follows a meeting yesterday between the government and representatives of Spain\u2019s 17 self-governing regions. \u201cMasks will be obligatory on public transport - as they already are - but also in enclosed spaces and on the streets if the minimum safety distance of two metres can\u2019t be observed,\u201d the government said in a statement. Orders officially stipulating their use will be made over the next few days. Last week, Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies, hinted that the use of masks could be expanded, saying: \u201cThe use of facemasks is very advisable and everyone who can should use them in public spaces.\u201d MPs are due to vote tomorrow on the government\u2019s request for a fifth and final extension of the state of emergency, which has been in place since 14 March. The prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, wants an extension to 27 June, arguing that it is \u201cthe only possible path\u201d to safeguarding the gains made in the fight against the virus. The government secured the current extension, which expires on 24 May, despite fierce opposition from the conservative People\u2019s party and the far-right Vox party. It faces an uphill battle in congress on Wednesday, and will have to rely on the support of smaller parties to get the extension approved. Only a simple majority - more yes votes than no votes - is needed. The government has also suggested that the extension need not last a whole month in areas that progress more quickly than others. Meanwhile, protests against S\u00e1nchez\u2019s Socialist-led coalition have continued in wealthy neighbourhoods of Madrid and have spread to some other cities. Although 70% of the country is now in the second phase of lockdown de-escalation, the Madrid region, the Barcelona metropolitan area and parts of Castilla y Le\u00f3n remain in the preliminary phase, meaning people cannot meet up in groups of up to 10, nor have a drink or a meal on the terraces outside cafes and bars. British politicians heaped fresh pressure on the government for its handling of the coronavirus outbreak today, calling its testing regime \u201cinadequate\u201d in the early stages. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, has been criticised for his initial response to the global pandemic, and has faced weeks of pressure about the availability of tests for the virus. The country has recorded 34,796 deaths \u2013 the second highest toll in the world behind the US \u2013 and 246,406 cases, according to the latest figures. But despite a recent surge in daily tests and the expansion of eligibility, MPs on a parliamentary committee said: \u201cTesting capacity has been inadequate for most of the pandemic so far.\u201d In a 19-page letter to Johnson, they said: Capacity was not increased early enough or boldly enough. Capacity drove strategy, rather than strategy driving capacity. The findings by the House of Commons science and technology committee come after six sessions of evidence involving scientists, public health experts and government advisers, which also looked at other countries\u2019 responses to the virus. On Sunday, Britain carried out 100,678 tests for coronavirus, but only 1,215 tests were performed on 10 March \u2013 two weeks before a nationwide lockdown was ordered as cases spiked. MPs said there was \u201cconsensus \u2026 that testing capacity has been too low\u201d. Reacting to the report, the work and pensions minister, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, told the BBC: \u201cThe capacity is there.\u201d Beijing has accused Donald Trump of smearing China and shirking American responsibilities to the World Health Organization, after the US president threatened to pull out of the UN health body. The American leader has been locked in a bitter war of words with Beijing, alleging it covered up the initial outbreak in central China late last year before the disease spread globally. Trump on Monday called the WHO a \u201cpuppet of China\u201d before tweeting a letter he had sent to the organisation\u2019s chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, threatening to make permanent a temporary freeze on funding from the US. China in response accused Trump of trying to \u201csmear China\u201d and \u201cshirk responsibility and bargain over its international obligations to the WHO\u201d, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a regular press briefing Tuesday. Zhao said: The US leader\u2019s open letter you mentioned is full of hints, \u2018perhaps\u2019, and \u2018maybes\u2019, and tries to use specious methods to mislead the public, and achieve the goals of smearing China\u2019s anti-virus efforts, and shirk responsibility for the United States\u2019 own insufficient response. The US tries to use China as an issue to shirk responsibility and bargain over its international obligations to the WHO. This is a miscalculation and the US has picked the wrong target. Zhao added the US was attempting to deflect from its own \u201cinsufficient prevention and control\u201d against the virus. With more fatalities and cases in the United States than any other country by far, Trump has blamed the WHO for not doing enough to combat its initial spread. \u201cThe only way forward for the World Health Organization is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China,\u201d Trump\u2019s letter read. A prolonged global slump and surge in bankruptcies arising from the coronavirus pandemic are the foremost concerns for companies surveyed in a World Economic Forum report out today. Recessions on a scale not seen since the 1930s Great Depression demand more action from governments to ensure a timely recovery and to put growth on a healthier path, the report also said. The survey of 347 company risk managers looked at the biggest concerns for the next 18 months, after the pandemic shuttered large swathes of production and forced massive rescue packages by governments around the world. They identified the most likely fallout as an extended downturn, a jump in company failures allied, along with high youth unemployment. The debt accrued in the rescue packages could depress government and hold back growth for years, and also stymie efforts to combat climate change, the report said. The crisis has \u201crevealed the inadequacies of the past\u201d, Saadia Zahidi, managing director of the World Economic Forum, said. We now have a unique opportunity to use this crisis to do things differently and build back better economies that are more sustainable, resilient and inclusive. A second wave of Covid-19 was another concern identified in Tuesday\u2019s report, along with the dangers of cyberattacks and data fraud as much corporate activity shifts online. A consortium of British companies said they were ramping up ventilator production to make sure there were enough available should there be a second spike in the coronavirus outbreak. Dick Elsy, chairman of VentilatorChallengeUK - a consortium of industrial, technology and engineering businesses - said: We are continuing to scale up our production capabilities to make sure that there is always a ventilator available when a patient needs it should a second wave strike the UK. A healthcare worker has written this incredibly moving first-hand piece about caring for a Covid-19 patient on a ventilator in hospital. Why was she so special to me? Despite having done this job for a few years, sometimes it is impossible to predict which patients will be the ones you take home with you, the ones you think about as you cry yourself to sleep. Maybe it\u2019s because she was one of us \u2013 a healthcare worker. I know this could happen to me or any of my loving colleagues. I am aware of this risk every time I get into my car to come to work, every time I put on my personal protective equipment (PPE) \u2013 I wonder, \u201cWill this mask protect me this time?\u201d Or maybe it\u2019s because she is a mother, whose family cannot be there for her, to sit by her; to cheer her on with soft words of encouragement and love, to hold her hand, to cry over. Is this what would happen if my mother became ill right now? Who would hold her hand? The number of coronavirus cases in Russia has risen to nearly 300,000, with authorities registering more than 9,000 new infections after saying the virus situation had stabilised. Health officials reported 9,263 new infections in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to 299,941, the second highest in the world after the United States. The prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, who along with several other senior officials has tested positive for the virus, said on Monday the country had stopped the growth of new infections but cautioned that the situation remains \u201cdifficult\u201d. Tuesday\u2019s tally saw new cases fall below 10,000 for the fourth day in a row, after Monday\u2019s count saw new infections under 9,000 for the first time since the beginning of May. There were 115 new coronavirus fatalities since the last update on Monday, bringing Russia\u2019s total to 2,837. Critics have cast doubt on Russia\u2019s low official mortality rate, accusing authorities of under-reporting in order to play down the scale of the crisis. Russian health officials say one of the reasons the count is lower than in the United States and parts of western Europe is that only deaths directly caused by the virus are being included. Authorities also say that since the virus came later to Russia, there was more time to prepare hospital beds and launch wide-scale testing to slow the spread. British unemployment jumped in the first quarter on the back of coronavirus, despite a lockdown being imposed only near the end of the period, official data has shown. The total number of unemployed people rose 50,000 to 1.3 million in three months to March from a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said. The ONS also revealed that jobless claims, made under the Universal Credit welfare support system, surged 69% or 856,000 to 2.1 million in April from March. Britain had imposed a lockdown on 23 March in a bid to halt the spread of the coronavirus, and launched a so-called furlough jobs retention scheme under which the government stepped in to back up employee wages. Jonathan Athow, ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics, said: While only covering the first weeks of restrictions, our figures show Covid-19 is having a major impact on the labour market. In March employment held up well, as furloughed workers still count as employed, but hours worked fell sharply in late March, especially in sectors such as hospitality and construction. The ONS also signalled in an early estimate that the number of paid employees in April fell by 1.6% compared to March. \u201cThrough April... there were signs of falling employment as real-time tax data show the number of employees on companies\u2019 payrolls fell noticeably, and vacancies were sharply down too, with hospitality again falling steepest,\u201d added Athow. The finance minister, Rishi Sunak, last week extended the furlough policy by four months until the end of October. The government scheme is supporting 7.5m jobs, ensuring employees receive 80% of their monthly pay up to \u00a32,500 ($3,100, \u20ac2,800).

Today\u2019s round up features the Kaiser Chiefs, Saturday Night Live, and king pairs - the greatest indignity in cricket. Austria insists that the European Union\u2019s emergency aid for coronavirus-hit member states should be based on repayable loans not grants, Austrian daily Die Presse reports. The European Union\u2019s biggest powers, Germany and France, proposed a \u20ac500bn ($546bn) fund on Monday that would offer non-repayable grants to EU regions and sectors hit hardest by the pandemic, with the cash borrowed by the bloc as a whole rather than by individual member states. The plan requires the consent of all EU members. \u201cWe will continue to show solidarity and support countries most affected by the corona crisis, but this must be done through loans and not through grants,\u201d the paper quoted a chancellery statement as saying. Authorities in eastern India and Bangladesh were relocating tens of thousands of villagers away from the coastline on Tuesday ahead of a super cyclone that is expected to inflict large-scale damage as both countries struggle to contain the coronavirus. Coronavirus quarantine shelters in India were being converted to cyclone shelters, leaving authorities to manage social distancing to try and prevent the spread of coronavirus. In neighbouring Bangladesh, officials were moving people to higher ground and urged them to maintain social distance and wear masks as the country has recorded over 20,995 coronavirus cases and 314 deaths so far. India\u2019s weather office said the super cyclone Amphan had reached winds of up to 240 kmh (145 mph) with gusts of around 265 kph (165 mph) over the Bay of Bengal on Monday night and was expected to make a landfall on Wednesday. Such wind speeds, according to weather officials, could make Amphan one of the biggest storms to hit Indian in about a decade. The cyclone comes as India eased the world\u2019s biggest lockdown imposed in April to contain the coronavirus which has infected more than 100,000 people in the country and killed 3,163. The states of Odisha and West Bengal were moving families to more than 1,000 shelters in government offices and educational centres, and were hastily converting coronavirus quarantine centres into cyclone shelters. SG Rai, an official in federal disaster management office, told Reuters: We have just about six hours left to evacuate people from their homes and we also have to maintain social distancing norms \u2026 the cyclone could wash away thousands of huts and standing crop. In neighbouring Bangladesh, officials intensified rescue operations as the cyclone could trigger the worst storm in about 15 years along the country\u2019s low-lying coast. \u201cWe have prepared 12,000 cyclone centres, where more than five million people can take shelter. We have also taken necessary steps so that people can maintain distance and wear masks,\u201d said Enamur Rahman, the junior minister for disaster management and relief in the capital, Dhaka. The number of new coronavirus cases in the Czech Republic showed its biggest daily rise in four weeks and climbed above 100 for the first time this month. The health ministry said 111 new cases had been recorded on Monday, bringing the total in the central European country to 8,586. It reported no new deaths, leaving the toll at 297. The rise is partly due to an outbreak reported by state-owned coal miner OKD at its Darkov mine near the eastern town of Karvina, close to the Polish border, Czech Radio reported. The radio said 53 cases had been confirmed among 860 miners tested by Monday evening. The Czech Republic, like others in central Europe, closed schools, shops and borders when the outbreak started in March and has seen a increase in the number of people recovering. Authorities have been reopening the economy in recent weeks by reopening most shops along with cinemas, theatres and outdoor dining places. There are plans to let restaurants open indoor areas next week. The government is also planning to ease travel to and from countries deemed safe from risks of coronavirus from 8 June, the health minister, Adam Vojt\u011bch, said on Monday. Farmers in China are being offered cash to stop breeding exotic animals as pressure grows to crack down on the illegal wildlife trade that has been blamed for the coronavirus outbreak. Authorities have for the first time pledged to buy out breeders in an attempt to curb the practice, animal rights activists say. China has in recent months banned the sale of wild animals for food, citing the risk of diseases spreading to humans, but the trade remains legal for other purposes including research and traditional medicine. The deadly coronavirus \u2013 first reported in the central Chinese city of Wuhan \u2013 is widely believed to have passed from bats to people before spreading worldwide. Two central provinces have outlined details of a buyout programme to help farmers transition to alternative livelihoods. Hunan on Friday set out a compensation scheme to persuade breeders to rear other livestock, or produce tea and herbal medicines. Authorities are offering to pay 120 yuan ($16) per kilogram of cobra, king rattlesnake or rat snake, while a kilogram of bamboo rat will fetch 75 yuan. A civet cat \u2013 the animal believed to have carried Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) to humans in another coronavirus outbreak nearly two decades ago \u2013 is worth 600 yuan. Neighbouring Jiangxi province has also released documents on plans to help farmers dispose of animals and financial aid. Both Jiangxi and Hunan border Hubei, the province where the coronavirus first emerged in December. Animal rights group Humane Society International (HSI) said Hunan and Jiangxi are \u201cmajor wildlife breeding provinces\u201d, with Jiangxi seeing a rapid expansion of the trade over the last decade. Revenues from breeding reached 10bn yuan in 2018, it said. HSI China policy specialist Peter Li told AFP that similar plans should be rolled out across the country. But he cautioned that Hunan\u2019s proposals leave room for farmers to continue breeding exotic creatures as long as the animals are not sent to food markets. The province\u2019s plan also does not include many wild animals bred for fur, traditional Chinese medicine or entertainment. Li said Chinese authorities are nevertheless moving in the right direction. In the past 20 years, a lot of people have been telling the Chinese government to buy out certain wildlife breeding operations, for example bear farming. This is the first time that the Chinese government actually decided to do it, which opens a precedent... (for when) other production needs to be phased out. A photograph of a migrant labourer, his face contorted with anguish as he sits on the roadside in Delhi speaking to his wife about their sick baby boy, has come to symbolise the ordeal of India\u2019s daily wage workers; penniless, and unable to get home to their families because of the lockdown. Rampukar Pandit, a construction worker in the Indian capital, had heard that his 11-month-old son was seriously unwell. With no public transport to reach his home in Begusarai in Bihar, 1,200 km (745 miles) away, he started walking. He reached Nizamuddin Bridge where, exhausted and hungry, he could go no further. Atul Yadav, a photographer with the Press Trust of India, was heading home from work on 11 May when he saw Pandit, 38, sobbing his heart out. Pandit refused his offer of biscuits and water, saying food would \u201cchoke\u201d him because he couldn\u2019t eat while his son was unwell. \u201cHe was so emotional I had to stop shooting. He had been sitting on the road for three days,\u201d said Yadav. \u2018We labourers don\u2019t belong to any country,\u201d Pandit told Yadav. \u201cAll I want is to go home and see my son.\u201d Later that evening, he reached a nearby police station. He was still waiting for the police to help when a group of well-wishers, having seen Yadav\u2019s tweet about Pandit, arrived in the area and managed to find him at the station. By now, he was full of grief. His wife, Bimal Devi, had just called to say their son had died. One of the well-wishers, a woman, paid for and arranged for his train ticket home. \u201cHe wept with gratitude at strangers helping him,\u201d said Yadav. Lockdowns around the world have dramatically reduced the number of street protests and political demonstrations. Photographs taken in Bangkok in May contrast with images from 10 years ago when the capital was in the throes of anti-government protests and occupations which culminated in a military crackdown that cost dozens of lives. Tanzania\u2019s divisive president, John Magufuli, has said the economy is \u201cmore important than the threat posed by coronavirus\u201d, adding that he wants to reopen the country for tourism despite warnings that Africa could face the next wave of the disease. The comments by Magufuli, who has modelled his populist response on that of Donald Trump and Brazil\u2019s Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 in repeatedly denying the risk of the pandemic to his country \u2013 come amid mounting alarm among Tanzania\u2019s neighbours over his approach. So far there have been 21 officially recorded Covid-19 deaths in Tanzania. Magufuli made the remarks on Sunday during a mass in his hometown of Chato, where he said he intended to keep Tanzania\u2019s borders open with its eight neighbours. The remarks follow a series of statements in recent weeks minimising the threat of coronavirus. In a video, the Tanzanian president once again touted natural remedies for coronavirus, saying these had helped his son. In a video that went viral, he said: My own son, after contracting the virus, closed himself in his room, took a lemon and ginger solution before getting well and is even able to do push-ups. We have had a number of viral diseases, including Aids and measles. Our economy must come first. It must not sleep. If we allow our economy to sleep, we will not receive salaries \u2026 Life must go on. As I am talking here, some airline operators are fully booked \u2013 until August \u2013 with tourists who want to visit Tanzania. The president\u2019s latest comments follow several bizarre interventions \u2013 including his order that animals and fruit be tested for the virus as a demonstration of \u201cfalse positives\u201d. He has also been accused by health professionals of covering up the true number of infections. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany rose by 513 to 175,210, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases shows, with new infections accelerating after decelerating the previous four days. The reported death toll rose by 72 to 8,007, the tally showed. The US will announce on Tuesday that it has signed one of its largest ever contracts to boost pharmaceutical manufacturing in the country. The $354m, four-year contract with a company in Virginia is to make generic medicines and pharmaceutical ingredients needed to treat Covid-19 that are currently largely imported from abroad, the New York Times has reported. The contract was awarded to Phlow Corp, a generic drugmaker that makes medicines overseas, mostly in India and China, according to the NYT. Trump\u2019s trade adviser, Peter Navarro, called this \u201ca historic turning point in America\u2019s efforts to onshore its pharmaceutical production and supply chains\u201d. The US health secretary, Alex Azar, called the initiative \u201ca significant step to rebuild our domestic ability to protect ourselves from health threats\u201d, in a statement the administration plans to make public on Tuesday morning, according to the NYT. The NYT added that the contract may be extended for a total of $812m over 10 years, making it one of the largest awards in the authority\u2019s history. Hello everyone, this is Jessica Murray, I\u2019ll be running the global blog for the next few hours, following the latest coronavirus developments across the world. As always, please do feel free to get in touch if you would like to share your own experiences or thoughts. Email: jessica.murray@theguardian.com Twitter: @journojess_ I\u2019ll do my best to respond to as many as I can! Phew. Between Trump and, well, Trump, it\u2019s been quite a day so far. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan. My colleague Jessica Murray is joining you now for the next few hours. Thanks as always for following along. Global cases pass 4.8 million. There are 4,805,005 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The death toll stands at 318,534. US deaths, the highest worldwide, passed 90,000, and the number of cases climbed above 1.5m, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Trump threatens to make WHO funding freeze \u2018permanent\u2019. Late on Monday evening, Donald Trump tweeted a letter addressed to World Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus saying that if the WHO \u201cdoes not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the World Health Organization permanent and reconsider our membership of the organization\u201d. The letter does not detail what the improvements are. WHO chief promises review of coronavirus response. Before Trump\u2019s letter was released, the World Health Organization said on Monday that an independent review of the global coronavirus response would begin as soon as possible . A resolution drafted by the European Union calling for an independent evaluation of the WHO\u2019s performance appeared to have won consensus backing among the WHO\u2019s 194 states. The motion is expected to be voted on on Tuesday. Trump says he is taking hydroxychloroquine. After the US president told reporters at the White House that he has been taking hydroxychloroquine, his doctor released a letter confirming that they had discussed the use of the drug and \u201cconcluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks\u201d. A White House spokesperson told the New York Times that Trump was prescribed the drug and is taking it. The US Food and Drug Administration has cautioned against use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for Covid-19 outside of a hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems. Brazil cases overtake UK to become third-highest worldwide. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Brazil stands at 255,368, according to Johns Hopkins University figures, making the country the third-worst affected in terms of cases.There are 16,792 officially confirmed deaths in Brazil, which is lower than the UK, Italy, Spain and France. IMF chief says full economic recovery unlikely in 2021. The global economy will take much longer to recover fully from the shock caused by the new coronavirus than initially expected, the head of the International Monetary Fund said, and she stressed the danger of protectionism. Managing director Kristalina Georgieva said the IMF was likely to revise downward its forecast for a 3% contraction in GDP in 2020, but gave no details. That would likely also trigger changes in the fund\u2019s forecast of a partial recovery of 5.8% in 2021. Deaths in Australia reach 100. The death toll in Australia has reached 100, following the death of a 93-year-old woman who had been diagnosed with Covid-19.The woman had been a resident at Newmarch House, the care home in western Sydney that has been the site of a cluster of cases. India cases pass 100,000. The number of confirmed cases in India has passed 100,000, standing at 100,328 according to Johns Hopkins University figures.The country has recorded 3,156 deaths. The government this week extended a nationwide lockdown to the end of May, but with significantly reduced restrictions, including allowing markets and standalone shops can reopen from Monday, with social distancing measures. Inter and intra-state road travel resumed with the agreement of states, but air travel, both domestic and international is still banned. Government wage subsidies for disabled and vulnerable workers could be drastically scaled back from August under Treasury plans to wind down its Covid-19 furlough scheme, employers\u2019 groups have warned. Charities and social enterprise employers have been told by the government that its plan to bring the coronavirus job retention scheme to an eventual close this autumn does not currently include an exemption for vulnerable workers. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, announced last week that the furlough scheme \u2013 under which the government pays 80% of staff wages up to \u00a32,500 a month \u2013 would be extended until October. However, state support will be scaled back from August, with employers expected to contribute to maintain a wage packet of at least 80% for furloughed workers. Although a final decision has yet to be taken, the chancellor is believed to favour a universal approach to scaling back the scheme for all employers, without tailoring it to reflect a gradual return to work for firms and workers. Italy has started easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions and some shops, restaurants and museums have reopened for the first time in two months. Physical distancing remains but people in Rome were able to enjoy a drink or visit mass. In Venice, stores and restaurants reopened, though without the usual crowds of tourists around: Children in Australia\u2019s most populated state will return to school full-time next week, a major step towards normalising life amid the coronavirus pandemic, as the nation on Tuesday recorded its 100th fatality from the disease. The directive from New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian to reopen schools full-time lifts childcare responsibilities for the parents and carers of around 800,000 children in public schools as Australia seeks to stem a surge in unemployment and restart the economy. The decision caught the state\u2019s teachers union by surprise, with Teachers Federation President Angelo Gavrielatos saying it \u201ccaused a lot of concern, frustration and anger among teachers and principals.\u201d \u201cThey turned themselves inside out, not once, not twice, but repeatedly, trying to come to terms with this crisis and fulfilling their professional and social and moral responsibilities,\u201d Gavrielatos told Australian Broadcasting Corp television. Australia\u2019s states and territories are beginning to allow more public activity under a three-step federal government plan to end two months of shutdowns that officials have credited with keeping the country\u2019s exposure to the pandemic relatively low. Thailand on Tuesday confirmed two new coronavirus cases and no additional deaths, bringing its total to 3,033 infections, a senior official said. The two new cases were in the south in a province bordering Malaysia, Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman for the government\u2019s Centre for Covid-19 Situation Administration, said at a daily briefing. There have been 56 deaths since the outbreak began in January and 2,857 patients have recovered. Global report: Trump threatens to pull out of WHO over \u2018failed response\u2019 to pandemic The Guardian\u2019s Julian Borger and Alison Rourke report: Donald Trump has threatened to cut funding to the World Health Organization permanently and even pull the US out of the global body altogether unless it makes \u201cmajor substantive improvements\u201d which the president did not explain. On Monday night, the president published the letter, citing a timeline of the organisation\u2019s alleged failings, which was based on a selective version of the pandemic, highlighting where the WHO had publicised Chinese findings on the nature of the disease, but ignoring or glossing over clear warnings from the organisation about the dangers of the contagion. The move came hours after the US president told reporters he had been taking hydroxychloroquine for a couple of weeks, despite warnings from his administration that it is dangerous. \u201cI think it\u2019s good, I heard a lot of good stories \u2026 I take a pill every day,\u201d he said. The letter is the latest salvo in a war of words between Trump and the WHO that has unfolded in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The US president, who is under pressure at home over his response to the pandemic, temporarily froze funding to the WHO in April, accusing the global body of \u201cseverely mismanaging and covering up\u201d the threat. At the time, critics were stunned at the move to cut money from a critical UN agency during a global pandemic. Before Trump\u2019s letter, Tedros acknowledged there had been shortcomings and told the virtual assembly he welcomed calls for a review. \u201cI will initiate an independent evaluation at the earliest appropriate moment to review experience gained and lessons learned, and to make recommendations to improve national and global pandemic preparedness and response,\u201d he said. \u201cBut one thing is abundantly clear. The world must never be the same.\u201d The number of confirmed cases in India has passed 100,000, currently standing at 100,328 according to Johns Hopkins University figures. The country has recorded 3,156 deaths. The government this week extended a nationwide lockdown to the end of May, but with significantly reduced restrictions. Markets and standalone shops can reopen from Monday, with social distancing measures, but malls will remain closed. Inter and intra-state road travel can resume with the agreement of states, but air travel, both domestic and international is still banned. Metro rail services, cinemas and gyms remain closed. Restaurants can open for home delivery, but schools and places of worship will remain closed. Schools and places of worship remain closed, domestic and international air travel will not be allowed and a 7pm-7am curfew on movement stays in place. The government has also advised people over 65, those with co-morbidities, pregnant women, and children below the age of 10, should stay at home. States will have the power to determine red, orange and green zones, as well as so-called containment zones, where large outbreaks or clusters happen, and different rules will apply in each zone. The country has been under lockdown since 25 March. Here are the main developments from the last few hours: Global cases pass 4.8 million. There are 4,805,005 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The death toll stands at 318,534. WHO chief promises review of coronavirus response. The World Health Organization said on Monday an independent review of the global coronavirus response would begin as soon as possible . A resolution drafted by the European Union calling for an independent evaluation of the WHO\u2019s performance appeared to have won consensus backing among the WHO\u2019s 194 states, but has not yet passed. It is expected to pass on Tuesday. Trump says he is taking hydroxychloroquine. The president said he has been taking hydroxychloroquine, his doctor released a letter confirming that they had discussed the use of the drug and \u201cconcluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks.\u201d A White House spokesperson told the New York Times that Trump was prescribed the drug and is taking it. The US Food and Drug Administration cautions against use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for Covid-19 outside of a hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems. Trump warns WHO must make \u2018major improvements\u2019 or funding freeze to be \u2018permanent\u2019. Late on Monday evening, US President Donald Trump released a letter addressed to World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The letter states that if the WHO \u201cdoes not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the World Health Organization permanent and reconsider our membership of the organization.\u201d The letter states that the Trump administration\u2019s review into the WHO\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak \u201cconfirmed many of the serious concerns I raised...and identified others that the World Health Organization should have addressed, especially the World Health Organization\u2019s alarming lack of independence from the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201d US deaths pass 90,000. The coronavirus death told in the US passed 90,000 Monday, and the number of cases climbed above 1.5m, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Brazil cases overtake UK to become third-highest worldwide. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Brazil stands at 255,368, according to Johns Hopkins University figures, making the country the third-worst affected in terms of cases.There are 16,792 officially confirmed deaths in Brazil, which is lower than the UK, Italy, Spain and France.

Inter and intra-state road travel resumed with the agreement of states, but air travel, both domestic and international is still banned. Some areas of New York City have seen death rates nearly 15 times higher than others, according to data released by New York City\u2019s health department, showing the disproportionate toll taken on poorer communities. The highest death rate was seen on the edge of Brooklyn in a neighbourhood dominated by a large subsidised-housing development called Starrett City. Qatar will close all shops and halt all commercial activities, from 19 to 30 May, state news agency QNA has reported, citing a decision by Qatar\u2019s cabinet. The closure excludes pharmacies, food supply stores and food deliveries. Italy registers lowest deaths since March as bars, restaurants, shops, hairdressers, museums and churches reopen. Italy registered 99 deaths and 451 infections on Monday. There is also a significant fall in new infections in Lombardy, the region worst affected by the virus, from 326 on Sunday to 175 on Monday. Australia had been one of the most vocal and early advocates of an independent international investigation into the origins and handling of Covid-19. Australia\u2019s foreign minister, Marise Payne, had originally called for \u201can independent review mechanism\u201d and argued it could not be overseen by the WHO because \u201cthat strikes me as somewhat poacher and gamekeeper\u201d. Earlier today, the Chinese embassy in Canberra declared it is \u201cnothing but a joke\u201d for Australia to claim vindication over the growing global support for an international review into the handling of Covid-19. The comments came as trade tensions intensify over China\u2019s decision to hit Australian barley imports with tariffs of more than 80% \u2013 a move that Australia will weigh up challenging through the World Trade Organization. A motion calling for an independent evaluation of the global response to the pandemic, drafted by the European Union, is expected to pass the World Health Assembly on Tuesday. The motion \u2013 co-sponsored by about 120 countries \u2013 calls on the WHO\u2019s director general to initiate a \u201cstepwise process of impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation\u201d to review the lessons learned from the international health response to Covid-19. This process should be launched \u201cat the earliest appropriate moment\u201d and in consultation with WHO member states. The wording of the EU-drafted motion which has wide support at the World Health Assembly allows for the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, to be the one to initiate \u201ca stepwise process of impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation\u201d at a future date. While the exact forms of the review are not yet settled, the motion allows for the possibility of \u201cusing existing mechanisms, as appropriate\u201d. That could include a role for the WHO\u2019s Independent Oversight Advisory Committee - which Tedros specifically mentioned in his speech to the World Health Assembly yesterday. Tedros said he would initiate an independent evaluation at the earliest appropriate moment so the world could learn the lessons from the pandemic. \u201cTo be truly comprehensive, such an evaluation must encompass the entirety of the response by all actors, in good faith.\u201d Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Some claims in the letter are false, for example that Taiwan had warned about human-to-human transmission of the disease on 31 December. On that date Taiwan sent a letter to the WHO noting the reported spate of unexplained pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, and that the patients were in isolation, and asking for further details. As the pandemic has worsened in the US, even as other countries have begun a tentative recovery Trump has sought to blame China and the WHO. He has suspended US funding to the organisation, pointing to the disparity between US and much smaller Chinese contributions and accusing Tedros and his team of being China-centric. Trump ended the letter with an ultimatum calling for \u201c major substantive improvements\u201d by the WHO. He did not make clear what \u201csubstantive improvements\u201d the US wanted to see. The US health and human services department has circulated a discussion document with other member states that was largely seen as moderate, calling for the WHO\u2019s powers of inspection to be strengthened for example. Similar proposals were included in a resolution that appeared to have majority support at Monday\u2019s World Health Assembly. However, some US officials have suggested more drastic measures, like making the WHO emergency programme semi-autonomous from the main organisation. That would be seen as unpalatable by many member states. Here is that concluding paragraph, where Trump threatens to \u201cpermanently\u201d end the US\u2019s funding to the WHO and to end its membership: It is clear the repeated missteps by you and your organization in responding to the pandemic have been extremely costly for the world. The only way forward for the World Health Organization is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China. My Administration has already started discussions with you on how to reform the organization. But action is needed quickly. We do not have time to waste. That is why it is my duty, as President of the United States, to inform you that, if the World Health Organization does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the World Health Organization permanent and reconsider our membership in the organization. I cannot allow American taxpayer dollars to continue to finance an organization that, in its present state, is so clearly not serving America\u2019s interests. You can read the letter for yourself here: The letter from the US president, images of which were tweeted by Trump late on Monday night in the US, also takes personal issue with the leadership of World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus: Perhaps worse than all these failings is that we know that the World Health Organization could have done so much better. Just a few years ago, under the direction of a different Director-General, the World Health Organization showed the world how much it has to offer. In 2003, in response to the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China, Director-General Harlem Brundtland boldly declared the World Health Organization\u2019s first emergency travel advisory in 55 years, recommending against travel to and from the disease epicenter in southern China. She also did not hesitate to criticize China for endangering global health by attempting to cover up the outbreak through its usual playbook of arresting whistleblowers and censoring media. Many lives could have been saved had you followed Dr. Brundtland\u2019s example. The focus of this letter is undoubtedly not the World Health Organization\u2019s handling of the pandemic in general, but what Trump alleges is its \u201calarming lack of independence from the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201d While many of the claims may be factually accurate, Trump is arguably seeking to scapegoat China and the WHO in order to distract from his own lack of leadership. The US is the worst-affected country globally \u2013 and by a long shot. It has over 1.5 million cases of the virus, and more than 90,000 people have died. The five countries with the next highest cases have each confirmed fewer than 300,000, according to Johns Hopkins figures. Even with underreporting, there is a significant gap. The UK has the next highest deaths, with 34,876. Trump writes in the letter: Throughout this crisis, the World Health Organization has been curiously insistent on praising China for its alleged \u201ctransparency.\u201d You have consistently joined in these tributes, notwithstanding that China has been anything but transparent. In early January, for example, China ordered samples of the virus to be destroyed, depriving the world of critical information. Even now, China continues to undermine the International Health Regulations by refusing to share accurate and timely data, viral samples and isolates, and by withholding vital information about the virus and its origins. And, to this day, China continues to deny international access to their scientists and relevant facilities, all while casting blame widely and recklessly and censoring its own experts. I will continue to post key extracts from the letter, but in the meantime it is worth returning to this piece by my colleague Julian Borger from 9 April: Trump scapegoating of WHO obscures its key role in tackling pandemic. Trump claimed that his ban \u201cshut down\u201d intercontinental transmission of the virus, but an ABC television investigation found that there were 3,200 flights from China to the US in the critical period between December and March. By the time Trump\u2019s ban was announced, it was far too late to stop the virus entering the US. It was already rampant in US communities, but Trump continued to tell Americans that the outbreak would not affect them, and wholesale US testing failed to get off the ground for another six weeks. Trump writes in the letter to World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus: On March 3, 2020, the World Health Organization cited official Chinese data to downplay the very serious risk of asymptomatic spread, telling the world that \u201cCOVID-19 does not transmit as efficiently as influenza\u201d and that unlike influenza this disease was not primarily driven by \u201cpeople who are infected but not yet sick.\u201d China\u2019s evidence, the World Health Organization told the world, \u201cshowed that only one percent of reported cases do not have symptoms, and most of those cases develop symptoms within two days.\u201d Many experts, however, citing data from Japan, South Korea, and elsewhere, vigorously questioned these assertions. It is now clear that China\u2019s assertions, repeated to the world by the World Health Organization, were wildly inaccurate. The remarks Trump is referring to state: Both COVID-19 and influenza cause respiratory disease and spread the same way, via small droplets of fluid from the nose and mouth of someone who is sick. However, there are some important differences between COVID-19 and influenza. First, COVID-19 does not transmit as efficiently as influenza, from the data we have so far. With influenza, people who are infected but not yet sick are major drivers of transmission, which does not appear to be the case for COVID-19. On 13 March the Guardian\u2019s science editor Ian Sample reported: Many coronavirus infections may be spread by people who have recently caught the virus and have not yet begun to show symptoms, scientists have found. An analysis of infections in Singapore and Tianjin in China revealed that two-thirds and three-quarters of people respectively appear to have caught it from others who were incubating the virus but still symptom-free. The finding has dismayed infectious disease researchers as it means that isolating people once they start to feel ill will be far less effective at slowing the pandemic than had been hoped. The letter also states that \u201cthe World Health Organization has repeatedly made claims about the coronavirus that were either grossly inaccurate or misleading.\u201d He has referred to the World Health Organizations\u2019 \u201cpolitical gamesmanship\u201d as \u201cdeadly\u201d, writing in the letter that: Your political gamesmanship on this issue was deadly, as other governments, relying on your comments, delayed imposing life-saving restrictions on travel to and from China. The wording is extremely strong. Trump also again praises his decision to close borders and takes issue with the lack of praise from the WHO: You also strongly praised China\u2019s strict domestic travel restrictions, but were inexplicably against my closing of the United States border, or the ban, with respect to people coming from China. I put the ban in place regardless of your wishes. Among the claims the letter alleges were \u201cgrossly innacurate or misleading\u201d are: On January 14, 2020, the World Health Organization gratuitously reaffirmed China\u2019s now-debunked claim that the coronavirus could not be transmitted between humans, stating: \u201cPreliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) identified in Wuhan, China.\u201d This assertion was in direct conflict with censored reports from Wuhan. On January 21, 2020, President Xi Jinping of China reportedly pressured you not to declare the coronavirus outbreak an emergency. You gave in to this pressure the next day and told the world that the coronavirus did not pose a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Just over one week later, on January 30, 2020, overwhelming evidence to the contrary forced you to reverse course. On January 28, 2020, after meeting with President Xi in Beijing, you praised the Chinese government for its \u201ctransparency\u201d with respect to the coronavirus, announcing that China had set a \u201cnew standard for outbreak control\u201d and \u201cbought the world time.\u201d You did not mention that China had, by then, silenced or punished several doctors for speaking out about the virus and restricted Chinese institutions from publishing information about it. Further claims made in the US president\u2019s letter include: According to Dr. Zhang Yongzhen of the Shanghai Public Health Clinic Center, he told Chinese authorities on January 5, 2020, that he had sequenced the genome of the virus. ... The World Health Organization has been conspicuously silent both with respect to the closure of to the closure of Dr. Zhang\u2019s lab and his assertion that he had notified Chinese authorities of his breakthrough six days earlier. Here is an earlier Guardian blog post on that incident: The Chinese laboratory that first sequenced and shared the coronavirus genome publicly has been closed down by the authorities for \u201crectification\u201d, the South China Morning Post reports. On 12 January, a day after the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre\u2019s laboratory shared the information online \u2013 a move that helped companies to devise new diagnostic kits for the virulent respiratory illness \u2013 officials from the Shanghai Health Commission ordered it to close. The PHCC lab is a level-three biosafety facility that had only last month passed its annual inspections. It had obtained the necessary credentials and permissions to research the coronavirus, SCMP reported. It seems that scientists at the laboratory acted unilaterally in releasing the virus because they thought authorities were taking too long to act. The SCMP said the team at the lab, led by Prof Zhang Yongzhen, had isolated and finished the genome sequence of the then-unknown virus on 5 January and reported its findings to the China\u2019s national health commission the same day. Among the claims made in US President Donald Trump\u2019s letter to the head of the WHO are that his administration\u2019s review \u201cof the organization\u2019s failed response to the COV1D-19 outbreak\u201d found that the WHO: \u201cConsistently ignored credible reports of the virus spreading in Wuhan in early December 2019 or even earlier, including reports from the Lancet medical journal.\u201d \u201cFailed to independently investigate credible reports that conflicted directly with the Chinese government\u2019s official accounts, even those that came from sources within Wuhan itself.\u201d \u201cKnew that there was a \u2018major public health\u2019 concern in Wuhan\u201d, he writes, \u201cno later than December 30, 2019\u201d The letter tweeted out by US President Donald Trump and addressed to World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus states that his review into the WHO\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak \u201cconfirmed many of the serious concerns I raised...and identified others that the World Health Organization should have addressed, especially the World Health Organization\u2019s alarming lack of independence from the People\u2019s Republic of China.\u201d US President Donald Trump has tweeted out a letter addressed to World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The letter states that if the WHO \u201cdoes not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the World Health Organization permanent and reconsider our membership of the organization.\u201d More soon. Mount Fuji, Japan\u2019s highest mountain and one of the most recognisable peaks in the world, will be off-limits to climbers for the first time in 60 years this summer to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. Authorities in Shizuoka prefecture, where three of the four major routes to the summit are located, said the paths would be closed during the 10 July-10 September climbing season, when tens of thousands of people normally hike to the top of the 3,776-metre mountain. The announcement comes after Yamanishi prefecture, home to the fourth and most popular route, said it would also ban climbers this year. \u201cWe\u2019re taking this measure so as not to spread the coronavirus,\u201d a Shizoka official told Agence France-Presse. The mountain, a Unesco world cultural heritage site, is located just 100km (60 miles) from Tokyo and is clearly visible from the capital. The move will come as a huge disappointment to the country\u2019s amateur climbers. Last year, an estimated 236,000 people made their way to the top of the active volcano, which last erupted just over 300 years ago. Roughly 4.1 million US mortgage borrowers have had their payments paused or reduced as the novel coronavirus outbreak hits household finances, Reuters reports, but the increase in the number of people needing such help is slowing, the latest weekly survey from the Mortgage Bankers Association showed on Monday. The share of mortgages in forbearance rose to 8.16% from 7.91% in the May 4-10 period, the industry lobbying group said, the smallest increase since March 16. The number of new requests for relief also fell relative to the prior week for the fifth consecutive survey period, the MBA said. Ginnie Mae loans once again had the highest percentage of loans in forbearance by investor type, at 11.26% of loans. The share of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans in forbearance increased to 6.25% from 6.08%. The death toll in Australia has reached 100, following the death of a 93-year-old woman who had been diagnosed with Covid-19. The woman had been a resident at Newmarch House, the aged care home in western Sydney which has been the site of a cluster of cases. More on the Newmarch House story below: China reported six new coronavirus cases for 18 May, compared to seven a day earlier, the health authority said on Tuesday. The National Health Commission said in its daily bulletin that three of the six new cases were imported. The imported cases were all detected in Inner Mongolia. Of the three new local transmissions, two were in the northeastern border province of Jilin and one in Hubei, where the coronavirus was first identified. The commission also reported 17 new asymptomatic coronavirus cases on 18 May, compared to 18 on the previous day. In Washington, President Donald Trump attacked the World Health Organization as a Chinese \u201cpuppet\u201d on Monday and confirmed he is considering slashing or canceling US support. \u201cThey\u2019re a puppet of China, they\u2019re China-centric to put it nicer,\u201d he said at the White House. Trump said the United States pays around $450 million annually to the World Health Organization, the largest contribution of any country. Plans are being crafted to slash this because \u201cwe\u2019re not treated right.\u201d \u201cThey gave us a lot of bad advice,\u201d he said of the WHO. Podcast: How coronavirus led to rough sleepers being housed in hotels Amelia Gentleman reports on life inside the hotels that are now housing some of the more than 5,400 homeless people across England and Wales. It is part of an unprecedented emergency operation to get all rough sleepers off the streets: In Australia, the Chinese Embassy has said that the World Health Assembly motion for an independent inquiry into the global response to the coronavirus pandemic is not \u201cvindication\u201d of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison\u2019s own call for an independent inquiry. This week, the ABC reports, Australian government MPs claimed vindication after 62 nations backed a European Union (EU) draft motion calling for an \u201cimpartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation\u201d of the \u201cinternational health response to Covid-19\u201d. But the Chinese embassy says that claim is \u201cnothing but a joke\u201d and that the WHA motion is \u201ctotally different\u201d to Australia\u2019s. My colleague Amy Remeikis points out that a key difference is that the WHA motion \u201callows for the World Health Organisation to lead the inquiry, which was the main thing Australia did not want.\u201d China has meanwhile put punitive tariffs of more than 80% on barley imports from Australia. Australian trade minister Simon Birmingham indicated Australia may appeal the imposition of a 73.6% anti-dumping tariff and a 6.9% anti-subsidy tariff applied to all Australian barley from Tuesday. \u201cAustralia is deeply disappointed with China\u2019s decision to impose duties on Australian barley,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe reject the basis of this decision and will be assessing the details of the findings while we consider next steps. The Guardian\u2019s Charlotte Graham-McLay reports: New Zealand has recorded another day of no new cases of Covid-19. The country\u2019s confirmed number of cases went up by four on Tuesday, due to several recorded cases in people who returned to New Zealand while infected with the virus in April. All have since recovered. As they had tested positive for the illness while they were in Uruguay, there had been some uncertainty about which country\u2019s total they should be added to, according to Ashley Bloomfield, New Zealand\u2019s director-general of health. There are two people in New Zealand hospitals with Covid-19. Neither are in intensive care units. Only New Zealand citizens and residents and their immediate families are currently allowed to enter the country. They must spend a mandatory two weeks in government-run quarantine. New Zealand \u2013 which eased its lockdown restrictions further last Thursday, allowing shops and cafes to re-open under physical distancing rules \u2013 has recorded five days of no new cases of the virus in the past week, and two days of one new case. Fewer than 1,500 people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus in New Zealand. Its government has drawn praise for shutting down the country in late March when just over 200 cases, and no deaths, had been recorded. 21 people have now died. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has weighed in on Trump\u2019s hydroxychloroquine use: As Covid-19 reached remote indigenous lands in Brazil\u2019s Amazon, the government agency responsible for protecting native people brushed off calls for action, focusing instead on waging ideological battles, according to agents from the institution itself and others, AP reports. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s repeated promotion of developing the vast Amazon has for months prompted indigenous activists, celebrities and agents on the ground to sound the alarm. In the face of a spreading pandemic, they warn inaction is enough to wipe out many indigenous people. The Associated Press spoke to four agents who work with indigenous peoples in the farthest reaches of Brazil\u2019s Amazon, and they were unanimous in their conclusion: The national Indian foundation, known as FUNAI, is hardly doing anything to coordinate a response to a crisis that could decimate ethnic groups. There\u2019s not enough protective equipment for agents who enter indigenous territories or meet with native people in cities. Necessities like kerosene and gasoline are in short supply. Food deliveries only began last week a month after indigenous people were instructed to remain in their villages and remain vastly insufficient. Since the pandemic\u2019s onset, there has been fear about the vulnerability of native people who live far from urban health facilities and whose communal lifestyles render them susceptible to swift transmission. At least 88 indigenous people have already died of Covid-19 in the Amazon, according to a tally by the Brazilian indigenous organization APIB that includes health ministry figures and information from local leaders. The count is likely higher, because hospitals often don\u2019t use patients\u2019 indigenous names when admitting them. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Brazil stands at 255,368, according to Johns Hopkins University figures, making the country the third-worst affected in terms of cases. There are 16,792 officially confirmed deaths in Brazil, which is lower than the UK, Italy, Spain and France. The Johns Hopkins figures come from official data, however, and are likely to be higher in some countries due to underreporting. These are the ten worst-affected countries worldwide according to that data: US cases: 1,508,168 (deaths: 90,338) Russia cases: 290,678 (deaths: 2,722) Brazil cases: 255,368 (deaths: 16,853) United Kingdom cases: 247,709 (deaths: 34,876) Spain cases: 231,606 (deaths: 27,709) Italy cases: 225,886 (deaths: 32,007) France cases: 180,051 (deaths: 28,242) Germany cases: 176,551 (deaths: 8,003) Turkey cases: 150,593 (deaths: 4,171) Iran cases: 122,492 (deaths: 7,057) The White House Director of Strategic Communications has confirmed that Trump was prescribed hydroxychloroquine and is taking it, the New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman has tweeted: Trump\u2019s doctor, Sean Conley, released a memorandum stating that he and the doctor had discussed the use of the drug, but did not confirm in the memo that the US president was actually taking the drug. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been warning since April that the drug should not be used for that purpose because it could cause irregular heartbeats and other cardiac trauma. In case you missed it earlier, here is our full story on US President Trump saying that he has been taking hydroxychloroquine: Donald Trump has told reporters at the White House that for \u201ca couple weeks\u201d he has been taking a malaria drug as a defense against Covid-19 \u2013 despite warnings from his administration that it is dangerous. Trump said he was taking hydroxychloroquine \u2013 a drug approved to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis \u2013 in response to the coronavirus threat. But the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been warning since April that the drug should not be used for that purpose because it could cause irregular heartbeats and other cardiac trauma. US President Donald Trump\u2019s doctor, Sean Conley, has released a memorandum stating that: After numerous discussions [Trump] and I had regarding the evidence for and against the use of hydroxycholorquine, we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks.\u201d The global economy will take much longer to recover fully from the shock caused by the new coronavirus than initially expected, the head of the International Monetary Fund said, and she stressed the danger of protectionism. Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the Fund was likely to revise downward its forecast for a 3% contraction in GDP in 2020, but gave no details. That would likely also trigger changes in the Fund\u2019s forecast of a partial recovery of 5.8% in 2021. In an interview with Reuters, she said data from around the world was worse than expected. \u201cObviously that means it will take us much longer to have a full recovery from this crisis,\u201d Georgieva said in an interview. She gave no specific target date for the rebound. In April, the global lender forecast that business closures and lockdowns to slow the spread of the virus would throw the world into the deepest recession since the 1930s Great Depression. But data reported since then points to \u201cmore bad news,\u201d Georgieva said earlier this month. The IMF is due to release new global projections in June. US President Donald Trump said on Monday he would issue a statement about the World Health Organization in the near future and said it had \u201cdone a very sad job\u201d in its handling of the coronavirus. Trump told a White House event he would make a decision about US WHO funding soon, and that he had he considered reducing it to $40 million, but some felt that was too much. Asked why he had not addressed a virtual ministerial meeting of the WHO earlier in the day, he replied: \u201cI chose not to make a statement today. I\u2019ll be giving them a statement, sometime in the near future, but ... I think they\u2019ve done a very sad job in the last period of time.\u201d The coronavirus death told in the US passed 90,000 Monday, and the number of cases climbed above 1.5m, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The milestone came as more states seek to loosen restrictions and the president tweeted, \u201cREOPEN OUR COUNTRY!\u201d The president has questioned the death toll, suggesting that the numbers have been inflated. But researchers from the CDC who analyzed deaths in New York over the past two months concluded that the actual death toll is likely higher than the reported number. All the states, except Connecticut, have relaxed stay-at-home orders, to varying degrees. But only 18 states showed a downward trend of new cases according to data from Johns Hopkins. The World Health Organization said on Monday an independent review of the global coronavirus response would begin as soon as possible, and received backing and a hefty pledge of funds from China, in the spotlight as the origin of the pandemic, Reuters reports. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus made his promise during a virtual meeting of the WHO\u2019s decision-making body, the World Health Assembly, at which Chinese President Xi Jinping defended his country\u2019s own handling of the crisis. US President Donald Trump has fiercely questioned the WHO\u2019s performance during the pandemic, withdrawing US funding after accusing it of being too China-centric, and at the same time leading international criticism of China\u2019s lack of transparency in the early stages of the crisis. Tedros, who has always promised a post-pandemic review, said it would come \u201cat the earliest appropriate moment\u201d and provide recommendations for future preparedness. He received robust backing from the WHO\u2019s independent oversight panel. A resolution drafted by the European Union calling for an independent evaluation of the WHO\u2019s performance appeared to have won consensus backing among the WHO\u2019s 194 states. In its first report on the WHO\u2019s handling of the pandemic, the seven-member oversight committee said the UN agency had \u201cdemonstrated leadership and made important progress in its Covid-19 response\u201d. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s coronavirus live blog. I\u2019m Helen Sullivan, with you for the next few hours. The US president Donald Trump has said he is taking hydroxychloroquine, a drug approved to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, as a precaution against coronavirus, despite warnings from the Food and Drug Administration that the drug should not be used for that purpose because it could cause irregular heartbeats and other cardiac trauma. Dr Anthony Fauci, the country\u2019s top infectious disease doctor, and a member of the White House coronavirus taskforce, has repeatedly warned that there is no conclusive evidence to support using the drug. Meanwhile deaths in the US passed 90,000 and confirmed infections topped 1.5 million, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. The US Centers for Disease Control have projected that deaths in the US could reach 100,000 by 1 June. Here are the main developments from the last few hours: Trump says he is taking hydroxychloroquine. The president said he has been taking hydroxychloroquine, a drug he has fiercely touted in the past but that was found to have a very mixed effect on patients. The US Food and Drug Administration cautions against use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for Covid-19 outside of a hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems. Some areas of New York City have seen death rates nearly 15 times higher than others, according to data released by New York City\u2019s health department, showing the disproportionate toll taken on poorer communities. The highest death rate was seen on the edge of Brooklyn in a neighbourhood dominated by a large subsidised-housing development called Starrett City. Qatar will close all shops and halt all commercial activities, from 19 to 30 May, state news agency QNA has reported, citing a decision by Qatar\u2019s cabinet. The closure excludes pharmacies, food supply stores and food deliveries. Italy registers lowest deaths since March as bars, restaurants, shops, hairdressers, museums and churches reopen. Italy registered 99 deaths and 451 infections on Monday. There is also a significant fall in new infections in Lombardy, the region worst affected by the virus, from 326 on Sunday to 175 on Monday. Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica reopens. Visitors are allowed to return to Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica in the Vatican after more than two months of lockdown. A handful of visitors queue up, observing social distancing rules and under the watch of police officers wearing face masks, before having their temperatures taken to enter the church.
