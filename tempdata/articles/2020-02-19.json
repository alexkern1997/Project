      "body": "<p>The coronavirus crisis in China has posed unprecedented political challenges to the authorities and prompted them to further crack down on speech freedom and tighten control over people in a desperate move to bolster the regime, say analysts and activists.</p> <p>After President Xi Jinping ordered \u201cresolute efforts\u201d to curb the spread of coronavirus in his first public remarks on the disease on 20 January, Wuhan was swiftly placed under lockdown. Millions of communities across China also began to implement draconian epidemic control measures.</p> <p>The rough implementation of epidemic control has resulted in extensive human rights abuses across China, analysts say. Disturbing images have emerged on social media showing people <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fangshimin/status/1229304733036204032\">chained up</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/59SwyT4QrKcI2PO/status/1228708481554882561\">paraded</a> on streets, or beaten by police for not wearing masks. Footage has also shown officers installing metal bars or chains outside people\u2019s homes to prevent them leaving.</p> <p>Propaganda banners with threatening messages have been put up around the country. \u201cA surgical mask or a breathing tube?

In Hubei province, home to the epicentre of the virus, Wuhan city, there have been nearly 50,000 confirmed cases.</p> <p>In a desperate move Wuhan this week began to confine all communities in the city of 11 million people to their homes and authorities said anyone seen on the streets without permission would be severely punished. Officers started to carry out new house-to-house checks to seek out and \u201cround up\u201d all infected patients.</p> <p>Citizens of Wuhan say they are forbidden from even taking strolls in their neighbourhood and shopping for food. \u201cPeople are gripped by fear and anxiety, and we are extremely angry because this disaster is entirely manmade,\u201d said a Wuhan resident who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals.</p> <p>\u201cIf they didn\u2019t detain Dr Li Wenliang for \u2018spreading rumours\u2019 and told us the virus was under control, none of this would have happened.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/06/whistleblower-chinese-doctor-dies-from-coronavirus\">Doctor who blew whistle over coronavirus has died, hospital says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The whistleblowing doctor alerted colleagues in late December to a mysterious disease that turned out to be coronavirus. Wuhan police censured him on 3 January and state television CCTV accused eight people, including Li, of \u201cspreading false rumours\u201d. Li\u2019s death from coronavirus infection this month<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/07/coronavirus-chinese-rage-death-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang\"> sparked widespread demands for speech freedom online</a>, although cyber-police quickly took down those posts.</p> <p>But the authorities do not seem to have learned their lesson. Cases of further crackdowns on speech abound. While the new decree from Wuhan said people would be punished for not reporting cases, it also warned that \u201cfabrication\u201d and the spread of \u201crumours\u201d would be severely punished.</p> <p>The government of the south-western province of Yunnan announced in early February that 25 people were detained or censured for \u201cfabricating and spreading rumours\u201d over the coronavirus epidemic. Last week three more in the province were detained over the same accusation.</p> <p>The authorities are also using epidemic control as a pretext to detain government critics.

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus crisis in China has posed unprecedented political challenges to the authorities and prompted them to further crack down on speech freedom and tighten control over people in a desperate move to bolster the regime, say analysts and activists. After President Xi Jinping ordered \u201cresolute efforts\u201d to curb the spread of coronavirus in his first public remarks on the disease on 20 January, Wuhan was swiftly placed under lockdown. Millions of communities across China also began to implement draconian epidemic control measures. The rough implementation of epidemic control has resulted in extensive human rights abuses across China, analysts say. Disturbing images have emerged on social media showing people chained up and paraded on streets, or beaten by police for not wearing masks. Footage has also shown officers installing metal bars or chains outside people\u2019s homes to prevent them leaving. Propaganda banners with threatening messages have been put up around the country. \u201cA surgical mask or a breathing tube? Your choice,\u201d said one. \u201cThose who don\u2019t report their fever are class enemies hiding among the people,\u201d another said. The coronavirus has turned into an epidemic that has so far infected more than 75,000 and killed more than 2,000, mostly in China. In Hubei province, home to the epicentre of the virus, Wuhan city, there have been nearly 50,000 confirmed cases. In a desperate move Wuhan this week began to confine all communities in the city of 11 million people to their homes and authorities said anyone seen on the streets without permission would be severely punished. Officers started to carry out new house-to-house checks to seek out and \u201cround up\u201d all infected patients. Citizens of Wuhan say they are forbidden from even taking strolls in their neighbourhood and shopping for food. \u201cPeople are gripped by fear and anxiety, and we are extremely angry because this disaster is entirely manmade,\u201d said a Wuhan resident who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals. \u201cIf they didn\u2019t detain Dr Li Wenliang for \u2018spreading rumours\u2019 and told us the virus was under control, none of this would have happened.\u201d The whistleblowing doctor alerted colleagues in late December to a mysterious disease that turned out to be coronavirus. Wuhan police censured him on 3 January and state television CCTV accused eight people, including Li, of \u201cspreading false rumours\u201d. Li\u2019s death from coronavirus infection this month sparked widespread demands for speech freedom online, although cyber-police quickly took down those posts. But the authorities do not seem to have learned their lesson. Cases of further crackdowns on speech abound. While the new decree from Wuhan said people would be punished for not reporting cases, it also warned that \u201cfabrication\u201d and the spread of \u201crumours\u201d would be severely punished. The government of the south-western province of Yunnan announced in early February that 25 people were detained or censured for \u201cfabricating and spreading rumours\u201d over the coronavirus epidemic. Last week three more in the province were detained over the same accusation. The authorities are also using epidemic control as a pretext to detain government critics. Two citizen journalists, Wuhan native Fang Bin and lawyer Chen Qiushi, who have reported on the situation in Wuhan, have disappeared under the guise of \u201cquarantine\u201d. The law professor Xu Zhangrun, who criticised Xi over the coronavirus crisis in an essay, was also put under house arrest under pretext of quarantine. The activist and legal scholar Xu Zhiyong, who has also lambasted Xi for mishandling the epidemic and other crises, was detained last Saturday. \u201cRestrictions of personal freedoms used to happen only to activists, but now millions in China know how it feels to be under house arrest,\u201d said Hu Jia, a veteran activist who has been previously jailed and often detained. \u201cThis epidemic poses the gravest challenge to the authorities since 1989 [the Tiananmen pro-democracy movement],\u201d he said. \u201cI have never seen so much demand for speech freedom \u2013 people now understand it is a matter of life and death. The authorities are afraid that people have awakened.\u201d Johnny Lau, a veteran commentator on Chinese politics, said the Communist party\u2019s intensification of control over free speech was aimed at bolstering the power of the regime but would ultimately cause political and social instability. \u201cWhen people are kept in the dark and they don\u2019t trust the government, their [discontent] would turn into protests,\u201d Lau said.",

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018Disastrous\u2019 consequences for business feared Hello again \u2013 Warren Murray here to help you move through the news. Britain is to close its borders to unskilled workers and those who can\u2019t speak English as the government unveils an \u201cAustralian-style\u201d points system that will end the era of cheap EU labour in factories, warehouses, hotels and restaurants. The government will say it is grasping a unique opportunity to take full control of British borders and eliminate the \u201cdistortion\u201d caused by EU freedom of movement. Among main criteria, anyone wanting to come to the UK to work must have a job offer with a salary threshold of \u00a325,600 \u2013 though \u00a320,480 will be acceptable in areas of skills shortage, such as nursing. Self-employed people need not apply \u2013 spelling the end of Polish plumbers or Romanian builders coming on their own initiative. Some highly skilled workers will be allowed in without a job offer. A limit of 10,000 places is being put on farm workers for seasonal harvesting, when the National Farmers\u2019 Union\u2019s (NFU) has said 70,000 such visas will be needed for 2021. Minette Batters, head of the NFU, said it was \u201cironic\u201d the government was encouraging people to eat more fruit and veg while \u201cmaking it harder for that fruit and veg to be produced in Britain\u201d. Industry leaders have accused the government of an assault on the economy, warning of \u201cdisastrous\u201d consequences with job losses and closures in factories and the high street. But a government briefing paper is unapologetic: \u201cUK businesses will need to adapt and adjust to the end of free movement, and we will not seek to recreate the outcomes from free movement within the points-based system.\u201d * * * Best of Brit-ish \u2013 The singer-songwriter Lewis Capaldi and the rapper Dave have taken the main prizes at the Brit Awards. Capaldi won best new artist and best song for Someone You Loved, while Dave won album of the year for Psychodrama. Billie Eilish and Tyler, the Creator were among international winners at an event criticised as having too few female nominees. South London rapper Dave accused Boris Johnson of racism as he performed the freestyle track Black, with a newly written final verse that began: \u201cIt is racist, whether or not it feels racist, the truth is our prime minister\u2019s a real racist / They say \u2013 \u2018you should be grateful, we\u2019re the least racist\u2019 / I say the least racist is still racist.\u201d Alexis Petridis writes: \u201cThere\u2019s a sense in which the actual winners of the 2020 Brits represented an attempt to convince the public it was all very much business as usual: nothing to get upset about here, kindly move along.\u201d Ben Beaumont-Thomas reviews the night\u2019s performances \u2013 Mabel, Capaldi, Lizzo, Rod Stewart and more. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; Passengers have begun leaving the Diamond Princess in Japan but questions are being asked about whether quarantine measures around the ship have been strict enough, amid fears coronavirus cases could flare later among those permitted to leave. A second death has been reported in Hong Kong \u2013 more at our live blog. &gt; 10 Downing Street is being questioned over whether it vetted the now-sacked adviser Andrew Sabisky. Kirsty Blackman of the SNP said: \u201cIt is beyond shameful that a man with a well-documented history of unapologetically offensive, misogynistic, and racist remarks was considered by No 10 to be an appropriate hire.\u201d &gt; Jurors deliberating in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape trial have asked to see emails in which the movie mogul highlighted the names of potential accusers and handed them to the investigators he employed to try and silence the women. &gt; Boris Johnson and his estranged wife, Marina Wheeler, are preparing to end their marriage after a family court judge approved a financial settlement and gave Wheeler permission to apply for a divorce decree. Johnson is believed to be the first prime minister divorced in office in modern times. He has been dating Carrie Symonds since 2019 and they live together in Downing Street. &gt; In the largest study of its kind, researchers have found that whether a family has more boys or girls, or an equal mix, is simply down to chance. Meanwhile a woman in France left infertile by cancer treatment is the first to give birth via a new procedure whereby her immature eggs were collected, matured in a lab, frozen and then used five years later. * * * Children\u2019s future at stake \u2013 All countries are failing to shield their children\u2019s health and future from ecological degradation, climate change and bad diet, according to a global panel of child and adolescent health experts commissioned by the WHO. They say that despite dramatic improvements in survival, nutrition, and education over the past 20 years, today\u2019s children face \u201cexistential threats\u201d. Apart from the environment, predatory marketing of fast food and sugary drinks is blamed for an increase in childhood obesity from 11 million cases in 1975 to 124 million in 2016. The experts\u2019 report rates Norway, South Korea, the Netherlands, France and Ireland as countries where a child can best flourish. The UK is ranked 10th on child flourishing but 133rd when it comes to delivering on emissions targets. * * * Drug expert blocked over tweets \u2013 The chief pharmacist at an addiction service was barred from rejoining the government\u2019s drug advisory panel after Home Office social media checks revealed he had publicly criticised Jeremy Hunt. Graham Parsons has rejected the idea that his disapproval of Hunt\u2019s policies as health secretary would have compromised his advice. Parsons\u2019s \u201cexcellent expertise\u201d had been noted by an assessment panel that recommended his appointment. But Home Office emails and memos seen by the Guardian reveal it was noted that Parsons, a previous member of the panel, had posted tweets critical of Hunt. The government\u2019s relationship with drug policy experts has become increasingly fraught at a time of record drug-related deaths, budget cuts and criticism of Conservative drugs policy. * * * Bones of a theory \u2013 A cave in Iraq has given up the skeleton of a Neanderthal from 70,000 years ago, adding to evidence that modern humans\u2019 cousins buried their dead and might even have brought flowers to their funerals. The female who died in her 40s or 50s is dubbed Shanidar Z after the cave where her remains were found and those of others were discovered 60 years ago. \u201cIt seems clear that Shanidar was a special place, with bodies being placed just in one part of a large cave,\u201d said Graeme Barker, a University of Cambridge archaeologist. Today in Focus podcast: Inside Trump\u2019s Facebook campaign Guardian US tech reporter Julia Carrie Wong spent a year analysing Trump\u2019s Facebook campaign. She discusses how the sophisticated social media machine is targeting voters \u2013 and explains the database the Guardian built to investigate the contents of Trump\u2019s 218,000 different Facebook ads. Also, Leah Green reflects on the death of the former Love Island presenter Caroline Flack. Lunchtime read: \u2018Mum talked to me about justice, racism \u2026\u2019 The actor and activist Saffron Burrows, who stars in the Netflix hit You, discusses her teenage years as an anti-racist campaigner, modelling in Paris, #MeToo and the \u201csexist\u201d films she turned down. Sport J\u00fcrgen Klopp accused Atl\u00e9tico Madrid of targeting Sadio Man\u00e9 after Liverpool suffered a frustrating 1-0 defeat in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie. Erling Haaland\u2019s extraordinary scoring streak for Borussia Dortmund continued as his two goals gave them a 2-1 first-leg victory over PSG. Manchester City could face further investigations by Uefa\u2019s financial fair play compliance body into the level of Abu Dhabi sponsorships they declared for the years since 2016.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of passengers have begun leaving the stricken Diamond Princess in Japan after testing negative for the coronavirus Covid-19, ending two weeks of quarantine that experts say failed to prevent the virus spreading onboard. Japanese TV showed passengers \u2013 who spent quarantine largely confined to their cabins \u2013 leaving the ship on Wednesday morning to board waiting buses, while others left the pier in Yokohama, near Tokyo, by taxi. Local health authorities said just over 500 passengers were expected to disembark on Wednesday with another 2,500 to follow over the next two days. About half the passengers were Japanese, media reports said. Those living or staying in Japan were given contact details in case they develop symptoms of Covid-19, which has killed more than 2,000 people in China and infected more than 74,000 others. Hundreds of infections have been reported in other countries, along with five deaths. Japan has 615 cases confirmed, including 542 on the Diamond Princess. Members of Japan\u2019s self-defence forces escorted some passengers, including an elderly man in a wheelchair who wore a face mask. Some of the people still on the ship waved from their cabin balconies as passengers disembarked below. \u201cI\u2019m a bit concerned if I\u2019m OK to get off the ship but it was getting very difficult physically,\u201d a 77-year-old man, who got off with his wife, told Kyodo News. \u201cFor now we just want to celebrate.\u201d Others expressed joy at their new-found freedom.

      "bodyText": "The Nasdaq index in New York has hit its latest record high, with investors apparently circumspect about the risks of the coronavirus outbreak worsening and the prospect of central banks stepping in to help the economy along. The Nasdaq composite index gained 0.6% in early trading on Wall Street, hitting 9,795 points for the new record. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average also rose by about 0.3% apiece. The continued gains for stock markets around the world illustrate just how sanguine investors are feeling \u2013 even if the potential costs of the coronavirus are large and fears over possible recessions in advanced economies are brewing. The People\u2019s Bank of China added that it would help anti-virus efforts by extending credit, including by providing favourable loans or interest rates to companies involved in controlling the epidemic. It all adds to quite a cocktail for policymakers at the Bank of England. Inflation moved towards its 2% target in January, suggesting that an interest rate cut is less likely \u2013 but with fears over the economy and the ever-present uncertainty of Brexit trade talks still looming, there will be many clamouring for the Bank to give the economy some support. And one of the biggest corporate stories of the day came from Seattle, where Boeing has ordered inspections of its entire fleet of grounded 737 Max planes after it found debris in the fuel tanks of some of the aircraft, in the latest setback for the US plane-maker. Thank you for following our coverage of business, economics and markets today \u2013 and do come back tomorrow for more of the same. JJ Qatar Airways has spent about \u00a3460m on increasing its stake in British Airways-owner IAG to increase its holding to 25.1%, strengthening its position ahead of a change in IAG management, Reuters reports: In an endorsement of the Anglo-Spanish group just weeks before its founder Willie Walsh steps down, Qatar said on Wednesday the move showed its support for IAG and its strategy. Qatar previously held 21.4% of IAG, which also owns Spanish carriers Iberia and Vueling and Ireland\u2019s Aer Lingus. IAG\u2019s share price has risen by 52% in the last six months. The move comes after some unnamed non-EU investors sold their shares. EU rules mean that airlines must be majority owned within the bloc \u2013 a situation that will be complicated after the Brexit transition period. There\u2019s a mighty row brewing around Britain\u2019s biggest mining project in North Yorkshire. Mining giant Anglo American has offered \u00a3405m to buy Sirius Minerals, the troubled owner of the multi-billion-pound project to develop the Woodsmith fertiliser mine. However, Odey Asset Management, the hedge fund owned by outspoken financier and political donor Crispin Odey, said the offer was too low. In an open letter, Odey, which held a 1.29% economic interest in Sirius as of Feb. 18, said it would only vote in favour of a bid at 7 pence per share or more \u2013 not the 5.5p suggested by Anglo. In its letter it said: The lack of \u2018final\u2019 offer, in Odey\u2019s opinion, suggests that Anglo American would be willing to bid substantially more for Sirius, with the investment case remaining highly attractive for Anglo American, even at a materially higher bid level. Anglo American declined to comment. Sirius said in a statement that its board was unanimous in recommending shareholders vote for Anglo\u2019s bid as it stands \u2013 and that the company could fail if it doesn\u2019t secure the deal. Read the full story here: It\u2019s still looking like an easy day for European stock market investors: blue-chip shares have notched up another record high. The 0.6% gain for the Stoxx 600 index gives it a 3.5% increase for 2020 so far, and we\u2019re only halfway through February. The FTSE 100 index has fallen back slightly to 7,434 points, a 0.7% rise \u2013 likely because the pound has strengthened slightly. (Stronger sterling means the large chunk of US dollar earnings is less valuable in nominal terms.) Laura Ashley has agreed emergency funding with its bank, Wells Fargo, staving off the threat of bankruptcy. The struggling fashion and homeware retailer said it \u201cshould be able to utilise requisite funds from its working capital facility with Wells Fargo to meet its immediate funding requirements\u201d. Laura Ashley, which is listed in the UK, had said it would have to \u201cconsider all appropriate options\u201d if it could not get hold of more cash, raising fears for the jobs of more than 2,700 workers. Majority owner MUI Asia, which is controlled by the multimillionaire shareholder Khoo Kay Peng, did not inject any cash as part of the deal, but longer-term options are still under consideration. The company\u2019s statement said: The company welcomes the support from MUI Asia Limited and continues to review its working capital needs on an ongoing basis. The company will update shareholders in due course in relation to the review of its working capital needs. Financial leaders of the world\u2019s 20 largest economies (G20) will say that the coronavirus epidemic is a downside risk to forecasts of global growth, according to a draft communique. Private sector estimats of the cost suggest it could be big \u2013 but temporary. Reuters has seen the document, ahead of the meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors due this weekend. With 73,332 confirmed cases of the Covid-19 virus worldwide, and widespread quarantine conditions in China, there is little doubt among economists that global growth will be impacted. The question is the scale of the hit. Oxford Economics, a consultancy, has today put out research that suggests that a global pandemic could cost the global economy $1.1tn (\u00a3850bn). GDP would be 1.3% lower than their model otherwise suggests. If the epidemic is confined to Asia the cost would be a still considerable $400bn, or 0.5% of 2020 GDP \u2013 although in either scenario the economy recovers by the end of next year. A global pandemic would represent \u201ca short but very sharp shock on the world economy\u201d, wrote Adam Slater, lead economist at Oxford Economics. Our scenarios see world GDP hit as a result of declines in discretionary consumption and travel and tourism, with some knock-on financial market effects and weaker investment. A quick currencies update (on a pretty quiet day in foreign exchange markets): sterling has lost 0.1% against the US dollar, with brief gains from the inflation beat failing to hold. \u201cPound hugs $1.30\u201d is the headline from Reuters \u2013 perhaps not the most exciting development. It\u2019s worth noting that against the euro the pound is at levels, above \u20ac1.20, not seen since the EU referendum in 2016 \u2013 barring the post-election result spike. The Japanese yen has fallen by 0.5% against the dollar. It was announced last night, but if you haven\u2019t caught up yet, there are some pretty momentous plans in train for the UK\u2019s post-Brexit immigration system. Britain is to close its borders to unskilled workers and those who can\u2019t speak English as part of a fundamental overhaul of immigration laws that will end the era of cheap EU labour in factories, warehouses, hotels and restaurants, reported the Guardian\u2019s front page this morning. Unveiling its Australian-style points system on Wednesday, the government said it is grasping a unique opportunity to take \u201cfull control\u201d of British borders \u201cfor the first time in decades\u201d and eliminate the \u201cdistortion\u201d caused by EU freedom of movement. Business groups reacted with horror, saying it would damage the economy, but the home secretary, Priti Patel, this morning essentially told them to like it or lump it. There are 8m \u201ceconomically inactive\u201d Britons who could do the jobs, she said \u2013 although with the UK thought to be at or near full employment it is unclear how many of those could be tempted back into the labour market. The Guardian\u2019s economics editor, Larry Elliott, described it as \u201cthe biggest structural change to the UK labour market in decades\u201d. The new policy represents a break with the past and is highly interventionist. As a member of the European Union, the government was only able to limit migration from non-EU countries. Under the new approach, the UK will be open to highly skilled workers from anywhere in the world, but the door to those with low skills will be closed. Here\u2019s the full detail on the inflation figures, from the Guardian\u2019s Phillip Inman: Inflation jumped to a six-month high of 1.8% in January after a surge in petrol prices and an increase in the cost of gas and electricity over last year. The surprise increase in the consumer prices index (CPI), which exceeded forecasts of a rise to 1.6%, brought the main measure of inflation closer to the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2%. The rise in fuel and energy costs forced up household heating costs and fed into the transport industry, the Office for National Statistics said. Read the whole story here: US stock markets are looking up. Futures for the S&amp;P 500 suggest the US benchmark index will gain 0.2% when it opens later today, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq is expected to rise by 0.3%. Economists are wondering whether the Bank of England\u2019s efforts to raise interest rates from historical lows will be short-lived, given fears over the state of the global economy. Melanie Baker, senior economist at Royal London Asset Management, said: Inflation rose closer to the Bank of England\u2019s target, but underneath the noise of the headline figures, domestically-driven inflation still looks weak. Business sentiment and the follow-through to activity data will, however, be the more important determinant of whether the Bank of England cut rates or not in coming months. Jing Teow, an economist at PwC, said there could be risks of increasing inflation on the horizon \u2013 suggesting that the Bank would hesitate before a cut to interest rates. A prolonged shutdown in production activity as a result of Covid-19 could exert a drag on industrial production and disrupt global supply chains, which could lead to further inflationary pressures as the shortage of inputs and key components start to bite. Looking towards the medium-term, a modest recovery this year that spurs further business activity, combined with continued upward pressure on wages due to a tight labour market could also give rise to inflationary pressures. For a view on just how unusual the past decade has been in monetary policy terms, take a look at this graph from a speech by the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane (with its impressive range of sources included). Central bankers are desperate to push interest rates back up, but fears over the slowing global economy have for the most part stymied those efforts. Some more reactions on the slight-surprise inflation reading \u2013 first of all from a man who a week ago would not have been expected to be in the spotlight, and his opposition, who is likely to leave the spotlight in April. Conservative chancellor Rishi Sunak said: Families across the country are better off as a result of the strong wage growth and low inflation over the last 18 months. We want to go further to help with the cost of living \u2013 that\u2019s why we\u2019ve cut taxes for 31m people and given nearly 2.4m a pay rise through our record increase to the National Living Wage. John McDonnell, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, focused on the jump in prices. He said: The Tories\u2019 poor economic management has contributed to an unstable economy, with prices rising sharply for people already suffering from ten years of vicious cuts. Successive Conservative governments have repeatedly blamed anyone but themselves for an under-performing economy. It\u2019s time for this chaotic government to take responsibility for these failings, and to reverse the decade of decline the Tories have brought to this economy. The inflation reading may have taken economists by surprise (1.8% against a 1.6% consensus), but it may not have a major effect on interest rate prospects, economists suggest. The figures were in line with the Bank\u2019s January monetary policy report forecast, according to Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, a consultancy. She said: While CPI inflation rose for the first time in six months, the inflation figures were in line with the Bank of England\u2019s expectations, so they are unlikely to move the dial on the outlook for interest rates. CPI inflation still looks likely to slip back to 1.5% within the next few months and remain below 2% for the rest of the year. But for the MPC, the fact that inflation is evolving in line with its projections provides another reason not to cut interest rates in the near term. House prices rose across the UK in December \u2013 the first time that has happened since February 2018. Although the ONS did not give a specific reason for the increase, many economists have ascribed the rise in prices to the Conservative party\u2019s majority won in the general election of 12 December. Average house prices in the UK increased by 2.2% in the year to December 2019, up from 1.7% in the year to November 2019. The average price was \u00a3235,000 \u2013 up \u00a35,000 year-on-year. The ONS\u2019s head of inflation, Mike Hardie, said: Annual house prices grew across all regions of the UK, the first time this has happened in nearly two years, with London seeing its strongest growth since October 2017. The consumer price index (CPI) of inflation (still the measure used by the Bank of England, despite the ONS\u2019s best efforts) has faded over the past few years as the effects of the post-Brexit-vote devaluation of sterling have passed through. Some other notable data from the ONS: the input producer price index (PPI) rose at its fastest pace since April 2019, suggesting that some further price pressures could feed through to consumers. The 12-month growth rate of Input PPI was 2.1% in January 2020, up from 0.9% in December 2019. The ONS\u2019s head of inflation, Mike Hardie, said: The rise in inflation is largely the result of higher prices at the pump and airfares falling by less than a year ago. In addition, gas and electricity prices were unchanged this month, but fell this time last year due to the introduction of the energy price cap. The UK\u2019s consumer price index of inflation rose by 1.8% year-on-year in January, the fastest rate of growth in six months, according to the Office for National Statistics. Economists had expected inflation of 1.6%. Prices rose by 1.3% year-on-year in December. The FTSE 100 has now gained more than 1% today, or 77 points, to reach 7,459 points. The mid-cap FTSE 250 has gained 0.5%. Stock indices have risen across the board in Europe, with the Stoxx 600 index up by 0.55%. Traders are ascribing the positivity to a slight dip in the number of new cases of the Covid-19 coronavirus. The World Health Organisation reported 73,332 cases worldwide on Tuesday, the vast majority of which are in China. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould credited a small fall in the number of new coronavirus cases and apparent hopes that central banks will intervene to prop up the global economy for the stock market gains. He said: It feels like markets are looking for any excuse to feel positive at the moment. Apple\u2019s coronavirus-linked iPhone sales warning earlier this week may have spooked investors briefly. However, markets have soon shifted their attention elsewhere. An interesting update on the trade relationship between the UK and the EU: German exports to the UK fell to their lowest level since 2013 last year. The UK is Germany\u2019s fifth-largest customer, but exports fell 4.2% to \u20ac78.7bn. At the same time Germany\u2019s total exports rose 0.8% year-on-year to reach a record high. Reuters reports: German exports to Britain fell for the fourth year running in 2019, according to Statistical Office data seen by Reuters, as the weak pound dampened demand and uncertainty over post-Brexit trade regulations disrupted existing supply chains. Exports of cars, aircraft and aircraft parts, electronic equipment and pharmaceutical products had fallen, the data showed Martin Braml, a trade expert at the Ifo research institute, said: The main cause is the continuing uncertainty over the trade relationship after 2020, when the transition phase is over. Here\u2019s the torrid tale of the 737 Max\u2019s almost three years since launching. Troubles first emerged on 29 October 2018, when 189 people aboard a Lion Air flight from Jakarta crashed. In March Boeing\u2019s fleet was grounded. And then, shockingly, emails revealed in US Congress this year showed that employees joked that the plane was \u201cdesigned by clowns\u201d. Referring to the Federal Aviation Authority, the US regulator that certified the plane as safe to fly, another message says: \u201cI\u2019ll be shocked if the FAA passes this turd.\u201d One employee said in 2018: \u201cI still haven\u2019t been forgiven by God for the covering up I did last year.\u201d With the return of Boeing\u2019s 737 Max to the skies not expected until late spring at the earliest, those effects on the US economy will be significant, according to economists. Moody\u2019s Investor Service, the influential credit rating agency, said that US economic growth will decelerate during 2020, in part because of the crisis at Boeing. In a note published on Monday its analysts said: Boeing\u2019s decision to temporarily halt the production of the 737 Max will weigh on Q1 GDP, subtracting as much as 0.5 percentage points, because of the effect on manufacturers down the supply chain. (Note that US quarterly GDP numbers are reported on an annualised basis for obscure technical reasons that don\u2019t seem to apply to much of the rest of the world. US real GDP grew by 2.3% in 2019.) Here\u2019s Boeing\u2019s full statement on the debris discovery, from a spokesman: Safely returning the 737 Max to service is our top priority. While conducting maintenance we discovered foreign object debris [FOD] in undelivered 737 Max airplanes currently in storage. That finding led to a robust internal investigation and immediate corrective actions in our production system. We are also inspecting all stored 737 Max airplanes at Boeing to ensure there is no FOD. We have already recommended to our customers with airplanes in active storage for more than one year to inspect the fuel tank for FOD as part of their procedures. We continue to have conversations with our customers about the best approach for inspections of their stored airplanes prior to return to service. Some more on Boeing, a company so big that its travails have caused an appreciable dent in US manufacturing figures. Boeing lost its crown as the world\u2019s largest producer of planes in 2019 to fierce European rival Airbus \u2013 for the first time since 2011. Boeing produced only 380 planes last year, compared to Airbus\u2019s 863. The decision to ground the 737 Max planes was taken by regulators, but the follow-on effect of Boeing halting production of its most popular plane is hitting smaller suppliers around the US, according to this informative report in the FT (\u00a3). The drop has affected everyone from toilet parts suppliers to major listed companies such as Spirit Aerosystems, which laid off 2,800 people as demand for its fuselage dropped. The threat for Boeing is that the longer it idles its own machines and workers, the greater the risk of long-term damage to the supply chain. Metro Bank has appointed a new chief executive \u2013 or rather, it has removed the word \u201cinterim\u201d from his title. The struggling lender on Wednesday said that Dan Frumkin would be the man to lead the bank permanently, after an accounting scandal that has so far cost it the jobs of its colourful founding chairman and its chief executive. Frumkin joined the bank in September as chief transformation officer, taking charge of changing systems, and stepped into the breach as interim chief executive after Craig Donaldson quit. It\u2019s quite a change in a few months for Frumkin: the 55-year-old most recently spent eight years as global chief operating officer at the Bank of N.T. Butterfield &amp; Son, a community bank based in Bermuda. He has previously held roles at Royal Bank of Scotland and Northern Rock. Beyond the investigations into the accounting error, which saw loans misclassified, Frumkin will also have the task of turning around the bank\u2019s share price. It\u2019s worth less than a 20th of its price in March 2018. European markets have gained at the opening bell, with the FTSE 100 up by 0.5% to about 7,421 points. Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac 40 indices also gained 0.5% apiece. London\u2019s mid-cap FTSE 250 gained 0.4%. Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of the world of business, economics and markets. Boeing has ordered inspections of its entire fleet of grounded 737 Max planes after it found debris in the fuel tanks of some, in the latest setback for the US planemaker. It is still less than a year since the second fatal crash of a Boeing 737 Max that grounded the model\u2019s entire global fleet, and the company is racing to recertify with regulators that the planes can fly safely. The fuel tanks are unrelated to the flaws to sensors thought to have contributed towards the two crashes. Boeing built about 400 of the planes which it could not deliver to customers, and its orders have suffered after it was forced to cut back production at its factory near Seattle. Specialist aviation blog Leeham News, which first reported the discovery of the \u201cforeign object debris\u201d (FOD), said the inspections would likely not delay the recertification. However, it would take a up to three days to inspect each plane because fuel must be drained and vapours dissipated before the fuel tanks can be opened. Mark Jenks, the general manager of the 737 programme, said in a memo to employees that the debris was \u201cabsolutely unacceptable\u201d. \u201cOne escape is one too many,\u201d he added. Via Reuters: A Boeing spokesman said that the issue would not change the company\u2019s belief that the Federal Aviation Administration will certify the plane to fly again this summer. An FAA spokesman said the agency knows that Boeing is conducting a voluntary inspection of undelivered Max planes. In stock markets, equities in Japan, Hong Kong and Australia have for the most part gained on Wednesday, with a lull in coronavirus fears as the number of new Chinese cases dropped slightly. The Nikkei in Tokyo rose by 0.89%, while Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng gained 0.45%. However, share indices in Shanghai and Shenzhen fell, with the CSI 300 index losing 0.15%.

      "body": "<p>Gordon Brown always used to joke that there were two kinds of chancellors: the ones who failed and the ones that got out in time. With Mark Carney only a month away from ending his stint at Threadneedle Street, the question is whether the same principle applies to Bank of England governors as well.</p> <p>When Carney arrived at the Bank in 2013, official interest rates were 0.5%. He leaves with them only a quarter of a point higher, at 0.75%. So will it fall to his successor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/20/andrew-bailey-appointed-head-of-bank-of-england\">Andrew Bailey</a>, to preside over the long-anticipated tightening of policy?</p> <p>On the face of it, the answer is yes. The government is planning an expansionary budget on 11 March. A 6.2% increase in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/31/boris-johnson-to-raise-minimum-wages-by-four-times-inflation\">minimum wage </a>comes into force in April. House prices are back on the rise across the country. And, according to the latest official figures, the annual <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/19/uk-inflation-at-six-month-high-as-petrol-and-energy-prices-rise\">inflation rate</a> rose sharply last month \u2013 from 1.3% to 1.8%.</p> <p>Despite all that, Britain is not in the early stages of a traditional wage-price spiral. For a start, there were a couple of one-off factors that pushed up inflation in January. There was a jump in the price of oil \u2013 now reversed as a result of the coronavirus \u2013 and the falls in energy prices in January 2019 were not repeated.</p> <p>Moreover, there\u2019s not much sign of inflationary pressure in the pipeline. Wage pressure is easing and the price of goods leaving factories is rising by only 1.1% a year.</p> <p>There are two other factors to bear in mind. The first is that an already struggling global economy is being dealt a fresh blow by the coronavirus. The second is that the pound is at its strongest against the euro since the Brexit vote in the summer of 2016. Although that has more to do with the current weakness of the single currency than confidence in sterling, it will help to keep the lid on inflation by making imports cheaper.</p> <p>Bottom line: inflation will fall in the coming months, giving Bailey time to play himself in before even needing to think about raising rates.</p> <h2>Narrow the industrial strategy \u2013 and fund it properly</h2> <p>A compendium of Theresa May\u2019s gifts to the nation would be right up there in a list of the world\u2019s smallest books, but one achievement the former prime minister could point to was the launch of a UK industrial strategy in December 2017.</p> <p>The white paper published by the then business secretary Greg Clark was not short on ambition, claiming a different approach was needed to tackle Britain\u2019s productivity crisis and a lost decade of earnings growth.</p> <p>Put simply, the strategy was aimed at five specific weaknesses of the UK economy: insufficient investment in R&amp;D; poor infrastructure, regional imbalances, inadequate skills and a lack of readiness for grand challenges ahead, such as the climate crisis.</p> <p>So how are things going? Not brilliantly, according to the Industrial Strategy Council (ISC), headed by the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, which was given the job of monitoring progress towards the government\u2019s lofty goals.</p> <p>Haldane\u2019s first healthcheck identifies 142 distinct policies in the strategy but says that most have little or no cash going into them. As a result, they are very unlikely to make any real difference to the economy.

      "bodyText": "Gordon Brown always used to joke that there were two kinds of chancellors: the ones who failed and the ones that got out in time. With Mark Carney only a month away from ending his stint at Threadneedle Street, the question is whether the same principle applies to Bank of England governors as well. When Carney arrived at the Bank in 2013, official interest rates were 0.5%. He leaves with them only a quarter of a point higher, at 0.75%. So will it fall to his successor, Andrew Bailey, to preside over the long-anticipated tightening of policy? On the face of it, the answer is yes. The government is planning an expansionary budget on 11 March. A 6.2% increase in the minimum wage comes into force in April. House prices are back on the rise across the country. And, according to the latest official figures, the annual inflation rate rose sharply last month \u2013 from 1.3% to 1.8%. Despite all that, Britain is not in the early stages of a traditional wage-price spiral. For a start, there were a couple of one-off factors that pushed up inflation in January. There was a jump in the price of oil \u2013 now reversed as a result of the coronavirus \u2013 and the falls in energy prices in January 2019 were not repeated. Moreover, there\u2019s not much sign of inflationary pressure in the pipeline. Wage pressure is easing and the price of goods leaving factories is rising by only 1.1% a year. There are two other factors to bear in mind. The first is that an already struggling global economy is being dealt a fresh blow by the coronavirus. The second is that the pound is at its strongest against the euro since the Brexit vote in the summer of 2016. Although that has more to do with the current weakness of the single currency than confidence in sterling, it will help to keep the lid on inflation by making imports cheaper. Bottom line: inflation will fall in the coming months, giving Bailey time to play himself in before even needing to think about raising rates. Narrow the industrial strategy \u2013 and fund it properly A compendium of Theresa May\u2019s gifts to the nation would be right up there in a list of the world\u2019s smallest books, but one achievement the former prime minister could point to was the launch of a UK industrial strategy in December 2017. The white paper published by the then business secretary Greg Clark was not short on ambition, claiming a different approach was needed to tackle Britain\u2019s productivity crisis and a lost decade of earnings growth. Put simply, the strategy was aimed at five specific weaknesses of the UK economy: insufficient investment in R&amp;D; poor infrastructure, regional imbalances, inadequate skills and a lack of readiness for grand challenges ahead, such as the climate crisis. So how are things going? Not brilliantly, according to the Industrial Strategy Council (ISC), headed by the Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, which was given the job of monitoring progress towards the government\u2019s lofty goals. Haldane\u2019s first healthcheck identifies 142 distinct policies in the strategy but says that most have little or no cash going into them. As a result, they are very unlikely to make any real difference to the economy. There is not much evidence of the focus, financing and policy coordination needed to meet the grand challenges, with the need to do better especially obvious when it comes to meeting the 2050 net zero carbon target. The ISC has no statutory power. It is not even a truly independent watchdog because its support staff come from the business department, which is responsible for the industrial strategy. But even talking shops have their uses and the government would be well advised to heed Haldane\u2019s main conclusions: focus on a smaller set of core issues, fund them properly and commit to them over the long term. Boeing\u2019s 2020 shaping up to be worse than its 2019 If there was one company happy to see the end of 2019 it was the US plane maker Boeing, whose entire 737 Max fleet was grounded worldwide after two fatal crashes. Unfortunately, 2020 is shaping up to be little better: competition from Airbus is stiff; the global economy is slowing; environmentalists are targeting air travel. Now \u2013 and perhaps worst of all \u2013 debris has been found in the fuel tanks of some of the grounded 737 Max planes. If you are trying to restore confidence in your brand, this is the last thing you need.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person.

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus could cost the global economy more than $1tn in lost output if it turns into a pandemic, according to a leading economic forecaster. Oxford Economics warned that the spread of the virus to regions outside Asia would knock 1.3% off global growth this year, the equivalent of $1.1tn in lost income. The consultancy said its model of the global economy showed the virus was already having a \u201cchilling effect\u201d as factory closures in China spilled over to neighbouring countries and major companies struggled to source components and finished goods from the far east. Apple told investors earlier this week that it would fail to meet its quarterly revenue target because of the \u201ctemporarily constrained\u201d supply of iPhones and a dramatic drop in Chinese spending during the virus crisis. Carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, adding its voice to a chorus of companies complaining about supply problems, said it could run out of car parts at its British factories by the end of next week if the coronavirus continued to prevent parts arriving from China. Oxford Economics said it expected China\u2019s GDP growth to fall from 6% last year to 5.4% in 2020 following the spread of the virus so far. But if it spreads more widely in Asia, world GDP would fall by $400bn in 2020, or 0.5%. If the virus spreads beyond Asia and becomes a global pandemic, world GDP would drop $1.1tn, or 1.3% compared to the current projection. A $1.1tn decline would be the same as losing the entire annual output of Indonesia, the world\u2019s 16th largest economy. \u201cOur scenarios see world GDP hit as a result of declines in discretionary consumption and travel and tourism, with some knock-on financial market effects and weaker investment,\u201d it said. Rival consultancy Capital Economics said the situation in China was still developing and it remained unclear how long before the quarantine rules across much of China\u2019s central belt would lead to mass job layoffs and wage cuts becoming more widespread. It said 85% of larger stock market-listed firms had enough funds to meet their liabilities and wage bills formore than six months without any further revenue. But thousands of small and medium-sized businesses, which are responsible for half of urban jobs, \u201cmay not heed government orders not to shed jobs\u201d. A survey of 1,000 SMEs conducted by two Chinese universities found that unless conditions improved, one-third of the firms would run out of cash within a month, the consultancy said. Another survey of 700 companies found that 40% of private firms would run out of cash within three months. The firm\u2019s Asia analyst, Julian Evans Pritchard, said: \u201cOur best guess is that there is still a window of another week or so during which, if economic activity rebounds, the bulk of employees including at vulnerable SMEs would probably keep their jobs. \u201cAnd with large-scale layoffs avoided, consumer spending would bounce back quickly due to pent-up demand, which in turn would help the self-employed and family-run businesses to recoup much of their recent loss of income. \u201cBut with each day that the disruption drags on, the risk of a protracted slump in output rises. If activity is not clearly rebounding by the end of next week, we will revisit our annual growth forecasts. Oxford Economics said it still expected the impact of the virus to be limited to China and have a significant, but short-term impact, bringing world GDP growth just 0.2% lower than January at 2.3%. But a pandemic would cause a deeper and more profound shock over the next six months, possibly equal to a $1.1tn loss, followed by a recovery that would make up some of the ground lost earlier in the year.",

More recently, in 2006 the tanker Jian Seng was found off the coast of Queensland, Australia, without a crew, the identity of its owner and its origins unclear. In 2016 a wooden houseboat washed ashore on Ireland\u2019s Atlantic coast. Made with driftwood and polystyrene and fitted with solar panels, it turned out to have been built by Rick Small, a Canadian environmentalist who had given the boat away and had no idea how it ended up crossing the ocean unmanned.",

For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1%.</p> <p>In a explanatory thread on Twitter, Kucharski said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It\u2019s well established there are likely far more symptomatic cases in China than have been detected/confirmed. If we are calculating \u2018deaths/cases\u2019, and we underestimate number of cases, it will cause us to *overestimate* fatality risk.</p> </blockquote> <p>However, he said another factor might mean the current mortality rate of 2% is an underestimate. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>As the number of cases starts to slow down, fatalities will climb faster than cases (because they were infected when the epidemic was growing faster).</p> </blockquote> <p>He concludes by saying the two factors could cancel each other out and mean that current estimates for the mortality rate are actually accurate. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The widely quoted 2% fatality for China is calculated incorrectly, because it\u2019s based on data that is under-reported and doesn\u2019t account for delays. But, confusingly, these errors may actually cancel out, leading to an estimate that is right for the wrong reasons.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/AdamJKucharski/status/1229708011519823873\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This effect means that as the number of cases starts to slow down, fatalities will climb faster than cases (because they were infected when the epidemic was growing faster).

In a statement it said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>CDC\u2019s assessment is that it may not have been sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship.</p> </blockquote> <p>From the start, experts raised questions about quarantine on the ship. Passengers weren\u2019t confined to their rooms until 5 February. The day before, as officials screened them, onboard events continued, including dances, quiz games and an exercise class, one passenger said.</p> <p>A number of readers have asked about the air conditioning employed on the ship, and whether this could have contributed to the spread of the virus.</p> <p>Previously health authorities said the air conditioning was not a problem. However, Princess Cruises\u2019 executive vice-president, Rai Caluori ,said that, \u201cin an abundance of caution\u201d, the amount of fresh air going through the system was maximised.</p> <p>Dr Richard Darwood, a medical director and specialist in travel medicine, told Metro.co.uk: \u201cIf air is being ducted between one part of the ship to another then that could possibly be a factor.\u201d</p> <p>A video by Prof Kentaro Iwata, a specialist in infectious diseases at Kobe University Hospital, has been circulated widely on social media.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtHYZkLuKcI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vtHYZkLuKcI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Professor Kentaro Iwata said the approach to infection control on the Diamond Princess was \u201cchaotic\u201d. </figcaption> </figure>   <p>He doesn\u2019t mention the air conditioning system, but he says the cruise ship was completely inadequate in terms of infection control, with no distinction between the green zone (which is free of infection) and the red zone (which is potentially contaminated by the virus). </p> <p>\u201cIt was completely chaotic. I was so scared of getting Covid-19, because there was no way to tell where the virus is,\u201d he said. He said there was no professional infection control person in charge on the ship and the bureaucrats in control were violating all infection control principles.</p> <p>He said he met a health worker who had completely given up wearing protection because they said they had already been infected with the coronavirus. <br></p> <p>Speaking on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Iwata said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I felt much safer when I was in Africa [during the Ebola crisis] because you know where the virus exists and you know where the patient is.

      "bodyText": "Inspectors in protective suits have been going door to door in Wuhan in an effort to find every infected person, the Associated Press reports. Wednesday marked the final day of a campaign to root out anyone with symptoms whom authorities may have missed so far. \u201cThis must be taken seriously,\u201d said Wang Zhonglin, the city\u2019s new Communist party secretary, adding that if a single new case was found after Wednesday, the district\u2019s leaders would be held responsible. His remarks were published on Hubei\u2019s provincial website alongside a declaration that \u201cif the masses cannot mobilise, it\u2019s impossible to fight a people\u2019s war.\u201d Britons returning home from the Diamond Princess cruise ship that has had more than 600 cases of coronavirus will be quarantined at the same NHS facility that housed people flown back to the UK from Wuhan. The Department of Health said: \u201cWe can confirm that an accommodation block on the Arrowe Park NHS site will be used to isolate those returning from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. They will be kept in this location for the 14-day quarantine period, with around-the-clock support from medical staff at all times.\u201d Officials stressed there was no risk to the public and that the hospital in Wirral would continue to run as normal. This comes after the Foreign Office told British passengers onboard the ship to stay put or risk not being allowed on an evacuation flight later this week. An FCO statement read: \u201cWe are planning an evacuation flight from Tokyo to the UK as soon as possible for Britons who are on the Diamond Princess. We hope the flight will be later this week, subject to permissions from the Japanese authorities. \u201cHowever there is a chance that people who disembark will not be able to join the evacuation flight. We have the utmost concern for the affected Britons and strongly encourage them to register for the evacuation flight.\u201d Here is the full story: Two people who were diagnosed with coronavirus in Iran have died, a state-run news agency has reported. The IRNA news agency said the two victims were elderly Iranian citizens. IRNA quoted Alireza Vahabzadeh, a health ministry official, who said both victims were located in Qom, about 86 miles (140km) south of the capital, Tehran. Officials had confirmed the cases earlier on Wednesday. It\u2019s been a fast-paced day with a number of major coronavirus developments, so if you\u2019re looking to catch up, here\u2019s a quick summary of the latest stories: The Foreign Office has advised Britons to stay on the infected Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan - they may not be able to board the evacuation flight later this week if they disembark. Meanwhile, concerns continue to be raised over how the virus was able to spread so rapidly on the ship, with one expert describing infection control on board as \u201cchaotic\u201d. Another 79 passengers onboard were diagnosed with the infection - taking the total to 621. A British couple on the ship will not be able to join the evacuation flight as they have tested positive for the virus. China has expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters from the country over what Beijing deemed a racist headline in the paper. South Korea confirmed 20 new cases in the country, taking the total infected to 51. Iran confirmed its first two coronavirus cases. China is taking steps to stimulate production in manufacturing hubs by easing infection control measures. The final passengers disembarked from the MS Westerdam cruise ship in Cambodia, after all tested negative for the Covid-19 virus. Over 15,000 people have recovered from coronavirus, the latest figures show. In China, where the bulk of cases have been, there have been 2,009 deaths and 14,938 recoveries - out of a total of 74,185 cases. In some Chinese provinces the recovery rate has increased to 40%, although the rate for Hubei is still below 15% - possibly due to the extra strain on medical resources there, experts have suggested. In the UK, eight of the nine people diagnosed have made a full recovery. In Thailand, nearly half of the 35 cases in the country have recovered. Earlier this week the World Health Organization chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said it is estimated four out of five patients in mainland China have mild symptoms and are expected to recover. Al Jazeera has reported the case of Yangyang, a 28-year-old from Wuhan who has recovered from the disease. She said: I hope this trend offers people battling the disease across the country a beacon of hope and the courage to continue the fight. Once she has finished her 14-day quarantine she hopes to donate her blood plasma, with initial trials showing the blood plasma of recovered patients is beneficial to those still fighting the disease. The Swiss government has postponed an annual summit on patient safety due to the coronavirus outbreak. The Ministerial Summit on Patient Safety, due to be held in Montreux near Lake Geneva on 27 and 28 February, \u201chas been postponed because numerous participants must remain in their own countries to deal with the Covid-19 epidemic\u201d, it said in a statement. The summit will be rescheduled. The coronavirus fatality rate may change over the coming weeks as those who were infected at the start of the epidemic come to the end of their illness. Adam Kucharski, a mathematician and epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the potential under-reporting of cases in China, and the fact that fatalities will continue as the number of new cases slows down, meant the death rate could vary over time. The mortality rate for the new coronavirus is estimated to be around 2.5%. For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1%. In a explanatory thread on Twitter, Kucharski said: It\u2019s well established there are likely far more symptomatic cases in China than have been detected/confirmed. If we are calculating \u2018deaths/cases\u2019, and we underestimate number of cases, it will cause us to *overestimate* fatality risk. However, he said another factor might mean the current mortality rate of 2% is an underestimate. As the number of cases starts to slow down, fatalities will climb faster than cases (because they were infected when the epidemic was growing faster). He concludes by saying the two factors could cancel each other out and mean that current estimates for the mortality rate are actually accurate. The widely quoted 2% fatality for China is calculated incorrectly, because it\u2019s based on data that is under-reported and doesn\u2019t account for delays. But, confusingly, these errors may actually cancel out, leading to an estimate that is right for the wrong reasons. Russia will continue to issue official, business, humanitarian and transit visas to Chinese nationals, the country\u2019s foreign ministry has said, clarifying the conditions of a sweeping entry ban for Chinese citizens announced yesterday. The ban comes into effect on Thursday at midnight Moscow time. It was imposed due to the worsening epidemiological situation in China, the office of the deputy prime minister, Tatyana Golikova, said in a statement. Russia\u2019s foreign ministry clarified that the ban is temporary and only applies to visitors with tourist, private, student and work visas. It said in a statement: We reiterate our willingness to continue close cooperation with China in order to efficiently eradicate this common threat. Russia has had three confirmed cases of the Covid-19 disease. These were two Chinese citizens in Russia who were treated and released, and a Russian national infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. Russian authorities have taken significant steps to try to keep the virus from spreading, including keeping hundreds of people in hospital as a precaution and monitoring more than 14,000 people after they returned from China. Russia halted most air traffic to China, suspended all trains to China and North Korea, and temporarily stopped issuing work visas to Chinese citizens. Chinese students studying in Russia were told not to return until 1 March. This month Russia\u2019s prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, said Russia might start deporting foreigners infected with the virus. The Covid-19 virus has now infected more than 75,000 people globally. Three more people in Singapore have tested positive for the virus, one of whom was first admitted to hospital as a Dengue patient. South Korea reported 20 new cases. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest figures reported by each government\u2019s health authority, as of Wednesday in Beijing: Mainland China: 2,004 deaths among 74,185 cases, mostly in Hubei province Hong Kong: 63 cases, two deaths Macau: 10 cases Japan: 693 cases, including 621 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, one death Singapore: 81 South Korea: 51 Thailand: 35 Malaysia: 22 Taiwan: 22 cases, one death Vietnam: 16 Germany: 16 United States: 15 cases; separately, one US citizen died in China Australia: 14 France: 12 cases, one death United Kingdom: 9 United Arab Emirates: 9 Canada: 8 Philippines: three cases, one death India: 3 Italy: 3 Russia: 2 Spain: 2 Iran: 2 Belgium: 1 Nepal: 1 Sri Lanka: 1 Sweden: 1 Cambodia: 1 Finland: 1 Egypt: 1 There is no need for people to panic about the coronavirus, said Scotland\u2019s public health minister as he visited one of the country\u2019s two testing laboratories. Joe FitzPatrick said there was no current evidence to suggest it is necessary for people in Scotland to wear masks to protect against the Covid-19 virus. Screening laboratories in Glasgow and Edinburgh have tested 202 possible cases since testing began in Scotland on 10 February, with all proving negative. Combined with the previous tests at the Public Health England facility in Colindale, London, 290 tests from Scotland have been carried out since the outbreak began, with none coming back positive. FitzPatrick said although it is likely there will be a case of coronavirus in Scotland, the country is well prepared to deal with the situation. There is no need for people to be panicked. We are clear that this is a serious threat that we are taking seriously and we\u2019re preparing for worst case scenarios but right now the risk in Scotland, as in the rest of the UK, remains low so there\u2019s no evidence to suggest that people should be walking around Scotland wearing face masks at this time. He added: \u201cAlthough all Scottish tests have so far been negative, we are prepared for the high likelihood that we will also see a positive case. We have a proven track record of dealing with challenging health issues and have been preparing for this possibility since the beginning of the outbreak. The coronavirus outbreak has temporarily reduced China\u2019s CO2 emissions by a quarter, according to analysis by Carbon Brief. Electricity demand and industrial output remain far below usual levels after authorities introduced stringent measures to stop the spread of the disease. Daily data of coal use at power stations is at a four-year low, while oil refinery operating rates in Shandong province are at the lowest level since 2015, the report said. Carried out by Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst at Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air who covers air quality and energy trends in China, the analysis found levels of NO2 air pollution over China are down 36% on the same period last year. Over the same two-week period in 2019, China released around 400m tonnes of CO2 (MtCO2), meaning the measures introduced to control the virus could have cut global emissions by 100MtCO2 to date. However, the report notes that this is likely to only have a short-term impact and shutdowns of a week or more are not uncommon in China. Cutting energy consumption and emissions by 25% for two weeks would only reduce annual figures by around 1%, it states. However, reduced consumer demand \u2013 potentially caused by unpaid wages during the outbreak \u2013 could have a more significant long-term effect. For instance, car sales are set to fall by 25-30% in the January-February period, according to preliminary forecasts. In total, containment measures have resulted in reductions of 15% to 40% in output across key industrial sectors, according to the report. The virus has had a severe impact on China\u2019s economy, with Shanghai making a list of companies eligible for millions of dollars in subsidised loans to help keep them afloat. In recent days, Chinese industrial hubs have taken measures to stimulate production again, after factories remained closed for around 10 days after the Lunar New year holiday to help with infection control. China has ordered three reporters from American newspaper the Wall Street Journal to leave the country, over what Beijing deemed a racist headline. The expulsion came as Beijing slammed Washington\u2019s decision to tighten rules on Chinese state media organisations in the United States, calling the move \u201cunreasonable and unacceptable\u201d, AFP reports. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the Journal op-ed - titled \u201cChina is the Real Sick Man of Asia\u201d - had a \u201cracially discriminatory\u201d and \u201csensational\u201d headline, and slammed the newspaper for not issuing an official apology. Geng told a press briefing: As such, China has decided that from today, the press cards of three Wall Street Journal reporters in Beijing will be revoked. The Journal reported that deputy bureau chief Josh Chin and reporter Chao Deng, both US nationals, as well as reporter Philip Wen, an Australian, had been ordered to leave the country in five days. The three journalists are in the Wall Street Journal\u2019s news section, which is not linked to the editorial and opinion section. The op-ed, written by Bard College professor Walter Russell Mead, criticised the Chinese government\u2019s initial response to the new coronavirus outbreak. It called the Wuhan city government \u201csecretive and self-serving\u201d, while dismissing national efforts as ineffective. The phrase \u201csick man of Asia\u201d originally referred to China in the late 19th and early 20th century, when it was exploited by foreign powers during a period sometimes called the country\u2019s \u201ccentury of humiliation\u201d. The 3 February piece \u201cslandered the efforts of the Chinese government and the Chinese people to fight the epidemic\u201d, said Geng. The new coronavirus epidemic has killed over 2,000 people in China and infected more than 74,000, and has spread to at least two dozen countries. \u201cThe editors of the Wall Street Journal have nailed themselves to the pillar of shame,\u201d wrote the nationalistic Global Times in an op-ed on Tuesday before the reporters were expelled. The WSJ\u2019s remarks \u201csound like gloating, and they disgust Chinese people\u201d, it said. The expulsions come a day after the United States angered China for classifying five state media outlets, including Xinhua news agency and the China Global Television Network, as foreign missions, with State Department officials saying they were part of Beijing\u2019s growing \u201cpropaganda\u201d apparatus. Voicing China\u2019s \u201cstrong dissatisfaction\u201d, Geng added cryptically: \u201cWe reserve the right to respond further to this matter.\u201d Japanese health officials said 79 new coronavirus cases have been detected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, taking the total to 621. The positive cases on board the vessel amount to the biggest cluster of infected people outside China, and Japan is facing mounting scrutiny of its quarantine measures as passengers begin to disembark and travel across the world. Iranian authorities have confirmed two cases of coronavirus, the first in the country, the Associated Press has reported. Citing the semi-official Isna news agency, the report states there was also an unspecified number of other suspected cases and that those individuals have been quarantined. Their are currently no details on the nationality of the two people infected by the virus or the state of their health. Isna quoted an official in the country\u2019s health ministry, Kiyanoush Jahanpour, as saying two confirmed cases were detected in the central province of Qom. Subsequent tests were in progress and the results of these tests will be released to the public, once they are finalised, Jahanpour said. A total of 781 guests who disembarked from the Westerdam cruise ship in Cambodia have tested negative for Covid-19, Holland America, the ship\u2019s operator, said. Testing of passengers is now complete, while testing of 747 crew members is expected to continue for the next few days, the company said. The Foreign Office previously confirmed Britons were among those tested. A number of guests and crew had previously flown home, triggering international concern after an American passenger was diagnosed with the virus in Malaysia. Holland America said: \u201cThese results provide the required clearance for remaining guests in Cambodia to begin their onward journey home. \u201cThose who travelled home previously will be contacted by their local health department and provided further information.\u201d The are no indications the new coronavirus has spread to North Korea, the World Health Organization said, after South Korean media suggested there were cases and deaths there being covered up by the Pyongyang authorities. Experts have raised concerns that the disease, which has now killed over 2,000 people in neighbouring China, could be devastating for North Korea\u2019s under-resourced health system. Aid agencies have called for exceptions to international trading sanctions to make it easier if needed to help Pyongyang fight the disease. Dr Mike Ryan, head of WHO\u2019s emergencies programme, said: \u201cAt the moment there are no signals, there are no indications we are dealing with any Covid-19 there.\u201d A WHO spokesman, Tarik Jasarevic, said North Korea had reported checking nearly 7,300 travellers entering the country over a six-week period to 9 February. He also said 141 travellers with fevers had been tested for the virus and all had tested negative. Jasarevic said the WHO would provide North Korea with supplies including laboratory reagents for tests and protective equipment such as goggles, gloves, masks and gowns for health workers. A former North Korean diplomat, Thae Yong-ho, who defected to South Korea in 2016 said the ability of the WHO to evaluate the situation in North Korea was probably limited, as its staff and other foreigners would mostly be confined in the capital Pyongyang. Already one of the world\u2019s most closed-off countries, North Korea has stopped flights and train services with its neighbours, established month-long mandatory quarantines, suspended international tourism and imposed a near-complete lockdown on cross-border travel. South Korea has now confirmed 20 new cases of the coronavirus, including 14 people involved in an outbreak traced to several church services in the central city of Daegu. The jump in new cases is unprecedented so far in South Korea and brings the number of people infected in the country to 51. Including the cases announced on Wednesday, 19 have been reported in Daegu and the surrounding North Gyeongsang province, with 16 of them tied to an earlier confirmed carrier, Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said in a statement. The earlier case was confirmed on Tuesday in a 61-year-old woman known as \u2018Patient 31\u2019. She had no recent record of overseas travel but had attended church services and sought care at a hospital before being tested for the virus, the agency said. According to a Reuters report, at least 15 people who attended religious services with \u2018Patient 31\u2019 have tested positive for the virus. One other person, who came in contact with her at a hospital, has also come down with the disease. Hundreds of people are believed to have attended services with \u2018Patient 31\u2019 in recent weeks at a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony, a religious movement founded in 1984 by South Korean Lee Man-hee, who is revered as a messiah by followers. On Tuesday, Shincheonji Church posted a statement on its website confirming the woman had attended services and advised its members to stay home. It encouraged members who had attended meetings on 9 and 16 February to be tested and quarantine themselves. \u201cThe Daegu branch has been shut down since this morning and is conducting prevention measures,\u201d the statement said. Health authorities view the Daegu case as a \u201csuper-spreading event\u201d, The KCDC director, Jeong Eun-kyeong, told briefings on Wednesday. Besides the church, \u2018Patient 31\u2019 also visited a hotel and, eventually, a hospital, the Daegu mayor, Kwon Young-jin, said in a Facebook post. None of the woman\u2019s family members has shown symptoms, while taxi drivers who were in contact with her are now in self-quarantine, Kwon said. A clinic that treated Patient 31 after a traffic accident on 6 February said she refused to be tested for the virus at that time, despite a fever, because she had not travelled abroad recently or been in contact with known patients. KCDC officials said they were reviewing policies governing people who refuse to be tested, and added police could be involved in such cases. After her symptoms worsened, she was finally tested for the virus on 17 February, according to the KCDC. The South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, has called for stringent infection control measures and every possible action to boost the economy, which he said was in an emergency situation as the result of the epidemic. As the quarantine of the Diamond Princess cruise ship ends today, questions continue to swirl over how the virus spread so readily on the ship. Via Japan\u2019s state broadcaster NHK, health minister Katsunobu Kato defended Japan\u2019s efforts to halt the outbreak: Unfortunately, cases of infection have emerged, but we have to the extent possible taken appropriate steps to prevent serious cases, including sending infected people to hospital But some health experts have criticised the measures taken to control the disease on board. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Japan\u2019s efforts might have slowed down the virus but were not enough. In a statement it said: CDC\u2019s assessment is that it may not have been sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals on the ship. From the start, experts raised questions about quarantine on the ship. Passengers weren\u2019t confined to their rooms until 5 February. The day before, as officials screened them, onboard events continued, including dances, quiz games and an exercise class, one passenger said. A number of readers have asked about the air conditioning employed on the ship, and whether this could have contributed to the spread of the virus. Previously health authorities said the air conditioning was not a problem. However, Princess Cruises\u2019 executive vice-president, Rai Caluori ,said that, \u201cin an abundance of caution\u201d, the amount of fresh air going through the system was maximised. Dr Richard Darwood, a medical director and specialist in travel medicine, told Metro.co.uk: \u201cIf air is being ducted between one part of the ship to another then that could possibly be a factor.\u201d A video by Prof Kentaro Iwata, a specialist in infectious diseases at Kobe University Hospital, has been circulated widely on social media. He doesn\u2019t mention the air conditioning system, but he says the cruise ship was completely inadequate in terms of infection control, with no distinction between the green zone (which is free of infection) and the red zone (which is potentially contaminated by the virus). \u201cIt was completely chaotic. I was so scared of getting Covid-19, because there was no way to tell where the virus is,\u201d he said. He said there was no professional infection control person in charge on the ship and the bureaucrats in control were violating all infection control principles. He said he met a health worker who had completely given up wearing protection because they said they had already been infected with the coronavirus. Speaking on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Iwata said: I felt much safer when I was in Africa [during the Ebola crisis] because you know where the virus exists and you know where the patient is. But inside the Diamond Princess you have no idea where the virus is.\u201d The remaining passengers who were stuck onboard a cruise ship docked in Cambodia for almost a week have left the vessel after testing negative for the coronavirus. The MS Westerdam arrived in the port of Sihanoukville on 13 February having been turned away from five other ports after leaving Hong Kong, which has reported more than 60 cases of the virus and two deaths. The ship came under renewed scrutiny following Cambodia\u2019s quick clearance for passengers to fly home, a move which was criticised after one American woman who had been on the cruise ship tested positive for the virus over the weekend in Malaysia. On Wednesday, a series of cheers went up from people lining the lower deck of the cruise ship and there were several loud blasts of the ship\u2019s horn as passengers began disembarking, 18 days after the ship first left Hong Kong. Kheang Phearum, spokesman for Preah Sihanouk province, where Sihanoukville is located, said: The last 233 passengers on MS Westerdam are disembarked and will continue to Phnom Penh by buses. Holland America Line, the ship\u2019s operator, confirmed in a statement the last passengers had been given health clearances to leave the ship and make their way home. Upon leaving the vessel, passengers received traditional checkered Cambodian scarves as souvenirs. The passengers will spend a night in capital Phnom Penh and then fly home, said Sun Chan Thol, Cambodia\u2019s minister of public transport. Holland America said the ship would remain at dock in Sihanoukville while hundreds of crew members were being tested. The last of the Australians who were in quarantine on Christmas Island have left and been declared free of coronavirus, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said. More than 200 Australians spent two weeks in quarantine on the remote island, best known for its immigration detention centre, after being evacuated from Wuhan in China. Morrison also confirmed that 170 Australians on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan will be flown home tomorrow, and they will also be subject to two weeks in quarantine on arrival. Shanghai has compiled a list of firms, including local units of multi-nationals Unilever PLC and 3M Co, as eligible for millions of dollars in subsidised loans to ease any blow from the coronavirus outbreak, according to bankers and documents seen by Reuters. In an economically bruising three weeks, China has cordoned off cities and suspended transport links in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. \u201cEvery bank in Shanghai is rushing to lend to the companies on its list, to earn political goodwill,\u201d said one banker who had seen a list with 194 firms, including restaurant operators and property developers. Companies have the option to nominate themselves to be added to the overall list. Each lender then determines independently whether to approach a company on its list and offer finance, according to the bankers. Companies producing medical supplies and which are \u201cbackbone enterprises\u201d providing daily necessities are eligible for the special loans, according to a notice on the Shanghai MIIT\u2019s website. China is trying to deal with a nationwide shortage of medical supplies, from face masks to protective suits, while hospitals in central Hubei province - the epicentre of the outbreak - struggle to manage hundreds of new cases a day. There is no indication from the list that loans offered will necessarily be sought, or that such firms are in any financial need. The Bank of Shanghai Co Ltd told Reuters it will lend 5.5 billion yuan ($786 million) to 57 firms on its list. The aim of the loans is to ensure financial support to key companies helping prevent and fight the epidemic, the Shanghai government notice said. A spokeswoman from Unilever said it had \u201cno current plans to apply for any financing support\u201d. 3M and other companies listed including Shanghai Kindly Enterprise Development Group and Tellgen did not respond to requests for comment. Big Chinese manufacturing hubs are starting to ease curbs on the movement of people and traffic, Reuters reports, as local governments prod factories to restart production following weeks of stoppages due to the coronavirus outbreak. The tough restriction measures slowed the sprawling industrial sector to a crawl, with companies unable to resume production or restore output to normal levels due to a lack of workers after the Lunar New Year holiday which was extended by around 10 days. Many have also been unable to take delivery of raw materials or send products to clients due to logistical hurdles, with the disruptions spilling over into supply chains worldwide. Beijing is trying to balance stamping out the epidemic which has infected more than 70,000 people and killed over 2,000, while also shielding the already weakened economy from more damage. The city of Foshan, a large manufacturer of electronics and household appliances in southern Guangdong province, said late on Tuesday that businesses no longer need to seek prior approval before resuming operations and they returning workers will not need to provide proof of their health. On Monday, the nearby city of Zhongshan similarly lowered administrative barriers. In eastern Zhejiang province over the weekend, the cities of Hangzhou and Ningbo also pared back the approval process for companies looking to restart. Morgan Stanley research said: Macro and micro data suggest production activities are resuming at a slow pace in China, reaching 60-80% of normal levels by end-Feb and normalising only by mid-to-late March,\u201d Morgan Stanley wrote in a research noted. If the spread of the virus is not contained within the next two weeks, the disruption to production could extend into the second quarter. Some cities in Guangdong and Zhejiang this week organised buses and trains to ferry workers back from their hometowns. The city of Taizhou, in Zhejiang, even arranged for several planes to pick up migrant workers from Chongqing, Guiyang, Chengdu, Kunming and Xian, with the local government of Taizhou footing a third of the bill. The outbreak has also chilled consumer demand and hammered the services sector, with restaurants, hotels, cinemas and travel agents among the segments most visibly hit. In a bid to revive consumption, Foshan announced stimulus measures for its auto market, the first city in China to do so amid the outbreak. The city government will offer subsidies of 2,000 yuan ($285) for purchases of new cars and 3,000 ($429) yuan for replacement of existing cars, according to a document published on its website.

The Foreign Office has confirmed that although most passengers are free to leave the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan today after its official quarantine comes to an end, those who do so many not be able to board the UK evacuation flight planned for later this week. In a statement, the Foreign and Commonwealth office said: We are planning an evacuation flight from Tokyo to the UK as soon as possible for Britons who are on the Diamond Princess. We hope the flight will be later this week, subject to permissions from the Japanese authorities. At 0700 local time on Wednesday, the Diamond Princess cruise operator and Japanese authorities allowed passengers to disembark from the cruise ship. However there is a chance that people who disembark will not be able to join the evacuation flight. We have the utmost concern for the affected Britons and strongly encourage them to register for the evacuation flight. I\u2019m handing over the blogging duties to my colleagues in London. Thanks for reading but here\u2019s a summary of the main developments today so far: Deaths from the virus have risen above 2,000 after a 40% spike in fatalities in Hubei overnight. However, the number of new cases in China has fallen again. Passengers have begun leaving the Diamond Princess cruise ship which has been anchored in Yokohama for two weeks. Questions remain about how Covid-19 has spread to infect 540 passengers and crew. One Japanese health expert says the quarantining was inadequate. A second person has died from the virus in Hong Kong. China\u2019s authorities are stepping up their control on people\u2019s movement \u2013 but could be risking a backlash A senior nurse in a Wuhan hospital has become the latest health worker to die from the virus. South Korea has recorded 15 new cases, 10 of them centred around a church in Daegu. Casual staff at Australian universities fear for their livelihoods amid a slump in enrolments caused by the travel ban on Chinese students. Stock markets have bounced back across Asia Pacific, shrugging off increasing evidence of a widespread shutdown in the Chinese economy. Casual staff at Australian universities fear for their livelihoods amid a slump in enrolments caused by the travel ban on Chinese students. Part-time teachers are \u201cpanicking\u201d in fear that they won\u2019t get paid if there no students to teach. \u201cThe casual workforce gets hired based on enrolments. Casual teaching contracts require student numbers to be confirmed. People were panicking,\u201d one lecturer said. Stephanie Convery has the full story: Justin McCurry in Tokyo has cleared up the confusion about the diagnosis of David Abel, a British passenger onboard the Diamond Princess, and his wife. It turns out he and Sally Abel are both positive after all, despite a suggestion earlier today that they weren\u2019t: Abel posted on Facebook on Tuesday night that he and his wife, Sally, had both tested positive, but then cast doubt on his diagnosis after being told by Japanese doctors that the couple were to be taken off the ship and placed in a hostel \u201cfor four or five days\u201d rather than being sent to hospital. But on Wednesday afternoon, Abel said they had confirmed their positive status after talking to an English-speaking doctor, and were preparing to be taken off the ship, which has been moored in Yokohama, near Tokyo, since 3 February. \u201cWe\u2019ve since spoken to a doctor that speaks English ... and it has been confirmed by him that we are both positive,\u201d Abel said in a YouTube video, adding that he believed they would spend a few days in a hostel while they wait for hospital beds to become available. \u201cI can\u2019t see that there\u2019s going to be any way we\u2019ll be on that flight to the UK,\u201d he said, referring to plans by the British government to send a chartered flight to Japan this week to collect about 70 British passengers on the Diamond Princess. Following on from Verna Yu\u2019s story (last post but one) about the crackdown on dissent in China, the Global Times has tweeted about the ongoing enforcement of rules in Huanggang, a city in Hubei hard-hit by the virus. The Chinese news site says people who violate the rules of the lockdown will be sent to \u201cdesignated places to learn and recite government official documents\u201d. Shades of Xinjiang. The relief of this passenger from the Diamond Princess is palpable. As it would be. Our reporter Verna Yu has been looking at how the government in Beijing has ruthlessly cracked down on dissent as it has tried to contain the spread of Covid-19. The situation is especially brutal in Wuhan where people risk jail if they dare to even leave their homes. One resident of the city told us: People are gripped by fear and anxiety, and we are extremely angry because this disaster is entirely man-made. The bubbling resentment felt about the draconian controls can be seen on social media, Verna writes, with images of people being beaten by police for not wearing masks and paraded in chains. It\u2019s a serious test of Xi Jinping\u2019s authority. Hu Jia, a veteran activist who has been previously jailed and often detained, says it\u2019s the \u201cgravest challenge to the authorities since 1989 (Tiananmen pro-democracy movement)\u201d. Stocks across the Asia Pacific region have rebounded today after the Apple-induced falls of Tuesday. In Sydney, the benchmark ASX200 rose 0.43% to close at a record high of 7144.6 points. That is also just 1 point off the all time intra-day high of 7145.7 which was set earlier in the year. In Tokyo the Nikkei is up 1% with only 30 minutes of trading to go. The Shanghai Composite is up 0.3% and the Hang Seng has climbed 0.44% today. The Kospi in Seoul is, however, off 0.2%, despite the government announcing billions of won in stimulus to help businesses through the Covid-19-driven slowdown. Our full story on the exodus from the Diamond Princess has just gone live on the site. Here it is: Reuters has given us a fascinating insight into what\u2019s happening inside the Chinese economy and how people are losing their jobs amid the unprecedented shutdown. Mark Xia, a cameraman at a video prooducer in Shanghai, returned to work this month to be told he had to take three months unpaid leave. The company rejected his request to pay at least half his monthly salary during the suspension so he has quit and is now looking for a new job. \u201cI understand the company\u2019s cash-flow is tight,\u201d Xia, 25, told Reuters. \u201cWe postponed some shooting due to the coronavirus outbreak, and that\u2019s had a huge impact on our revenues, that\u2019s the reality.\u201d The government has rolled out special loans for small businesses facing loss of business and cash flow problems. But the real human cost to people like Xia could be profound if multiplied across China\u2019s vast economy. As we saw in an earlier post, the government is pushing hard to get people back to work but faces some serious problems in the shape of travel restrictions on migrant workers. The Global Times said a little while ago that the government is urging provinces \u2013 except Hubei \u2013 to relax the restrictions on migrants. More grim news from the frontline in Wuhan. A nurse at Wuchang hospital in the city has died from the virus, the Global Times reports. Liu Fan, 59, was deputy chief nurse and had worked in the injection room until 2 February. She then developed a fever and was admitted to hospital on 7 February. She died on 14 February after contracting pneumonia. Liu\u2019s parents and brother have also died of the virus. Her husband and daughter are under quarantine but have not been found to be infected. Liu Zhiming, a senior doctor at the hospital, has also died of the virus, as we reported yesterday. Australian Olympic chief John Coates has assured athletes, fans and officials that it will be safe to attend the games scheduled for Tokyo at the end of July. Coates said he had travelled to Tokyo last week and was briefed by organisers about contingency plans for dealing with Covid-19 ahead of the games. There was no question of the games being cancelled, he said, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re very satisfied that all the checks and balances will be there by the time the athletes and the spectators enter the country.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story: Ten staff from a Japanese news agency, Kyodo News, were reportedly driven in a hired vehicle in January and early February by a man who has since tested positive for Covid-19. The Japan Times reports that the staff were sent home to self-quarantine. In 14 days since their last contact with the man, seven of the staff members have shown no symptoms and will soon return to work. Three remain at home. None have actually been tested for the virus. The Japan Times points out, however, that some of the staff could be political journalists who attend briefings at the office of prime minister Shinzo Abe. When contacted by The Japan Times, Kyodo declined to comment on whether any of the workers are reporters. The death rate from the novel coronavirus has risen to 2.67%, based on today\u2019s official figures from China. That\u2019s based on 2,010 deaths worldwide and 75,199 confirmed cases. The rate was thought to be around 2%. I\u2019m not an expert in infectious diseases but that figure is growing. A second person has died from Covid-19 in Hong Kong, according to the South China Morning Post. The 70-year-old man had underlying health problems and was declared dead on Wednesday morning. He had visited the Chinese mainland in January. The territory has 62 confirmed cases. The team at Capital Economics have been producing charts tracking coal consumption and traffic congestion and other factors in China in an effort to give a picture of how the virus is affecting the economy. The official line from China is that much of the workforce is back in action and that targets can be hit. But there is a lot of evidence to suggest that things are far from being back to normal. Take this chart, for example, tracking coal consumption in power stations. It shows a slight pickup in the last few days but not much more. Electricity use is routinely used by economists as a proxy for economic activity in China as a counterpoint to official growth figures. The charts are compiled from sources such as WIND, a Chinese data tracker, and CEIC. This one on daily passenger traffic also shows a slight uptick but only just: And traffic congestion as garnered from Amap, China\u2019s version of Google Maps: More on the disembarking passengers from Justin in Tokyo: Japanese TV showed passengers leaving the ship late on Wednesday morning to board waiting buses. Local health authorities said about 500 passengers were expected to disembark on Wednesday, with around 2,500 others to follow over the next two days. Only those who tested negative and did not share cabins with infected passengers are being permitted to disembark, amid widening criticism of Japan\u2019s handling of the ship\u2019s quarantine. Anyone who has had contact with an infected passenger will have to undergo 14 more days in quarantine. In addition, the crew will begin a new quarantine when the last passenger has disembarked. The Diamond Princess has proved a fertile breeding ground for the virus with at least 542 positive cases \u2013 making the ship home to the largest cluster of infections outside mainland China. \u201cNEGATIVE! Me, son, husband, mom and dad! Thank you Lord for protecting us... So emotional now,\u201d tweeted passenger Yardley Wong, who has been cooped up with her six-year-old son. Those with no symptoms and a negative test received an official certificate saying they posed \u201cno risk of infection of nCoV, as the said person has also presented no symptoms including fever at the time of infection.\u201d Some in Japan have raised concerns about allowing people from the cruise ship to board flights home or spread out into crowded cities such as Tokyo, saying there was a chance that secondary infections had occurred on the ship during its 14-day quarantine. Several countries, including Britain, Hong Kong and Australia, appear to have lost patience with the on-board quarantine and have prepared chartered planes to bring back their citizens. More than 300 Americans were flown home on Monday, although 14 of the passengers tested positive during the evacuation. The US government has told Americans who chose to remain on the ship that they will not be allowed back into the country until they have completed another two weeks of quarantine after disembarking. Early Wednesday, South Korea flew six of its nationals plus a Japanese spouse to Seoul. They will be placed in isolation for 14 days, the Yonhap news agency reported. Other countries will require repatriated people to undergo another two weeks of quarantine after they return home. Beijing\u2019s leading medical adviser has warned that human-to-human transmission of Covid-19 has still not been stopped in Wuhan, the state-owned Global Times reports. Zhong told a press conference in Guangzhou on Tuesday that despite huge efforts to lock down the city of 11 million, the authorities had failed to separate patients from healthy people and to separate COVID-19 patients from flu patients. Yang Zhanqiu, deputy director of the pathogen biology department at Wuhan University, told the Global Times that transmission of the common flu had also worsened in Wuhan alongside the spread of Covid-19. \u201cThe human-to-human transmission of flu worsened the human-to-human transmission situation of novel coronavirus in Wuhan,\u201d Yang said, as it has made screening for coronavirus patients more difficult. The Global Times also reports criticism by local people of the authorities\u2019 response to the outbreak. One resident called Chen said residential areas were sealed off too late to stop the spread. \u201cOur community only arranged the collective purchase of daily necessities today, after it was completely locked down. A few days ago, I heard that people went to the supermarket nearby, which led to a public gathering,\u201d she said. \u201cLocal authorities acted too slowly, missing the best opportunity to contain the virus spread,\u201d she added. Justin McCurry, our man in Tokyo, has been speaking to a Japanese health expert who fears some of the cruise ship passengers could yet turn out to be carrying the virus: Kentaro Iwata, a specialist in infectious diseases at Kobe University Hospital in western Japan who spent several hours on the luxury cruise liner on Tuesday, told the Guardian that passengers cleared of the virus should continue to be monitored for another two weeks in case they develop symptoms of Covid-19. He told us: It is a good idea to allow people to disembark because conditions on the ship are dangerous, but it is possible that some people who recently tested negative could turn out to be positive. Certainly those who are due to leave should not be allowed to wander around freely. They have to be monitored so they can quickly receive medical treatment if they show symptoms. Passengers have begun leaving the Diamond Princess cruise ship after spending two weeks in quarantine off Yokohama, near Tokyo, public broadcaster NHK said. Around 500 people were expected to disembark on Wednesday with the entire process to be completed by Friday, NHK reported. The South Korean disease control centre (KCDC) has confirmed our earlier report that the country has 15 new cases of the virus, taking the total to 46. It says 13 cases were identified in Daegu and the surrounding North Gyeongbuk province about 250km south of the capital, Seoul. Eleven of the cases are linked to the 31st patient who is identified as a 60-year-old woman. She had been in a car accident and treated at a local hospital since 7 February. She developed the fever on 10 February and was tested for Covid-19 on Monday. She was confirmed positive on Tuesday and is now in isolation in hospital. She has not been abroad since December, 2019. An epidemiological investigation is currently underway. Ten of these people attend the same church as the woman, the KCDC said. Officials are in the process of finding out how another two people from the area were infected. Another new is the daughter of a previously confirmed case who has been hospitalised for treatment at Seoul National University Bundang hospital. The 15th new case is a 43-year-old man in Seongdong-gu, Seoul, who is being hospitalised for isolation. A countermeasures team has been dispatched to the Daegu area to implement emergency defense measures with the local government. China is doing its utmost to get its huge state-owned industrial sector back to work following the shutdowns amid the Covid-19 outbreak, state media reports. According to CGTN, the state council\u2019s assets supervision and administration commission (SASAC) said it would stick to this year\u2019s production targets and \u201cguide enterprises to resume work in a safe and orderly manner\u201d. Ren Hongbin, vice chairman of the SASAC, told media on Tuesday that more than 80% of state-owned enterprise (SOE) production subsidiaries had resumed operation, and more than 95% of the companies in the sectors of petroleum and petrochemical, communication, electricity and transport have resumed work. However, according to a report by the Financial Times on Tuesday, companies are having difficulty getting migrant workers back into their factories because of the travel restrictions imposed around the country. The newspaper claimed Foxconn\u2013 which manufactures for Apple \u2013 is struggling to get enough workers onto the iPhone assembly line at its plant in Zhengzhou, in China\u2019s Henan province. Many workers left the cities to return home for new year and are now unable to return to work because of compulsory quarantine in Foxconn dormitories. Henan has seen the most deaths of any province outside Hubei, with 19. The FT explains: The rooms, which usually pack in eight workers, had quickly filled, causing Foxconn to halt the return of additional staff, explained a Zhengzhou-based factory recruiter, who asked not to be named. \u201cThey don\u2019t have enough room,\u201d the recruiter said, adding that workers could now sign up and wait for quarantine availability. \u201cThere\u2019s no one snoring. There\u2019s no one bothering you. The internet is finally fast,\u201d said one worker of the comfortable conditions in quarantine. The seven other bunks in his dorm room \u2014 consisting of only wood planks without mattresses \u2014 were empty. Justin McCurry in Tokyo reports that a British couple did not after all test positive: David Abel, a British passenger onboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan, has said he and his wife Sally did not test positive for the coronavirus Covid-19 - as he had initially reported - and were still on the ship waiting to disembark. Abel, who said in a Facebook post on Tuesday that the couple had both tested positive, blamed the mix-up on communication problems with Japanese officials. \u201cSally &amp; I packed and waited 8 hours in the cabin to be transported to a hostel. We are still on the ship!\u201d he said in an update on Wednesday morning. \u201cThey do NOT send folk with the virus to a hostel! Massive communication error yesterday. The Japanese quarantine officials to not speak any English. They came to our door &amp; told us to be ready to be taken to the hostel. My mindset was \u2018virus\u2019 and said \u2018positive then\u2019. He nodded. I don\u2019t think he was saying yes to the virus but positive we were moving out?? He followed up by saying it will probably be just 4 or 5 days. You would not say that to a virus victim.\u201d Abel said he and Sally were being helped by the British embassy in Tokyo, adding: I am being listened to and Sally &amp; I feel really well. I will get more info out when I know what\u2019s happening. Thank you for your love and concern. Sally &amp; David xx\u201d Japan\u2019s health ministry said on Wednesday that Diamond Princess passengers who tested negative and had not shared a cabin with someone who tested positive would start leaving the ship around mid-morning after spending two weeks in quarantine. The ministry said the disembarkation would be completed by Friday. More than 500 of the 3,700 passengers and crew originally on the Diamond Princess have been diagnosed with Covid-19, making it home to the largest cluster of infections outside mainland China. Some experts have criticised quarantine conditionsonboard the ship, fearing it has become an incubator for the virus. The luxury cruise liner was placed in lockdown at the port of Yokoyama early this month after it emerged that a passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong tested positive for the virus at the end of last month. Sticking with South Korea, the finance minister has outlined some emergency funding measures to prop up the local economy, which is very exposed to the slowdown in China. Hong Nam-ki said: The government will provide 100bn won (US$84m) in reserve funds to help local authorities stem the spread of the virus. Small tourism businesses will receive a total of 50bn won of credit-based loans with a 1% interest rate. 300bn won worth of support for low-cost airlines suffering liquidity shortages. South Korea has 15 new cases of the coronavirus and will announce the positive test results later on Wednesday, according to Yonhap news agency, which cited unnamed health officials. The new cases are in the city of Daegu and the surrounding North Gyeongsang province, Yonhap said. Health officials declined to confirm the Yonhap report, Reuters said. There have been 31 cases of Covid-19 in South Korea as of Tuesday. It comes as South Korean citizens arrived back in the country after being evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Stock markets in Asia are in positive territory today after a dip yesterday caused largely by Apple\u2019s shortages warning. Sydney is up 0.15%, Tokyo is 0.4% to the good and Seoul is 0.5% better off. In case you missed it, our economics editor Larry Elliott has been looking at what Apple\u2019s warning tells us about the impact of the virus on the Chinese and global economies. Covid-19 is unusual because it is both a demand and a supply shock to Apple, he writes, with shoppers in China unable to get out and the supply of devices mostly made in China now drying up because of factory closures. So far financial markets have \u201cblithely asumed\u201d that everything will be back to normal, Larry writes, but Germany, Japan and China \u2013 the top three economies behind the US \u2013 are all struggling and former two could be in recession soon. There are also signs the US economy might not be as strong as the occupant of the White House thinks. He concludes with a grim warning of his own: Bulls in the financial market have seen every dip in share prices as a buying opportunity, primarily because they are confident that the Federal Reserve and other central banks will step in and provide ample stimulus if things start to look grim. In the short-term, the bulls are right. In the long term, central banks will be legitimising reckless behaviour and risking the crash to end all crashes. Here\u2019s the full article: Reuters has the latest health commission numbers. It says 2,004 people have died from the virus in mainland China, making a total around the world of 2,009 by my reckoning. Confirmed cases on the mainland are 74,185. When you add Taiwan (22) and Hong Kong (62) that\u2019s a total of 74,279. Globally the total is 75,152. The NHC website still hasn\u2019t updated its daily briefing page. Chinese media are reporting that the total deaths from the virus are now more than 2,000. I\u2019m hoping to get the official confirmation of national health commission figures shortly but Tencent reports 2,003 deaths in mainland China with one in Hong Kong. There have been four more deaths around the world. The Johns Hopkins University tracker puts the total deaths, including those around the world, at 2,007, so there\u2019s a discrepancy of one between the two figures. Total cases in mainland China stands at 74,139, according to Johns Hopkins. Looking at more depth at the latest health figures from Hubei shows that deaths in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, rose markedly on Tuesday with 116 new fatalities, up from 72 on Monday. A total of 1,497 people have now died from the virus in Wuhan. New confirmed cases in Wuhan stood at 1,660, up from 1,600 on Monday. Welcome to our rolling coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the main points today: Another 132 people have died from the virus in Hubei as of midnight on Tuesday, the provincial health commission has said on Wednesday morning, making a total of 1,921. That represents a jump from 93 deaths recorded on Monday, or a rise of more than 40%. The number of new cases in the province is 1,693, taking the total to 61,682. It is the lowest number since 11 February and the second consecutive day below 2,000. The other main developments are: After a 14-day quarantine, passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship are preparing disembark if they have tested negative. Flights from nations including the UK and Australia will be standing by to take them home. Fourteen South Korean passengers and crew arrived back home on Wednesday morning on the presidential jet, Yonhap news agency said Chinese people in Britain have reported a rise in abuse relating to the virus A Chinese film director and his family are among the latest victims of the virus The UK\u2019s largest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, has warned it is running out of parts for its factories. Stocks on Wall Street and in Europe fell after Apple\u2019s warning about a shortage of iPhones And our health editor Sarah Boseley has been analysing how China\u2019s handling of the outbreak has created a diplomatic balancing act for the WHO",

We hope the flight will be later this week, subject to permissions from the Japanese authorities.</p> \n<p>\u201cHowever there is a chance that people who disembark will not be able to join the evacuation flight. We have the utmost concern for the affected Britons and strongly encourage them to register for the evacuation flight.\u201d</p> \n<p>Later, the government confirmed those Britons who are repatriated will be monitored and taken to Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral for two weeks. Anyone who develops symptoms during the flight will be taken to hospital.</p> \n<p>A British couple who have been putting pressure on the UK government to organise a repatriation flight will not be on the plane after testing positive for the new coronavirus.</p> \n<p>David and Sally Abel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/18/britain-to-evacuate-citizens-from-coronavirus-hit-cruise-ship-diamond-princess\">were diagnosed with the infection</a> just one day before the ship\u2019s quarantine was due to end.</p> \n<p>The couple, who are in their 70s, have been documenting their ordeal through a video diary and in their latest post said they were pleased their efforts to bring about a British flight had paid off, despite the fact they will not be on it.</p> \n<p>They said they are being taken to a nearby hostel as there are no available hospital beds nearby.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/corona-19-feb-zip/giv-3902TCcE0XfgIVD0/\" data-alt=\"interactive\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/corona-19-feb-zip/giv-3902TCcE0XfgIVD0/\">interactive</a> \n</figure> \n<p>David said: \u201cWe are going to a hostel because there isn\u2019t a hospital bed anywhere around.

I\u2019m disappointed, it\u2019s like everyone going to a party and leaving you out,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>She also said the FCO sent a note stating it was unlikely they would be allowed out of Japan if they did not board the specific evacuation flight. There is no set date for the flight yet.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, hundreds of passengers began leaving the ship after testing negative for the coronavirus. Japanese TV showed passengers, who spent quarantine largely confined to their cabins, leaving the ship to board waiting buses, while others left the pier in Yokohama, near Tokyo, by taxi.</p> \n<p>Local health authorities said a little more than 500 passengers were expected to disembark on Wednesday, with another 2,500 to follow over the next two days. About half the passengers were Japanese, media reports said.</p> \n<p>Members of Japan\u2019s self-defence forces escorted some passengers, including an elderly man in a wheelchair who wore a face mask. Some of the people still on the ship waved from their cabin balconies as passengers disembarked below.</p> \n<p>The US has already evacuated 340 of its citizens from the ship and taken them back to America for further quarantine. Other countries, including Canada and Australia, have plans to fly back their citizens in the coming days.</p> \n<p>Questions continue to be raised about the effectiveness the cruise ship quarantine after the virus spread rapidly among those onboard.</p> \n<p>Prof Kentaro Iwata, a specialist in infectious diseases at Kobe University hospital, said the infection control onboard was \u201cchaotic\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>After spending time on the ship, Iwata told the Guardian: \u201cThe cruise ship was totally inadequate in terms of infection control. A lot of officials are insisting there have been no secondary infections aboard the ship [since quarantine began] \u2026 that is their best-case scenario and they are sticking to that. They don\u2019t want to accept that their plan has failed.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI never had a fear of getting an infection myself with Ebola or Sars because I know how to protect myself and how to protect others, and how the infection control should be,\u201d he said in a video post.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut inside the Princess Diamond I was so scared of getting Covid-19 because there was no way of telling where the virus was.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "British passengers stuck on the cruise ship in Japan where more than 600 people have been infected with the coronavirus have have been told to stay onboard by the Foreign Office, while those who are evacuated face a 14-day quarantine in the UK. Japanese authorities said those who had tested negative for the virus were allowed to leave on Wednesday, but the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) warned that passengers who disembark may not be allowed to board a British evacuation flight scheduled for later this week. An FCO statement read: \u201cWe are planning an evacuation flight from Tokyo to the UK as soon as possible for Britons who are on the Diamond Princess. We hope the flight will be later this week, subject to permissions from the Japanese authorities. \u201cHowever there is a chance that people who disembark will not be able to join the evacuation flight. We have the utmost concern for the affected Britons and strongly encourage them to register for the evacuation flight.\u201d Later, the government confirmed those Britons who are repatriated will be monitored and taken to Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral for two weeks. Anyone who develops symptoms during the flight will be taken to hospital. A British couple who have been putting pressure on the UK government to organise a repatriation flight will not be on the plane after testing positive for the new coronavirus. David and Sally Abel were diagnosed with the infection just one day before the ship\u2019s quarantine was due to end. The couple, who are in their 70s, have been documenting their ordeal through a video diary and in their latest post said they were pleased their efforts to bring about a British flight had paid off, despite the fact they will not be on it. They said they are being taken to a nearby hostel as there are no available hospital beds nearby. David said: \u201cWe are going to a hostel because there isn\u2019t a hospital bed anywhere around. In four or five days we will be removed from the hostel and put into hospital where we will receive treatment. \u201cSo I can\u2019t see there\u2019s going to be any way we\u2019re on that flight to the UK.\u201d Speaking to the BBC, their son, Steve Abel, said: \u201cThey\u2019re being messed about [\u2026] I just want someone to take care of them.\u201d Another British passenger, Elaine Spencer, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that those wanting to board the evacuation flight later in the week have to sign an agreement that they will go into quarantine for 14 days once back in the UK. \u201cWe know we won\u2019t be going today, I reckon it\u2019s going to be the end of the week, if not longer. I\u2019m disappointed, it\u2019s like everyone going to a party and leaving you out,\u201d she said. She also said the FCO sent a note stating it was unlikely they would be allowed out of Japan if they did not board the specific evacuation flight. There is no set date for the flight yet. On Wednesday, hundreds of passengers began leaving the ship after testing negative for the coronavirus. Japanese TV showed passengers, who spent quarantine largely confined to their cabins, leaving the ship to board waiting buses, while others left the pier in Yokohama, near Tokyo, by taxi. Local health authorities said a little more than 500 passengers were expected to disembark on Wednesday, with another 2,500 to follow over the next two days. About half the passengers were Japanese, media reports said. Members of Japan\u2019s self-defence forces escorted some passengers, including an elderly man in a wheelchair who wore a face mask. Some of the people still on the ship waved from their cabin balconies as passengers disembarked below. The US has already evacuated 340 of its citizens from the ship and taken them back to America for further quarantine. Other countries, including Canada and Australia, have plans to fly back their citizens in the coming days. Questions continue to be raised about the effectiveness the cruise ship quarantine after the virus spread rapidly among those onboard. Prof Kentaro Iwata, a specialist in infectious diseases at Kobe University hospital, said the infection control onboard was \u201cchaotic\u201d. After spending time on the ship, Iwata told the Guardian: \u201cThe cruise ship was totally inadequate in terms of infection control. A lot of officials are insisting there have been no secondary infections aboard the ship [since quarantine began] \u2026 that is their best-case scenario and they are sticking to that. They don\u2019t want to accept that their plan has failed.\u201d \u201cI never had a fear of getting an infection myself with Ebola or Sars because I know how to protect myself and how to protect others, and how the infection control should be,\u201d he said in a video post. \u201cBut inside the Princess Diamond I was so scared of getting Covid-19 because there was no way of telling where the virus was.\u201d",

Australia Tony Abbott was asked to consider registering as an agent of foreign influence, after he spoke at a conference organised by the Hungarian government in praise of the country\u2019s far-right prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n. The registry is run by the attorney general\u2019s office to trace foreign influence on Australian politics, with Abbott\u2019s address at the Conservative Political Action Conference, an event affiliated with US conservative politics, also potentially requiring the former prime minister to register. Liberal MP Lucy Wicks has denied a conflict of interests, after the leader of a wealthy Pentecostal church who had described her as a \u201cdear friend\u201d was awarded a $8,580 grant to soundproof its auditorium under the Stronger Communities scheme. Child protection advocates have condemned Andrew Bolt\u2019s use of the phrase \u201chit on\u201d to describe the sexual grooming of a year 9 school boy by his athletics coach, saying the language was inappropriate and minimised the seriousness of the offence. Software billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and his wife Annie have promised up to $12m to install solar and battery systems in communities disconnected from the electricity grid by bushfire or flood. The world Iran has announced the death of two citizens from the coronavirus, while a leading economic forecaster has predicted the disease could cost the global economy more than $1tn in lost output if it turns into a pandemic. Bernie Sanders has firmed strongly as the Democratic frontrunner in national opinion polls, with the Vermont senator soaring to 32% as Joe Biden tanked to 17%. Late runner Mike Bloomberg rose 6% to third with 14% ahead of Elizabeth Warren, who remained unchanged on 11% support. Brussels has dispelled the UK\u2019s hopes of a post-Brexit, Canada-style trade deal with the EU, with chief negotiator Michel Barnier warning that the UK\u2019s \u201cparticular proximity\u201d meant it could not hope for similar advantages as the North American nation. Lingerie giant Victoria\u2019s Secret has come under fire for excessive waste within the fashion industry, after hundreds of bras were found dumped in a bin, not far from one of its stores in Colorado. Recommended reads \u201cMost people in the UK assume Australia is quite enlightened \u2026 so it\u2019s shocking to read about what is happening on offshore detention centres\u201d. That\u2019s the discovery of British actor Dominic West, who stars alongside Cate Blanchett in the new series, Stateless, a star-laden six-episode deep dive into Australia\u2019s controversial immigration policies, writes Clarissa Sebag-Montefiore. Private sector wage growth is stagnant and the government\u2019s predicted 3% growth figures seems increasingly far away, writes Greg Jericho. \u201cLow wages have become the norm, and worryingly they appear to have peaked at a level that in the past would have been considered disastrous.\u201d So, what hope is there for imminent wages growth? Well, unless unemployment drops dramatically, not a lot. Hell is other people in confined spaces \u2013 if you question that, a long-haul flight in economy might remind you of the worst of humanity, writes Jo Tovey. But \u201ccramming\u201d frustration is happening everywhere. \u201cWe jostle and squabble in queues at underfunded public services. We grow irritated stuck on buses behind streams of slow cyclists.\u201d But sometimes seeing each others\u2019 humanity can be the key. Listen Throughout 2019, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign spent nearly $20m on Facebook ads. So what makes Trump voters tick, and click? On this episode of Today in Focus, Rachel Humphreys speaks with Guardian US\u2019s tech reporter Julia Carrie Wong. Sport Former Socceroos coach Ange Postecoglou has handed A-League sides a dose of reality after his side Yokohama F. Marinos beat Sydney FC 4-0 in the ACL Champions League. But more bad news could be in store \u2013 as Australia\u2019s ranking within Asia\u2019s elite plummets dramatically. Manchester City\u2019s chief executive has hit out over the club\u2019s two-year Champions League ban, claiming Uefa\u2019s decision is \u201cless about justice and more about politics\u201d. The club were fined \u20ac30m, but as Jamie Jackson writes, maintain their innocence. Media roundup A suspected spy who tried to get a Chinese agent inside federal parliament was able to leave Australia after undergoing questioning, claims the Age, suggesting a significant gap in national security legislation.
