The new governor is no stranger to baptisms of fire as he prepares to replace Mark Carney in the hot seat, having started his last job \u2013 as boss of the Financial Conduct Authority \u2013 a week after the Brexit vote. This time around, the challenge appears far greater, following the biggest stock market crash since Black Monday in October 1987, as countries around the world step up their efforts to contain the coronavirus, with dramatic consequences for households and businesses. On his agenda from day one at Threadneedle Street will be the task of calming the markets and shoring up confidence in the British economy, amid rising levels of concern about the path ahead. The coming week is expected to be another volatile one for financial markets and a significant test for the new governor. The odds are mounting that the US Federal Reserve will slash interest rates on Wednesday, following its emergency cut in borrowing costs earlier this month.

      "body": "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Donald Trump given coronavirus all clear</h2> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s physician, Sean Conley, has confirmed the US president does not have Covid-19. A memo from Conley said that the president had agreed to be tested for the virus following an \u201cin-depth discussion\u201d on Friday night. A week earlier he had dinner with a Brazilian official who later tested positive. Earlier on Saturday, vice-president Mike Pence announced that the country\u2019s European travel ban would be extended to the UK and Ireland from midnight on Monday (eastern standard time).</p> <h2>NHS and private hospitals join forces to fight coronavirus</h2> <p>The NHS is to form an unprecedented partnership with the private health sector this week in an emergency plan to combat the Covid-19 crisis, amid fears the UK\u2019s publicly funded hospitals will be unable to cope with the number of patients. Meanwhile, a group of more than 200 UK scientists have denounced the government\u2019s plan to achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d by delaying measures to prevent the virus spreading. The group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/14/scientists-urge-government-to-enforce-social-distancing-now\">said that enforcing social distancing now</a> could save \u201cthousands of lives\u201d.</p> <h2>Lockdown announced in Spain</h2> <p>The Spanish government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/spain-government-set-to-order-nationwide-coronavirus-lockdown\">formally declared</a> a state of emergency over the coronavirus, placing the country in lockdown and ordering people to stay at home for the next two weeks unless they have to buy food or medicine or go to work or hospital. The measures are set to come into effect on Monday morning and follow the example set by France hours earlier, which announced the closure of all \u201cnon-essential\u201d public places from midnight on Saturday. Restaurants, cafes, cinemas and discos will be closed under the measures. Pharmacies and places selling other basic necessities will be exempted.</p> <h2>Spanish PM\u2019s wife tests positive for coronavirus</h2> <p>The Spanish government announced that the prime minister\u2019s wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Both Gomez and her husband, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, are doing well and remain at their official residence in Madrid, the Moncloa palace, the government said in a statement.</p> <h2>Israel proposes use of anti-terrorism tracking tech</h2> <p>Israel has \u2013 like France and Spain \u2013 announced a partial closure of the country, shutting hotels, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and malls. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu added that he hopes to deploy anti-terrorism tracking technology to locate people who have been in contact with those carrying the virus. He said he had requested Justice Ministry approval because such measures could infringe patients\u2019 privacy. \u201cThe enemy is invisible, but we must locate it,\u201d Netanyahu said.</p> <h2>Colombia closes border with Venezuela and Ecuador bans foreigners</h2> <p>Colombia closed its border with Venezuela in order to stem the spread of Covid-19 in the South American nation. The move to shut the border came overnight, after Venezuela \u200bconfirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 on Friday morning. Colombia currently has 22 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but its government appears to view Venezuela \u2013 with fewer cases \u2013 as a possible centre\u200b of an outbreak in Latin America. Meanwhile, Ecuador announced it would ban foreigners from entering the country by land, sea or air. Citizens and residents will be able to enter until Monday, after which they will also face restrictions. Gatherings larger than 30 people have also been banned.</p> <h2>State of emergency announced in Libya</h2> <p>Libya\u2019s Tripoli-based Government of National Accord has declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus and will close all air and sea ports from Monday, prime minister Fayez al-Serraj said on Saturday.

      "bodyText": "Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Donald Trump given coronavirus all clear Donald Trump\u2019s physician, Sean Conley, has confirmed the US president does not have Covid-19. A memo from Conley said that the president had agreed to be tested for the virus following an \u201cin-depth discussion\u201d on Friday night. A week earlier he had dinner with a Brazilian official who later tested positive. Earlier on Saturday, vice-president Mike Pence announced that the country\u2019s European travel ban would be extended to the UK and Ireland from midnight on Monday (eastern standard time). NHS and private hospitals join forces to fight coronavirus The NHS is to form an unprecedented partnership with the private health sector this week in an emergency plan to combat the Covid-19 crisis, amid fears the UK\u2019s publicly funded hospitals will be unable to cope with the number of patients. Meanwhile, a group of more than 200 UK scientists have denounced the government\u2019s plan to achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d by delaying measures to prevent the virus spreading. The group said that enforcing social distancing now could save \u201cthousands of lives\u201d. Lockdown announced in Spain The Spanish government has formally declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus, placing the country in lockdown and ordering people to stay at home for the next two weeks unless they have to buy food or medicine or go to work or hospital. The measures are set to come into effect on Monday morning and follow the example set by France hours earlier, which announced the closure of all \u201cnon-essential\u201d public places from midnight on Saturday. Restaurants, cafes, cinemas and discos will be closed under the measures. Pharmacies and places selling other basic necessities will be exempted. Spanish PM\u2019s wife tests positive for coronavirus The Spanish government announced that the prime minister\u2019s wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Both Gomez and her husband, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, are doing well and remain at their official residence in Madrid, the Moncloa palace, the government said in a statement. Israel proposes use of anti-terrorism tracking tech Israel has \u2013 like France and Spain \u2013 announced a partial closure of the country, shutting hotels, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and malls. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu added that he hopes to deploy anti-terrorism tracking technology to locate people who have been in contact with those carrying the virus. He said he had requested Justice Ministry approval because such measures could infringe patients\u2019 privacy. \u201cThe enemy is invisible, but we must locate it,\u201d Netanyahu said. Colombia closes border with Venezuela and Ecuador bans foreigners Colombia closed its border with Venezuela in order to stem the spread of Covid-19 in the South American nation. The move to shut the border came overnight, after Venezuela confirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 on Friday morning. Colombia currently has 22 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but its government appears to view Venezuela \u2013 with fewer cases \u2013 as a possible centre of an outbreak in Latin America. Meanwhile, Ecuador announced it would ban foreigners from entering the country by land, sea or air. Citizens and residents will be able to enter until Monday, after which they will also face restrictions. Gatherings larger than 30 people have also been banned. State of emergency announced in Libya Libya\u2019s Tripoli-based Government of National Accord has declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus and will close all air and sea ports from Monday, prime minister Fayez al-Serraj said on Saturday. Libya, split for years between rival governments that have been fighting a war for nearly a year, lacks adequate isolation and other facilities to combat the virus, the head of its disease control centre told Reuters on Thursday. Number of African countries to report Covid-19 cases rises Rwanda, Seychelles and Central African Republic confirmed their first coronavirus cases on Saturday \u2013 bringing the total number of African countries that have reported positive tests for the virus to 23. Sudan has ordered the closure of schools and universities for one month from Saturday to stop the spread of coronavirus, a statement from the prime minister\u2019s office said. Morocco has banned flights to and from as many as 25 countries.

on the situation in Colombia and Venezula from my Bogota-based colleague <strong>Joe Parkin Daniels</strong> :</p> \n  <p>Colombia overnight closed its border with Venezuela in order to stem the spread of Covid-19 in the South American nation, a move that is likely to have lasting ramifications given the scale of Venezuela\u2019s migration crisis.</p> \n  <p>About 4.5 million people have fled Venezuela which, despite boasting the planet\u2019s largest proven oil reserves, remains mired in years-long economic and social turmoil. Hyperinflation is rampant, with shortages in basic foodstuffs and medical supplies already a daily reality. Around 1.4 million of those that have left have arrived to Colombia, which shares a 1,378-mile border with Venezuela.</p> \n  <p>Authorities estimate as many as 40,000 people cross the border every day, the majority of which buy supplies - medicines and food staples - and return home.</p> \n  <p>The move to shut the border came overnight, after Venezuela confirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 on Friday morning.</p> \n  <p>The two countries broke diplomatic relations when Colombia ceased to recognise its embattled leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, as the country\u2019s legitimate president in early 2019, as part of an ongoing US-led coalition to oust him from office. Analysts say that will hamper coordination to contain a virus that does not respect borders.</p> \n  <p>Others worry that the closure will force desperate Venezuelans to cross informally, putting them at risk of armed groups operating along the border. </p> \n  <p>\u201cColombia\u2019s overnight decision to \u2018close\u2019 its porous border with Venezuela won\u2019t stop the flow of people,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GRamsey_LatAm/status/1238832345916071936\">tweeted</a> Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office on Latin America. \u201cBut it will force them to rely more on informal crossings where they\u2019ll be more vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Colombia currently has 22 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but its government appears to view Venezuela - with fewer cases - as a possible centre of an outbreak in Latin America. Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez, Colombia\u2019s president, described the closure in a statement as \u201ca measure of protection ahead of the situation unfolding in [Venezuela].\u201d</p> \n  <p>M\u00e1rquez also announced overnight a ban on travellers who have been in Europe or Asia in the last 14 days, with the exceptions of Colombian citizens and residents.</p> \n  <p>All measures are expected to last until 30 May.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T17:41:21.305Z\">at 5.41pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6d11628f085c6327bbff36\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T17:21:57.821Z\">5.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the UK, a newborn baby tested positive for coronavirus at a north London hospital <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/newborn-baby-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-in-london\">earlier today</a>. </p> \n  <p>The child\u2019s mother, who was taken to a north <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/london\">London</a> hospital days before the birth with suspected pneumonia, has also caught the virus.</p> \n  <p>Richard Tedder, visiting professor in medical virology, Imperial College London, said this raises \u201cconcerns about the potential ways in which this transmission may have occurred\u201d.</p> \n  <p>He told PA Media:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is important to say at this point in time that the detection of Covid-19 nucleic acid on the sample from the child does not necessarily mean that the child was infected. </p> \n   <p>It could well have come from the mother at the time of delivery, further follow-up of the infant will clarify whether or not the infant is infected.</p> \n   <p>Previous data from colleagues in China, published in the journal The Lancet, albeit on a small number of mother and infant pairs, did not show infection in any of the infants at the time of birth. Neither did sampling of breast milk immediately after birth contain detectable virus. Thus, the UK observation of a possible neonatal transmission is unexpected and needs further confirmation.</p> \n   <p>The question of risk to a newly born child being nursed by a mother who is known to be infected is a matter that will need careful consideration. </p> \n   <p>The absence of detectable virus in breast milk would appear to reduce the risk of breastfeeding however the close, intimate and entirely understandable contact between a mother and her baby will raise questions about how best to care for them. Compounding this too is the lack of knowledge of the clinical outcome of neonatal infection, should this actually occur.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6d10118f088d75755936d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T17:14:19.548Z\">5.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Italy\u2019s coronavirus death toll rose to 1,441 from 1,266 on Friday, according to official data.

The son developed symptoms a fortnight after returning to India. Officials are trying to trace the 1,500 people he may have been in contact with at the large plant where he worked. </p> \n  <p>Her family complained that the cemetery they took her to refused to cremate her. Crematoriums in India tended to be crowded and the staff felt at risk. It was only when doctors arrived to prescribe the right protocol that her last rites were performed. The number of coronavirus cases in India stands at 84.</p> \n  <p>With no hand sanitisers available, the New Delhi government has designated them \u2018essential commodities\u2019 so that anyone hoarding them or selling them at inflated prices can be punished by law.</p> \n  <p> As stories trickle in of some people concealing their travel history to affected areas or refusing to be tested and, if necessary, isolated, the Delhi government has also invoked the Epidemic Act. This allows district magistrates to take coercive action to isolate high-risk people. </p> \n  <p>The wife of a Google employee in Bengaluru, for example, fled her home and vanished last week. Officials found that she had flown to Delhi \u2013 at the other end of the country - and travelled by train to Agra to her parents\u2019 home.</p> \n  <p>Across many states, social life is being curbed with weddings, engagement ceremonies and birthday parties banned in the south Indian state of Karnataka. The message to Indians is to stay at home and avoid large gatherings. Several states have closed swimming pools, gyms, cinemas, night clubs, and theatres. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6ccf648f088d7575593533\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T12:40:21.340Z\">12.40pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A petition calling for the UK to go into lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus has reached more than 110,000 signatures, meaning it will be considered for parliamentary debate. </p> \n  <p>It encourages the UK to follow the containment procedures of countries that have been widely affected by the outbreak, by restricting unnecessary travel and discouraging public gatherings. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt is time the government should prioritise the health of the public and should consider how vital it is to implement effective containment now,\u201d the petition says. \u201cIt is better to spend money to contain the virus and treating the relatively low numbers who are ill now rather than wait for more casualties.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The government responds to all petitions with more than 10,000 signatures, and considers any petition with more than 100,000 signatures for parliamentary debate.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T12:41:07.909Z\">at 12.41pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6ccdf18f085c6327bbfd82\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T12:29:53.448Z\">12.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This video explores how Islam has been impacted by coronavirus.

Summary Donald Trump given coronavirus all clear. Donald Trump\u2019s physician, Sean Conley, has confirmed the US president does not have Covid-19. Earlier on Saturday, vice-president Mike Pence announced that the country\u2019s European travel ban would be extended to the UK and Ireland from midnight on Monday (eastern standard time). NHS and private hospitals join forces to fight coronavirus. The NHS is to form an unprecedented partnership with the private health sector this week in an emergency plan to combat the Covid-19 crisis, amid fears the UK\u2019s publicly-funded hospitals will be unable to cope with the number of coronavirus patients. A group of more than 240 UK scientists have denounced the government\u2019s plan to achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d by delaying measures to prevent the virus spreading. The group said that enforcing social distancing now could save \u201cthousands of lives\u201d. The Spanish government has formally declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus, placing the country in lockdown and ordering people to stay at home for the next two weeks unless they have to buy food or medicine or go to work or hospital. The measures are set to come into effect on Monday morning and follows in the example set by France hours earlier, which announced the closure all public places \u201cnon-essential\u201d from midnight on Saturday. Spanish PM\u2019s wife tests positive for coronavirus. The Spanish government announced that the prime minister\u2019s wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Both Gomez and her husband, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, are doing well and remain at their official residence in Madrid, the Moncloa palace, the government said in a statement. Israel proposes uses anti-terrorism tracking tech. Israel has \u2013 like France and Spain \u2013 announced a partial closure of the country, shutting down hotels, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and malls. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu added that he hopes to deploy anti-terrorism tracking technology to locate people who have been in contact with those carrying the virus. He said he had requested Justice Ministry approval because such measures could infringe patients\u2019 privacy.\u201cThe enemy is invisible, but we must locate it,\u201d Netanyahu said. Colombia closes border with Venezuela and Ecuador bans foreigners. Colombia overnight closed its border with Venezuela in order to stem the spread of Covid-19 in the South American nation. The move to shut the border came overnight, after Venezuela confirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 on Friday morning. Colombia currently has 22 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but its government appears to view Venezuela - with fewer cases - as a possible centre of an outbreak in Latin America. Meanwhile, Ecuador announced it would ban foreigners from entering the country by land, sea or air. Citizens and residents will be able to enter until Monday, after which they will also face restrictions. Gatherings larger than 30 people have also been banned. Libya\u2019s Tripoli-based Government of National Accord has declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus and will close all air and sea ports from Monday, prime minister Fayez al-Serraj said on Saturday. Libya, split for years between rival governments that have been fighting a war for nearly a year, lacks adequate isolation and other facilities to combat the virus, the head of its disease control centre told Reuters on Thursday. Rwanda, Seychelles and Central African Republic confirmed their first coronavirus cases on Saturday \u2013 bringing the total number of African countries that have reported positive tests for the virus to 23. Sudan has ordered the closure of schools and universities for one month from Saturday to stop the spread of coronavirus, a statement from the prime minister\u2019s office said. While Morocco has banned flight to and from as many as 25 countries. Global number of confirmed cases stands at 156,098, with 5,819 deaths. As of today 72,621 people have recovered, according to Johns Hopkins University. The institution runs a live tracker of coronavirus cases, based on official figures, meaning that the true figures may be somewhat higher. That is from me in London this evening. One of my colleagues will soon get going on a new liveblog to bring you all the latest developments in the coronavirus outbreak. A White House physician has issued a statement confirming that Donald Trump does not have Covid-19. It comes after the US president confirmed he had been tested for the virus at a press briefing earlier on Saturday. The Spanish government has just announced that the prime minister\u2019s wife, Bego\u00f1a G\u00f3mez, has tested positive for the coronavirus. Both Gomez and her husband, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, are doing well and remain at their official residence in Madrid, the Moncloa palace, the government said in a statement. Earlier this week, two of S\u00e1nchez\u2019s ministers also tested positive for the virus. Here is more heartening footage of a neighbourhood in Madrid spontaneously breaking into a round of applause in support of Spain\u2019s healthcare workers. It comes shortly after the Spanish government announced a nationwide lockdown would come into effect on Monday morning. The video is filmed by student Sam Llewellyn Smith, who is set to fly back to the UK tomorrow before the lockdown comes into effect. For more on the latest in Spain, read this report: Scientists warn against UK government\u2019s \u2018herd immunity\u2019 strategy More than 245 scientists and mathematicians have denounced the government\u2019s plan to achieve \u201cherd immunity\u201d by delaying measures to prevent the virus spreading, saying acting now would save \u201cthousands of lives\u201d. It comes as the NHS announced an unprecedented partnership with the private health sector in an emergency plan to combat the coronavirus crisis, as fears grow that publicly funded hospitals will soon be unable to cope with the number of patients suffering from the virus. My colleagues Denis Campbell, Toby Helm, Robin McKie and James Tapper have the full report: More details on the scientists\u2019 letter to the government, urging it to immediately enforce social distancing, can be found here: Details continue to emerge of Israel\u2019s plans to use anti-terrorism tracking technology to minimise the risk of coronavirus transmission. Cyber tech monitoring would be deployed to locate people who have been in contact with those carrying the virus, subject to cabinet approval, Netanyahu told a news conference in Jerusalem. \u201cWe will very soon begin using technology ... digital means that we have been using in order to fight terrorism,\u201d Netanyahu said. He said he had requested Justice Ministry approval because such measures could infringe patients\u2019 privacy. The Shin Bet, Israel\u2019s internal security service, confirmed that it was examining the use of its technological capabilities to fight coronavirus, at the request of Netanyahu and the Health Ministry. Avner Pinchuk, a privacy expert with the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, said such capabilities could include real-time tracking of infected persons\u2019 mobile phones to spot quarantine breaches and backtracking through meta-data to figure out where they had been and who they had contacted. \u201cI am troubled by this announcement. I understand that we are in unique circumstances, but this seems potentially like over-reach. Much will depend on how intrusive the new measures are,\u201d Pinchuk told Reuters news agency. The governor of Louisiana has confirmed the states\u2019 first coronavirus-related death \u2013 a 58-year-old with underlying health conditions. Twitter has created a new emoji to encourage handwashing during the coronavirus outbreak. Here is what they look like: Among the manufacturing firms taking part in Johnson\u2019s call will be Unipart Group, which makes precision parts and also manages large parts of the NHS warehousing and logistics chain. Unipart chairman John Neill said: \u201cThis is a critical initiative \u2013 there are a lot of talented people already working at a great speed on this, it has my and others\u2019 full-hearted support.\u201d Boris Johnson is calling on British manufacturers to boost production of ventilators and other medical equipment to prepare for a significant increase in the number of coronavirus cases. The prime minister has also warned private hospitals to prepare for an overspill of patients from the public health service. In a conference call on Monday, Boris Johnson will urge manufacturers to join a \u201cnational effort\u201d to tackle the virus. Engineers have already been asked to draw up plans to quickly produce more ventilators in the UK amid concerns that critical care facilities will come under intense pressure as the Covid-19 crisis intensifies. In Monday\u2019s call, the prime minister will confirm that the government will buy up stocks of new ventilators that can be produced. Sportswriter Jonathan Liew, in London, reflects on the dearth of sporting events amid the coronavirus pandemic. He writes: Things move pretty fast in the corona-verse: in the space of a fortnight we\u2019ve gone from ironic elbow-bumps in the pub to the postponement of virtually the entire sporting schedule, Euro 2020 potentially becoming Euro 2021, Mikel Arteta in quarantine. Every day, every hour seems to bring more jolts to a system that on some level we all took for granted. Read the full story: Libya\u2019s Tripoli-based Government of National Accord has declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus and will close all air and sea ports from Monday, prime minister Fayez al-Serraj said on Saturday. Serraj also said, in a broadcast address, that his internationally recognised government had earmarked 500 million Libyan dinars ($360.54 million) to combat the disease if it reached Libya, though no cases had been confirmed so far. Libya, split for years between rival governments that have been fighting a war for nearly a year, lacks adequate isolation and other facilities to combat the virus, the head of its disease control centre told Reuters on Thursday. Ecuador has announced sweeping restrictions, hours after the second person to die from Covid-19 in the Andean country was reported. Starting tonight, foreigners will be banned from entering Ecuador, whether that is by land, sea or air. Citizens and residents will be able to enter until Monday, after which they will also face restrictions. Gatherings larger than 30 people have also been banned. The bodies of those that die from the disease will be cremated. Ecuador\u2019s vice president Otto Sonnenholzner announced the measures \u2013 the strictest in South America \u2013 on Saturday. \u201cThis a problem for all of Ecuador, which could affect all of us,\u201d Sonnenholzner said at an emergency operations committee meeting in Quito on Saturday afternoon. The country has confirmed 28 cases and two deaths. From Madrid correspondent Sam Jones: Just had a wonderful moment at 10pm local time as neighbourhoods across Spain applauded and cheered all the people who work in the country\u2019s healthcare system. A bright moment amid the lockdown. Ireland\u2019s foreign affairs minister Simon Coveney has issued a travel advisory warning against all but essential travel to Czech Republic, Cyprus, Denmark, Malta, Poland, and Slovakia. He has also issued a telephone number for all Irish citizens impacted by flight cancellations. The Swedish government is advising its citizens against all non-necessary trips abroad, it said in a statement on Saturday. \u201cDue to the widespread spread of the new coronavirus and the rapidly changing and uncertain situation that exists for travellers, the ministry of foreign affairs advises against unnecessary travel to all countries,\u201d the government said. Madrid correspondent Sam Jones has the latest from Spain: The Spanish government has formally declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus, placing the country in lockdown and ordering people to stay at home for the next two weeks unless they have to buy food or medicine or go to work or hospital. Speaking after a seven-hour cabinet meeting on Saturday evening, the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said \u201cextraordinary decisions\u201d needed to be taken as Spain grappled with a \u201chealth, social and economic crisis\u201d. Spain is the country most affected by the coronavirus in Europe after Italy, and has so far confirmed 6,251 cases of the virus and 193 deaths. Italy has already taken similar measures. S\u00e1nchez said the central government would direct the response and that all the local, national and regional police forces would come under the command of the interior ministry. He also said that the army was standing by and ready to help with the emergency response. The prime minister confirmed that people would be required to stay home from Monday morning and that all non-essential shops would close, along with bars, restaurants, cafes and cinemas. Supermarkets, small food shops, pharmacies, petrols stations and pet supply shops are among those businesses that will remain open. He said: \u201cDuring the state of emergency, people will only be allowed out on to public streets for the following reasons: to buy food, basic or pharmaceutical items; to attend medical centres; to go to and from work; to look after children, older people or those with disabilities or who are especially vulnerable, and to attend financial or insurance offices on force majeure grounds.\u201d S\u00e1nchez acknowledged that the measures needed to tackle the coronavirus would have a \u201cbig economic impact\u201d but said the government was committed to mitigating its effects. Sudan has ordered the closure of schools and universities for one month from Saturday to stop the spread of coronavirus, a statement from the prime minister\u2019s office said. The statement said all public gatherings, such as weddings and social events, will also be banned. Meanwhile, Rwanda, Seychelles and Central African Republic confirmed their first coronavirus cases on Saturday \u2013 bringing the total number of African countries that have reported positive tests for the virus to 23. In case you missed it, here is a video from Saturday\u2019s White House briefing in which Donald Trump revealed he has been tested coronavirus. Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez has also announced that medium-distance rail transport will be reduced as part of the government\u2019s state of emergency measures. This restriction on freedom of movement will come into effect on Saturday. Sanchez added that it would not be reasonable to hold planned regional elections in Galicia and the Basque country amid the coronavirus lockdown. My colleague Oliver Holmes has the latest in Israel: Similar to France, Israel has announced a partial closure of the country, shutting down hotels, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and malls. Speaking on Saturday night at a news conference, prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said pharmacies, supermarkets and banks should continue to operate. He added people should remain two metres apart to prevent the spread of the virus. In an unclear move that raised immediate privacy issues, Netanyahu announced the government also intended to use technology developed for counter-terrorism to track people with the virus digitally. He said the decision depended on approval from the justice ministry. \u201cThe enemy is invisible, but we must locate it,\u201d Netanyahu said. There have been 193 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Israel, with no deaths, according to the health ministry. Spain to be placed under 15-day nationwide lockdown \u2013 Sanchez Spain is to be placed under nationwide lockdown as part of state emergency measures to control the spread of coronavirus, prime minister Pedro Sanchez has announced. Following in the footsteps of France, Sanchez said that shops will close for 15-days. Pharmacies and those selling other basic necessities will be exempted. He added that the crisis requires \u201cextraordinary decisions\u201d and confirmed that the government has agreed a state of emergency. Armed forces will be available to help in the response effort if needed. In case you are just tuning in, here is a round-up of the biggest developments in the coronavirus outbreak as of this evening. If there\u2019s anything I\u2019ve missed, please drop me a message on Twitter (@aaronwala). Due to the enormous interest in coronavirus, I won\u2019t be able to respond to everything, but I will do my best to take a look Morocco has suspended flights to and from at least 25 countries as the country\u2019s total number of confirmed coronavirus cases rose to 17. On Saturday Morocco\u2019s foreign ministry announced it would extend an earlier travel ban that covered China, Spain, Italy, France and Algeria. Other countries with which air travel is now suspended are Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chad, Denmark, Egypt, Germany, Greece, Jordan, Lebanon, Mali, Mauritania, Netherlands, Niger, Norway, Oman, Portugal, Senegal, Switzerland, Sweden, Tunisia, Turkey and the UAE. Morocco has closed all schools and cancelled gatherings of more than 50 people to stop the coronavirus spreading. One person has died and another has recovered from the virus. Dubai said on Saturday it was temporarily suspending operations at four major theme parks and tourist attractions until the end of March amid coronavirus concerns. The emirate\u2019s government media office said in a statement that Motiongate Dubai, Legoland Dubai, Legoland Waterpark Dubai and Bollywood Parks Dubai would be closed to ensure the health and safety of guests and employees. My colleague Kim Willsher has the latest from France: France has announced the closure of all places \u201cnon essential\u201d to public life including restaurants, cafes, cinemas and discos from midnight Saturday. \u201cWe must absolutely limit movement, meetings and contacts,\u201d French prime minister Edouard Philippe said on Saturday evening. Food shops, tobacconists, banks and public transport will remain open, he said. Philippe said the measure was being imposed after another meeting with the country\u2019s scientific committee. The announcement came as J\u00e9rome Salomon, director of the French health authority, confirmed the WHO\u2019s assessment, that Europe is \u201cthe epicentre of the epidemic\u201d. \u201cIn France, we are confronted with the start of a national epidemic with a rapid and intense spread in numerous zones,\u201d Salomon said. The first round of the municipal elections will still go ahead on Sunday. The UK\u2019s Foreign Office has said it is working to support Britons affected by the US\u2019s extended travel ban, which comes into effect from midnight on Monday (EST). \u201cThis is a decision for the US. We are working to provide as much information and support to affected British nationals as possible,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cWe continue to coordinate closely with the US and other international partners on the global response to coronavirus.\u201d The Embassy of Ireland in the USA tweeted to confirm the travel from the US to Ireland will continue: Irish airline Aer Lingus said: \u201cWe\u2019re assessing the impact of new US government restrictions announced today on travel from Ireland and the UK to the United States. \u201cWe will communicate directly with affected guests as soon as possible. \u201cAll travel before 31 May can be changed to a later date and/or destination. No change fees apply. A fare difference may apply.\u201d Lithuania will shut its borders to foreigners from Monday to try stop the spread of coronavirus, the government has said in a statement. France to close most shops, cafes, restaurants and cinemas \u2013 Philippe France will shut down cafes, shops, restaurants and cinemas to stem the spread of the coronavirus outbreak, prime minister \u00c9douard Philippe has announced. Philippe said public transport will be kept open but asked citizens to limit their use, Reuters news agency reported. The closures will come into effect at midnight on Saturday. He told a news conference that exceptions on the shop ban would include food stores, pharmacies and gas stations. Spain\u2019s government failed to agree on Saturday on a new package of economic and social measures to mitigate the impact of the fight against the coronavirus, a source close to the negotiations told Reuters. With schools shut across Spain and a first package of economic steps announced on Thursday, the government was expected to go further on Saturday. The source said ministers disagreed in a seven hour cabinet meeting on Saturday on what the new measures should be. The source added that the government would aim to agree on them on Tuesday. Prime minister Pedro Sanchez is due to announce emergency measures including the shutting down of most shops in a news conference scheduled for 8pm local time. France has reported a total of 4,499 confirmed coronavirus cases \u2013 up from 3,661 on Friday, according to official figures. Slovenia has recorded its first coronavirus-related death, according to national broadcaster TV Slovenia. A second patient has died of the Covid-19 virus in Ireland, the country\u2019s chief medical officer Tony Holohan told journalists on Saturday. The total number of confirmed cases in the country has increased to 129 from 90. Two people in the Seychelles have tested positive for coronavirus, the country\u2019s health commissioner has confirmed. Donald Trump confirmed that he had taken the test for coronavirus at a White House briefing today \u2013 although the result was not yet available. The news came just before vice-president Mike Pence clarified the existing US travel ban would be extended to the UK and Ireland to tackle the coronavirus outbreak. Read the full report from my colleagues in the US here. Norway will temporarily shut all its airports from Monday in a move to curb the spread of coronavirus the country\u2019s prime minister, Erna Solberg, said on Saturday. The government is ready to do all that is needed to secure Norway\u2019s economy, hit by business shutdowns due to the outbreak, and would seek to import medical equipment from China, Solberg told a news conference. The coronavirus death toll in Spain reached 190 on Saturday, up from 120 the day before. Kind-hearted people in the UK have been shrugging off the sense of apocalypse by offering to lend a helping hand to those in need, notifying them by dropping leaflets through their letterboxes. My colleague Simon Murphy reports: Here\u2019s the latest on the situation in Colombia and Venezula from my Bogota-based colleague Joe Parkin Daniels : Colombia overnight closed its border with Venezuela in order to stem the spread of Covid-19 in the South American nation, a move that is likely to have lasting ramifications given the scale of Venezuela\u2019s migration crisis. About 4.5 million people have fled Venezuela which, despite boasting the planet\u2019s largest proven oil reserves, remains mired in years-long economic and social turmoil. Hyperinflation is rampant, with shortages in basic foodstuffs and medical supplies already a daily reality. Around 1.4 million of those that have left have arrived to Colombia, which shares a 1,378-mile border with Venezuela. Authorities estimate as many as 40,000 people cross the border every day, the majority of which buy supplies - medicines and food staples - and return home. The move to shut the border came overnight, after Venezuela confirmed its first two cases of Covid-19 on Friday morning. The two countries broke diplomatic relations when Colombia ceased to recognise its embattled leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, as the country\u2019s legitimate president in early 2019, as part of an ongoing US-led coalition to oust him from office. Analysts say that will hamper coordination to contain a virus that does not respect borders. Others worry that the closure will force desperate Venezuelans to cross informally, putting them at risk of armed groups operating along the border. \u201cColombia\u2019s overnight decision to \u2018close\u2019 its porous border with Venezuela won\u2019t stop the flow of people,\u201d tweeted Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert at the Washington Office on Latin America. \u201cBut it will force them to rely more on informal crossings where they\u2019ll be more vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.\u201d Colombia currently has 22 confirmed cases of Covid-19, but its government appears to view Venezuela - with fewer cases - as a possible centre of an outbreak in Latin America. Iv\u00e1n Duque M\u00e1rquez, Colombia\u2019s president, described the closure in a statement as \u201ca measure of protection ahead of the situation unfolding in [Venezuela].\u201d M\u00e1rquez also announced overnight a ban on travellers who have been in Europe or Asia in the last 14 days, with the exceptions of Colombian citizens and residents. All measures are expected to last until 30 May. In the UK, a newborn baby tested positive for coronavirus at a north London hospital earlier today. The child\u2019s mother, who was taken to a north London hospital days before the birth with suspected pneumonia, has also caught the virus. Richard Tedder, visiting professor in medical virology, Imperial College London, said this raises \u201cconcerns about the potential ways in which this transmission may have occurred\u201d. He told PA Media: It is important to say at this point in time that the detection of Covid-19 nucleic acid on the sample from the child does not necessarily mean that the child was infected. It could well have come from the mother at the time of delivery, further follow-up of the infant will clarify whether or not the infant is infected. Previous data from colleagues in China, published in the journal The Lancet, albeit on a small number of mother and infant pairs, did not show infection in any of the infants at the time of birth. Neither did sampling of breast milk immediately after birth contain detectable virus. Thus, the UK observation of a possible neonatal transmission is unexpected and needs further confirmation. The question of risk to a newly born child being nursed by a mother who is known to be infected is a matter that will need careful consideration. The absence of detectable virus in breast milk would appear to reduce the risk of breastfeeding however the close, intimate and entirely understandable contact between a mother and her baby will raise questions about how best to care for them. Compounding this too is the lack of knowledge of the clinical outcome of neonatal infection, should this actually occur. Italy\u2019s coronavirus death toll rose to 1,441 from 1,266 on Friday, according to official data. The number of confirmed cases has risen to 21,157 from 17,660 over the same period. The filming in Mexico of a big budget Steven Spielberg-produced Amazon mini-series, starring Spanish actor Javier Bardem, has been suspended due to concerns about the coronavirus, according to a letter sent to cast and crew on Friday and seen by Reuters. The production entitled Mexica, which centers on the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, began filming two weeks ago on location in Mexico City. Mexico has so far confirmed 26 cases of coronavirus. Only a skeletal wrap crew will continue working through next week, and cast and crew were informed that production might resume in December depending on how the public health crisis develops. The project\u2019s budget is believed to be tens of millions of dollars, and dozens of local contractors will be affected by the suspension. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Latvia will also close its borders to all foreigners from Tuesday to stop the spread of the outbreak. Latvia has banned all public gatherings of more than 50 people, its prime minister, Arturs Kri\u0161j\u0101nis Kari\u0146\u0161, has announced. There are more than 2,200 coronavirus cases in the US but the country has not yet \u201creached peak\u201d of the outbreak, according to top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci. US vice-president Mike Pence has confirmed the country\u2019s travel ban will be extended to the UK and Ireland from midnight on Monday EST. He said: \u201cIn our taskforce meeting today the president has made a decision to suspend all travel to the UK and Ireland, effective midnight Monday night, eastern standard time.\u201d Mr Pence said there had been a \u201cunanimous recommendation\u201d from health experts to extend the travel ban. \u201cAmericans in the UK or Ireland can come home, legal residents can come home ... they will will be funnelled through specific airports and processed.\u201d Houthi rebels in control of northern Yemen have said that all passenger flights to and from the capital Sana\u2019a will be suspended for two weeks to prevent Covid-19 from reaching the country, where five years of war have already decimated healthcare infrastructure. The announcement is particularly painful for many Yemenis in poor health since medical evacuation flights have only just restarted after years of negotiations with the Saudi-led military coalition, which controls the country\u2019s airspace. Yemen, Libya and Syria - all of which have significant populations of displaced people and failing healthcare systems - are yet to announce any cases of the novel coronavirus. Warring parties have insisted that the three Middle Eastern nations remain free of the pandemic, despite fears from aid agencies that cases may be being covered up or the virus may already be present but undetected. For Yemen in particular, where over 3 million people are displaced and over a third of the population needs humanitarian aid, an outbreak of coronavirus could be catastrophic. Iran, one of the worst hit countries, has close ties to both the Houthi administration in Yemen and Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government in Syria. The Syrian regime said on Friday that schools would close and most public events are cancelled until further notice as a precautionary measure. Unconfirmed reports from doctors in Damascus suggest the Syrian capital may already be dealing with the virus. Here is the latest from Martin Pengelly, who is at the White House press conference: Donald Trump attended the press briefing and spoke first, wearing a blue \u201cUSA\u201d baseball cap and a suit and shirt but no tie. Eventually, he said he had taken a coronavirus test \u2013 a subject of contention for days after he had contact with a number of people who have since tested positive. The president opened by praising state and local measures around the coronavirus and the US taskforce, members of which were ranged behind him at the podium. He also thanked members of Congress for passing a coronavirus economic relief bill on Friday night. It still has to pass the Senate. Trump thanked Steven Mnuchin, his treasury secretary who negotiated the bill with Nancy Pelosi. He did not directly thank the House speaker. He also boasted about the effect on the stock markets of his Friday Rose Garden press conference, in which he declared a national emergency and announced measures to prepare for the pandemic, but also made a series of claims which were immediately questioned and attacked a reporter who asked about cuts to White House pandemic preparedness teams. Behind Trump stood surgeon general Jerome Adams, Dr Deborah Birx, housing secretary Ben Carson and Medicare and Medicaid administrator Seema Verma and Dr Anthony Fauci, all for the most part expressionless. Trump tried to leave without answering questions but was kept in the room. \u201cBy the way, I had my temperature taken coming into the room \u2026 and I also took the test,\u201d he said. He did not reveal the result. Trump also explained why he continues to shake people by the hand, as he did conspicuously in the Friday press conference. \u201cMaybe people shouldn\u2019t be shaking hands for the long term,\u201d the famous germaphobe said, though he said he still did it because he had to, as president, as people expected it. Donald Trump is asked whether he is going to extend the Europe travel ban to the UK and Ireland. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re looking at it very seriously because they have had a little bit of activity unfortunately. We actually have looked at it already and that is going to be announced.\u201d Donald Trump has been asked why he has still been shaking people\u2019s hands at press conference, contrary to official guidance. He said: \u201cPeople come up to me \u2026 they put their hands out. It\u2019s sort of a natural reflex. We\u2019re all getting out of that.\u201d The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in Lombardy, the Italian region that has been worst affected by the crisis, rose by 76 to 966 on Saturday, according to the region\u2019s senior health official Giulio Gallera. The number of new cases rose by 1,865 to 11,685, he told a news conference. The latest national death toll is due to be released later in the day. On Friday, the Italy-wide tally stood at 1,266. Denmark has confirmed its first coronavirus-related death, according to Reuters. Vice-president Mike Pence is about to speak at a press briefing at the White House. Reporters had their temperatures taken as they arrived and one was turned away, US media said. Ahead of the press conference, Reuters reported that the US government was set to announce an expansion of its travel ban on most European countries to include the UK and Ireland. Donald Trump originally announced the 30-day ban for travellers from 26 countries, which took effect at midnight on Friday. Hi, it\u2019s Aaron Walawalkar here taking over the coronavirus live blog in London. I\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak, as Reuters reports that US travel restrictions on Britain and Ireland are likely to come into effect on Monday night. If you spot anything I miss, do drop me a message on Twitter @aaronwala. Due to the enormous interest in coronavirus, I won\u2019t be able to respond to everything, but I will do my best to take a look. Thanks in advance! I\u2019m handing over the blog now. Thank you very much to all those who got in touch with information. Here\u2019s some of the key updates so far: Syria has shut schools and cancelled events, but still insists it has no cases. A further 10 people have died in the UK since yesterday, almost doubling the death toll from 11 to 21. Jordan is stopping all flights in and out of the country. The Spanish government is set to announce a national lockdown, which would require all citizens to stay at home unless they need food, medical supplies or emergencies. Authorities in Madrid have told residents to stay at home, as Seville cancel Holy Week celebrations. India has announced that it will treat coronavirus as a notified disaster, which will enable it to take greater measures as part of the state disaster response fund. In China, the number of new coronavirus cases brought to the mainland from overseas has exceeded the number of locally transmitted infections, for the first time. Indonesia\u2019s capital, Jakarta, will shut schools and organise remote teaching for a minimum of two weeks. Cambodia has banned entry of visitors from Italy, Germany, Spain, France and the US. Austria has announced a 4bn euros ($4.4bn) aid package available to deal with the economic impact of coronavirus. Here is the most recent summary of confirmed cases and deaths from Reuters, and this article gives a slightly deeper summary with the biggest stories as of a few hours ago: As concerns are growing amongst tenants, who fear they might be unable to pay rent if they can\u2019t work due to coronavirus, renters\u2019 organisations in the UK have called for a suspension of rent payments during the outbreak. London Renters Union has sent an open letter to the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, urging him to join them in fighting to end rent payments and evictions, housing the homeless to protect them against the pandemic, and ensuring that homes are fit for people to self-isolate in. In Edinburgh, the city\u2019s tenants union has highlighted that landlords with buy-to-let mortgages could be allowed to stop paying their mortgage during the outbreak, but still claim money off tenants. They are concerned that renters may be forced to work during the pandemic to keep a roof over their heads. Here is the latest from Greece, from my colleague Helena Smith. Greece has announced it is halting all remaining flights to Italy following a mini-cabinet meeting chaired by prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. It was also decided to further bolster Greece\u2019s health system by hiring hundreds more doctors and nurses to cope with demands posed by coronavirus. Hospitals nationwide were at the sharp end of budget cuts ordered by international creditors in return for rescue loans during the country\u2019s long-running debt crisis. Greek authorities have confirmed 190 Covid-19 cases so far but the number is likely to rise when new figures are released later today. The death toll rose to three this morning. The government spokesman, Stelios Petsas, announced he was going into self-imposed isolation and would be working from home after his wife was diagnosed with the virus. Almost all of downtown Athens now resembles a ghost town. Streets in the ancient Plaka district beneath the Acropolis were eerily empty with cafes and tavernas boarded up and closed. Archaeological sites were also shut until 30 March. The Olympic flame, which was lit in ancient Olympia on Thursday for the Tokyo 2020 games \u2013 and in more normal times would now be on a cross-country relay \u2013 arrived at Athens\u2019 Kallimarmaro stadium this afternoon, five days ahead of schedule after the race was cancelled because of public health fears. It will remain in the stadium until it is handed over to the Organising Committee Tokyo 2020 on 19 March. Like other archaeological sites, the stadium is closed. Egypt is set to close all schools and universities for two weeks, Reuters are reporting. Hundreds of members of the scientific community have sent two open letters to the British government, voicing their concerns about the response to the coronavirus outbreak. One comes from 198 academics in the field of maths and science, calling for urgent measures of social distancing across the UK. It says: \u201cGoing for \u2018herd immunity\u2019 at this point does not seem a viable option, as this will put NHS at an even stronger level of stress, risking many more lives than necessary.\u201d Another letter has been signed by 164 behavioural scientists. It raises concerns about the idea of \u201cbehavioural fatigue\u201d \u2013 the idea that if the public are instructed to take preventative measures too early, they\u2019ll eventually revert back to prior behaviour. The letter suggests that this has been a cornerstone of British government policy on coronavirus and sheds doubt on the evidence behind this. \u201cWhile we fully support an evidence-based approach to policy that draws on behavioural science, we are not convinced that enough is known about \u2018behavioural fatigue\u2019 or to what extent these insights apply to the current exceptional circumstances,\u201d it says. \u201cIf \u2018behavioural fatigue\u2019 truly represents a key factor in the government\u2019s decision to delay high-visibility interventions, we urge the government to share an adequate evidence base in support of that decision. If one is lacking, we urge the government to reconsider these decisions,\u201d it ends. Here\u2019s another video from Italy, where neighbours are playing music together from their apartment, whilst they are in quarantine. Syria has shut schools, cancelled most public events, and reduced public sector hours to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The Health Ministry said the steps were \u201cpreventative\u201d and \u201cprecautionary\u201d and intended to raise the health sector\u2019s readiness to control the virus should it emerge, and says there have been no cases in the country. There\u2019s a very sweet video on Twitter showing a young boy in Milan, Italy, shouting from the balcony of his home to the Red Cross, who are are bringing food to doctors. It translates roughly as \u201cthanks and good job\u201d. Northern Ireland schools will be closed for \u201cat least 16 weeks\u201d but they will they will not be shutting immediately, the region\u2019s first minister, Arlene Foster, has said after a summit with the Ireland\u2019s taoiseach, Leo Varadkar. The disclosure gives a glimpse of the scale of coronavirus crisis to come and will lead to questions as to whether a four-month schools closure is being planned for the rest of the UK. Foster confirmed that schools in Northern Ireland will close at some point in an effort to stem the spread of the virus but it was a matter of timing. We\u2019ll have a full report soon. The Middle Eastern kingdom Jordan says it will suspend all passenger flights in and out of the country from Tuesday, according to a government statement just issued. Schools and universities will be closed and so will tourist sites including Petra as part of a number of proposals to limit public gatherings in the country. The measures may seem onerous, given Jordan has a single confirmed case of the virus - a citizen who returned from Italy and was identified as being infected on 2 March. But earlier today the Canadian government announced that one of its citizens who recently returned from Jordan had tested positive, raising the possibility there are undetected cases here. The tour guide who showed the woman around has been quarantined but there\u2019s no idea yet how the Canadian contracted the disease. Jordan will would stop all incoming and outgoing passenger flights into the country from Tuesday, the prime minister, Omar Razzaz, has confirmed. He also said that universities and schools would be closed for two weeks, with all tourist sites, sports and cinemas also set to close. Jordan had one confirmed Covid-19 case, but this was successfully treated and the patient left hospital on Friday. It had already closed its borders with Egypt, Iraq, Syria and the occupied Palestinian territories and Israel. The number of coronavirus cases in South Africa has risen to 38, up from 24 a day earlier, the ministry of health has said. As of 9am on Saturday, there were 1,140 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK, and 21 deaths, Public Health England has confirmed. This is an increase of 342, and ten further deaths, since yesterday. 37,746 people have been tested, of which 36,606 were confirmed negative. Ten more patients who tested positive for the coronavirus have died, bringing the death toll in the UK to 21, NHS England has said. The first minister of Northern Ireland, Arlene Foster, has said that when schools in Northern Ireland are closed, they will remain shut for a minimum of 16 weeks. The Welsh Rugby Union has suspended all events until the 30 March. My colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll is at the press conference with Irish politicians following their meeting on coronavirus. She is live tweeting the event, and you can follow her @lisaocarroll for breaking updates from there. All parties have said they accept that schools will close, it is now a matter of when. The health minister has said that Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are going to launch joint \u2018awareness campaigns\u2019, and added that individuals must take personal responsibility to stop the spread of the virus. The number of coronavirus cases in the Netherlands has risen by 155 to 959, with two further deaths. Dubai has cancelled all events planned in March and has banned hotels from hosting weddings, Reuters is reporting. The Spanish government have drafted a decree to put the country into lockdown, according to reports in the Spanish media. The reports say that Spaniards will be told to stay home except to buy food or medical supplies, go to hospital, work or in the case of other emergencies. I\u2019ll update you when we get official confirmation on this. Germany is urging people returning from Italy, Switzerland and Austria to self-isolate for up to two weeks, in an attempt to slow the spread of coronavirus. \u201cEspecially travellers and skiers returning from Switzerland, Italy and Austria should stay at home as far as possible for up to two weeks, even without symptoms,\u201d the health minister, Jens Spahn tweeted. As of Friday, there were 3,062 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Germany, with five deaths, the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases said. This photograph of a Tesco store, in Colney Hatch, London has been circulating on Twitter. Michelle Davies, who took the photograph, described the scene as looking \u201clike there\u2019s been a riot\u201d. \u201cThe selfishness of some people filling their trolleys with multiple packs and leaving none for others is staggering,\u201d she said. However, others have suggested that many of the products on the floor could be waiting to be restocked. Thanks to all those sending information. Just a reminder that if I miss anything, you can drop me a message on Twitter @mollyblackall. I won\u2019t be able to reply to all of the messages, but will endeavour to read them! Authorities in Madrid have told residents to stay at home, as Seville cancel the Holy Week celebrations. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez\u2019s government have come under fire for getting off to a slow start with coronavirus. They only began to introduce serious measures this week as numbers of coronavirus rates soared. The opposition has criticised the government for letting events like International Women\u2019s Day marches go ahead a week ago. As well as urging people to stay at home, Madrid city council has just announced that all parks in the capital will be closed from 4pm local time today. \u201cGiven the crowds of people who are unfortunately ignoring all the warnings and congregating in Madrid\u2019s public spaces, the mayor has given the order to close all of the city\u2019s parks and gardens from 4pm,\u201d it said in a tweet. There are now 5,753 cases and 136 deaths in Spain. 2,940 of the cases are in the Madrid region India has recorded its second coronavirus death \u2013 a 68-year-old woman in Delhi who caught the virus from her son who had travelled to Italy and Switzerland. The son developed symptoms a fortnight after returning to India. Officials are trying to trace the 1,500 people he may have been in contact with at the large plant where he worked. Her family complained that the cemetery they took her to refused to cremate her. Crematoriums in India tended to be crowded and the staff felt at risk. It was only when doctors arrived to prescribe the right protocol that her last rites were performed. The number of coronavirus cases in India stands at 84. With no hand sanitisers available, the New Delhi government has designated them \u2018essential commodities\u2019 so that anyone hoarding them or selling them at inflated prices can be punished by law. As stories trickle in of some people concealing their travel history to affected areas or refusing to be tested and, if necessary, isolated, the Delhi government has also invoked the Epidemic Act. This allows district magistrates to take coercive action to isolate high-risk people. The wife of a Google employee in Bengaluru, for example, fled her home and vanished last week. Officials found that she had flown to Delhi \u2013 at the other end of the country - and travelled by train to Agra to her parents\u2019 home. Across many states, social life is being curbed with weddings, engagement ceremonies and birthday parties banned in the south Indian state of Karnataka. The message to Indians is to stay at home and avoid large gatherings. Several states have closed swimming pools, gyms, cinemas, night clubs, and theatres. A petition calling for the UK to go into lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus has reached more than 110,000 signatures, meaning it will be considered for parliamentary debate. It encourages the UK to follow the containment procedures of countries that have been widely affected by the outbreak, by restricting unnecessary travel and discouraging public gatherings. \u201cIt is time the government should prioritise the health of the public and should consider how vital it is to implement effective containment now,\u201d the petition says. \u201cIt is better to spend money to contain the virus and treating the relatively low numbers who are ill now rather than wait for more casualties.\u201d The government responds to all petitions with more than 10,000 signatures, and considers any petition with more than 100,000 signatures for parliamentary debate. This video explores how Islam has been impacted by coronavirus. It follows Kuwait changing the call to prayer to tell people to pray in their homes, rather than at a mosque. More from Sam Jones, our correspondent in Madrid: Seville has announced that it will be cancelling the city\u2019s world famous Holy Week processions as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. The Andaluc\u00edan capital\u2019s mayor, Juan Espadas Cejas, said it was the hardest decision he had taken in his five years in office, but added: \u201cThe declaration of the state of emergency, together with the need to safeguard public health and to allow enough time for a return to normality in the city, justify this move.\u201d Espadas said he was confident that the people of Seville would understand why the decision had been taken. The cancellation of the spectacular but sombre parades, which draw huge crowds of foreign visitors, comes as tourist bookings plummet. Last year, nearly 84 million people visited Spain, 18 million from the UK. Tourism is the nation\u2019s third biggest industry, accounting for 11% of GDP. Even before the severe restrictions, including schools closures and bans on large public events, announced in the Madrid area, bookings were down. According to the Spanish hoteliers\u2019 confederation, reservations were already down 20-30%, in particular for holidays in Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearic and Canary Islands, in February compared with last year. Hotel bookings were down 24% in Madrid and 20% in Barcelona. The government in India has announced that it will treat coronavirus as a notified disaster, which will enable it to take greater measures as part of the state disaster response fund. The Labour leadership candidate Lisa Nandy is set to call for an aid package like that delivered after the second world war. Speaking at the National Union of Mineworkers in Barnsley today, Nandy will call for greater transparency about the expert advice received by the government, more social care funding to protect older people, and a Covid-19 workers\u2019 taskforce to ensure that workers with insecure and low paid jobs don\u2019t arrive at work unwell. She will also call for a consultation with council and community leaders, along with support for charities that tackle loneliness, to address the risks of self isolation. \u201cWe need the equivalent of a Marshall Plan to protect our older people. After a decade of underfunding, a virus that could affect up to 80% of the population will not be dealt with by our NHS alone,\u201d she will say. In China, the number of new coronavirus cases brought to the mainland from overseas has exceeded the number of locally transmitted infections, for the first time. This occurred on Friday, data from the National Health Commission showed. Mainland China had 11 new confirmed cases on Friday, up from eight cases a day earlier, but only four of those, all in Hubei province, were locally transmitted. The other seven \u2013 four in Shanghai, one Beijing and two in Gansu \u2013 came from travellers coming into China from Italy, the United States and Saudi Arabia. This indicates a slowing of the virus in China, which has been at the centre of the outbreak. Japan has said it will take \u201cbold, unprecedented\u201d steps to protect the economy, the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has said. Abe urged international cooperation to combat the impact of coronavirus on the global economy. Abe also said Japan would consider various options, including a proposal by ruling party lawmakers to temporarily cut the country\u2019s sales tax rate, to support an economy suffering \u201cquite a big blow\u201d from the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThe near-term focus is on containing the virus. After that, we need to put Japan\u2019s economy back on a solid footing. We will take bold, unprecedented steps to achieve this,\u201d he told a news conference. \u201cThe impact of the coronavirus [on the global economy] has been enormous and markets are suffering disruptions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government will closely coordinate with other countries as well as with the Bank of Japan. If necessary, we\u2019ll respond appropriately in line with agreements made by the G7 and G20.\u201d There have been another 22 positive cases in Wales overnight, bringing the total number of people infected with coronavirus to 60. Indonesia\u2019s capital, Jakarta, will shut schools and organise remote teaching for a minimum of two weeks in an attempt to halt the spread of coronavirus. The announcement was made today by Jakarta\u2019s governor, following reports of 27 more cases, bringing the total to 96. The number of deaths increased to five. While most case are in Jakarta, cases were also reported in cities in western and central Java, Manado on Sulawesi island and Pontianak on Borneo island. \u201cWe must massively, in an integrated way and without panic, search and find, and isolate positive cases,\u201d Yurianto said. He added that \u201ca community-based approach\u201d was set to be adopted to prevent healthy people from getting sick. Leo Varadkar and Arlene Foster are to meet on Saturday to discuss an all-of-Ireland approach to combatting coronavirus. With mass gatherings including sporting events and concerts to be banned across the UK from next weekend, pressure was growing on Northern Irish leaders to close schools in line with the move south of the border. The caretaker taoiseach and first minister will meet in Armagh as part of a wider delegation involving Ireland\u2019s chief medical officer, who has been acting on Irish as well as EU modelling. You can read the full story here: In Brunei, 38 of the total 40 coronavirus cases in the country had been linked to the religious gathering, as of Saturday. A total of 85 Bruneians were present at the the gathering, 18 of whom went on to test positive. The remainder of the 38 are their immediate family members, friends or co-workers, the health ministry said. New cases in Brunei include a nine-month-old baby, the child of a man who attended the religious event. The speaker of Brunei\u2019s legislative council called for the current session to end on Saturday, a week ahead of schedule, because of coronavirus concerns. Malaysia has confirmed 41 new coronavirus today. Most of the cases are connected to a religious event which occurred on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur and was attended by around 10,000 people. This brings the total number of cases in Malaysia to 238, 81 of which were linked to the same event held at a mosque between February 27 and March 1. The prime minister, Muyiddin Yassin, said on Friday that the country was facing a \u201csecond wave\u201d of infections, and warned of an impact on economic growth. To contain the spread of the virus, all gatherings including international meetings, sports, social and religious events would be cancelled or postponed until after April, he said. Reuters initially reported this as \u2018all\u2019 cases, but they\u2019ve corrected this to \u2018most\u2019. Sorry for any confusion! Namibia has announced that it is suspending travel to and from Qatar, Ethiopia and Germany for 30 days, with immediate effect. It comes after the country confirmed its first cases of coronavirus. Here is an update from Brazil, from my colleague Tom Phillips, the Guardian\u2019s Latin America correspondent: Rio de Janeiro is starting to go into shutdown mode because of the coronavirus crisis, which looks set to worsen in Brazil in the coming days. On Friday night Rio\u2019s governor, Wilson Witzel, announced that theatres, cinemas, sports stadiums and nightclubs would be shuttered here for a fortnight while beaches could also be sealed off to prevent large numbers of people coming together. \u201cThis is a moment to stay at home so we can control this epidemic,\u201d Witzel told reporters. A hospital in western Rio is reportedly being prepared to deal with the anticipated spike in coronavirus cases here. \u201cOne thing is for sure: depending on the speed with which the epidemic spreads, the stress on our health system could be brutal,\u201d a prominent Brazilian doctor, Drauzio Varella, wrote in the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper on Friday. Reuters news agency have compiled this very comprehensive (albeit very long) list of the current number of coronavirus cases across the world.

You can read more from my colleague Simon Murphy here: Cambodia has banned entry of visitors from Italy, Germany, Spain, France and the US. The ban will last for 30 days, beginning on 17 March, the ministry of health has announced. The ban came after Cambodia confirmed two new cases of the coronavirus, bringing the total number in the country to seven. The patient were both foreign nationals, a 49-year-old Canadian teacher and a 33-year-old Belgian man on Friday. The Canadian national\u2019s two children tested negative for the virus though his school has been closed, the ministry and the school said. Schools in the capital Phnom Penh and Siem Reap province, where coronavirus cases had been detected, were ordered closed on Saturday, the ministry of health said. However, the country hasn\u2019t banned travellers from China, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cThe kingdom of Cambodia has subsequently detected the Covid-19 virus on different foreign nationals, which requires immediate measures to prevent the spread and importation of the Covid-19 virus into Cambodia,\u201d the minister of health, Mam Bunheng, said in the statement. \u201cTherefore, the ministry of health takes measures to ban foreigners from Italy, Germany, Spain, France and the United States from entering the country for 30 days, effective 17 March 2020,\u201d he added. Sam Jones, our correspondent in Madrid, has the latest on the situation in Spain: The Spanish government is meeting this morning to decide what urgent measures to take under the state of emergency that was announced yesterday and will be declared later today. The emergency powers, set out in article 116 of the constitution, allow the government to limit the movement of people and vehicles in specified places, to temporarily requisition goods, to take over factories and businesses, to ration the consumption of basic items, and to issue the necessary orders to ensure the provision of services. The article has not been used since 2010, when it was enacted in response to an air traffic controllers\u2019 strike. The state of emergency will initially apply for two weeks, but can be extended with parliamentary approval. The prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, is due to speak at 2pm local time once the cabinet meeting is over. Meanwhile, all non-essential shops in the Madrid and Galicia regions have shut on the orders of the regional governments. All non-food shops, caf\u00e9s, bars, restaurants, cinemas, gyms and non-food shops have been ordered shut for a fortnight in a bid to halt the spread of the coronavirus. The only businesses permitted to remain open are supermarkets, bakeries, butcher\u2019s shops, fishmongers, greengrocers, petrol stations, pharmacies, tobacconists and newspaper kiosks. On Friday night, the Catalan president, Quim Torra announced plans to close off the north-eastern Spanish region and called on the central government to assist by authorising the closure of ports, airports and railways. \u201cThe evolution of the contagion calls for most drastic action,\u201d Torra said on Friday night. \u201cWe need to restrict entry and exit to protect ourselves.\u201d While Catalonia is one of Spain\u2019s 17 autonomous regions, major transport routes and hubs come under the mandate of the central government. Spain, the European country most affected by the virus after Italy, has reported more than 5,200 cases and 132 deaths. For those just joining us, you can see an overview of the recent updates here: Austria has announced a 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) aid package available to deal with the economic impact of coronavirus, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz and Vice Chancellor Werner Kogler said on Saturday. Kogler said the money would provide \u201cfresh blood\u201d for the economy, and would include bridge loans and credit guarantees for businesses. The death toll from coronavirus in Iran has risen to 611, with 12,729 confirmed cases, state TV said. On Friday, Iran, the death toll stood at 514, with 11,364 confirmed infections. Here is an update from my colleague Rebecca Ratcliffe, the Guardian\u2019s south-east Asia correspondent on the situation in the Philippines: The number of coronavirus cases in the Philippines has jumped by 34 to 98, it was confirmed on Saturday, as the national capital region prepared for major travel restrictions to be imposed tomorrow. The country also recorded two more fatalities, bringing the death toll to eight. The Philippines has witnessed a wave of cases over the past week, and there are fears the disease could spread quickly through overcrowded slum areas in the capital, Manila. Officials announced on Saturday that a night curfew would be introduced in Manila, and said that people should only leave their homes during the daytime for work or urgent errands. \u201cIf you\u2019ll go to work, go. If you need to go out for medical treatment, go. If you\u2019ll buy food, go, but other than that, stay home,\u201d the interior secretary, Eduardo A\u00f1o, told a news conference. He said the public should \u201cpractice social distancing\u201d, though doing so will be a struggle for the poorest residents who live in cramped housing with poor sanitation. Metro Manila, which includes 16 cities, has an official population of 12 million but the real figure, including informal settlers, is believed to be much higher. The curfew is in addition to wider measures due to be introduced on Sunday, including a ban on domestic land, sea and air travel to and from Metro Manila. Mass gatherings will be stopped and schools closed. Foreigners traveling from countries where there is local transmission of the disease \u2013 at least 65 nations, including the UK \u2013 will also be banned from entering the country. Kuwait authorities have temporarily closed mosques and changed the Muslim call to prayer, which normally tells people to come to mosque, to instruct them to pray at home. The announcement came on Friday, when the Ministry of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs said that the five daily prayers usually held at mosques had been cancelled. Below is footage showing the new call to prayer ringing out in Kuwait. Low budget airline Jet2 have cancelled all flights to mainland Spain, the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands. In a statement posted on Twitter, the low budget airline said: \u201cIn response to local measures introduced throughout Spain to prevent the spread of Covid-19, including the closure of bars, restaurants, shops and activities including any watersport, we have taken the decision to cancel all flights to Mainland Spain, the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands. \u201cWe know these local measures will have a significant impact on our customers\u2019 holidays, which is why we have taken this decision,\u201d it said. The airline said it was contacting customers who were currently in those destinations, and who were set to travel to them, to advise them of their options. It urged customers not to call, and said it was \u201creviewing\u201d its programme \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d. \u201cThe health and safety of our customers is our number one priority,\u201d it added. Two more people have died in Greece from coronavirus, bringing the total death toll to three. The deceased were two men, aged 67 and 90. They both had serious underlying health problems, the health ministry said. There were 190 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Greece by Friday evening. Italians quarantined in their own home have been singing from their balcony to support one another during the country\u2019s lockdown. You can read the full story here: Abu Dhabi has announced the temporary closure of large tourist sites including the Louvre Abu Dhabi museum. The Ferrari World theme park will also be shut under the new measures, which will be in place from 15 to 31 March. The announcements were made in tweets from the Abu Dhabi government media office. The Philippines capital, Manila, has announced night curfews, and urged shopping malls to close for a month. The health department made the announcement today, as three new fatalities were confirmed, bringing the death toll in the country to eight. It came as the Philippines experienced its biggest single day increase, with 34 new cases bringing the total number to 98. The president, Rodrigo Duterte, has raised the country\u2019s health emergency status to the highest level and issued quarantine measures in Manila, along with land and air travel restrictions in and out of the capital. These will take effect from 15 March. School closures were extended school until 12 April. The nighttime curfew will begin on 15 March 15 and continue until 14 April, but some employees will be exempt, Garcia said. People who violated the curfew would be turned back, he said, but would not be reprimanded or arrested. \u201cTo limit the spread of the virus, we need to limit the movement of people. We are slowing down the movement of people in Metro Manila,\u201d Jose Arturo Garcia, general manager of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, told a news conference. The health ministry has announced the first confirmed case of coronavirus in Rwanda. The patient is an Indian citizen who arrived in Rwanda from Mumbai on 8 March, the health ministry said on Saturday. \u201cHe is currently under treatment in stable condition, isolated from other patients,\u201d the ministry said. \u201cThe tracing of all contacts has been conducted for further management.\u201d RwandAir, Rwanda\u2019s national airline, announced it was suspending all flights to India until 30 April and would refund customers. Rwanda\u2019s case means that 19 African countries have now got coronavirus cases. Other African nations to have reported cases of the virus include Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria, Senegal, Togo, Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Sudan, Kenya and Ethiopia. British GP Sarah Jarvis has said she is doubtful about the UK government\u2019s response to coronavirus. Herd immunity works on the idea that if enough of the population become infected with a disease, they will become immune, and unable to transmit further. \u201cWe\u2019ve traditionally said we need about 90% herd immunity for it to work,\u201d she said, speaking on Sky News. The government have put the estimated figure for coronavirus at 60% of the population. \u201cThe issue we\u2019ve got is this is a new virus and we don\u2019t know if people will retain immunity,\u201d she said. Whilst it is thought not to be possible to get infected twice, it is unclear how long immunity lasts. The herd immunity approach is unlike that used in other parts of Europe, and has been thrown into doubt by the WHO. What does coronavirus mean for pregnant women? Jarvis said there was no evidence that the virus could be transmitted from parent to baby while the mother was pregnant, but could be transmitted once the baby was born. She urged women who have been infected with coronavirus and are going in to labour to let hospitals know before they arrive. Jarvis said that there had been some reports in China of pregnant women with coronavirus giving birth prematurely. However, she said that it was unclear whether this was due to labour being induced early because the mother was sick, or because of the virus directly. Zara owner Inditex will temporarily close all of its stores in Spain from Saturday, Europa Press said. Spain has the largest network of Zara stores, and makes about a sixth of group sales. Spain is the fashion retailer\u2019s largest network of stores by far, accounting for about a sixth of group sales. It also owns Massimo Dutti and Pull &amp; Bear. On Friday, the Spanish prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, declared a state of emergency but did not specify what emergency powers he would use, or what support businesses who are forced to close would receive. Some regions, such as Madrid and Catalonia, have decided to close bars, restaurants and shops apart from those selling essential items such as food, but this is not a nationwide policy. Spain has the second-highest number of coronavirus cases in Europe after Italy, with 4,231 cases and 120 deaths. The Guardian\u2019s correspondent in Greece, Turkey and Cyprus, Helena Smith, has this update: Greece has confirmed two more deaths from Covid-19, bringing the death toll to three in a country where the number of cases rose to 190 \u2013 a jump of 73 and the biggest rise yet on Friday. A 92-year-old from Ptolemaida, close to Kastoria in western Macedonia, died this morning after being diagnosed with the virus three days ago. At the heart of the fur trade in Greece, Kastoria has been hard hit by coronavirus with a growing number of confirmed cases in the town among people connected to the industry. According to state-run TV many locals has recently visited Milan for the fashion show. Health authorities reported that a third man, aged 67, who had been on life support in a specialised hospital unit on the Ionian island of Zakynthos, also died today. Greece, which has closed all of its archaeological sites and museums, introduced its most draconian measures yet to curb the spread of the disease, announcing late Friday that every bar, restaurant, cafe and eatery will have to close for at least two weeks. Malls, shopping centres, hairdressers, betting shops and brothels are among others that have also been ordered shut. Super markets, pharmacies, take-aways and hotels have been permitted to stay open. Norway has advised its citizens not to travel abroad during the next month, and urged Norwegians currently abroad to consider returning home. \u201cCountries can quickly introduce travel restrictions, quarantine at arrival from countries with coronavirus, and borders can close, flights could be cancelled or other measures initiated,\u201d the foreign minister, Ine Eriksen S\u00f8reide, said on Saturday. Oslo\u2019s main airport stopped admitting foreign travellers on Friday, a local municipality said. A day prior, the government invoked emergency powers to shut a range of private and public institutions, including schools and restaurants, and asked the majority of citizens to work from home where possible. The country has also announced emergency economic measures, including the central bank making an emergency rate cut on Friday and pumping more money into banks. The government has announced a package of fiscal and regulatory measures to support the economy. The Philippines has confirmed 34 new cases, bringing its total to 98.

The Czech government has announced it will shut most shops and restaurants for 10 days, and ban foreigners from entering the country. From Monday, foreign travel will be banned and foreigners will be barred from arriving in the country. Food stores, pharmacies, banks, post offices, gas stations and takeaway food establishments will be exempt from the closures. The measures come after other restrictions including closing schools and banning public events such as sports games or concerts, were announced in recent days. \u201cWe wanted to avoid people going to shopping centres today,\u201d the prime minister Andrej Babi\u0161, told a news conference on Saturday, broadcast on television. The interior minister, Jan Ham\u00e1\u010dek, said the government\u2019s aim was to spread out the rise of infections over time to reduce the strain on the health system. \u201cWe need people to go to work but stay home afterwards,\u201d Ham\u00e1\u010dek said. \u201cThose (countries) who have managed to do something about the situation say ... limit interaction among people.\u201d The Czech Republic had 150 cases as of Saturday morning, with no deaths. It had tested 3,094 people as of Friday evening, with 741 tests taken on Friday, according to the health ministry. The government has been criticised for taking a heavy-handed approach, and not testing widely enough. Health workers have reported shortages of protective gear such as face masks and respirators at hospitals, senior care centres and pharmacies. The government has said it aimed to ramp up testing by involving more laboratories and ordering 100,000 rapid-result test kits for delivery next week. Babi\u0161 said 51,000 respirators were distributed to health facilities on Friday. Morocco has suspended flights to and from Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Portugal to try and halt the spread of coronavirus, the foreign ministry announced on Saturday. It has also suspended all flights with China, Spain, Italy, France and Algeria. The total number of coronavirus cases in Morocco has risen to 8, including one death and one recovery. Donald Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, has been working from home and avoiding the White House after coming into contact with an Australian politician who later tested positive for coronavirus. The Australian home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, who has been infected with the virus, was in Washington DC last week and met with Trump\u2019s daughter and the US attorney general, William Barr. The White House and justice department have been quick to downplay the situation, saying Ivanka\u2019s decision came out of an \u201cabundance of caution\u201d. \u201cExposures from the case were assessed and the White House medical unit confirmed, in accordance with CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidance, that Ivanka is exhibiting no symptoms and does not need to self-quarantine,\u201d the White House deputy press secretary, Judd Deere, said in a statement. \u201cShe worked from home today out of an abundance of caution until guidance was given,\u201d Deere added. Barr\u2019s spokesman also said the attorney general was not showing coronavirus symptoms. \u201cHe is staying home today and has consulted with CDC,\u201d Department of Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement. \u201cCDC is not recommending he be tested at this point.\u201d It is possible that the president himself has been exposed to the virus. A Brazilian official tested positive just days after posing for a photo with the Mr Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. rump said he was not showing symptoms, though conceded he will \u201cmost likely\u201d get a test. Dutton woke up on Friday morning with a temperature and sore throat. He admitted himself for a test which came back positive and he has remained in hospital in Queensland. \u201cI feel fine and will provide an update in due course,\u201d Dutton said in a statement. World Health Organization spokeswoman Margaret Harris has questioned the UK\u2019s approach to developing \u201cherd immunity\u201d against Covid-19. Dr Harris told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today: \u201cWe don\u2019t know enough about the science of this virus, it hasn\u2019t been in our population for long enough for us to know what it does in immunological terms. \u201cEvery virus functions differently in your body and stimulates a different immunological profile. We can talk theories, but at the moment we are really facing a situation where we have got to look at action.\u201d You can read more about herd immunity, and its use with coronavirus, here: Europe now the epicentre of coronavirus outbreak, WHO says \u201cEurope has now become the epicenter [sic] of the pandemic, with more reported cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined, apart from China,\u201d World Health Organization (WHO) director, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has tweeted. \u201cOur message to countries continues to be: you must take a comprehensive approach to fight. Not testing alone. Not contact tracing alone. Not quarantine alone. Not social distancing alone. Do it all,\u201d he said. He added: \u201cWe are at a critical point in the #COVID19 response \u2013 we need everyone to get involved in this massive effort to keep the world safe.\u201d He also mentioned the Covid-19 solidarity response fund, which was announced yesterday, and praised those who worked to create it. The fund \u201cwill raise money from a wide range of donors to support the work of the WHO and partners to help countries respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d \u201cThe fund, the first-of-its-kind, enables private individuals, corporations and institutions anywhere in the world to come together to directly contribute to global response efforts, and has been created by the United Nations Foundation and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation, together with WHO.\u201d Hello, this is Molly Blackall taking over the blog in London. I\u2019ll be bringing you all the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak, as the global death toll reaches 5,429, with 145,369 confirmed cases. As of today, 71,694 people have recovered, according to figures from the Johns Hopkins University. If you spot anything I miss, do drop me a message on Twitter @mollyblackall. Due to the enormous interest in coronavirus, I won\u2019t be able to respond to everything, but I will do my best to take a look. Thanks in advance! Multinational tech company Apple has just announced it will close all stores. In a statement the company said: In all of our offices, we are moving to flexible work arrangements worldwide outside of Greater China. That means team members should work remotely if their job allows, and those whose work requires them to be on site should follow guidance to maximize interpersonal space. Extensive, deep cleaning will continue at all sites. In all our offices, we are rolling out new health screenings and temperature checks. The global spread of COVID-19 is affecting every one of us. We will be closing all of our retail stores outside of Greater China until March 27. Our online stores are open ... All of our hourly workers will continue to receive pay in alignment with business as usual operations. We have expanded our leave policies to accommodate personal or family health circumstances created by Covid-19. Here\u2019s a summary of the main points of the liveblog coverage so far. Australia has launched a public education campaign including information on hygiene as 200 cases have been reported around the country. It comes as the chief medical officer Brendan Murphy wrote to doctors to implore them to use testing kits and protective gear responsibly. \u201cUnfortunately, the extreme pressure on our personal protective equipment stocks continues, and the situation regarding pathology test kits, reagents and swabs is deteriorating rapidly, with kits no longer being available in some regions of the country,\u201d Murphy wrote. After declaring coronavirus a national emergency US president Donald Trump said he would free up $50bn in federal resources for the states to tackle the virus. The US House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a coronavirus aid package that will provide free testing and paid sick leave, in a bid to limit the economic damage from a pandemic that has shuttered schools, sports arenas and offices. The US travel ban for 26 European countries has come into force, banning travel from the 26 countries of the Schengen area during the 14 days before their planned arrival in the United States. The travel restrictions are set to last for 30 days but do not apply to the UK or Ireland. Saudi Arabia has banned all flights into the kingdom for two weeks, starting Sunday, state news agency SPA reported. New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has said all people arriving in the country, including returning citizens, will be required to isolate themselves for a fortnight. Only people arriving from the Pacific, were there are virtually no cases, are exempt from the rule. Ardern also cancelled Sunday\u2019s memorial commemorating the first anniversary Christchurch mosque shootings. Colombia, Bolivia, Venezuela, Paraguay and Peru have all suspended European flights. Argentina also announced it would suspends links with the most badly affected countries and Guatemala said it will ban arrivals from the United States and Canada. Cambodia announced it would refuse entry to citizens from Italy, Germany, Spain, France, and the United States, according to local media. Vietnam will also stop issuing tourist visas to citizens from Europe\u2019s Schengen area and Britain, starting from Sunday. In South Korea, for a second day in a row the daily number of recovered people on Saturday (204) exceeded that of new confirmed cases (107). Meanwhile in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak began, officials reported just five new cases on Friday, the second day in a row the tally has been less than 10. The global death toll reached 5,429, with 145,369 cases confirmed. So far 71,694 people have recovered, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. The institution draws from official figures, and so it possible that actual figures are higher. Jakarta\u2019s governor Anies Baswedan has told a broadcasted news conference that Indonesia\u2019s capital city will close all schools and has ordered remote teaching for at least two weeks starting next week to curb the spread of the virus. Baswedan said out of 69 confirmed coronavirus cases nationwide, an unspecified number of people were detected in many places across Jakarta, a city of 10 million people. The number of people under surveillance in the city had jumped to 586 people as of 12 March, compared to 129 at the beginning of the month. The number of patients suspected of having Covid-19 had surged to 261 from 39 in the same period. The chief justice of Victoria\u2019s supreme court, Anne Ferguson, said the state\u2019s supreme and county courts have decided to suspend all new jury trials from Monday 16 March until further notice. She said: This means that the jury empanelment process, in which hundreds of potential jurors gather at Court, will not take place until further notice. This precautionary decision was made after consideration of the latest expert health and government advice and recognises that members of the community may hold concerns about attending court in large groups. This suspension does not apply to trials in which the jury has already been empanelled, which will continue as usual. The courts acknowledge this is an unprecedented decision and we are confident it is in the best interests of the Victorian community. As we mentioned a bit earlier, the Australian government has launched a community education campaign around Covid-19 following criticism from the public and the shadow minister Chris Bowen that people have been receiving mixed-messages about what to do. Here is the video launched as part of the public education blitz, which focusses on hygiene. We\u2019ve seen and heard the wonderful sound of Italians making music in their towns as an antidote to the misery of coronavirus. And here is Yo-Yo Ma with his little contribution. Supermarket giants have put limits on purchases of food staples to prevent panic buying sparked by the coronavirus, AAP reports. Coles and Woolworths have introduced a limit on some goods to ensure there is enough for everyone, especially the elderly, by preventing people stockpiling.

But Guardian Australia\u2019s podcast editor Miles Martignoni reports that now fruit and vegetables appear to be out-of-stock as well, at least in Sydney\u2019s inner-west. Thirteen new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Victoria, the state\u2019s health department said in a statement just issued, bringing the total number of cases in Victoria to 49 and the Australian total to at least 200. The new cases include 11 men and two women aged between 20 and 69. All cases are recovering at home in isolation, except for one person who was admitted to hospital and is stable. All new confirmed cases were acquired overseas or through close contact with known, confirmed cases of Covid-19. Thailand has reported seven new coronavirus cases on Saturday, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 82, health officials said. The Australian government will release a national publicity blitz aimed at stopping the spread of Covid-19 from tomorrow (Sunday). It comes after criticism of the government\u2019s response to the crisis and an acknowledgement by the chief medical officer that the country\u2019s supply of crucial medical equipment including personal protective gear and pathology test kits was \u201cdeteriorating rapidly\u201d. From Sunday, the government will release two separate television advertisements which encourage stringent personal hygiene and warn people who have recently been overseas or in contact with someone who has the virus to \u201cseek medical advice\u201d and self-isolate if they develop symptoms. The campaign, which will also include outdoor advertising on buses, at train stations and in shopping centres, includes the slogan \u201ctogether we can help stop the spread and stay healthy\u201d. It also advises people to only be tested for the virus \u201cif you are experiencing flu or cold-like symptoms, and have recently returned overseas or have been indirect contact with someone who is known to have contracted coronavirus\u201d. Venezuela confirmed its first two cases of the coronavirus Friday, deepening anxiety in a crisis-stricken nation where many hospitals struggle to treat even basic ailments. The announcement prompted president Ivan Duque of neighbouring Colombia to order his nation\u2019s border with Venezuela closed. It will also stop visitors who have been in Europe or Asia from entering the country. Colombia reported its first case of coronavirus on 6 March, which has risen to 16 cases. Meanwhile Bolivia, Venezuela, Paraguay and Peru have suspended European flights. Argentina also announced it will suspends links with the most badly affected countries. Guatemala will from Monday widen travel restrictions, banning arrivals from the United States and Canada, president Alejandro Giammattei said. Panama\u2019s health minister Rosario Turner on Friday said the number of confirmed cases has risen to 36, and includes three foreigners. Brazil\u2019s two biggest cities \u2013 Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo \u2013 contain most of the country\u2019s 107 coronavirus cases registered so far. No deaths have been reported, but government officials say they expect the number of people affected to soar in the next couple of weeks. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has tested negative. And in Mexico \u2013 Latin America\u2019s number two economy \u2013 economic turmoil sparked by the outbreak threatens to deepen a recession that started last year. The number of cases remains low. I\u2019ve just been getting some reaction from the Australian medical bodies to the letter sent by the chief medical officer Prof Brendan Murphy to doctors warning them of extreme pressure on personal protective equipment stock, and shortages of testing kits. Murphy wrote that \u201cPathology collection centres have also experienced large backlogs in testing appointments in some parts of Australia, and emergency testing facilities have had to be established in some areas to ensure that urgent patients can get access to testing\u201d. The head of the Australian Medical Association Dr Tony Bartone told Guardian Australia that people needed to take some personal responsibility and to stop pushing doctors for Covid-19 testing unless they met the criteria or were severely unwell. He said: It\u2019s clear that there is a significant amount of people who are being tested at the moment for no other reason than just fear, anxiety or personal interest. The criteria that have been clearly outlined in the letter are in the interest of ensuring adequate supply at this crucial time while we\u2019re facing a significant pressure on reagents and kits. We are really running out and it undermines the ability to identify true cases. We can\u2019t just be testing to relieve anxiety. We can\u2019t just be relieving anxiety in a population with no contact with a confirmed case.\u201d Bartone said the rush to hospitals and doctor clinics for testing was an extension of panic buying being seen in supermarkets. He urged people to think of vulnerable people including the elderly before asking for tests. The US House of Representatives has overwhelmingly passed a coronavirus aid package that will provide free testing and paid sick leave, in a bid to limit the economic damage from a pandemic that has shuttered schools, sports arenas and offices, Reuters reports. By a bipartisan vote of 363 to 40, the Democratic-controlled House passed a multi-billion dollar effort that would expand safety-net programs to help those who could be thrown out of work in the weeks to come. Donald Trump said he supported the package, raising the likelihood that it will pass the Republican-controlled Senate next week. The 110-page bill is the product of extensive negotiations between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Mnuchin has pressed for tax cuts, while Pelosi had pushed to expand safety-net spending. It does not include the $1 trillion payroll tax cut that Trump had called for. Earlier in the day, Trump had accused Democrats of \u201cnot doing what\u2019s right for the country\u201d. Amongst other measures, the bill will provide two weeks of paid sick and family leave for those affected by the virus. Businesses will get a tax credit to help cover the expense. More on Australia\u2019s chief medical officer\u2019s letter to doctors... Brendan Murphy said he was seeking doctors\u2019 help in \u201cstrictly applying the Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA) National Guidelines in deciding whether to refer a patient for a COVID-19 pathology test\u201d. He said the current guidelines only recommend testing \u201cwhere a patient meets both the current epidemiological and clinical criteria for testing\u201d. The epidemiological criteria include international travel in the 14 days before illness onset OR close or casual contact in the 14 days before illness onset with a confirmed case of Covid-19. Murphy said the last point needs to be interpreted \u201csensibly\u201d, adding: \u201cWe do not have sufficient testing kits to test everyone who attends the same large concert as a person with Covid-19.\u201d Murphy said clinical criteria included fever OR an acute respiratory infection, with or without fever. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer has written to doctors urging them for help as Australians rush out to get tested for Covid-19, including those who don\u2019t need it. The letter says there has been \u201cextreme pressure\u201d on personal protective equipment stocks continues. Meanwhile, he wrote, \u201cthe situation regarding pathology test kits, reagents and swabs is deteriorating rapidly, with kits no longer being available in some regions of the country\u201d. He told doctors: Pathology collection centres have also experienced large backlogs in testing appointments in some parts of Australia, and emergency testing facilities have had to be established in some areas to ensure that urgent patients can get access to testing. He implored doctors to stick to testing guidelines. That is, only testing those who meet both clinical and epidemiological criteria. You can read more about Murphy\u2019s letter here. From Naples to Tuscany, Italians have been singing from their balconies across the country, in an effort to boost morale during its nationwide lockdown that began this week, due to Covid-19. Videos of Italian neighbours singing together have been appearing on social media after Italy\u2019s prime minister Giuseppe Conte announced the restrictions that shut down virtually all daily life. Social media posts with messages from China have also appeared, expressing solidarity with Italians. You can read The Guardian\u2019s full story below: The premier of Western Australia Mark McGowan is giving a press conference. Another three cases of the virus have been detected in Western Australia on Saturday, all travellers from overseas. That brings the state to a total of 17 cases. McGowan is talking about the agreement reached between the states, territories and federal government for a national cabinet of Australia. McGowan said: This means all of the leaders of each of the governments of Australia will form a group to meet regularly and to form important decisions in relation to coronavirus. This has never been done before in Australia. This is an Australian-first, since Federation. So this didn\u2019t happen in wartime, this is the first time that we have done this as a nation. I want to make sure that there is collaborative decision-making, that we are making decisions on behalf of the entire nation. The states are as one on this. The states need to work together. The boundaries are dropping away in relation to confronting this, and we are working together as Australians to confront this threat to our nation. Secondly, a range of decisions were made on policy issues, and I just want to go over those again. Firstly, we are now advising all Australians not to travel overseas. That is very firm advice to all Australians, don\u2019t travel overseas. Have your holidays at home. Only travel overseas if it is absolutely critical. He added the states and territories would begin sharing medical supplies. McGowan said: This is a very significant issue for Australia, and we want to work together. We have been through was together, we have been through depressions, we have been through all sorts of national upheavals. Australians can withstand this if we work together, if we co-operate, if we are reasonable to each other. New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern says while the country only has only seen six Covid-19 cases, the government was enforcing border control measures to contain it. At a press conference on Saturday Ardern told reporters: As of midnight Sunday, every person entering New Zealand, including returning New Zealand citizens and residents, will be required to enter self-isolation for 14 days. Everybody. The Pacific Islands are exempted from this measure. They are the only ones. Anyone from this country, though, will be required to automatically self isolate should they exhibit any Covid-19 symptoms upon arrival in New Zealand. All of these restrictions will be reviewed in 16 days\u2019 time... this decision will mean New Zealand will have the widest ranging and toughest border restrictions of any country in the world. We are also encouraging New Zealanders to avoid all non-essential travel overseas. As of midnight tonight, we\u2019re issuing to all cruise ships not to come to New Zealand until at least 30 June 2020, that is for incoming cruise ships, at which time the directive will be reviewed. Countries across Southeast Asia are stepping up travel restrictions for citizens from Europe and countries with high numbers of cases. Cambodia has announced that it will refuse entry to citizens from Italy, Germany, Spain, France, and the United States, according to the Khmer Times. The ban, to be introduced on Tuesday, will last for 30 days. The country has so far recorded seven cases of the virus. Vietnam will also stop issuing tourist visas to citizens from Europe\u2019s Schengen area and Britain starting from Sunday, the state-run newspaper Hanoimoi reported. Tens of tourists are in quarantine in the country, following a recent cluster of cases linked to a London flight that arrived in Hanoi on 2 March. The country has so far recorded 47 cases. Meanwhile, Thai officials have added the UK to the list of countries with ongoing local transmission, which means travellers may need to monitor their health for 14 days and report symptoms to the health authorities. This applies to anyone who has travelled from or transited through the UK in the 14 days prior to their arrival in Thailand. The Philippines had earlier announced a travel ban for all foreign nationals coming from the more than 60 countries reporting local transmission of coronavirus. This includes the UK, according to the British government\u2019s travel advice. The New Zealand government has tightened its border restrictions and included Australia on the list of countries from which those entering New Zealand would be subjected to a mandatory 14-day self-isolation period. This comes into effect on Sunday. New Zealand Cricket [NZC] has announced in a statement that as a consequence, \u201cwe need to get our team back to New Zealand before the restriction is imposed, meaning it will not be able to participate in the two remaining Chappell-Hadlee fixtures\u201d. The statement says: Arrangements are at this moment being made to fly the bulk of the squad home this evening. This development also means the three-match T20I series scheduled for New Zealand cannot proceed as the mandatory self-isolation period would also apply to the Australian squad as soon as it crossed the border into New Zealand. NZC believes both these series can be replayed in their entirety at a later and more appropriate date. NZC understands and supports the government\u2019s position. This is a time of unprecedented risk and peril, and the personal health and well-being of our players is paramount. After initially calling coronavirus a \u201choax\u201d and following widespread criticism that the US government failed to act quickly enough to test for and contain coronavirus, president Donald Trump has taken to Twitter, saying; \u201cI want you to know that your Federal Government will unleash every authority, resource and tool at its disposal to safeguard the lives and health of our people\u201d. His Tweet was met with some scepticism. Trump on Friday announced a national emergency and billions in funding to tackle the pandemic. \u201cIt gives tremendous powers for things that we need,\u201d Trump said in a White House Rose Garden press conference on Friday. \u201cTremendous power actually.\u201d The Australian home affairs minister Peter Dutton has just done an interview from his sickbed at the Royal Brisbane Hospital with Chris Smith from Sydney radio station 2gb. Dutton, who on Friday confirmed he had tested positive for coronavirus, said he was feeling \u201cmuch better this morning\u201d. \u201cFever has gone this morning, temperature is down, my throat was very mild to start with so probably still a bit sore but very mild in that sense. I\u2019ve had asthma since I was a child so I guess they were a bit worried about that, but they think my lungs are clear so all pretty good at the moment,\u201d he said. Dutton, who said he woke with symptoms including a fever, sore throat and a slight shortness of breath on Friday morning, attended a cabinet meeting with senior government ministers including the prime minister Scott Morrison on Tuesday and before that was in the US where he met with Ivanka Trump, the daughter of the US president. But he said that he\u2019d spoken to Queensland Health authorities on Friday night who had begun contact tracing back to Wednesday morning and were not concerned about his earlier contacts. His wife and children had not displayed symptoms but were self-isolating. \u201cTheir advice to me is they\u2019re concerned with people that I\u2019ve had close contact with since the morning of the 11th. So beyond that, it\u2019s not further back, there\u2019s some speculation about my visit to the White House etcetera but all the medical advice says there\u2019s no issue in relation to that period or even cabinet earlier in the week. That\u2019s the very clear medical advice that I got from Queensland Health.\u201d Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings - which operates the Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises - has just announced a voluntary suspension of all cruise voyages embarking between 13 March and 11 April. The temporary suspension is aimed at containing the virus spread, with the company saying the measure was being taken \u201cin an abundance of caution\u201d and that it had not experienced any confirmed cases across its fleet. Guests on voyages that are underway will end and guests will be disembarked as soon as possible and assisted with travel arrangements, the company said in a statement. All guests on impacted voyages will receive a 125% refund of the fare paid in the form of a future cruise credit, which can be applied toward any future cruise through to 31 December, 2022. Alternatively travellers can ask instead for a 100% refund of the fare paid. Saudi Arabia has suspended all international flights for two weeks, starting on Sunday, to prevent the spread of coronavirus, state news agency SPA said on Saturday, citing an official source at interior ministry. Reuters reports the period will be considered as an exceptional official holiday for citizens and residents who are unable to return due to the suspension of flights or if they face quarantine after their return to the Kingdom, SPA cited the official as saying. Saudi Arabia has reported 86 coronavirus cases. On Saturday the federal department of health published a fact sheet for the general public titled \u2018Coronavirus (COVID-19) \u2013 what you need to know\u2019. Health workers and the public have been calling out for consistent and clear information about the virus. However, given the situation has been evolving rapidly, the advice too has changed over time. This is the thirteenth version of the public fact sheet. The latest advise states that to protect those most at risk and slow the rate of community transmission: Non-essential organised gatherings should be kept to fewer than 500 people Non-essential meetings or conferences of health care professionals and emergency services should be limited, and Reconsider if you need to visit residential care facilities and remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. These precautions are most important for people over 60, particularly if they have a chronic disease, the department said. Donald Trump has taken to Twitter to reassure Americans over the coronavirus, saying the government will \u201cunleash every authority\u201d to fight the outbreak. It marks the end of a momentous day in the US, in which the president declared a national emergency and plans to dramatically increase the availability of testing kits. Meanwhile, the defence correspondent from PBS\u2019s Newshour programme, reported that the Pentagon was banning all domestic travel for anyone associated with the defence department. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has tested negative for the coronavirus, according to his former aid, senator Christopher Go. Duterte, who was not showing symptoms of the disease, was tested on Thursday after a number of cabinet members announced that they had been in contact with a person confirmed to have the virus, and that they would isolate themselves. Duterte has also suspended all foreign trips. The number of cases recorded in the Philippines has risen to 64, following a wave of new infections this week. The country reported its sixth death on Saturday morning. Metro Manila, home to 12 million people, will placed under lockdown from tomorrow, with schools shut and mass gatherings banned. Domestic land and sea travels to and from Manila will also stop. There is particular concern about the disease spreading rapidly in the capital\u2019s crowded housing settlements. A tourist in the Philippines, Helena Peacock, told The Guardian she found out last night that the island she is on, Coron, is being locked down from tomorrow. \u201cAll tourists have until then to leave but there is not enough flights or boats out,\u201d she said. \u201cMany of us have been at the airport on standby, approximately 300 tourists and more arriving every minute. The UK embassy in Manila is being as helpful as they are able to be. People are scared and confused because there is no information coming out. I did hear that someone has fainted inside the terminal building as it\u2019s hot and cramped. \u201cThere are rumours of private planes but no one can tell you how much it will cost or when it would leave. Airlines were still flying people in to here this morning from other areas without telling them, they found out when they arrived.\u201d South Korea has recorded 107 new coronavirus cases on Saturday compared with 110 a day earlier, taking the national tally to 8,086. In contrast, 204 patients were released from hospitals where they had been isolated for treatment. It\u2019s the second day in a row, the daily number of recovered people exceeded that of new confirmed cases since South Korea\u2019s first patient was confirmed on 20 January. It marks the continuing trend of a steady drop in the number of new cases, raising hopes that the outbreak may be slowing, just weeks after it became the biggest centre of infections outside China (now a title held by Italy). Of the latest 107 cases, 62 were from the hard-hit southeastern city of Daegu where the Christian church at the centre of the epidemic is located, while 15 and 13 were in Gyeonggi and Seoul, respectively. There has been debate about whether schools in Australia should close in light of the ban on gatherings of more than 500 people commencing from Monday. Major events have been cancelled throughout Australia. But except for schools and universities where there have been cases of the virus, the ban will not apply to educational institutions. Earlier on Saturday chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy said wider school closures were \u201cnot on the horizon\u201d. He said: They are certainly something that could be considered if there\u2019s a community outbreak. The interesting aspect about schools is that children don\u2019t seem to get much in the way of infection and if they do, they get very mild infection. At this stage we don\u2019t feel that school closures are warranted. NSW education department secretary Mark Scott told ABC news that even in large schools it was rare to have 500 people in one place at the same time. Scott said: That\u2019s part of the social distancing advice we\u2019re going to be providing. So if you have a big school that runs big school assemblies, now is not the time to be doing that. Australian Primary Principals Association president Malcolm Elliott said schools were on \u201ctenterhooks\u201d. We are all unsure about what the spread of the virus will be when it might strike particularly schools or how widespread this might become and how quickly. It is a very difficult thing to plan for in any really meaningful way. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera has announced a ban on public events with more than 500 people, Reuters reports, as the government tries to curtail the spread of coronavirus. Pinera also said people arriving in Chile from countries considered high-risk for the virus, including China, Italy and Spain, would have to quarantine for 14 days. Chile has confirmed 43 cases of the coronavirus. The ban on large public events, which will begin on Monday, could have implications for upcoming planned protests. Demonstrations began late last year over the high cost of living and inequality, in some cases attracting tens of thousands of people. We are just getting the latests Chinese figures, which show 11 new cases of Covid-19 and 13 deaths. Four of the new cases were in Wuhan \u2013 the centre of the outbreak \u2013 as were 10 of the deaths. Of the total 80,824 confirmed cases in China, 65,541 have recovered. On Friday the Chinese Health Commission reported just 8 deaths - the lowest since they began giving daily briefings on 25 January. Tasmania Ports has announced about 400 passengers on the MSC Magnifica are being kept on board after arriving in Hobart. Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein said the government had acted on the advice of Australian Border Control, and \u201c... also the advice of our own health experts and the director of public health.\u201d The ABC has more on the cruise ship here. Covid-19 has now taken a foothold in 19 countries in Africa, a continent authorities are particularly worried about due to a lack of health services. Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan, Guinea and Mauritania all confirmed their first cases of the coronavirus on Friday. Most of Africa\u2019s reported cases were foreigners or people who had travelled abroad. Cases were previously reported in Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria, Senegal, Togo, Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Sudan, Kenya and Ethiopia. The numbers of cases in most of the countries are still in single figures. Mauritania\u2019s health ministry says its first coronavirus patient is a European man, whose nationality was not specified, had returned to Nouakchott on 9 March and had since been in quarantine. Senegal confirmed 11 new cases, raising the total in that West African nation to 21. Its health ministry said 16 had been infected by the same man who had returned from Italy. Kenya\u2019s health minister, Mutahi Kagwe, said the country\u2019s first case, a 27-year-old Kenyan, was diagnosed on Thursday after travelling home via London on 5 March. Meanwhile in the US: According to the US Centers for Disease Control there have now been 49 deaths throughout the country, with more than 2,200 total cases. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the state had more cases than any other in the US. The cluster of cases in New York has now surpassed Washington. Cuomo said; The number one thing we have to do in this state to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus is to increase testing, and the federal government has created a testing bottleneck nationwide with their slow response in lifting restrictions for states to authorise testing. We\u2019re dealing with the virus, but we\u2019re also dealing with the fear and anxiety New Yorkers are facing, and we\u2019re taking new actions every day as this situation evolves to address both. Following reports that vulnerable people including the elderly are struggling to buy essential items such as toilet paper as Australians rush to panic buy, supermarket giant Woolworths has announced a deal with Meals on Wheels in New South Wales to help deliver toilet paper directly to the elderly in the community. In a statement Woolworths said the first delivery of toilet paper was dropped off at the Meals on Wheels Central Coast branch in Tuggerah with more deliveries across NSW to follow in the next week. Woolworths managing director Claire Peters said: Due to the unprecedented demand on certain products in our stores, we\u2019ve heard that many elderly and vulnerable people in the community are missing out on items they may need when they shop. While we\u2019ll continue to do our very best to continue restocking our stores, we encourage all Australians to be mindful of those in your community at this time who might need help and ensure that we continue to support each other. Three more coronavirus cases have been confirmed in South Australia, the premier Steven Marshall said on Saturday. The people infected there including a student from Sacred Heart College. This means Australia has now reached 200 cases. Earlier on Saturday the shadow health minister Chris Bowen responded to the news that home affairs minister Peter Dutton had tested positive with the virus by saying the Australian government had been inconsistent in its response. He criticised Morrison for not getting tested for the virus or self-isolating following Dutton\u2019s diagnosis. But chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said Morrison and other ministers had not been in close contact with Dutton and did not need to undergo testing. Murphy said: No member of cabinet was in contact with minister Dutton within 24 hours of him becoming symptomatic, nor was I in fact in contact with him. So the prime minister was very, very clear to me that the cabinet and all the public officials follow the exact same public health rules as everybody else in the Australian community. If there had been a requirement for quarantine, he was insistent that government and cabinet follow those rules, so we just follow the normal public health advice, no-one had been in contact with the minister in that period Meanwhile in the US, president Donald Trump said the UK could be added to the list of European countries included in the US travel ban. PA Media reports: The US president announced a state of emergency on Friday to combat the coronavirus pandemic, freeing up billions of dollars in funding and promising a screening website and drive-through tests. He told reporters during a White House press conference afterwards that the UK exemption had been made after being \u201crecommended to me by a group of professionals\u201d but he said the UK\u2019s rising number of cases could result in a rethink of that decision. On Wednesday night, Trump announced that the US would temporarily suspend most travel from the European Union. The restrictions, which began on Friday and are set to last 30 days, do not currently apply to US citizens or to travellers from the UK or the Republic of Ireland. The restrictions apply to most foreign nationals who have been in the 26 countries of the Schengen area during the 14 days before their planned arrival in the US. The World Health Organization [WHO] has announced a Covid-19 \u2018Solidarity Response Fund\u2019, which it describes as a first-of-its-kind fund to raise money from a range of donors. The money will be used to help WHO and its and partners assist countries to respond to the pandemic. WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the fund marked \u201ca critical point in the global response\u201d to the virus. He said; \u201cA lot of people and institutions have been saying they want to contribute to the fight against the novel coronavirus. Now they can\u201d. He has declared Europe as the epicentre of the virus. \u201cMore cases are now being reported every day than were reported in China at the height of its epidemic,\u201d he said. The latest WHO figures show more than 132,500 people have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in 123 countries. Ghebreyesus said; We have shipped supplies of personal protective equipment to 56 countries, we\u2019re shipping to a further 28 countries, and we\u2019ve sent almost 1.5 million diagnostic tests to 120 countries. Our message to countries continues to be: you must take a comprehensive approach. As Australia prepares to ban mass gatherings of more than 500 people from Monday, the chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy said the government has modelling that says an infection could take some months to go right through the community \u201cwith a flattened curve\u201d. He said: But it depends how it develops. It might develop in focal parts of the country where we might be able to control it, if it develops in a number of parts it could last for quite a number of weeks. At the moment we are just focusing on containing and flattening it, and we will be reviewing our public health measures every day. One of the most important areas of preparation is to make sure we have sufficient critical care capacity. If we get a number of people who have severe disease and there is a lot of planning in that space. I do reiterate that if you did have a large outbreak in this country, probably 80% of people would be treated at home because they are so mild. But those who might need hospital, we have plans to stop elective surgery, expand open beds, find extra workforce, all of those plans are well advanced. I think we have a very well-prepared health system, there is clearly more preparation that is ongoing and we have clearly got to make sure in this worldwide situation that we can maximise the resources available in Australia such as those testing equipment. If we get a large outbreak and we can flatten the curve, it could go well into the middle of the year before it peaks. But there are some countries ... which seems to have peaked quite early and controlled the outbreak. One of the things we know about outbreaks and epidemics as they are very hard to predict. Welcome to our continuing coverage of the coronavirus outbreak Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. I\u2019m the Guardian\u2019s Melbourne bureau chief Melissa Davey, and I\u2019ll be keeping you up to date on all the latest developments. You can contact me at melissa.davey@theguardian.com or on Twitter. Here\u2019s a summary of the key points so far on the Covid-19 outbreak. The global death toll reached 5,359, while 142,557 cases have been confirmed. In addition, 70,176 people have recovered, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. The institution draws from official figures, so the true toll could be higher. The US president declared a national emergency. Donald Trump, who started out by dismissing coronavirus as a hoax, took the major step of designating it a national emergency. That allowed him to sweep aside a host of rules and regulations in order to try to stop its spread. But he repeatedly refused to accept any responsibility for his own administration\u2019s response to the outbreak. Europe is now the centre of the pandemic, the WHO said. Its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the continent has more cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined apart from China. The UK is set to ban mass gatherings \u2013 a significant U-turn by Downing Street. A Whitehall source briefed reporters that ministers are working on a plan to stop \u201cvarious types of public event, including mass gatherings, beginning next week\u201d. The government has thus deemed such measures unnecessary. The UK could be added to the US\u2019 travel ban, Trump said. Responding to news of a significant uptick in the number of UK cases, Trump indicated he was thinking of extended his ban to a country he has thus far protected, while taking others off the list. UK sporting events and elections were postponed. Almost all professional football in Britain, including a significant portion of the grassroots game, was suspended. Rugby fixtures were put off and the London marathon was postponed. In golf, the Masters, which is played in the US, was also cancelled. Local and mayoral elections due to take place in the UK later this year were put back to 2021. Spain declared a state of emergency, while a host of other countries announced strict new measures. Among them were France, Canada and Cyprus, as well as Bosnia, Switzerland and a string of others. Ivanka Trump working from home after contact with Australian government minister who has the virus. Donald Trump\u2019s daughter, who serves in the White House, will not self-quarantine despite coming into close contact with the Australian home affairs minister, Peter Dutton. In Australia the Victorian government will soon reveal more details about event cancellations following the cancellation of the Grand Prix on Friday.",

However, the NRL announced on Sunday it planned to continue the competition \u2013 without crowds \u2013 into round two despite the coronavirus pandemic. The number of new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in New South Wales rose by 22 in 24 hours to 134, with more than 250 cases nationally. In Victoria, the chief health officer, Brett Sutton, said eight new cases had been confirmed on Saturday, bringing the total number of cases in the state to 57. In Tasmania, passengers and crew were barred from disembarking from a cruise ship that docked in Hobart. The NSW tourism minister, Stuart Ayres, said the decision to cancel Vivid was made after recommendations from the federal government to limit non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people. Vivid, now in its 11th year, was scheduled to run from 22 May to 13 June. \u201cVivid Sydney is a bright star of Sydney\u2019s event calendar so the decision to cancel was not taken lightly.

Ayres said the decision to cancel was \u201canother body blow\u201d for the tourism industry, which has already endured challenges as a result of the bushfire crisis. In NSW an additional 22 people were diagnosed with Covid-19 between 11am on Saturday and 11am on Sunday, NSW Health said in a statement. The new cases include three people who recently returned from the United States, one who had returned from Singapore and another from the Philippines. Five people caught the infection after contact with other confirmed cases of COVID-19. The source for the remainder of the 22 new cases is under investigation, however two of those had also travelled overseas recently, including one to the United States.

No one on the ship has the illness but the captain made the call as a precaution to protect passengers\u2019 health. The ship left Italy in early January before the coronavirus became a global concern. Tasmania\u2019s acting director of public health, Scott McKeown, said on Saturday the state now had its sixth confirmed case of Covid-19 after a woman in her 60s tested positive. She was identified as a close contact of a previous Tasmanian case, who had recently travelled overseas, McKeown said on Sunday. The woman and all the other five cases in Tasmania were in a stable condition and remained in isolation receiving medical care. The state\u2019s Public Health Services had identified and contacted the woman\u2019s close contacts. These people will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days and receive daily follow-up from PHS staff. The new cases in Victoria this weekend include six men and two women with ages ranging from their teens to 60s. One is a student \u2013 a known contact of case 17, a teacher from Carey Grammar. The student was not at school during their infectious period. The school will remain closed until the holidays. And as a precaution, 12 classmates will home-isolate. Sutton said all cases were recovering at home in isolation. All had acquired the infection from either overseas or through close contact with known, confirmed cases of Covid-19.

      "bodyText": "School closures and stockpiling a fortnight\u2019s food to prepare for coronavirus self-isolation are \u201cpremature\u201d for the general population, the health minister, Greg Hunt, and chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, have said, though all options are on the table. Appearing alongside Hunt on ABC\u2019s Insiders on Sunday, Murphy said that federal authorities are currently recommending that returned travellers socially distance themselves although others should begin \u201cpractising\u201d to do the same, especially at-risk groups such as the elderly. Both reiterated these settings may change in future, with Hunt confirming that all options are on the table in the event a more general lockdown is required. Public concern about the consistency of advice about responding to coronavirus has grown as schools and universities prepare for shutdowns and the Victorian chief medical officer has suggested stockpiling a fortnight\u2019s worth of food. Labor and medical experts who do not report directly to governments have suggested Australia has been too slow to roll out a public information campaign and to advise in favour of more drastic social distancing. On Friday the Council of Australia Governments agreed that from Monday non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people across Australia should be cancelled. Scott Morrison said the advice did not apply to attendance at work, childcare, schools, university lectures, public transport, airports \u201cor things of that nature\u201d. On Sunday Hunt told Insiders the government\u2019s best estimate is that the coronavirus will reach its peak in Australia in a \u201csix-month window\u201d although it \u201cmight be longer\u201d. Asked about general lockdowns, Murphy replied they may be used although they may focus on one part of the country and not others. \u201cIt \u2013 it is potential that could be the case,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that may be focal. One of the things we know about outbreaks of infections is that they can affect one part of a country, not another.\u201d Asked if Sydney could be locked down and not the rest of the country, Murphy continued: \u201cPotentially you could. The Koreans did that for two provinces, very successfully locked them down. Everything is up for consideration.\u201d \u201cThere are no options that are off the table,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cThe paramount goal, and the prime minister said this to me at the outset, is protecting health.\u201d Murphy said authorities were \u201cstrongly suggesting that returned travellers should practise what we call \u2018social distancing\u2019. \u201cSo that\u2019s keeping a distance of 1.5 metres, if possible, from people, not getting in close contact \u2026 not shaking hands [and] avoiding all public gatherings.\u201d Murphy said that advice relating to gatherings of 500 people or more \u201cmay well change\u201d but Australia, which he said had \u201conly 250 cases\u201d, was still \u201cahead of the curve\u201d. \u201cIf you\u2019re over 70 you should be more careful, particularly if you have chronic disease, you should \u2026 [exercise] more social distancing,\u201d he said, and \u201cavoid things that aren\u2019t essential\u201d.

But I think it is probably sensible to have a few days of supply.\u201d Asked about school closures, Hunt said the government was keeping all options on the table and would be guided by medical advice. He said governments did not want to \u201cmove too early\u201d because of the risk of children being at home with their grandparents and \u201ctaking parents out of the workforce who might be in the health and medical sector, [and] disrupting supply chains\u201d. Murphy said there was \u201cno question we have a range of social distancing measures that we will not hesitate to recommend to government but they\u2019ve got to be proportional and they might last for a long time\u201d. \u201cSo you don\u2019t want to move too early.\u201d Murphy said there were \u201cvery few reports of symptomatic infection in children\u201d and authorities don\u2019t know \u201cwhether children are getting infected but just don\u2019t get symptoms [and] they can still spread it or they\u2019re not getting infected\u201d. \u201cThe former is probably more likely.\u201d Murphy also suggested children getting infected may contribute to herd immunity. Hunt said the government had started rolling out its first information campaign about coronavirus, and advice can be accessed at health.gov.au. The campaign urges people to wash their hands frequently, cover coughs and sneezes, and dispose of tissues, and avoid contact with others if they\u2019re feeling unwell. Murphy said Australian authorities define \u201cclose contact\u201d \u2013 which requires self-isolation \u2013 as \u201csomeone who has been in contact with someone who is symptomatic at any stage or up to 24 hours before\u201d. He then clarified that only people with contact with someone with coronavirus who had symptoms in the last 24 hours needs to self-isolate because they are \u201cvery, very unlikely to have been infectious\u201d. On Sunday Bill Bowtell, adjunct professor at the Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity, said he was \u201caghast\u201d at the lack of clarity and structure in the coronavirus response. Bowtell told Sky News that Murphy\u2019s advice on hand shaking was \u201cinconsistent with what New South Wales Health is saying\u201d and argued there is \u201cno coherent advice\u201d about whether schools should open from Monday. Bowtell said the government appeared to \u201chave no plan\u201d for the fact people whose wages are at threat will be unlikely to get tested, and said it was \u201cimperative\u201d to address the issue. The Morrison government has trimmed the waiting period for sickness allowance by one week, but rejected calls to introduce paid leave for casuals. Earlier, Hunt and Murphy addressed the revelation on Friday that the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, had been infected with coronavirus, after attending cabinet on Tuesday. Murphy suggested commonwealth offices in Sydney may have been cleaned out of an \u201cabundance of caution\u201d and Hunt suggested Qantas may have contacted passengers near Dutton on an earlier flight because the time period had not been determined. Hunt said Queensland Health had now determined \u201cthe relevant time for contact with Peter Dutton was the 11th of March\u201d, meaning cabinet members did not need to self-isolate as a result of Tuesday\u2019s meeting. On Friday Coag agreed to weekly meetings of a \u201cnational cabinet\u201d made up of Morrison, the six premiers and two chief ministers, as well as key federal ministers such as the treasurer. The first meeting will be held at midday on Sunday. So far Australia has responded to the coronavirus through travel bans from the worst-affected countries, a $2.4bn health package to create 100 fever clinics and boost telehealth consultations and a $17.6bn stimulus package to prevent a major economic downturn. The Morrison government has set up a new coronavirus business unit in the Treasury to support business confidence, employment and business continuity.",

If you want to know what\u2019s going on, tune to 5 Live, LBC or your local radio station. Rolling news, expert opinion, plus listener reaction and listeners\u2019 questions are often surprising and insightful.</p> <p>So this week I\u2019ve been listening to <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tt9hz/episodes/player\" title=\"\">Your Call</a></strong>, with Rachel Burden, and to<strong> <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09l5cpb/episodes/player\" title=\"\">Emma Barnett</a></strong>, both on 5 Live, as well as <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/nick-ferrari/health-expert-government-coronavirus-perverse/\" title=\"\">LBC\u2019s Nick Ferrari</a> (a bit) and <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/james-obrien/take-government-handling-covid19-coronavirus/\" title=\"\">James O\u2019Brien</a>. On Tuesday, with coronavirus doing what a virus does, meaning going viral, the on-air chat was of little else. And although everyone kept insisting that we should just follow governmental advice, the calls from listeners to <em>Your Call</em> revealed how confused people are. Should a listener with sciatica stop taking her immune-suppressant medication? (No, she should take it.) Should someone who\u2019s been to Basel in Switzerland and has a few mild symptoms go to work? (No, stay home and call 111, because then you will be logged somewhere on the NHS system, so that if you do get ill, you have a contact.) So said <a href=\"https://www.thethirdwayofevolution.com/people/view/frank-p.-ryan\" title=\"\">Dr Frank Ryan</a>, a virus specialist who didn\u2019t seem to agree with governmental advice about very much at all. The BBC has rushed out a coronavirus podcast <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/brand/p085f9hw\" title=\"\">on Sounds</a>, by the way, which includes this show.</p> <p>On Wednesday morning, with the news that Nadine Dorries had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/health-minister-nadine-dorries-diagnosed-with-coronavirus\" title=\"\">tested positive</a> for the virus, Barnett welcomed the Labour MP Rachael Maskell, who\u2019d recently had a meeting with Dorries and so, after calling 111, decided to self-isolate.

      "bodyText": "Your Call (Radio 5 Live) | BBC Sounds The Emma Barnett Show (Radio 5 Live) | BBC Sounds The Archers (Radio 4) | BBC Sounds Live radio is always the best medium in a crisis. If you want to know what\u2019s going on, tune to 5 Live, LBC or your local radio station. Rolling news, expert opinion, plus listener reaction and listeners\u2019 questions are often surprising and insightful. So this week I\u2019ve been listening to Your Call, with Rachel Burden, and to Emma Barnett, both on 5 Live, as well as LBC\u2019s Nick Ferrari (a bit) and James O\u2019Brien. On Tuesday, with coronavirus doing what a virus does, meaning going viral, the on-air chat was of little else. And although everyone kept insisting that we should just follow governmental advice, the calls from listeners to Your Call revealed how confused people are. Should a listener with sciatica stop taking her immune-suppressant medication? (No, she should take it.) Should someone who\u2019s been to Basel in Switzerland and has a few mild symptoms go to work? (No, stay home and call 111, because then you will be logged somewhere on the NHS system, so that if you do get ill, you have a contact.) So said Dr Frank Ryan, a virus specialist who didn\u2019t seem to agree with governmental advice about very much at all. The BBC has rushed out a coronavirus podcast on Sounds, by the way, which includes this show. On Wednesday morning, with the news that Nadine Dorries had tested positive for the virus, Barnett welcomed the Labour MP Rachael Maskell, who\u2019d recently had a meeting with Dorries and so, after calling 111, decided to self-isolate. Maskell stays with her sister when working as an MP in London, she said. Barnett, always alert to detail, pounced. How was that working? Maskell has \u201ccreated a barrier\u201d, she said. \u201cHow have you done this?\u201d wondered Barnett, and we discovered that Maskell was, essentially, sitting in her bedroom, texting, calling and using her computer, only emerging to use the bathroom and, possibly, make cheese on toast. Listener Steve wondered if Maskell was getting full pay or sick pay, but she confessed she hadn\u2019t even asked as yet. Later, we got the budget, which was the usual shouting and sneering fest. Why were MPs going to the Houses of Parliament at all, wondered many 5 Live listeners, given that one of them had tested positive? Why couldn\u2019t they all just stay at home and listen to the radio for the chancellor\u2019s speech? \u201cWe\u2019d take it wherever Rishi Sunak was,\u201d agreed Barnett. \u201cWe\u2019d just link up the mics.\u201d If unnecessary gatherings are to be cancelled for health reasons, I do hope that parliament leads by example. All MPs should immediately self-isolate in their bedrooms, eat delivery pizza and attempt a spot of online work, before getting distracted by the internet, spraying around some disinfectant and spending three hours bitching about the state of the world on social media.

      "body": "<p>Life as we know it is about to change dramatically. And when the world eventually emerges from this pandemic, it is likely to be irrevocably altered. In the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p086hjgc\" title=\"\">words of one public health expert</a>, Professor Graham Medley: \u201cThis is the kind of event that is going to live on for decades.\u201d It will either cause illness or death on a scale most of us have not experienced in our lifetimes, or it will take huge changes to the way we live our lives in order to avoid that. The social impact will be more momentous than anything Britain has experienced since the two world wars.</p> <p>This weekend, ministers have warned that increasingly <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexwickham/coronavirus-boris-johnson-tougher-restrictions\" title=\"\">stringent measures</a> will be introduced on people\u2019s movements in the coming days and weeks, and that they are likely to be in place for months. More of us will be asked to self-isolate or to reduce the contact we have with other people for long periods of time. Many will be asked to work from home for weeks, if not months. Travelling abroad will become increasingly restricted. Major sporting and cultural events have already been cancelled, with others likely to follow. In an unprecedented move, local and mayoral elections have been delayed by a year. But by far the most devastating likely impact of this pandemic was hinted at by the prime minister last Thursday. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-johnson-warns-many-more-families-are-going-to-lose-loved-ones-video\" title=\"\">Many more families are going to lose loved ones,</a>\u201d he said at a press conference. This is the frightening truth about what the government\u2019s top scientists believe is to come.</p> <h2>Policy under scrutiny<br></h2> <p>Amid rising public anxiety, there is more scrutiny than ever of the government\u2019s decision to move from the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/covid-19-government-announces-moving-out-of-contain-phase-and-into-delay\" title=\"\">\u201ccontain\u201d to the \u201cdelay\u201d phase </a>of its strategy. The emphasis has shifted from tracing and testing all those who have been in contact with people confirmed to have contracted Covid-19, to asking all those with symptoms to self-isolate. The government also announced some further limited measures to limit social contact: from next week, mass events with more than 500 people will be banned. But it has faced strong criticism from some public health experts for not taking more stringent action, such as larger-scale closures of places where people congregate, restrictions on public transport, closure of schools and asking more people to self-isolate.</p> <p>The government says it will phase in more stringent restrictions in the coming days and weeks, and that it is not looking at this point to suppress the spread of the virus altogether. There appear to be two interrelated reasons for this. The first is that the government\u2019s experts are concerned that asking people to observe strict social distancing measures for long periods of time, such as widespread self-isolation even for those with no symptoms, could backfire. Like all governments, it is trying to minimise the extent to which demand for critical care exceeds maximum capacity in the NHS, in order to keep death rates from the virus as low as possible and to give the NHS time to do what it can to extend that capacity, already low by European standards. There is clearly a worry that it is untenable to ask people to fundamentally alter their lifestyles for very long stretches of time and that to introduce some measures now would be to risk a significant peak in cases further down the line if people were to abandon those lifestyle changes later on, for example, because they no longer believed they were needed, or could not afford to do so.</p> <p>Second, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser has said that its strategy is driven by the objective of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-science-chief-defends-uk-measures-criticism-herd-immunity\" title=\"\">developing herd immunity</a>, which occurs when a sufficient number of people in a population are immune to a disease, to offer some level of protection to everyone. He has said that the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-millions-of-britons-will-need-to-contract-covid-19-for-herd-immunity-11956793\" title=\"\">working assumption</a> is that about 60% of the population will need to catch the disease in order to achieve that.</p> <p>This implies the government is assuming that, even with social distancing measures in place, it is inevitable that a large proportion of the population will contract coronavirus before a treatment or vaccine becomes available, and the best it can do is to manage the flow of people requiring hospitalisation in order to protect those who are most vulnerable. This sits in stark contrast to the strategy deployed by a country such as South Korea \u2013 whose lead most other countries are following \u2013 which is to delay the rate at which the virus spreads as much as possible, using much more stringent social distancing measures and a more comprehensive testing and isolation regime.</p> <h2>Public confidence<br></h2> <p>This difference has prompted serious questions about why the government\u2019s strategy differs from much of the rest of the world. Would 60% of the population contracting the virus be enough to offer any meaningful level of population immunity? Is it even right to assume that people contracting the virus will develop long-term immunity? On what sort of evidence is the government basing its assumption that the public will only tolerate stringent social distancing for so long? Why does it appear that there have been few measures and little guidance to protect those most vulnerable to the symptoms of Covid-19 \u2013 older people and those with underlying medical conditions \u2013 as the disease spreads? On the other hand, there are huge uncertainties and risks involved in trying to halt the spread of the disease as much as possible at this time. What would happen if people broke quarantine before a treatment or vaccine was developed? What might be the impact on the NHS of a large peak in cases as we move into next winter? What would be the impact of immediately closing schools, given that grandparents are likely to pick up the childcare slack and children are more likely to mix outside school the longer closures go on? This would significantly affect the availability of those doing critical jobs in the NHS, care homes and the food supply chain.</p> <p>This is why anyone who expresses with absolute certainty that the government has got this entirely wrong should be treated with some scepticism. There is no surefire way to combat the virus: there are too many unknowns for that. It is however, absolutely right that public health experts are asking questions about why this strategy is so divergent from the overall recommendations of the World Health Organization. The government must be far more transparent about the evidence and assumptions on which it is basing its decisions, or risk undermining public confidence in its actions.</p> <p>There are other problems beyond a lack of transparency. Ministers have said they will seek to legislate for sweeping emergency powers that will last for two years, including giving the police the power to detain suspected victims of the virus, and reducing standards in care homes to allow for staff shortages. Such powers should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, and should initially be introduced on a more temporary basis to avoid significant incursions on our liberty and a watering down of basic standards becoming the new norm. Moreover, after a decade of austerity that has put services like the NHS and social care under intolerable strain, and eroded tax credits for families, there are questions to be asked about whether last week\u2019s budget went far enough in terms of channelling additional resources to public services and protecting low-income families from the forthcoming massive economic shock.</p> <h2>International cooperation<br></h2> <p>The contrast between the approach taken by the UK and the rest of the world has also prompted questions about the lack of coordination at an international level, both in relation to the public health or the economic response. \u201cOur willingness to cooperate is becoming inversely related to our need to do so,\u201d Gordon Brown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-crisis-leaders-failing-gordon-brown\" title=\"\">wrote last week</a>. He is right: this pandemic is exposing the extent to which the international organisations and networks that exist to promote global cooperation are fraying as a result of the spread of populism. At a moment when the US might once have provided global leadership, President Trump is flailing; having spent weeks denying the existence of a looming pandemic, he has now politicised the crisis, erratically introducing measures that seem designed to bolster his America First re-election campaign rather than protect citizens. Coronavirus may be the most pressing and immediate global challenge we face; but there are plenty more to come, from microbial resistance to the climate crisis. Effective solutions will only be found if countries rediscover a willingness to work in concert.</p> <p>International cooperation may be proving elusive, but we should take hope from one comfort that might emerge from this crisis: it is heartening to see so many individuals pitching in to help neighbours, or offering to support older people who may be isolated and lonely. This pandemic may leave us a legacy of social action and civic engagement that we should seek to sustain long after its worst threat has subsided. Life may be about to change immeasurably in a way most of us would not have dreamed of just weeks ago. But by looking out for each other, by following government advice even as we question it with healthy scepticism, and by acting for the greater good, we can collectively try to minimise the pain that will undoubtedly be wrought by this pandemic.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Life as we know it is about to change dramatically. And when the world eventually emerges from this pandemic, it is likely to be irrevocably altered. In the words of one public health expert, Professor Graham Medley: \u201cThis is the kind of event that is going to live on for decades.\u201d It will either cause illness or death on a scale most of us have not experienced in our lifetimes, or it will take huge changes to the way we live our lives in order to avoid that. The social impact will be more momentous than anything Britain has experienced since the two world wars. This weekend, ministers have warned that increasingly stringent measures will be introduced on people\u2019s movements in the coming days and weeks, and that they are likely to be in place for months. More of us will be asked to self-isolate or to reduce the contact we have with other people for long periods of time. Many will be asked to work from home for weeks, if not months. Travelling abroad will become increasingly restricted. Major sporting and cultural events have already been cancelled, with others likely to follow. In an unprecedented move, local and mayoral elections have been delayed by a year. But by far the most devastating likely impact of this pandemic was hinted at by the prime minister last Thursday. \u201cMany more families are going to lose loved ones,\u201d he said at a press conference. This is the frightening truth about what the government\u2019s top scientists believe is to come. Policy under scrutiny Amid rising public anxiety, there is more scrutiny than ever of the government\u2019s decision to move from the \u201ccontain\u201d to the \u201cdelay\u201d phase of its strategy. The emphasis has shifted from tracing and testing all those who have been in contact with people confirmed to have contracted Covid-19, to asking all those with symptoms to self-isolate. The government also announced some further limited measures to limit social contact: from next week, mass events with more than 500 people will be banned. But it has faced strong criticism from some public health experts for not taking more stringent action, such as larger-scale closures of places where people congregate, restrictions on public transport, closure of schools and asking more people to self-isolate. The government says it will phase in more stringent restrictions in the coming days and weeks, and that it is not looking at this point to suppress the spread of the virus altogether. There appear to be two interrelated reasons for this. The first is that the government\u2019s experts are concerned that asking people to observe strict social distancing measures for long periods of time, such as widespread self-isolation even for those with no symptoms, could backfire.

Second, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser has said that its strategy is driven by the objective of developing herd immunity, which occurs when a sufficient number of people in a population are immune to a disease, to offer some level of protection to everyone. He has said that the government\u2019s working assumption is that about 60% of the population will need to catch the disease in order to achieve that. This implies the government is assuming that, even with social distancing measures in place, it is inevitable that a large proportion of the population will contract coronavirus before a treatment or vaccine becomes available, and the best it can do is to manage the flow of people requiring hospitalisation in order to protect those who are most vulnerable.

The tech giant <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179118/google-coronavirus-testing-screening-website-drive-thru-covid-19\">denied it is doing any such thing</a>.</p> <p>The bizarrely misleading claim was indicative of Trump\u2019s mishandling of a crisis different in magnitude from any he faced before. The former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation and the Ukraine scandal that led to Trump\u2019s impeachment did not send markets into free fall, force mass closures of schools and sporting events or potentially put millions of lives at risk.</p> <p>The acid test of Trump\u2019s maverick leadership has finally come.</p> <p>His response so far has been \u201chaphazard\u201d, said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelSteele?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Michael Steele</a>, former chairman of the Republican National Committee. \u201cWhen you start from the point of thinking the whole thing is a hoax, or at least something your political opponents are ginning up to use against you, it colours your whole approach.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s original sin was committed two years ago when he disbanded a White House office dealing specifically with preparation for pandemics. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NewsHour/status/1238572800186757120?s=20\">His discomfort on this topic</a> was clear on Friday when a reporter asked him about it.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I just think it\u2019s a nasty question,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s second big mistake was turning down the offer of a German-made diagnostic test approved by the World Health Organization (WHO). Asked about the shortage, which left America lagging far behind South Korea and other countries, Trump said: \u201cI don\u2019t take responsibility at all.\u201d</p> <p>The past few weeks have also brought a cascade of false statements that sought to downplay the severity of the threat and wish it away. The coronavirus is not as bad as the seasonal flu, Trump has maintained, and will disappear in the warmth of spring. The slump of financial markets, on which Trump has yoked so much of his re-election hopes, finally seized his attention.</p> <p>Everything he did, however, just seemed to make matters worse. He toured the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta wearing a \u201cKeep America Great\u201d cap, boasting of his \u201cnatural ability\u201d to understand the subject and making the bogus assertion that any American who needs a coronavirus test can get one.</p> <p>On Wednesday this week he addressed the nation from the Oval Office, live on primetime TV. It was, in many viewers\u2019 estimation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/donald-trump-us-coronavirus-address\">an unmitigated disaster</a>, fueling anxiety rather than calm, panic rather than reassurance.

      "bodyText": "With his back to the wall, Donald Trump turned to perhaps the only people that truly impress him: not health experts or scientists but the titans of corporate America. Confronted by a global pandemic he cannot bully, insult or out-tweet, the president paraded chief executives at the White House in the hope they could dig him out of a hole partly of his own making. Retailers such as CVS, Target, Walmart and Walgreens \u2013 household names in America \u2013 will provide \u201cdrive-thru\u201d testing for the coronavirus, Trump promised, while Google was developing a national website to offer guidance. This, however, came as a surprise to Google. The tech giant denied it is doing any such thing. The bizarrely misleading claim was indicative of Trump\u2019s mishandling of a crisis different in magnitude from any he faced before. The former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation and the Ukraine scandal that led to Trump\u2019s impeachment did not send markets into free fall, force mass closures of schools and sporting events or potentially put millions of lives at risk. The acid test of Trump\u2019s maverick leadership has finally come. His response so far has been \u201chaphazard\u201d, said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee. \u201cWhen you start from the point of thinking the whole thing is a hoax, or at least something your political opponents are ginning up to use against you, it colours your whole approach.\u201d Trump\u2019s original sin was committed two years ago when he disbanded a White House office dealing specifically with preparation for pandemics. His discomfort on this topic was clear on Friday when a reporter asked him about it. \u201cWell, I just think it\u2019s a nasty question,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d Trump\u2019s second big mistake was turning down the offer of a German-made diagnostic test approved by the World Health Organization (WHO). Asked about the shortage, which left America lagging far behind South Korea and other countries, Trump said: \u201cI don\u2019t take responsibility at all.\u201d The past few weeks have also brought a cascade of false statements that sought to downplay the severity of the threat and wish it away. The coronavirus is not as bad as the seasonal flu, Trump has maintained, and will disappear in the warmth of spring. The slump of financial markets, on which Trump has yoked so much of his re-election hopes, finally seized his attention. Everything he did, however, just seemed to make matters worse. He toured the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta wearing a \u201cKeep America Great\u201d cap, boasting of his \u201cnatural ability\u201d to understand the subject and making the bogus assertion that any American who needs a coronavirus test can get one. On Wednesday this week he addressed the nation from the Oval Office, live on primetime TV. It was, in many viewers\u2019 estimation, an unmitigated disaster, fueling anxiety rather than calm, panic rather than reassurance. Trump blindsided European officials by announcing a 30-day travel ban and made some basic factual errors the White House had to correct. Then came Friday\u2019s rose garden reset. Trump declared a national emergency that released $50bn for state and local governments. Shaking hands with chief executives despite medical advice on social distancing, the president promised a public-private partnership to finally make testing widely available. His eternally loyal vice-president, Mike Pence, did his best to reshape the narrative. \u201cThis day should be an inspiration to every American,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause thanks to your leadership from early on, not only are we bringing a whole-of-government approach to confronting the coronavirus, we\u2019re bringing an all-of-America approach. \u201cMr President, from early on, you took decisive action. You suspended all travel from China \u2026 throughout this process, Mr President, you\u2019ve put the health of America first.\u201d It was an attempt to right the ship and restore confidence. But will it work? There was a promising sign on the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped nearly 2,000 points \u2013 its biggest point gain ever. Furthermore, there are few signs that the coronavirus shambles has disillusioned Trump\u2019s supporters. Some 87% of Republicans approve of his handling of the problem, according to a Quinnipiac University poll. Sean Spicer, a former White House press secretary, said: \u201cI think they came out really strong in terms of declaring flights shut down [from China]. The rollout of the kits and the testing was a step backwards but now they seem to be getting their footing back.\u201d Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, said: \u201cHe gets mixed reviews. His rhetoric over this has been sloppy if not reckless: the Trump tendency to blurt out things, loose talk. Where he got good reviews lies in the government\u2019s overall approach.\u201d Whalen noted that California\u2019s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, had praised Trump for supporting his state in the repatriation of passengers from a coronavirus-infected cruise ship. Newsom told reporters: \u201cWe had a private conversation, but [Trump] said: \u2018We\u2019re gonna do the right thing\u2019 and \u2018You have my support, all of our support, logistically and otherwise\u2019. He said everything I could have hoped for and we had a very long conversation and every single thing he said, they followed through on.\u201d Trump will almost certainly face Joe Biden in November\u2019s presidential election. Standing before US flags, the former vice-president gave a speech this week about his plan to tackle the coronavirus, presenting the image of a government in waiting. It made for a telling contrast with Trump, who may find himself haunted by the spectre of George W Bush\u2019s bungled response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Whalen said: \u201cThe question is how does he handle this as on a personal level. For Bush, the problem with Katrina wasn\u2019t the federal response but Bush not getting out of the plane, not showing the personal touch.

      "body": "<p>In the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, where millions have been under lockdown for the last two months, Hubei residents have been coping with uncertainty, anxiety and stress.</p> <p>As the virus spreads around the world, people living in the province spoke to the Guardian about how they coped with prolonged confinement, isolation and panic, and the strategies they used to protect their mental health.</p> <h2><strong>Guo Jing, 29, Wuhan: \u2018</strong>Make yourself a point of connection\u2019</h2> <p>At the beginning, the decision to close the city was so sudden that everyone was at a loss. I only knew about it the next morning. There was no time to react, no option to leave. I was panicked and at a loss. I didn\u2019t know when the lockdown would end, so went out to buy vegetables and see how the food supply was, which alleviated my anxiety to some extent.</p> <p>Every day, I have tried to get up and exercise, cook and eat, write a diary and do some volunteer work. Taking action and doing things makes you feel better.</p> <p>Everyone has been worrying and I have been restricting the time spent outside. I am isolated here. But human beings are social. So I have been going out every day to interview sanitation workers. I have asked them about their problems and working conditions. This connection has been very real. Talking online to friends has also been a kind of mutual support.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"47d8f79f0eba5e5ca68f2550de497986b56a66d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47d8f79f0eba5e5ca68f2550de497986b56a66d0/0_61_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"woman looks outside from the balcony at a residential compound in Wuhan, the centre of the novel coronavirus outbreak\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Wuhan resident stands at her balcony.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REUTERS/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was also a sense of anxiety from not knowing when it would end. I have looked at the numbers every day.</p> <p>It has also been very difficult to be locked in the community. It deprives you of some sense of control. Food has been bought by the residential community. I can\u2019t even control what I want to buy. It feels like I have had to rely on other people to live.</p> <p>By writing a diary online, I have connected with other people. People have sent masks to me that I have donated to sanitation workers or to a hospital. [I recommend] making yourself a point of connection and forming a network to serve the needs of different groups.</p> <p>It is very important to rebuild your daily life, to maintain social connection, to connect with friends and the people around you. If you can participate in some volunteer work this can alleviate the sense of powerlessness in the face of a huge disaster. Caring for others, seeing their needs and doing what you can to help, is also a way of helping yourself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/conspiracy-theory-that-coronavirus-originated-in-us-gaining-traction-in-china\">'American coronavirus': China pushes propaganda casting doubt on virus origin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chatting with my friends we have all commented on what a luxury it is to talk every day. We have shared what we have done every day. Some people have started to exercise while others have started studying. Some people who normally don\u2019t like to go out are now going out every day. It has felt precious.</p> <h2><strong>Werther Huang, 22, Wuhan: \u2018Ask for help\u2019</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s hard to describe. Never-ending anxiety and heart palpitations. Most recently, I haven\u2019t been able to concentrate on my work. I don\u2019t absorb what I\u2019m reading. I\u2019m constantly looking at Weibo to see the latest developments. Really, it just makes things worse, but I can\u2019t help it.</p> <p>I have tried to shift my attention. I have played games online with my friends. When I need to work, I have used the time-management app, Forest. But when I look at the news again, all this effort is for nothing.</p> <p>If you feel stressed, you can communicate with your relatives and friends, or ask a psychologist for help.

Like most people, I didn\u2019t know before that the epidemic was so serious. So when I went home, I was very worried I had been infected and afraid I would infect my family.</p> <p>I sprayed alcohol all over my body. I consciously kept a distance with my family. After half a month of self isolation, nothing happened. Finally, the stone hanging in my heart was lifted.</p> <p>Seeing the messages online of people begging for help and unable to find a hospital bed was really hard for me. I felt like I couldn\u2019t help. If I was in Wuhan maybe there would have been something I could have done. The more [messages] I saw, the guiltier I felt. As much as I could, I tried to forward on people\u2019s requests for help online.

      "bodyText": "In the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, where millions have been under lockdown for the last two months, Hubei residents have been coping with uncertainty, anxiety and stress. As the virus spreads around the world, people living in the province spoke to the Guardian about how they coped with prolonged confinement, isolation and panic, and the strategies they used to protect their mental health. Guo Jing, 29, Wuhan: \u2018Make yourself a point of connection\u2019 At the beginning, the decision to close the city was so sudden that everyone was at a loss. I only knew about it the next morning. There was no time to react, no option to leave. I was panicked and at a loss. I didn\u2019t know when the lockdown would end, so went out to buy vegetables and see how the food supply was, which alleviated my anxiety to some extent. Every day, I have tried to get up and exercise, cook and eat, write a diary and do some volunteer work. Taking action and doing things makes you feel better. Everyone has been worrying and I have been restricting the time spent outside. I am isolated here. But human beings are social. So I have been going out every day to interview sanitation workers. I have asked them about their problems and working conditions. This connection has been very real. Talking online to friends has also been a kind of mutual support. There was also a sense of anxiety from not knowing when it would end. I have looked at the numbers every day. It has also been very difficult to be locked in the community. It deprives you of some sense of control. Food has been bought by the residential community. I can\u2019t even control what I want to buy. It feels like I have had to rely on other people to live. By writing a diary online, I have connected with other people. People have sent masks to me that I have donated to sanitation workers or to a hospital. [I recommend] making yourself a point of connection and forming a network to serve the needs of different groups. It is very important to rebuild your daily life, to maintain social connection, to connect with friends and the people around you. If you can participate in some volunteer work this can alleviate the sense of powerlessness in the face of a huge disaster. Caring for others, seeing their needs and doing what you can to help, is also a way of helping yourself. Chatting with my friends we have all commented on what a luxury it is to talk every day. We have shared what we have done every day. Some people have started to exercise while others have started studying. Some people who normally don\u2019t like to go out are now going out every day. It has felt precious. Werther Huang, 22, Wuhan: \u2018Ask for help\u2019 It\u2019s hard to describe. Never-ending anxiety and heart palpitations. Most recently, I haven\u2019t been able to concentrate on my work. I don\u2019t absorb what I\u2019m reading. I\u2019m constantly looking at Weibo to see the latest developments. Really, it just makes things worse, but I can\u2019t help it. I have tried to shift my attention. I have played games online with my friends. When I need to work, I have used the time-management app, Forest. But when I look at the news again, all this effort is for nothing. If you feel stressed, you can communicate with your relatives and friends, or ask a psychologist for help. Take advantage of this time to care for yourself and your family. Shen Miao, 30, Tianmen city, Hubei province: \u2018I write every day\u2019 I came home from Wuhan the day before the lockdown. Like most people, I didn\u2019t know before that the epidemic was so serious. So when I went home, I was very worried I had been infected and afraid I would infect my family. I sprayed alcohol all over my body. I consciously kept a distance with my family. After half a month of self isolation, nothing happened. Finally, the stone hanging in my heart was lifted. Seeing the messages online of people begging for help and unable to find a hospital bed was really hard for me. I felt like I couldn\u2019t help. If I was in Wuhan maybe there would have been something I could have done. The more [messages] I saw, the guiltier I felt. As much as I could, I tried to forward on people\u2019s requests for help online. Reading the news and these posts, I felt despair and like my heart could not bear that much. I feel like I am a survivor. It\u2019s a privilege to be healthy. I have read books, watched plays and movies. I have watched the news. I started writing a \u201clock down\u201d diary, and plan to write until the end of the lockdown. I have written every day. Sometimes I just have just posted a picture. Several of my posts have been deleted but it has helped me. It has provided a channel for me to express emotions. Seeing other people reply has let me know that I am not alone. Everyone is in this situation. I am not special. Hu, 22 Huanggang city, Hubei: \u2018Talking with friends is really important\u2019 I have documented what was happening through conversations with people or by going out. I have also volunteered in the hospitals. This has kept me busy, and allowed me to relax while also helping some of the rescue efforts. It has helped relieve some of the mental and emotional pressure. Talking with friends is also really important.

Nick Carter, Sanders\u2019 political outreach director in 2016, told the New York Times the Vermont senator was \u201cpivoting to ensure that the issues that he has built his political career around continue to be front and center in the political dialogue. \u201cI also think he has [at the] top of [his] mind ensuring his supporters and those unenthusiastic about a Biden candidacy don\u2019t call it a day.\u201d Many in the Democratic establishment would prefer the independent from Vermont admit defeat and put his shoulder to the wheel for Biden. In emails to the Guardian, Martin O\u2019Malley, a former Baltimore mayor, Maryland governor and candidate for the presidential nomination, said he was \u201cguessing, most kindly, that Bernie is thinking as quickly as Biden sprung back to political life, he could as easily stumble and so he has an obligation to hang in there. \u201cWhat he risks is that more and more people [see] his messiah veneer fall away and his hypocrisy on many issues \u2013 gun safety, immigration reform, Russia interference \u2013 will strip away his lovable old uncle persona.\u201d At the polls, Biden\u2019s comeback from seemingly inevitable defeat has been powered by older voters, moderates, voters in swing counties and an overwhelming percentage of African Americans. \u201cI think Biden has been so battered and scarred already,\u201d O\u2019Malley said, \u201c[that] I\u2019m not sure there is much more that Bernie can do \u2026 in fact, Bernie could be a useful foil for Biden\u2019s need to appeal to and win more independents.\u201d Reed Galen, a former aide to George W Bush and John McCain, left the Republican party in 2016 and is now part of the Lincoln Project, a super Pac devoted to producing ads against Trump. Sanders is \u201cusing the core of his support base to not drop out gracefully\u201d, Galen told the Guardian on Saturday, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t think Bernie Sanders has grace about him. From my perspective I think he should have [dropped out] and let the Biden campaign go and do the things it needs to do vis-a-vis Trump. \u201cBut Bernie doesn\u2019t care because he\u2019s not a Democrat and never has been, so from his supporters\u2019 perspective, if they wreck the Democratic party it\u2019s just another win for them.\u201d Galen and O\u2019Malley both expected a fiery contest in CNN\u2019s Washington studio. \u201cBiden won\u2019t stand there like a punching bag,\u201d said O\u2019Malley, who experienced the highs and lows of the debate stage alongside Sanders and Hillary Clinton. \u201cHe will hit back when pressed. And Bernie has no choice but to press.\u201d Galen said he thought Biden had a good opportunity to appeal again to moderates and independents, but added a warning about the pitfalls of any such bare-knuckle political bout, into which Biden has fallen in this and other elections. \u201cWhen you hit that debate stage it\u2019s like a roller coaster heading downhill,\u201d he said. \u201cYou hope it\u2019s going to stay on the tracks but once in a while it goes flying off the edge.\u201d The coronavirus outbreak \u2013 which caused Univision host Jorge Ramos to step aside as a debate host after contact with someone exposed to Covid-19 \u2013 seems sure to dominate proceedings. Both Biden and Sanders addressed the nation on the subject this week, attempting to present a contrast with Trump\u2019s wildly uneven attempts to lead. Galen said he thought Biden\u2019s advisers would therefore seek to \u201cutilise what Biden has been best at, which is relying on personal experience. \u201cWe saw this week that he started talking about what he\u2019s done in government and what government can and can\u2019t do. I think his team will try to stay in that fairly narrow zone. \u201cBut it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if they also spend a fair amount of time focused on Trump. Here\u2019s a way that he can use a sledgehammer on Trump but a scalpel on Sanders: by saying, \u2018Here\u2019s a guy we elected that had no experience, no people willing to work for him, no people he is willing to listen to. We can\u2019t have that anymore.\u2019\u201d Galen and O\u2019Malley both deplored a tweet sent by Trump\u2019s campaign this week which called Biden a \u201crotting corpse of a candidate\u201d, and said it was a taste of the fierce and dirty fight to come. \u201cThere is one question and only one question that viewers will be asking themselves during Sunday\u2019s debate,\u201d O\u2019Malley said, \u201cand it is this: which of these two candidates would do the best job of keeping me and my family safe in a big emergency, like, a pandemic. \u201cWhat I do know is that of the three men left [including Trump], more and more people are wishing Biden were already in charge.\u201d In fact, the Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is still campaigning. For the debate in Washington on Sunday, however, she did not meet qualification criteria set by the Democratic National Committee.",

Ominously, there are far fewer hospital beds per capita in the US compared to the Lombardy region in Italy, where the coronavirus has overwhelmed the healthcare system. \u201cWe don\u2019t have all the beds we need and if this thing hits us full on we are going to be up the creek,\u201d said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. \u201cWe started with a very crippled public health system that has been underfunded for many years and we knew that something like this would cause us huge challenges. We are seeing that now. We are planning for the worst but hoping for the best.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The international travel industry faces a widespread shutdown over coronavirus fears after airlines announced new flight reductions and more countries introduced travel bans and isolation requirements. Travel businesses were hit with multiple doses of bad news on Saturday and Sunday, with the US expanding its Europe travel ban to include the UK and Ireland, a number of South American countries bringing in flight restrictions and Australia joining New Zealand in requiring all people entering the country to self-isolate for 14 days. American Airlines, the second biggest in the world, said on Saturday that it would start implementing a phased suspension of nearly all long-haul international flights from Monday, amid reduced demand and travel restrictions due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. The cruise industry also suffered another setback when two ships were placed in quarantine in Chile after an elderly British man aboard one of them tested positive for the coronavirus, the health ministry announced on Saturday. The US government said on Saturday that it would \u201cimmediately\u201d begin working on ways to help the coronavirus-hit aviation and cruise industries as they scramble to stem losses and protect jobs. The crisis facing the industry has been accelerated by the latest extension of the US ban on incoming travel, with US vice-president Mike Pence announcing at the White House on Saturday that British and Irish travellers would also be barred from entering the US for 30 days. At the same press conference, Donald Trump revealed that he had taken a test for the virus, with the White House later revealing that he had proved negative. In Spain, the wife of prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez has tested positive as her husband formally declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus. Spain is now the fourth-worst affected country in the world after it recorded more deaths to take the total to 196. S\u00e1nchez said the country would be placed in lockdown for two weeks and ordered people to stay at home unless they had to buy food or medicine or go to work or hospital. The outbreak also worsened in the UK on Saturday with the total of deaths nearly doubling from 11 to 21 amid continued controversy about whether the government\u2019s policy aimed at creating \u201cherd immunity\u201d from the disease would work or not. Around the world, varying measures of control continued to be imposed on populations from the Philippines, where the capital Manila was in the process of being sealed off, to Argentina where flights from countries badly hit by the virus have been halted. The prospect of a shattering blow for the airline industry was foreshadowed by the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, as he announced that all international passenger arrivals from midnight Sunday would be legally required to self-isolate for 14 days. The flights would dry up \u201cvery, very quickly\u201d, he said, and set up serious concerns for the country\u2019s $3.5bn cruise industry by adding that passenger ships from foreign ports would be banned for an initial 30 days. Even before the new curbs were announced, the chief executive of British Airways told staff that the airline was in a \u201cfight for survival\u201d. US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said the government would \u201cimmediately\u201d start working with Congress to support the afflicted industries. The US restrictions on travel to the UK and Ireland will begin on Monday at midnight, Pence said. Most non-US citizens who have been in those countries within the last 14 days will be barred from entering America. The restrictions do not bar flights to and from the US, and Americans and permanent residents can still travel. As the curbs were revealed, United and Delta airlines said they would start cutting flights to the UK and Southwest, one of the few US airlines still flying a full schedule, said it was \u201cseriously considering\u201d cutting flights. United said it would suspend flights to London from Houston and Denver starting Monday. The airline expects to fly three daily flights to London and one daily flight to Dublin through the end of April.

The US Chamber of Commerce on Friday called on the government to \u201cturn next to a package to assist impacted employers ... No business should go bankrupt because of a temporary loss in revenue as a result of the coronavirus.\u201d In Europe, the situation for the sector was increasingly dire. Norwegian Air, which has built up large debts to establish itself as a low-cost transatlantic operator, said on Saturday that it had \u201cweeks not months\u201d to avert collapse. KLM, the Dutch subsidiary of Air France-KLM, plans to slash up to 2,000 jobs, cut working hours by one-third for its entire staff and ask for government support. German flagship carrier Lufthansa said on Friday it was considering a request for state aid. In Bolivia, a ban on direct flights to and from Europe went into effect on Saturday. Travellers from China, South Korea, Italy and Spain are also banned from entry. Panama banned flights from Asia, one day after blocking flights from Europe. Chile, meanwhile, has quarantined more than 1,300 people aboard two cruise ships after an elderly Briton aboard one of them tested positive for the coronavirus, the health ministry announced Saturday. The 85-year-old man, who is reportedly in good condition in a hospital in the city of Coyhaique, showed symptoms of the virus after getting off the Silver Explorer ship in the far southern port of Caleta Tortel, 2,400 kilometres (1,500 miles) from Santiago. The other ship, the Azmara Pursuit was currently near the port of Chacabuco after authorities banned it from landing passengers there, on grounds that it was carrying suspected cases of the coronavirus.

And this year, as in 2016, African Americans <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/exit-polls-2020-south-carolina-primary/\">overwhelmingly</a> chose Sanders\u2019 opponent.

After being walloped in the south on Super Tuesday, Sanders\u2019 campaign <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gcY2Fhr5wo\">released</a> an ad that featured Obama praising the senator and saying emphatically \u201cFeel the Bern!\u201d But it did not yield the results he hoped.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental disconnect if folks still don\u2019t feel like he\u2019s the one who they can put their faith in after four years,\u201d said Cliff Albright, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter Fund.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f9f21efff9a3b7798ba8c263372716406ca3df77\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9f21efff9a3b7798ba8c263372716406ca3df77/0_165_4876_2927/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sanders visits custodian Davonta Bynes, from left, principal DaRhonda Evans-Stewart and social worker Kim Little outside a polling location in Detroit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sanders visits custodian Davonta Bynes, from left, principal DaRhonda Evans-Stewart and social worker Kim Little outside a polling location in Detroit.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Sancya/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Ahead of the Michigan primary, Sanders earned the endorsement of the Rev Jesse Jackson, in what those close to him said was a deeply meaningful moment. In 1988, Jackson became the first black presidential candidate to win millions of votes on a similar platform of universal healthcare, a federal jobs guarantee and taxing the rich. Sanders, then the mayor of Burlington, was one of the few white public officials to endorse him.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe ideas resonate with black folks,\u201d Albright said. \u201cMedicare for All, free college, debt forgiveness, criminal justice reform, on those issues black folks are far closer to Bernie than to Biden. So it\u2019s not the ideas. It\u2019s this issue of electability.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> \n<p><strong>Sanders now faces a legacy-defining decision: </strong>does he stay in a race that has become increasingly difficult for him to win or does he bow out now to begin the delicate process of unifying the party?</p> \n<p>Many supporters are not ready to see Sanders exit. Larry Cohen, a longtime Sanders confidant and chairman of his political non-profit, Our Revolution, acknowledged the senator faces long odds but urged him to keep competing. Every delegate Sanders accumulates in the primary, he argued, will be \u201ccritical to negotiations over the rules and party platform\u201d at the convention in Milwaukee this summer.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf he drops out now, those ideas are left with the delegates that he\u2019s won,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThey\u2019re the voice for these issues.\u201d</p> \n<p>Further complicating the course ahead is a new challenge: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/12/trump-coronavirus-election-impact-bernie-sanders-joe-biden\">running for president in midst of a global health emergency</a>. The coronavirus outbreak has forced Sanders to abandon the stadium-size rallies that are a feature of his campaign.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis coronavirus has obviously impacted our ability to communicate with people in the traditional way and that\u2019s hurting us,\u201d he told reporters during a brief press conference in Burlington, where he has spent his time since cancelling an election night rally in Cleveland last week amid concerns about the virus.</p> \n<p>Yet the senator has signaled in recent days that he is unlikely to battle Biden to the bitter end. But he also made clear that there are issues on which he still intends to confront his opponent \u2013 and on which has the leverage to do so.</p> \n<p>On Sunday Sanders will appear at the next presidential debate, a long-sought one-on-one with Biden. At a press conference, he previewed a litany of policy questions that he planned to press Biden on: \u201cJoe, what are you gonna do?\u201d he intends to ask on issues from income inequality to student loan debt.</p> \n<p><strong>When Sanders launched his campaign in February </strong><strong>2019,</strong> he was asked what would be different this time. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/19/bernie-sanders-announces-2020-run-presidency\">Sanders replied,</a> with the blunt assurance that thrills so many of his supporters.</p> \n<p>By his own admission, he is falling short of that goal. As Sanders fights for the future of his candidacy, there is also the sense that he has already accomplished more than he could have imagined in his nearly 50-year political career.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d907cf5a90875b1ff42418617685d6dbcb0c3696\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d907cf5a90875b1ff42418617685d6dbcb0c3696/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sanders speaks during a rally in St Louis, Missouri, last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sanders speaks during a rally in St Louis, Missouri, last week.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Michael Kazin, a historian and co-editor of Dissent magazine, said Sanders has already achieved what many nominees and presidents never do: he has fundamentally shifted the ideology of the Democratic party on everything from healthcare and climate change to raising the minimum wage and taxing the rich. Sanders, Kazin said, was likely the \u201cmost leftwing candidate\u201d to make it this far in American political history.</p> \n<p>That a 78-year-old democratic socialist has come within striking distance of the nomination is an \u201castounding success\u201d in its own right, marveled Bill Press, a progressive talkshow host who helped launch Sanders 2016 campaign from the living room of his Washington home.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn a very real sense,\u201d he said, \u201cBernie has already won the primary.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s this issue of electability.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 Sanders now faces a legacy-defining decision: does he stay in a race that has become increasingly difficult for him to win or does he bow out now to begin the delicate process of unifying the party? Many supporters are not ready to see Sanders exit. Larry Cohen, a longtime Sanders confidant and chairman of his political non-profit, Our Revolution, acknowledged the senator faces long odds but urged him to keep competing. Every delegate Sanders accumulates in the primary, he argued, will be \u201ccritical to negotiations over the rules and party platform\u201d at the convention in Milwaukee this summer. \u201cIf he drops out now, those ideas are left with the delegates that he\u2019s won,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThey\u2019re the voice for these issues.\u201d Further complicating the course ahead is a new challenge: running for president in midst of a global health emergency. The coronavirus outbreak has forced Sanders to abandon the stadium-size rallies that are a feature of his campaign. \u201cThis coronavirus has obviously impacted our ability to communicate with people in the traditional way and that\u2019s hurting us,\u201d he told reporters during a brief press conference in Burlington, where he has spent his time since cancelling an election night rally in Cleveland last week amid concerns about the virus. Yet the senator has signaled in recent days that he is unlikely to battle Biden to the bitter end. But he also made clear that there are issues on which he still intends to confront his opponent \u2013 and on which has the leverage to do so. On Sunday Sanders will appear at the next presidential debate, a long-sought one-on-one with Biden. At a press conference, he previewed a litany of policy questions that he planned to press Biden on: \u201cJoe, what are you gonna do?\u201d he intends to ask on issues from income inequality to student loan debt. When Sanders launched his campaign in February 2019, he was asked what would be different this time. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win,\u201d Sanders replied, with the blunt assurance that thrills so many of his supporters. By his own admission, he is falling short of that goal. As Sanders fights for the future of his candidacy, there is also the sense that he has already accomplished more than he could have imagined in his nearly 50-year political career. Michael Kazin, a historian and co-editor of Dissent magazine, said Sanders has already achieved what many nominees and presidents never do: he has fundamentally shifted the ideology of the Democratic party on everything from healthcare and climate change to raising the minimum wage and taxing the rich. Sanders, Kazin said, was likely the \u201cmost leftwing candidate\u201d to make it this far in American political history. That a 78-year-old democratic socialist has come within striking distance of the nomination is an \u201castounding success\u201d in its own right, marveled Bill Press, a progressive talkshow host who helped launch Sanders 2016 campaign from the living room of his Washington home. \u201cIn a very real sense,\u201d he said, \u201cBernie has already won the primary.\u201d",

Employers and companies have been told to talk to their staff as soon as possible and ensure that they have ways to work from home \u2013 via laptops and mobile phones. The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) said anyone who is worried about going into the office should have their concerns listened to by their boss \u2013 but employers are not obliged to allow for time off nor unpaid leave.

Workers \u2013 such as agency staff, those on zero-hour contracts and casuals \u2013 are also likely to be entitled to the \u00a394.25 weekly payment. Acas says many workplaces offer better terms than the statutory however. In his budget last week, chancellor Rishi Sunak said the four-day rule would be suspended and reduced to one day for anyone who has been advised to self-isolate. Anyone who is not entitled to sick pay has been advised to contact their local jobcentre to see if they are able to claim universal credit or other allowances. Only employees and workers are entitled to statutory sick pay, not the \u201cgenuinely\u201d self-employed said Acas.</p> <h2>What if people are told to self-isolate but are not sick?</h2> <p>Anyone who fears that they may have coronavirus has been told to contact the NHS 111 service. If the service advises someone to self-isolate, then they will be entitled to statutory sick pay. If employees are not sick but are not wanted in work, then they should be paid their usual salary. For workers however, who have fewer employment rights, there is typically no obligation for employers to pay them or for them to provide services.</p> <h2>Do people still get paid if a workplace is shut down?</h2> <p>Employees should get their normal pay unless contracts entitle the employer to lay them off, in which case they are entitled to five days\u2019 guaranteed pay. If the contract does not include this right and the workplace is shut for some time, then employers could require staff to take their annual leave while it is closed.</p> <h2>What about holidays?</h2> <p>Travel has been severely disrupted with limits to flights and cancelled holidays. If someone is intent on going away for a break however, their holidays may be cancelled but sufficient notice must be given. This will be the same amount of time as is being taken by the employee - so if they are going away for two weeks, they need two weeks\u2019 notice to cancel it. An explanation or justification does not have to be given by the employer.</p> <h2>What happens if schools shut?</h2> <p>Employees are entitled to one or two days off to arrange for emergencies and could use that to put in place alternative childcare arrangements. This may not be paid time off and can include dependants ranging from spouses, children, parents, people who rely on them for help or people who receive care. Should a child or dependant become unwell and need to self-isolate, then the parent may also need to do so.</p> <h2>Money worries</h2> <p>Under the government plans, it will now be easier for people to claim sick pay and get benefits. However, the level of benefits that are available will be far below what many people will need to cover their household costs. \u201cThe government is making changes so it\u2019s easier and quicker to claim sick pay and to get benefits. Those are welcome but statutory sick pay is only \u00a394 a week and the standard allowance in universal credit is just \u00a373 a week \u2013 that is less than a quarter of the average income.

The worst tactic, she said, is to try and borrow to get through any problems. As the crisis may last a number of weeks, people could see debts mount up and become unaffordable when things do return to normal.</p> <h2>Ask for help</h2> <p>Banks including Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds and TSB are to offer repayment holidays on mortgages and loans, as part of relief measures \u2013 part of an effort to stem a potential tide of defaults if customers become ill, have to self-isolate or lose pay from employers and clients as the virus continues to spread. In Italy, where the crisis is much more advanced, all mortgage repayments have been suspended. Williams says she hopes more lenders follow the lead set by the banks here not just in home loans but on credit cards and catalogue debt as well. If someone is experiencing difficulty with their repayments, they should talk to their creditors. \u201cIf your income has dropped because of coronavirus, whether you are ill, you have been told to self-isolate, you are caring for someone ill or children not at school, your hours have been cut or your self-employed income has dropped a lot, tell your creditors and ask for a payment break,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for your lender to make an announcement. The FCA\u2019s rules say that all lenders should treat customers who can\u2019t make payments \u2018with forbearance and due consideration\u2019.

We need to free up doctors and NHS staff to prepare for what\u2019s coming. We should be cancelling outpatient clinics, suspending waiting-time targets, like the four-hour A&amp;E wait and the 18-week target for outpatient treatment, until this is all over - and be open with the public about why this is happening. Soon the NHS is going to be faced with a huge amount people with Covid-19. So we need to urgently ensure <em>all</em> doctors, not just A&amp;E, intensive care and respiratory doctors, are trained to at least perform the initial assessment and treatment of someone suspected to have the virus. Otherwise we will burn out from overwork and stress; specialists can\u2019t do it all ourselves. Not to mention that many of us will get the infection ourselves and fall ill or even die, further depleting the workforce.</p> <p>We need doctors and managers to go to hospitals and identify where extra ICU beds can be created. Which operating theatres, anaesthetic rooms and resus areas can be used? And what does doing that mean for patients who come in with cancer, serious injuries or heart disease? What about them? The NHS also needs to get people out of hospital who don\u2019t need to be there and buy find lots of extra ventilators, though Italy and other countries want them too.</p> <p>We may be lucky. But I fear and expect that we are going to end up in the same situation as Iran and Italy, where health services have struggled to cope. Hospitals have been overwhelmed, unmanageable and unsafe. If that does happen here, doctors will have to decide who is worth saving: an 80-year-old or someone in their 30s or 40s? Those will be impossible decisions. The NHS will have to ration healthcare that could mean the difference between life and death.</p> <p>The virus has wreaked havoc in the north of Italy, the richest part of the country. The health service there \u2013 one of the best in the world \u2013 hasn\u2019t been able to treat everyone who needs care. Some, particularly the elderly, have been left to die. Doctors and nurses have ended up in tears because they can\u2019t do the job they were trained to do, because of the sheer scale of the crisis. They feel helpless.</p> <p>I\u2019m worried about a lot of things, especially our ability to care for all the people with severe infections who will need treatment; not just by saving their lives but by ensuring dignity and comfort for people who are dying. I worry that staff will be working flat out, with too few resources, and end up fatigued, sick and broken. And I\u2019m worried that many people are going to die \u2013 many avoidably. I\u2019m appalled and frightened that this might be coming our way. It\u2019s a catastrophic situation in Italy and Iran.

      "bodyText": "Schools will remain open nationally despite escalating government restrictions on other aspects of life such as travel due to the spread of the coronavirus, but new social distancing measures have been announced for schools in New South Wales. The secretary of the NSW department of education, Mark Scott, said excursions, assemblies, travel, concerts and other events would be cancelled to limit exposure. \u201cSchools have been a focus of the community and the government as the impacts of the coronavirus have developed globally,\u201d Scott said. \u201cFrom Monday onwards I expect assemblies and substantial gatherings to be cancelled, along with all excursions.\u201d All interschool arts and sports events have also been cancelled. But the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said widespread school closures would not take place, despite a raft of other new measures to contain the spread of the virus. Morrison said the first meeting of the national cabinet on Sunday heard that taking children out of school and putting them into the community may actually hasten the spread of the disease and the disruption to critical workforce like nurses and doctors is too great. \u201cPeople are naturally anxious about the issue of schools,\u201d Morrison told reporters in Sydney. \u201cAs the British chief medical officer observed over the last couple of days, the issue of widescale closure of schools, it may be anti-intuitive, but the advice is this could be a very negative thing in terms of impacting on how these [disease] curves operate. \u201cWhen you take children out of school and put them back in the broader community, the ability for them to potentially engage with others increases that risk.\u201d The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has said school closures are inevitable and state and territory departments are preparing for closure by encouraging schools to prepare online learning resources. Three schools in Victoria and four in NSW have already closed temporarily but these are referred to as spot closures rather than a widespread shutdown. Another reason for the delay is that closing schools would mean many healthcare and other essential workers would have to stay home to care for young children, further disrupting the healthcare system. The future of the schools will be discussed again on Tuesday and Friday, Morrison said. Senior education sources said there was a split over what was the \u201copportune public health decision\u201d with tension between health experts over closing schools now or later. \u201cGiven that schools may be closed for months is it too early to close them now when there is only a handful of cases of potential infection,\u201d one source said. Schools are expected to introduce new social distancing measures this week, including scrapping school assemblies, school plays and concerts and reducing interschool activities. The senior vice-president of the NSW Teachers\u2019 Federation, Amber Flohm, said teachers had the technology available to deliver online learning but many children could be disadvantaged if they didn\u2019t have access to computers and the internet. \u201cWe are not doctors, we\u2019re teachers, and so the decision will be for them and the department of education will respond accordingly,\u201d Flohm said. \u201cThere will be an equity issue. I would argue a lot of kids don\u2019t have laptops. Children might have mobile phones but if we\u2019re talking about delivering the curriculum, significant resources would need to be provided for teachers and students.\u201d Flohm dismissed a claim by the Greens MP David Shoebridge that not all schools provided soap for children to wash their hands. \u201cIt is my understanding that all public schools have soap and access to water in their bathrooms \u2026 that\u2019s not what we have heard from teachers.\u201d The former Australian Medical Association president Kerryn Phelps called for schools to be immediately shut down despite the disruption to medical personnel who would have to care for children. Phelps, a Sydney GP, also said all children should be tested for a fever when arriving at school if schools are kept open. \u201cIt\u2019s inevitable in the middle of an uncontrolled epidemic that the schools will be closed,\u201d Phelps said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of when. \u201cUnless the government has convincing evidence that the schools can safely be kept open, that should be now.\u201d",

Those of us with online delivery and click-and-collect services are running them at full capacity.</p> \n<p>\u201cBut we need your help too. We would ask everyone to be considerate in the way they shop. We understand your concerns but buying more than is needed can sometimes mean that others will be left without. There is enough for everyone if we all work together.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9c6fbe5f-f221-45b2-878e-a5ed03f3a506\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/toUTQJwCfls?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Retailers and online sellers have faced huge demand, with pictures emerging of empty shelves in some stores, with hand sanitiser, pasta and toilet paper selling out. Paper towels, thermometers and paracetamol also appeared to be in low supply among some online retailers. Stores are attempting to increase supplies in an attempt to keep up.</p> \n<p>Their joint plea comes after a series of meetings with the government last week. Delivery hours to supermarkets are being extended to ensure shelves can be replenished more quickly, while ministers are prepared to implement existing rules that allow for an extensions on delivery drivers\u2019 hours. A further emergency meeting is planned for tomorrow between George Eustice, the environment secretary, and the supermarket chief executives.</p> \n<p>All kinds of businesses are changing their behaviour to deal with the outbreak. Online supermarket Ocado has said it is prioritising existing customers and not accepting the return of old shopping bags, as it usually does. Meanwhile, takeaway delivery companies Just Eat and Deliveroo have both said they will provide deliveries without physical contact. Tech giant Apple has closed its stores temporarily, while the Body Shop cosmetics company has stopped makeup demonstrations and tester pots.</p> \n<p>Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: \u201cRetailers are working incredibly hard to keep shops well stocked and deliveries running as smoothly as possible. In the face of unprecedented demand as a result of coronavirus, food retailers have come together to ask their customers to support each other to make sure everyone can get access to the products they need.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/14/online-grocery-shopping-coronavirus\">Online grocery shopping hasn\u2019t taken off.

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s leading supermarkets are pleading with customers to refrain from panic buying during the coronavirus crisis, with some already rationing items and turning new customers away to cope with demand. In a highly unusual move, all the major operators including Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Asda and Ocado signed up to a letter urging customers to shop responsibly and ensure supplies are shared out fairly. \u201cWe know that many of you are worried about the spread of coronavirus (Covid-19),\u201d they say in the letter, which runs in a number of national newspapers today and tomorrow. \u201cWe want to let you know that we are doing everything we can so that you and your families have the food and essentials you need. \u201cWe are working closely with government and our suppliers to keep food moving quickly through the system and making more deliveries to our stores to ensure our shelves are stocked. Those of us with online delivery and click-and-collect services are running them at full capacity. \u201cBut we need your help too. We would ask everyone to be considerate in the way they shop. We understand your concerns but buying more than is needed can sometimes mean that others will be left without. There is enough for everyone if we all work together.\u201d Retailers and online sellers have faced huge demand, with pictures emerging of empty shelves in some stores, with hand sanitiser, pasta and toilet paper selling out. Paper towels, thermometers and paracetamol also appeared to be in low supply among some online retailers. Stores are attempting to increase supplies in an attempt to keep up. Their joint plea comes after a series of meetings with the government last week. Delivery hours to supermarkets are being extended to ensure shelves can be replenished more quickly, while ministers are prepared to implement existing rules that allow for an extensions on delivery drivers\u2019 hours. A further emergency meeting is planned for tomorrow between George Eustice, the environment secretary, and the supermarket chief executives. All kinds of businesses are changing their behaviour to deal with the outbreak. Online supermarket Ocado has said it is prioritising existing customers and not accepting the return of old shopping bags, as it usually does. Meanwhile, takeaway delivery companies Just Eat and Deliveroo have both said they will provide deliveries without physical contact. Tech giant Apple has closed its stores temporarily, while the Body Shop cosmetics company has stopped makeup demonstrations and tester pots. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: \u201cRetailers are working incredibly hard to keep shops well stocked and deliveries running as smoothly as possible. In the face of unprecedented demand as a result of coronavirus, food retailers have come together to ask their customers to support each other to make sure everyone can get access to the products they need.\u201d Around the country, there were mounting attempts to ensure the housebound were receiving help. In Porthcawl, former Labour MP Madeleine Moon is mobilising a team of volunteers in her former south Wales constituency to drop off essentials and offer emotional support over the phone to people in isolation, relieving some of the pressure on local GPs and the NHS. \u201cThere is a growing sense of panic,\u201d Moon said. \u201cFor the older demographic, certainly there is a feeling that nobody is worrying about them \u2013 that they can be discarded. We are not going to let that happen in this small town.\u201d In Shropshire, a medical centre has organised volunteers to collect groceries for its most vulnerable patients during the outbreak, which could last months. In Cornwall a charity has recruited 50 people to assist those without family or friends to turn to for help. Local support groups are also being set up across the UK on Facebook and other social media.",

This is now being sorted out\u2009\u2026ish. The Ministry of Housing has just committed to reforms where all homes built under the permitted development scheme are required to meet standards for natural light. However, nothing was said about the size of homes, while certain pledges \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/12/property-owners-right-build-upwards-without-planning-permission\" title=\"\">such as extending existing buildings upwards by two storeys</a> \u2013 suggest that hitting Tory targets takes priority.

Add to this the general state of the UK\u2019s rented sector (escalating rents, unacceptable conditions, unscrupulous landlords, insufficient housing benefit), and it is clear that the concept of \u201cbattery tenants\u201d is uncomfortably close to the truth.</p> <h2>Will Cornwall prove the Moby Dick of Greggs\u2019 ambitions?<br></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"382514d4a2569eed1c7600aae13cd6e043e5e3ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/382514d4a2569eed1c7600aae13cd6e043e5e3ef/0_135_900_540/500.jpg\" alt=\"A Cornish pasty made in Cornwall.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Cornish pasty made in Cornwall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ID8035355</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Your attention please: Greggs is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/13/greggs-cornish-resurrection-sparks-consternation-from-locals\" title=\"\">trying to return</a> to Cornwall, mere months after its sole, short-lived branch was axed in a move dubbed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/shortcuts/2020/jan/15/give-us-real-pasties-why-greggs-is-leaving-cornwall\" title=\"\">\u201cGreggxit\u201d</a>.

Moreover, there were no minimum space standards for conversions, and some plans were for homes that were about the size of a London taxi. How could anyone be expected to live humanely in such conditions? This is now being sorted out\u2009\u2026ish. The Ministry of Housing has just committed to reforms where all homes built under the permitted development scheme are required to meet standards for natural light. However, nothing was said about the size of homes, while certain pledges \u2013 such as extending existing buildings upwards by two storeys \u2013 suggest that hitting Tory targets takes priority. (They promised 300,000 new homes a year, and, last year, produced only 240,000.) That this is being partially and inadequately addressed now doesn\u2019t justify the past seven years of what appears to be wholesale under-regulated cowboy building. Add to this the general state of the UK\u2019s rented sector (escalating rents, unacceptable conditions, unscrupulous landlords, insufficient housing benefit), and it is clear that the concept of \u201cbattery tenants\u201d is uncomfortably close to the truth. Will Cornwall prove the Moby Dick of Greggs\u2019 ambitions? Your attention please: Greggs is trying to return to Cornwall, mere months after its sole, short-lived branch was axed in a move dubbed \u201cGreggxit\u201d. Greggs intends to open a branch at another site (yet to be determined), and Cornish people are furious, saying they have enough baked goods of their own. This is clearly the main issue facing Britain right now \u2013 can Greggs finally win over the home of the pasty? But why is this so important to Greggs? The high street chain has enjoyed an astonishing run of late \u2013 the vegan sausage roll, the fake steak-bake, giving Stormzy his VIP card \u2013 so can\u2019t they let it go about Cornwall? Apparently not. The psychology is fascinating, and making me strangely hungry. Maybe there\u2019s a secret Greggs war-room, with flashing red dots signifying branches all over Britain and just one empty, Greggs-free space (Cornwall)? In the corner, perhaps, a Greggs boss who\u2019s gone full-Citizen Kane, obsessively muttering \u201chungry surfers\u201d under his breath. Or is this about the challenge \u2013 has Cornwall become the whale that couldn\u2019t be caught, the mountain that couldn\u2019t be climbed, the vegan steak-bake that couldn\u2019t be sold \u2013 that which must be conquered at all costs? Whatever\u2019s going on, I fear I can\u2019t do it justice. Where\u2019s Hemingway when you need him? \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist",

Only people who usually live with you should be in the home. Do not see visitors.\u201d</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;\u201cAsk others who are not in isolation to get food and necessities for you. If you must leave home, such as to seek medical care, wear a surgical mask. If you don\u2019t have a mask, take care to not cough or sneeze on others.\u201d</p>\n    <p>&nbsp;\u201cIf you live in a private house, it is safe for you to go into your garden or courtyard. If you live in an apartment or are staying in a hotel, it is also safe for you to go into the garden but you should wear a surgical mask to minimise risk to others and move quickly through any common areas.\u201d</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What if I feel sick?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The health department recommends monitoring yourself for symptoms including \u201cfever, cough or shortness of breath.

The strict measures came as two more deaths in Australia from coronavirus were confirmed on Sunday evening. A 77-year-old woman from Queensland died in New South Wales on Friday shortly after arriving in Sydney by plane, NSW Health said, while a 90-year old woman \u2013 a resident of Dorothy Henderson Lodge \u2013 died on Saturday. NSW recorded 22 new cases of Covid-19, taking the total number of cases in the state to 134 and Victoria recorded eight new cases taking its total to 57. Queensland had its highest increase in a 24-hour period with 15 new cases, bringing the total number for the state to 61. Morrison told reporters in Sydney that the first meeting of the national cabinet on Sunday had agreed to legislate offences for people who breach the self-isolation rule and escalated advice to others to undertake social distancing, including refusing handshakes and keeping a distance of 1.5 metres away from people. State and territory leaders say there are already existing laws through which they will enforce the new rules but they were also assessing on Sunday whether any changes would need to be made.

The advice has been upgraded to a ban although Morrison reiterated on Sunday that this would not trigger \u201cwidescale\u201d closure of schools, shops, airports and workplaces. \u201cWe will impose a universal compulsory self-isolation requirement on all international arrivals to Australia effective from midnight tonight,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cAll people coming to Australia will be required, will be required, I stress, to self-isolate for 14 days. \u201cFurther, the Australian government will ban cruise ships from foreign ports from arriving at Australian ports after an initial 30 days and that will go forward on a rolling basis.\u201d Morrison said that \u2013 until now \u2013 self-isolation had been a \u201cvoluntary arrangement\u201d with \u201cno potential sanction against a person for not following that requirement\u201d. \u201cThat will change,\u201d he said, although penalties would be \u201ca matter for the states and territories\u201d. \u201cIf your mate has been to Bali and they come back and they turn up at work and they are sitting next to you, they will be committing an offence.\u201d The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said on Sunday afternoon that the state\u2019s Public Health Act had provisions that would enable the government to enforce the self-isolation requirements. But she said the health minister, Brad Hazzard, was examining the legislation in case any changes needed to be made. Berejiklian said there had already been one case before Sunday\u2019s announcement in which someone had not self-isolated and police had become involved. But she said it would be difficult to monitor \u201cevery situation\u201d and the government would be relying on \u201cpublic goodwill\u201d to ensure the rules were followed and the government would \u201cprefer people help us by putting themselves in self-isolation\u201d. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a workplace and you know someone is coming to work who has recently been overseas, let us know,\u201d Berejiklian said. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said public health laws passed in February would be used to enforce the self-isolation rules and people caught not complying could be fined $13,000. \u201cTo date, everyone has done the right thing, we thank them for that,\u201d she said. The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, said there would be penalties, included \u201csevere fines\u201d, for people who breached the self-isolation rules. By contrast, Morrison played down the prospect of enforcement of social distancing. \u201cThe states and territories \u2026 are not going to create event police or social distancing police or things of that nature.\u201d Morrison said the government\u2019s national information campaign \u201cis running and it will be available to all Australians\u201d but claimed that social distancing was \u201cpretty straightforward\u201d. He explained maintaining a distance of 1.5 metres would mean \u201censuring that you refrain from that sort of physical contact, whether it might be a handshake or something a bit more intimate, unless they\u2019re close family and friends\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s all commonsense.\u201d For the first time, Morrison presented various scenarios for the speed of the spread of the coronavirus, using them as encouragement to slow the spread to help free up hospital beds for those who need them. \u201cIf we continue to manage this but on how the virus impact on Australia, we will be able to ensure that we can continue to provide the services and support, particularly to the most vulnerable Australians most at risk from the coronavirus,\u201d he said. Morrison foreshadowed that there \u201cwill be further intrusions, further restrictions on people\u2019s movement and their behaviour\u201d in future in response to changes in medical advice. The first of these will be new protocols for visiting aged care facilities, he said, with further work to be done to protect remote communities in South Australia, Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has warned that school closures are regarded as inevitable, prompting many schools and universities to prepare for shutdowns. But Morrison said there were \u201cvery good reasons\u201d against moving to \u201cbroadscale closures of schools\u201d at this point. Although it may seem counterintuitive, schools should stay open at this time because taking children out may expose others to risk and would \u201cput at great risk the availability of critical workers such as nurses, doctors and others who are essential in the community\u201d, he said. \u201cThe states and territories are not moving in that direction.\u201d The issue will be revisited at meetings of the national cabinet on Tuesday and Friday, although individual schools in Victoria and NSW have been allowed to close \u201cbased on the cases presented there in the circumstances that exist in those communities\u201d, he said. Earlier on Sunday Murphy and the health minister, Greg Hunt, confirmed that as advice changes, measures might escalate to include general lockdowns. \u201cIt \u2013 it is potential that could be the case,\u201d Murphy told ABC\u2019s Insiders. \u201cBut that may be focal. One of the things we know about outbreaks of infections is that they can affect one part of a country, not another.\u201d Asked if Sydney could be locked down and not the rest of the country, Murphy continued: \u201cPotentially you could. The Koreans did that for two provinces, very successfully locked them down. Everything is up for consideration.\u201d Labor has criticised the government for the slow pace of rolling out a national information campaign, and on Sunday the shadow infrastructure minister, Catherine King, called for further support for the aviation sector, which missed out on funding in the $1bn regional and community fund. \u201cWhile these measures are necessary for public health, the federal government must urgently address the significant consequences for our aviation sector,\u201d she said. \u201cWith conditions changing rapidly and no end in sight, the federal government must urgently provide all necessary support to ensure Australia has a vibrant aviation sector once the coronavirus outbreak has passed.\u201d",

Those with persistent coughs or fevers should, from that point on, stay at home for seven days. The elderly would soon be told not to venture out, and families soon be quarantined if one member had a cough.</p> \n<p>But if the message was clear, it is not obvious that it was shared and agreed by others. When asked whether mass gatherings should be outlawed, the two experts were adamant that this was not necessary, in the short term at least. Banning large crowds would not have a \u201cbig effect\u201d on slowing transmission of Covid-19, said Vallance. Indeed, people were more likely to spread the virus watching football in a pub than at an open-air match, however big the crowd.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3589c53962af85c985e4f0be7f18dd678599758a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3589c53962af85c985e4f0be7f18dd678599758a/624_301_2642_1585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rory Stewart.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rory Stewart.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Chown/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But within a few hours, these calm assurances began to look shaky. The Premier League, Football League and Scottish Football Association announced they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/13/premier-league-and-football-league-suspended-until-4-april-coronavirus\" title=\"\">suspending all their seasons </a>until early April. The Wales v Scotland Six Nations Rugby match was also delayed. The government had little option but to follow, and Whitehall sources began briefing that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/uk-to-ban-mass-gatherings-in-coronavirus-u-turn\" title=\"\">mass gatherings would, after all, be banned from next week</a>.</p> \n<p>This change of heart was also spurred by some robust interventions from a number of politicians and commentators. Former Tory minister Rory Stewart, who is now hoping to become mayor of London, called for schools to be closed. \u201cEvidence from other pandemics is that closing schools and large gatherings earlier rather than later stops the peaks of this kind of disease,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of the <em>Lancet</em>, said the government was \u201cplaying roulette with the public\u201d, while Jeremy Hunt, a former health secretary, said the decision to hold off cancelling large gatherings was \u201csurprising and concerning\u201d.</p> \n<p>Look at Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, said the critics. There, Chinese authorities blocked all outdoor activities and halted the escalation, they argued. And, as the week wore on, and the number of deaths and sufferers across the world grew, more and more senior figures slowly began to question a British approach to coronavirus that began to look out of kilter with the responses of other countries including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore.</p> \n<p>These criticisms were not just confined to politicians. \u201cSocial distancing has worked in China, Singapore and other countries,\u201d said Alan McNally, professor of microbial evolutionary genomics at Birmingham University. \u201cThere needs to be a combination of social distancing and extensive testing, followed by the quarantining of infected individuals to contain the epidemic \u2013 and that quarantine should not be at home, where we will see large levels of familial transmission, but in dedicated quarantine facilities.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Significant disruptions need high population compliance.

They continue to dismiss the idea that Britain should proceed immediately with major shutdowns, maintaining support for carefully controlled interventions. However, in doing so, they expose an alarming schism in the nation\u2019s attitudes to Covid-19 and the attempts to control it.</p> \n<p>A clear warning is provided by global health expert Dr Michael Head, of Southampton University. \u201cThe UK population have significant control over their daily life,\u201d he said yesterday. \u201cYou choose when to pop out for a pint of milk or go to a concert. Significant disruptions greatly reduce that control and thus need high population compliance. You won\u2019t get that over a long period of time.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople already can\u2019t be trusted to buy toilet roll properly, so how about long-term compliance when significant levels of freedom are removed and there\u2019s a need to stay indoors for long periods of time? The evidence, as we have it right now, suggests it will decline.\u201d</p> \n<p>This point was echoed by Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say, \u2018Let\u2019s just do what Wuhan did\u2019, but the actions there have involved a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/post-apocalyptic-how-coronavirus-has-altered-day-to-day-life-wuhan-north-england\" title=\"\">change to daily life that </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/post-apocalyptic-how-coronavirus-has-altered-day-to-day-life-wuhan-north-england\" title=\"\">has been unimaginable</a> in scale and impact.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f8a1c3f06ee0a2eeac04746876c57507c48b18a8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8a1c3f06ee0a2eeac04746876c57507c48b18a8/51_129_3712_2228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Ashworth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jonathan Ashworth.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Harvey/Rex</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Measures there included a lockdown on nearly 60 million people in Hubei and strict quarantine and travel restrictions for hundreds of millions of people \u2013 both citizens and foreigners. \u201cChina cannot sustain them indefinitely,\u201d added Kucharski.</p> \n<p>In addition, the vast majority of the population in Wuhan is likely to remain susceptible to Covid-19, he added. \u201cAs soon as control measures are lifted, there is the risk of new introduced cases and another outbreak. In addition, countries such as Hong Kong and Singapore, which for so long have managed to contain Covid-19, now seem to be seeing a rise in transmissions, as infections continue to be introduced.\u201d</p> \n<p>Professor Mark Woolhouse of Edinburgh University agreed. \u201cIt is now very difficult for those countries that have gone into total lockdown to know under what circumstances they can come out of it. And, to the best of my knowledge, none of those countries has a clear plan \u2013 an exit strategy \u2013 through which they can relax their measures.\u201d</p> \n<p>Woolhouse added that the World Health Organization \u2013 which has been pushing for strict lockdown measures across the globe \u2013 had provided no advice on how these measures could be ended. The lesson for the UK is clear, say experts.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, pressure is building on the government to act more forcefully. Yesterday, Labour\u2019s health spokesman, Jonathan Ashworth, told the <em>Observer</em> that public confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the crisis was fragile and questions were increasingly being posed about key aspects of its strategy.</p> \n<p>\u201cDelaying the spread of this virus has to be a priority so as not to overwhelm our already overstretched NHS. But people are increasingly questioning if the UK is following international best practice. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/archive-2-zip/giv-39025RScOtAt04QY/\" data-alt=\".\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/03/archive-2-zip/giv-39025RScOtAt04QY/\">.</a> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWhy are we no longer testing those with symptoms who are advised to stay at home, when the World Health Organization recommends continued testing, for example? The government must move into an \u2018explain\u2019 phase and publish its modelling, so it can be robustly peer-reviewed.

      "bodyText": "Last Thursday evening, Boris Johnson appeared at a press conference in No 10 flanked by England\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, and the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. Johnson looked uncharacteristically grave while the two experts stood expressionless, a choreography that was intended to project a sense of calm, reassuring authority during a national crisis. \u201cI must level with the British public,\u201d the Prime Minister said. \u201cMany more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.\u201d While he recognised that the spread of coronavirus now amounted to the \u201cworst public health crisis for a generation\u201d, Johnson wanted the UK to know the nation\u2019s best experts \u2013 and its politicians \u2013 were in control of the situation. \u201cWe have a clear plan,\u201d he said. Those with persistent coughs or fevers should, from that point on, stay at home for seven days. The elderly would soon be told not to venture out, and families soon be quarantined if one member had a cough. But if the message was clear, it is not obvious that it was shared and agreed by others. When asked whether mass gatherings should be outlawed, the two experts were adamant that this was not necessary, in the short term at least. Banning large crowds would not have a \u201cbig effect\u201d on slowing transmission of Covid-19, said Vallance. Indeed, people were more likely to spread the virus watching football in a pub than at an open-air match, however big the crowd. But within a few hours, these calm assurances began to look shaky. The Premier League, Football League and Scottish Football Association announced they were suspending all their seasons until early April. The Wales v Scotland Six Nations Rugby match was also delayed. The government had little option but to follow, and Whitehall sources began briefing that mass gatherings would, after all, be banned from next week. This change of heart was also spurred by some robust interventions from a number of politicians and commentators. Former Tory minister Rory Stewart, who is now hoping to become mayor of London, called for schools to be closed. \u201cEvidence from other pandemics is that closing schools and large gatherings earlier rather than later stops the peaks of this kind of disease,\u201d he said. Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of the Lancet, said the government was \u201cplaying roulette with the public\u201d, while Jeremy Hunt, a former health secretary, said the decision to hold off cancelling large gatherings was \u201csurprising and concerning\u201d. Look at Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, said the critics. There, Chinese authorities blocked all outdoor activities and halted the escalation, they argued. And, as the week wore on, and the number of deaths and sufferers across the world grew, more and more senior figures slowly began to question a British approach to coronavirus that began to look out of kilter with the responses of other countries including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. These criticisms were not just confined to politicians. \u201cSocial distancing has worked in China, Singapore and other countries,\u201d said Alan McNally, professor of microbial evolutionary genomics at Birmingham University. \u201cThere needs to be a combination of social distancing and extensive testing, followed by the quarantining of infected individuals to contain the epidemic \u2013 and that quarantine should not be at home, where we will see large levels of familial transmission, but in dedicated quarantine facilities.\u201d Johnson has enjoyed public support for his handling of the crisis so far \u2013 as our opinion poll shows today, but now appears to be less confident in his strategy. Many experts fear that this poses a serious danger to the UK. They continue to dismiss the idea that Britain should proceed immediately with major shutdowns, maintaining support for carefully controlled interventions. However, in doing so, they expose an alarming schism in the nation\u2019s attitudes to Covid-19 and the attempts to control it. A clear warning is provided by global health expert Dr Michael Head, of Southampton University. \u201cThe UK population have significant control over their daily life,\u201d he said yesterday. \u201cYou choose when to pop out for a pint of milk or go to a concert. Significant disruptions greatly reduce that control and thus need high population compliance. You won\u2019t get that over a long period of time. \u201cPeople already can\u2019t be trusted to buy toilet roll properly, so how about long-term compliance when significant levels of freedom are removed and there\u2019s a need to stay indoors for long periods of time? The evidence, as we have it right now, suggests it will decline.\u201d This point was echoed by Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say, \u2018Let\u2019s just do what Wuhan did\u2019, but the actions there have involved a change to daily life that has been unimaginable in scale and impact.\u201d Measures there included a lockdown on nearly 60 million people in Hubei and strict quarantine and travel restrictions for hundreds of millions of people \u2013 both citizens and foreigners. \u201cChina cannot sustain them indefinitely,\u201d added Kucharski. In addition, the vast majority of the population in Wuhan is likely to remain susceptible to Covid-19, he added. \u201cAs soon as control measures are lifted, there is the risk of new introduced cases and another outbreak. In addition, countries such as Hong Kong and Singapore, which for so long have managed to contain Covid-19, now seem to be seeing a rise in transmissions, as infections continue to be introduced.\u201d Professor Mark Woolhouse of Edinburgh University agreed. \u201cIt is now very difficult for those countries that have gone into total lockdown to know under what circumstances they can come out of it. And, to the best of my knowledge, none of those countries has a clear plan \u2013 an exit strategy \u2013 through which they can relax their measures.\u201d Woolhouse added that the World Health Organization \u2013 which has been pushing for strict lockdown measures across the globe \u2013 had provided no advice on how these measures could be ended. The lesson for the UK is clear, say experts. Nevertheless, pressure is building on the government to act more forcefully. Yesterday, Labour\u2019s health spokesman, Jonathan Ashworth, told the Observer that public confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the crisis was fragile and questions were increasingly being posed about key aspects of its strategy. \u201cDelaying the spread of this virus has to be a priority so as not to overwhelm our already overstretched NHS. But people are increasingly questioning if the UK is following international best practice. \u201cWhy are we no longer testing those with symptoms who are advised to stay at home, when the World Health Organization recommends continued testing, for example? The government must move into an \u2018explain\u2019 phase and publish its modelling, so it can be robustly peer-reviewed. We need total clarity to maintain public confidence.\u201d In general, Johnson has steered clear of politicising the coronavirus scandal, although the tension between playing politics and managing a national emergency was evident in last week\u2019s budget. For the first 10 to 15 minutes, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, struck a sombre note as he announced that every financial resource possible would be directed to minimise the coronavirus crisis. After that, however, Sunak turned the event into a pantomime of crowd-pleasing gestures for Tory MPs, which robbed it of the seriousness it merited.

Among those states are Oregon, Ohio and New York, where the UFC was scheduled to hold events over the next few weeks. The organization has since <a href=\"https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2020/3/12/21177822/ufc-coronavirus-response-london-card-not-cancelled-las-vegas-apex-mma-news\">announced</a> that those shows (28 March in Columbus and 11 April in Portland) have been moved to the UFC\u2019s Apex facility in Las Vegas, a state-of-the-art arena space that sits adjacent to the UFC\u2019s headquarters, and will go ahead without fans.</p> <p>The UFC also revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/14/ufc-fight-night-brasilia-coronavirus\">Saturday\u2019s show in Brasilia</a>, where Charles Oliveira submitted Kevin Lee by guillotine choke in the main event, would be limited to staff and personnel after the city\u2019s governor declared a ban on large gatherings.

The infection spreads via respiratory droplets from airways like coughing or sneezing, while the onset of symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath and headache is between two and 14 days. However, given that the incubation period ranges from one to 14 days (averaging five to six days), it is possible for asymptomatic individuals to spread the virus, which makes it highly contagious and difficult to control.</p> <p>As of Saturday, there were more than 150,000 confirmed cases resulting in about 5,800 deaths.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c6140f45877b55953ff37e5a1599b5a2a13f820\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c6140f45877b55953ff37e5a1599b5a2a13f820/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"UFC\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The UFC staged a full card on Saturday at the Nilson Nelson Gymnasium in Brazil\u2019s capital city.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Buda Mendes/Zuffa LLC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Due to the infectious nature of the virus, global health organizations including the WHO have published preventative measures to reduce the chance of spreading the infection in locations with outbreaks.

However, this policy is remarkably shortsighted given that Covid-19 can be spread by asymptomatic individuals, which means that those infected do not even have to show symptoms or feel unwell to be contagious to those around them. The UFC president also cited Trump\u2019s response to the pandemic, which has been <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/us-politics/article-president-trump-criticized-over-incompetent-response-to-coronavirus/\">heavily criticized</a> for the lack of available testing compared to other industrialized countries around the world. Given the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/aug/16/ufc-dana-white-donald-trump-relationship\">longstanding friendship between Trump and White</a>, it comes as little surprise that the UFC brass is basing its reaction entirely on the president\u2019s blundered response to the outbreak.</p> <p>It should be noted that several other MMA promotions have already taken steps to cancel upcoming shows.

      "bodyText": "In the wake of the World Health Organization declaring the novel coronavirus 2019 a pandemic on Wednesday, major sports leagues in the United States and across the globe have reacted by canceling or postponing events. The NCAA canceled March Madness. MLB called off spring training and delayed the season, the PGA Tour canceled events, while the MLS, NHL and NBA have suspended their seasons until further notice. Yet despite the slew of professional organizations taking action to protect public health and safety, the Ultimate Fighting Championship, the leading promotion in mixed martial arts, has no intention of deviating from its upcoming schedule and has instead decided to move some of its shows to Las Vegas. As the coronavirus \u2013 officially known as Covid-19 \u2013 spreads across the United States, a growing number of states have declared a state of emergency due to the outbreak, which allows states the authority to establish curfews, shut down public spaces, and a host of other restrictions. Among those states are Oregon, Ohio and New York, where the UFC was scheduled to hold events over the next few weeks. The organization has since announced that those shows (28 March in Columbus and 11 April in Portland) have been moved to the UFC\u2019s Apex facility in Las Vegas, a state-of-the-art arena space that sits adjacent to the UFC\u2019s headquarters, and will go ahead without fans. The UFC also revealed that Saturday\u2019s show in Brasilia, where Charles Oliveira submitted Kevin Lee by guillotine choke in the main event, would be limited to staff and personnel after the city\u2019s governor declared a ban on large gatherings. However, it appears that the Brazilian MMA Athletic Commission \u2013 the regulatory body responsible for fighter safety \u2013 was not intending on testing fighters for COVID-19, a troubling development given the contagious and unpredictable nature of the virus. Covid-19 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-CoV-2), which is a virus related to Sars. The infection spreads via respiratory droplets from airways like coughing or sneezing, while the onset of symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath and headache is between two and 14 days. However, given that the incubation period ranges from one to 14 days (averaging five to six days), it is possible for asymptomatic individuals to spread the virus, which makes it highly contagious and difficult to control. As of Saturday, there were more than 150,000 confirmed cases resulting in about 5,800 deaths. Due to the infectious nature of the virus, global health organizations including the WHO have published preventative measures to reduce the chance of spreading the infection in locations with outbreaks. These include practicing respiratory hygiene, social distancing and staying away from large-scale public gatherings. While sports organizations have interpreted this as an ethical obligation to suspend their seasons and cancel events, the UFC has no intention of canceling any upcoming shows. \u201cI talked to the president and the vice president about this, and they\u2019re taking this very serious,\u201d UFC president Dana White said during an appearance on ESPN\u2019s SportsCenter on Thursday. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018Be cautious, be careful, but live your life and stop panicking.\u2019 Everybody is panicking, and instead of panicking, we\u2019re actually getting out there and working with doctors and health officials and the government to figure out how to keep the sport safe and continue to put on events.\u201d White added that the UFC plans to screen incoming fans with \u201cinfrared technology\u201d that would detect spikes in body temperatures such as those caused by fever. However, this policy is remarkably shortsighted given that Covid-19 can be spread by asymptomatic individuals, which means that those infected do not even have to show symptoms or feel unwell to be contagious to those around them. The UFC president also cited Trump\u2019s response to the pandemic, which has been heavily criticized for the lack of available testing compared to other industrialized countries around the world. Given the longstanding friendship between Trump and White, it comes as little surprise that the UFC brass is basing its reaction entirely on the president\u2019s blundered response to the outbreak. It should be noted that several other MMA promotions have already taken steps to cancel upcoming shows. Euro-African promotion ARES FC postponed an upcoming event in Belgium. ONE Championship followed suit and postponed its 20 March show in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam after hosting its previous event in Singapore behind closed doors. Combate Americas announced a \u201cproactive plan\u201d that included postponing upcoming shows and scheduling new ones on a closed-set TV studio, while Bellator postponed its Friday show hours before the event was set to begin. Interestingly, White and the UFC have failed to address the status of UFC 249: Khabib v Ferguson, which is still scheduled to take place on April 18th at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. New York State governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency in New York state last Saturday and has since placed a ban on gatherings of more than 500 people. New York mayor Bill de Blasio declared a state of emergency in the city on Thursday and revealed that locations such as the Barclays Center and Madison Square Garden could be closed for months to deal with what \u201ccould easily be a six-month crisis.\u201d While the UFC will likely move its anticipated pay-per-piew event from Brooklyn to the Apex facility, it remains to be seen whether that will serve as a long-term solution for the promotion, especially given that Nevada has also declared a state of emergency. White\u2019s reaction to the outbreak over this past week, which includes the claim that he doesn\u2019t \u201cgive a shit about the coronavirus\u201d, suggests that the UFC will continue to push ahead with their planned events irrespective of concerns regarding public safety. During a time of crisis, the UFC\u2019s stubborn insistence that the show must go on is not only a prime example of corporate greed but a betrayal of its responsibility towards its staff, its fighters and the public at large. \u201cThis is not just a public health crisis, it is a crisis that will touch every sector,\u201d said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, at a media briefing declaring Covid-19 a pandemic. \u201cSo every sector and every individual must be involved in the fights.\u201d",

If the situation deteriorated and going outside, while maintaining distance from others, wasn\u2019t as viable an option, she\u2019d go on Netflix and \u201csort things out that I haven\u2019t\u201d around the house. \u201cMarie Kondo my apartment, that was one of my ideas,\u201d said Dennett, referring to the Japanese decluttering guru. \u201cI\u2019ve already done that, but I\u2019m probably just going to re-do it, have a wardrobe clean out.\u201d She doesn\u2019t tension with her roommates \u2013 two cats. \u201cThey\u2019re fine,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re probably going to be really happy, because I\u2019ll be around a lot more.\u201d Dana Humphrey, CEO of Whitegate PR, neither wants nor intends to weather mass disruptions of social activities at home. \u201cI am supposed to fly to Guatemala on Wednesday, and I sat on hold for two hours last night to see if i could fly out earlier,\u201d said Humphrey, a resident of New York City\u2019s Queens borough. \u201cSitting at home, not being able to go to events, is not OK for me.\u201d \u201cI just feel like there\u2019s no point in being in New York,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here. I want to get out of here.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re constantly afraid of what your neighbor is up to, it\u2019s no way to live.\u201d Ryan Walker, who DJs post-punk and goth rock at the Pyramid Club in the East Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York, said the venue is closed temporarily due to the outbreak. Walker, who also spends time at the Pyramid Club when he\u2019s not DJing, said he has fewer friends leaving home, \u201cso it\u2019s kind of less people to hang out with\u201d. \u201cThere is still reason to go out,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel like, the people that are going out, we have a sense of humor about things, we understand the severity \u2026 but it\u2019s just our way of keeping our morale up.\u201d Walker \u2013 who said that while he\u2019s not \u201cwelding my door shut\u201d, he is limiting contact with older family members \u2013 said that he would find ways to occupy himself if the situation worsened. He would watch Netflix with his girlfriend or take online finance courses. \u201cSo yeah, that and probably just listen to more music,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m always on the lookout for more music for my DJ sets. It would be an excuse for me to hang around and find danceable stuff that I\u2019ve never heard of before.\u201d Walker said his two roommates appeared to be handling the outbreak without incident. \u201cSo far, in our apartment, you probably wouldn\u2019t know there was a global pandemic outside,\u201d he said. \u201cThat could change, you know, it\u2019s supposed to be doubling everyday \u2026 so, we might be freaking out if you called me a week from now.\u201d",

This crisis, one that now touches every continent on Earth apart from Antarctica, demands leaders who are willing to listen to professional advice, capable of fostering national cohesion at a time of emergency, and skilled at seeking international cooperation. The luckier countries will be those blessed with competent, honest and intelligent leadership. One of the possible positives to come out of this crisis \u2013 I put it no higher than possible at this stage \u2013 is that it will decrease the public appetite for bombastic charlatans and increase demand for serious leaders who respect expertise.

People present at Cobra meetings and other decision-making moments generally report being impressed by the way he conducts himself. I asked one witness, who is not an instinctive cheerleader for this prime minister, how they thought he was doing. The reply came: \u201cPretty well. He is listening intently to the science.\u201d In this respect, Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser and a fervent admirer of science, is acting as a positive influence on the prime minister, rather than a baleful one. Whenever he addresses the country from the state dining room, he has come flanked by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, and Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer. Thrust into the spotlight in a way neither man can have anticipated, they have both impressed with the clear and calm way they have talked to the nation. They can explain the reasoning for the strategy and how it is evolving with much more credibility than any politician. The polls tell us they will be much more likely to be believed. The government\u2019s senior scientists also serve as the prime minister\u2019s human shields against accusations that he is acting out of ideological fixations or for partisan advantage. No wonder he is clinging to them.</p> <p>The past few days have brought both more clarity and more controversy about their strategy. There is still consensus around one key component \u2013 to try to spread out the rate of infection: \u201cflattening the peak\u201d. The hope is to reduce the scale of the spike and delay it to a warmer month so that the health service is not overwhelmed with patients requiring critical care. In his budget, an event all but eclipsed by the crisis, Rishi Sunak promised the NHS \u201cwhatever it takes\u2026 millions or billions\u201d to tackle the coronavirus, but you can\u2019t spend that money overnight. The NHS needs to increase its intensive care capacity, but that requires more staff, more equipment and more time. The crisis in Italy, whose leadership was slow to realise that they had a problem and who have now imposed an almost total lockdown of the entire country, has shocked ministers. It is widely assumed that Britain is about four weeks behind Italy in terms of infection, though that doesn\u2019t mean we have to end up in the same grisly place.</p> <p>There is not consensus, but mounting controversy, about another critical element of the government\u2019s strategy. Britain has adopted a strikingly different approach to the many other countries that are implementing faster and more sweeping programmes to curtail human contact. These include Ireland, France and Belgium, all close neighbours.</p> <p>That has fuelled the rising pressure on the prime minister to take much more stringent steps here. The pressure is coming both from Labour and from within the government\u2019s own ranks. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, has been the loudest voice asking why we are not seeking to emulate Asian states, such as Singapore and South Korea, that seem to have had some success in snuffing out the spread of the virus.</p> <p>The government is moving towards banning sports fixtures and other mass gatherings, but is still resistant to a more comprehensive shutdown. The scientific reasoning behind Britain\u2019s approach is that more draconian steps won\u2019t make that much difference at this stage, are not sustainable over the longer term, and may well turn out to be counterproductive because it will lead to a second wave of infections when restrictions are eased \u2013 possibly in winter, when the NHS is most stretched.</p> <p>Sir Patrick has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-science-chief-defends-uk-measures-criticism-herd-immunity\" title=\"\">lucidly explained</a> what the strategy is designed to achieve. It expects those on whom the disease has mild effects, the great majority, to be gradually exposed to the virus, building up \u201cherd immunity\u201d. Over time, this will lower the risk of infection for the vulnerable. While this is going on, they will do what they can to protect those for whom the coronavirus could be fatal. Perhaps the most important advice given by the government last week was the simplest. That was to tell people who have flu-type symptoms, however slight, that they should stay at home for seven days. \u201cThat\u2019s not trivial,\u201d says one of those involved in this decision. \u201cThat is a significant amount of social distancing.\u201d</p> <p>Faced with an invisible menace with extremely visible impacts, a clamour for instant and total shutdowns is understandable. But it comes accompanied by the danger that kneejerk responses by frantic governments can end up doing more harm than good. One scientist drew my attention to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/04/japan-lifts-evacuation-order-futaba-town-fukushima-disaster\" title=\"\">Fukushima</a> nuclear plant disaster in Japan in 2011. Later studies found that around 20 people died from radiation. Many more, about a thousand, lost their lives as a result of the decision to evacuate: casualties of car crashes, heart attacks and other medical emergencies triggered by trying to clear the area in a rush. Sometimes the obvious reaction to a crisis will not be the correct one.</p> <p>Many lives depend on getting this right. The government can\u2019t be blamed for the virus, but there will be fierce scrutiny of its responses. There are risks with the strategy it has adopted \u2013 and huge ones for the reputation of Mr Johnson if the public concludes that his handling of the crisis led to avoidable deaths. There are hazards, too, with the alternative approaches. Various models for tackling the pandemic are now being live trialled around the world by governments of many different complexions and levels of competence. It will likely be a year or so before we will gain an understanding of which of the plans was the smartest. My conversations have convinced me that the British approach is rooted in scientific logic and a careful calibration of the different risks. I\u2019m no epidemiologist so I won\u2019t pretend to be a qualified judge of whether they are doing the right thing. I am persuaded that they are sincerely endeavouring to do the right thing.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

With doubt surrounding the continuation of the league, the Phoenix are proposing to spend at least six-straight weeks in Australia in pursuit of a maiden title.</p> <p>Wellington will host Melbourne Victory on Sunday at Sky Stadium, hours before travel restrictions take effect at midnight on both sides of the Tasman. Phoenix general manager David Dome said his third-placed team had all but bought into playing out their campaign on Australian soil under extraordinary circumstances. They couldn\u2019t play for 14 days while undergoing mandatory isolation, and then would have an intense run of games, probably in empty stadiums.</p> <p>Wellington would be unable to play road games scheduled next week, against Sydney FC on Wednesday and Newcastle on Sunday. They would bank on FFA rescheduling both games, while two matches - which were to have been played in Wellington in April - would need to be relocated to Australia.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to capitulate and not play out. We had to play out; we had to do our best to get into the finals series,\u201d Dome said. \u201cThe disappointing thing for us is that the fans won\u2019t be there to enjoy it.\u201d</p> <p>Dome said the team would likely self-isolate in central Sydney accommodation and emerge only for controlled training sessions. Dome said players would have the choice to commit to a full Australian stay of at least six weeks.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to force players to go.

A resort in far north Queensland has already emailed the NRL to advise they have vacancies to accommodate all 16 NRL teams should the competition be moved.</p> <p>However, it all hinges on a report from an appointed biosecurity expert who will assess which solution is safest for players.<br></p> <p>\u201cWe need to get our biosecurity experts to have a look at that facility and how we would eliminate any risk. There\u2019s an element of thought that you might put greater risk by having all the players in one area,\u201d V\u2019landys told Triple M on Sunday. \u201cWe have to look at all contingencies and ensure that we are providing the best biosecurity measures to eliminate any risk of the players catching the virus. The biggest risk for us is a player or official catching the virus, which means there would be isolation of some of the players and teams and that\u2019s when we can pull the lever on suspending the season.\u201d</p> <p>Other options understood to be considered are postponing the season for a month and extending the competition through until the end of October and playing catch-up games during bye rounds. There is also the option for rescheduling games should a player be diagnosed with coronavirus and restructuring the competition for games to be played later in the season.</p> <p>Games are already closed to crowds from round two but conversations will continue with clubs over the next week as the global situation remains fluid. It\u2019s still to be determined if lower grade and junior competitions will need to be shut down, with the state authorities to make those decisions in the coming days.

      "bodyText": "Well, what a day we\u2019ve been through! Some big changes happening across the sporting landscape with doubtless more to come over the next week. We\u2019ve already seen the end, for now, of the Super Rugby. While the AFLM, AFLW, NRL and A-League are still scheduled to go ahead next week, albeit behind closed doors, advice is changing multiple times a day and who knows if those next games will happen next week, or at all? The Newcastle Jets look pretty comfortable in Adelaide, up 3-0 halfway through the second half, while in Wollongong the Tigers have pulled ahead, leading the Dragons 18-14 with 15 minutes remaining. Until we meet again, in whatever form Sportwatch takes over the coming weeks, good night, stay safe, socially distant and clean. So long! NRL: Here\u2019s that footage of Cameron Smith with his take on how the NRL should be handling the competition in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. NBL: The Perth Wildcats are one win away from securing the NBL premiership with a win over the Sydney Kings in game three of a best of five grand final series played behind closed doors today. NRL: Melbourne\u2019s Cameron Smith has added his voice to the debate on continuing the NRL, believing the competition should be suspended for two weeks. More from AAP: Cam Smith calls for NRL to be suspended Cameron Smith has called for the NRL to be suspended for at least two weeks in a bid to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Smith said he was speaking for all Melbourne players when he highlighted his concern around family members and the team\u2019s constant travel load. \u201cThere is something in place tomorrow to avoid being around groups larger than 500 people, and there are more than 500 people at airports and we\u2019re going to be doing that every second week,\u201d Smith said. A-League: Adelaide 0-1 Newcastle at half-time This game was scoreless for most of the half, until Dimitrios Petratos slid it across to Roy O\u2019Donovan for a simple tap in in the 41st minute to put the Jets ahead. Newcastle have been pretty ordinary on the road this year, so they\u2019ll be hoping to snatch just their second away win of the season if they can see this lead through. NRL: St George-Illawarra Dragons 12-8 Wests Tigers at half-time The Dragons got the early points in this one, before the Tigers hit back. But Zac Lomax was on hand to deliver another blow for the Dragons, putting pressure on the Tigers fullback Corey Thompson that forces and error and lets Lomax sneak over for an easy try, before adding the conversion. Lomax was lucky his own error didn\u2019t prove costly later as he dropped a simple kick return right on the Tigers\u2019 tryline, but the Dragons defence was good enough to hold the Tigers out. Despite West Coast finally managing to snare a goal in the final quarter, this game was all about the Gold Coast Suns. It was a dominant display from start to finish and keeps their finals hopes alive going into their match against Adelaide next week. Kalinda Howarth continued her form into the final quarter, finishing with four goals for the game. \u201cIt was an awesome game today,\u201d she said. \u201cWe love playing in the dry - it was a really great opportunity to show off our skills. It was awesome to be able to get on the board and hopefully we can keep pushing through and keep winning.\u201d Just a reminder that if you want a quick rundown of everything that\u2019s happening in Australian sport with regards to coronavirus, this story has all the latest updates. AFLW: Gold Coast leads West Coast 4.3 (27) to 0.2 (2) The Suns have really started to assert their dominance on this game, with some impressive stats coming out of their side of the scorecard. Jacqui Yorston has been a menace in defence, with nine tackles and eight disposals, while Kate Surman with 17 disposals is working like a machine. Kalinda Howarth has been on fire with the boot, kicking three of the Suns\u2019 four goals. Rugby Sevens: Here is more on that story I mentioned earlier about possible coronavirus cases coming out of the Australian Sevens camp, via AAP. Australian Sevens program possibly hit by virus Two members of the Australian sevens program have been tested for coronavirus after showing signs and symptoms associated with the pandemic. Rugby Australia didn\u2019t specify whether they were players or staff, only announcing two people had self-isolated after experiencing symptoms this weekend. Both had attended the RA high performance centre within its Moore Park headquarters in Sydney during the past week. As a precautionary measure, the governing body\u2019s headquarters will be closed for two days for an intensive clean. All administrative staff have been advised to work from home, and the Australian men\u2019s and women\u2019s sevens teams will not attend the facility on Monday or Tuesday. Results of the tests are expected to be known within 72 hours. The Phoenix finished off their last home game for the forseeable future in style, with a 3-0 takedown of the Victory in Wellington. A second half goal to David Ball sealed the deal and their defence held strong to deny the Victory any goals. It was a measured performance that will see them edge ever closer to Melbourne City on the ladder, sitting just outside the top two. Rugby Sevens: An interesting little piece of info from Georgina Robinson on Twitter here, we\u2019ll keep an eye on this story and see how it progresses. Well I predicted someone would blink before too long in the second half and it was Manly in the end - Melbourne were able to score the first try of the game in the 61st minute with a little chip over the top to winger Suliasi Vunivalu. Two minutes later Vunivalu was over again and Tom Eisenhuth put the icing on the cake in the 74th minute. An ominous start to the season for the Sea Eagles, who tend to rely on their parochial home crowd to get them over the line at their Brookvale fortress. The crowd couldn\u2019t do it today and from next week they will be unable to even get through the gates. AFLW: Gold Coast 2.2 (14) leads West Coast 0.1 (1) at half-time Things aren\u2019t getting any better for the Eagles, with still no goals on the board. It hasn\u2019t been a complete performance from the Suns so far, but they\u2019ve done enough to stay on top and will be feeling pretty confident heading into the sheds for half-time. A huge win for the Brumbies as the Super Rugby grinds to a halt while travel restrictions are enacted. Seven tries for the home side in this game, while the Waratahs couldn\u2019t manage to score again in the second half. Tom Banks scores an absolute belter at the death just to really send the Waratahs home with their tails between their legs. The Brumbies are comfortably on top of the Australian conference, while the Waratahs are languishing down near the bottom, just ahead of the Sunwolves. Formula One: Giles Richards\u2019 fascinating chat with former world champion Alan Jones (not the one from the radio) is well worth a read, some interesting thoughts on the Albert Park cancellation. Jones was hugely disappointed at the cancellation but accepts it was the right thing to do. The indomitable Australian can-do spirit tempered by the reality of the coronavirus. \u2018From my point of view I would have gone ahead and done it anyway but you have to be sensible about the whole thing,\u2019 he says.\u201d AFLW: Gold Coast leads West Coast 1.2 (8) to 0.0 (0) at quarter-time A defensive-heavy game so far, with Kalinda Howarth sneaking through a goal in the 11th minute after a couple of behinds from her teammates. A very unhappy outing from the Eagles so far, with plenty of tackling but no reward. A-League: Phoenix 2-0 Victory at half-time The Phoenix are making the most of what will likely be their last game in New Zealand for some time. They have been clinical this first half, taking their scoring opportunities and limiting Victory\u2019s time in possession. Ulises D\u00e1vila scored early for the home team, with Gary Hooper heading through the second in the 21st minute. A-League: An update via AAP on the situation with the Wellington Phoenix with travel restrictions coming into effect from tonight. Phoenix commit to Australian A-League stay Wellington have committed to playing out their A-League season in Australia, even though it means undergoing a self-isolation period after border restrictions introduced to Australia to combat coronavirus. With doubt surrounding the continuation of the league, the Phoenix are proposing to spend at least six-straight weeks in Australia in pursuit of a maiden title. Wellington will host Melbourne Victory on Sunday at Sky Stadium, hours before travel restrictions take effect at midnight on both sides of the Tasman. Phoenix general manager David Dome said his third-placed team had all but bought into playing out their campaign on Australian soil under extraordinary circumstances. They couldn\u2019t play for 14 days while undergoing mandatory isolation, and then would have an intense run of games, probably in empty stadiums. Wellington would be unable to play road games scheduled next week, against Sydney FC on Wednesday and Newcastle on Sunday. They would bank on FFA rescheduling both games, while two matches - which were to have been played in Wellington in April - would need to be relocated to Australia. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to capitulate and not play out. We had to play out; we had to do our best to get into the finals series,\u201d Dome said. \u201cThe disappointing thing for us is that the fans won\u2019t be there to enjoy it.\u201d Dome said the team would likely self-isolate in central Sydney accommodation and emerge only for controlled training sessions. Dome said players would have the choice to commit to a full Australian stay of at least six weeks. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to force players to go. We won\u2019t mandate it because there are some players with families. There are some players who are expecting children and do we really want to take them away from their newborn babies?\u201d Super Rugby: Brumbies 21-14 Waratahs at half-time Meanwhile in the code where trying scoring is usually much less frequent, there has been a bit of a try-fest down in Canberra in a high scoring first half between these two old foes. The Waratahs got on the board first through Rob Simmons, but the Brumbies hit back soon after and lead three tries to two. Solomone Kata managed two in eight minutes for the home side. With the Super Rugby suspended after today when travel restrictions into Australia and New Zealand come into place, this will be an important win to get. NRL: Manly 4-2 Melbourne at half-time A very low scoring start to the season for these two teams with the match resembling rugby union more than league - three penalty goals are all that has troubled the scorers in the first half. Both sides have been phenomenal in the defence of their lines, but early season lack of fitness is likely to plague one or both sides in the second half and we could see some late tries sneak through. A strong win for GWS over last year\u2019s premiers, sending them into second place on the Conference A ladder. Another goal from Cora Staunton sealed the deal as they kept up their defence all the way to the end. A late goal from Courtney Gum for the Crows wasn\u2019t enough to bridge the gap and the Giants celebrated the win. An emotional response from Staunton showed just how important this game was to the GWS team. \u201cObviously it was a big game for the club,\u201d said Staunton after the match. \u201cWe knew coming in it was a big game for the club...it was a massive win for us. We wanted consistency in our game and we showed that today. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that there\u2019s no crowd, but we obviously understand that people\u2019s health is a lot more important than sport. \u201cIt\u2019s been just over 10 months since I shattered my leg and had four breaks. I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d be back...it was a physical and mental battle to get back.\u201d More perspective on cancellations, this time out of the UK from Barney Ronay. There will be a clashing of gears over all this and no shortage of legal threats as time and resources are divvied up. Sport will survive. The beauty, the grace, the basic pleasure of these gaudy entertainments will remain unaffected. But a great deal of practical help will be required to ensure it is not offered only to those victims of this nasty little bug who can shout the loudest, that precarious livelihoods and the infrastructure of amateur sport are also protected.\u201d AFLW: GWS leads Adelaide 3.2 (20) to 2.3 (15) at three-quarter time Another low scoring quarter - the stifling defence from the Giants is doing the job here as they keep their noses in front. It\u2019s an exhausting style of game to play though, so it will be interesting to see how their fitness holds up in the last quarter. Alyce Parker is doing a power of work, with 25 disposals and six marks to her name. Brittany Tully scored the goal to ease the Giants ahead, just four minutes before three-quarter time. W-League: The match report on Melbourne City\u2019s dominant semi-final win is up now. Some good info here from Tom Kludt on the North American perspective of sport in the time of coronavirus and those who will be hit hardest by league suspensions. Schauder says the deepest, and most immediate implications, will be felt by those employed by the stadiums, which play host to other entertainment ventures along with sporting events, as well as nearby businesses that capitalize on those gatherings.\u201d AFLW: GWS leads Adelaide 2.2 (14) to 2.1 (13) As predicted, this game remains a tight struggle, with just one goal that quarter - to the Giants\u2019 cross-coder Jodie Hicks (also a cricketer with the Sydney Sixers in the WBBL). Last season\u2019s best and fairest for the Giants Rebecca Beeson has continued her dominance, with 10 disposals and three tackles for the match. Strong defence from the Giants is frustrating the Crows, the team in orange will need to keep that up and continue to stifle as the match plays out. F1: A bit of a mess this week with the cancellation of the F1 after all spectators had arrived and were waiting to get in. Giles Richards breaks it down for us in this story. It was merely mismanagement that had crowned what increasingly appears to have been at best an optimistic decision to bring thousands of F1 personnel from a Europe already creaking under the assault of coronavirus to a mass gathering event that attracts up to 100,000 people a day. In the light of sport across the world curtailing activity to restrict the spread of the virus, that F1 felt it could escape unscathed seems hopelessly naive.\u201d AFLW: Adelaide 2.1 (13) lead GWS 1.1 (7) at quarter time A strong first quarter from the Crows with Courtney Gum and Marijana Rajcic in the goals. Cora Staunton scored for GWS, who will feel that they are still in the game at this point. Tait Mackrill and Rebecca Beeson have both been strong for the Giants, with plenty of disposals in the first quarter. It\u2019s shaping up to be a cracker of a game. City have booked their spot in the W-League grand final with a decisive win over the Wanderers. Kyah Simon was happy with the performance and said the team is focusing on improving to ensure they play their best game in the grand final against Sydney FC next weekend. \u201cI\u2019ve played with a lot of the Sydney FC girls and spent a lot of my career there in the sky blue,\u201d she said. \u201cPriority is to play our own game and focus on what we do well.\u201d Interesting to see elbow bumps taking place between the two teams after the game considering the level of the goal celebrations taking place. Possibly each team believes they could only spread viruses through opposition and not teammates? A-League: News just in from AAP on the potential suspension of the A-League: Travel restrictions could shut A-League The A-League could be suspended with the governments of Australia and New Zealand imposing compulsory 14-day self-isolation periods to combat the coronavirus. Wellington Phoenix will host Melbourne Victory at Sky Stadium on Sunday, with travel restrictions taking effect in Australia and New Zealand at midnight. On Saturday following New Zealand announcing its health plan, the Phoenix said it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to host matches at home due to international travellers having to self-isolate for two weeks. Well in this very strange week the coverage of sport has looked quite different to usual. This interesting piece from Jonathan Liew talks about sport bringing the brutal reality of coronavirus to the front of many people\u2019s minds. For so many of us, sport isn\u2019t simply a way of passing the time but a way of marking it. It offers a liturgy, a structure on which to measure the passing days and seasons...In frightening times, virus or no virus, these are the rituals that offer the veneer of normality, a background noise as reassuring and immutable as the ticking of the clock.\u201d Not a happy outing for the Brumbies, being comprehensively beaten by the Reds in Canberra. The Reds were dominant in every facet of the game and with this win, have earned the right to host next weekend\u2019s Super W playoff. Tries to Shannon Mato, Okeroa Manihera and Ivy Kaleta sealed the win for the Reds, with a 100% conversion rate from Lori Cramer. This swung back and forth like a pendulum and was very close throughout most of the match, but in the end the Dockers were able to put the foot down and come away with a strong 15 point win. Ashley Sharp was dominant for Fremantle, kicking three goals, while Mia-Rae Clifford finished with two. It was a valiant effort from the Bulldogs who are well down the Conference B ladder, taking it to the highly fancied Dockers who remained undefeated at the top of Conference B. NRL: An interesting story from AAP on potential responses the NRL are considering. NRL take advice from biosecurity expert ARL commission chairman Peter V\u2019landys has revealed a north Queensland resort has reached out to the NRL to be considered if all 16 clubs are to be relocated to play a \u2018Magic Round\u2019 style competition. As NRL bosses navigate one of the most complex challenges in the game\u2019s history due to the coronavirus pandemic, V\u2019landys has confirmed every option to keep the competition alive is being considered. That includes relocating all 16 NRL teams to a warmer climate such as Queensland where the virus is less likely to thrive, isolating teams in one location, and playing all games at one stadium to ensure the broadcast can proceed. A resort in far north Queensland has already emailed the NRL to advise they have vacancies to accommodate all 16 NRL teams should the competition be moved. However, it all hinges on a report from an appointed biosecurity expert who will assess which solution is safest for players. \u201cWe need to get our biosecurity experts to have a look at that facility and how we would eliminate any risk. There\u2019s an element of thought that you might put greater risk by having all the players in one area,\u201d V\u2019landys told Triple M on Sunday. \u201cWe have to look at all contingencies and ensure that we are providing the best biosecurity measures to eliminate any risk of the players catching the virus. The biggest risk for us is a player or official catching the virus, which means there would be isolation of some of the players and teams and that\u2019s when we can pull the lever on suspending the season.\u201d Other options understood to be considered are postponing the season for a month and extending the competition through until the end of October and playing catch-up games during bye rounds. There is also the option for rescheduling games should a player be diagnosed with coronavirus and restructuring the competition for games to be played later in the season. Games are already closed to crowds from round two but conversations will continue with clubs over the next week as the global situation remains fluid. It\u2019s still to be determined if lower grade and junior competitions will need to be shut down, with the state authorities to make those decisions in the coming days. However, V\u2019landys said it was inevitable there would be changes made. Coronavirus updates: Head to this story if you want to keep track of where Australian sports are at with postponing, cancelling and locking out spectators as the coronavirus continues to have an effect on sport around the world. We\u2019ll keep it updated throughout the day as information comes in and situations change. W-League: Melbourne City 3-0 Western Sydney Wanderers at half-time A big half for City who have all but booked their place in the grand final after a dominant first half. Goals from Kyah Simon, Claire Emslie and Rebekah Stott put City on the board, though the goal celebrations were not entirely in keeping with social distancing protocols - it will be interesting to see how this trends across sport this weekend. Well, what a weekend this is. At this stage we have plenty of live sport to get through, although many sports are locked out to crowds. But today may be the last day we see this much sport for a while - the Super Rugby will be postponed at the conclusion of the current round following travel restrictions to New Zealand coming into effect tonight. The NRL is continuing with round two at this stage, though crowds will be locked out after the conclusion of round one this evening. The Super Netball has cancelled the Team Girls Cup preseason competition that was due to be held from 27-29 March. It\u2019s certainly not the usual Sportwatch for a weekend - I\u2019ll do my best to keep you updated on all the latest developments as they unfold. Don\u2019t forget to tweet, email or leave a comment with your thoughts on how the sports are responding.",

      "body": "<p>There has been a huge difference in how the coronavirus pandemic has evolved in different countries. Some have gone nearly two months with just a few dozen cases; others have seen an outbreak explode in weeks.</p> <p>The statistics about the early evolution of cases can be confusing, because some countries were slow to test or late to announce results. Italy\u2019s first case was at the end of January, but the disease is thought to have been circulating there from the middle of the month. Likewise the steep rise of cases in Iran suggests it was spreading long before the first positive test.</p> <p>Many of the countries that have had the greatest success in containing the disease are ones that were affected by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/24/lessons-from-sars-outbreak-help-in-race-for-coronavirus-vaccine\" title=\"\">Sars in 2002-03</a>. The memory of that crisis may have led to better preparedness, in government and among the population, and to a greater willingness among people to comply with restrictions on movement and daily life to prevent the spread of infection.</p> <p>There are three main aspects to controls that aim to stop the spread of the disease. The first is travel bans on people from areas with high levels of cases (initially mainland China, now many more places); the second is quarantine rules to prevent known or suspected carriers from spreading infection; and the third is shutdowns and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-uk-action-plan-poised-for-social-distancing-phase\" title=\"\">social distancing</a> to prevent transmission between unidentified carriers by reducing human contact.</p> <p>Below we take a look at some of the worst-affected countries, and the most successful at containing coronavirus so far. China has not been included, because its circumstances are an outlier. But it is another example of how quarantine requirements, and strict controls on movement and social interaction, can dramatically curb the spread of the disease. On Friday it had only eight new cases, the first time that number has fallen into single digits since the outbreak began.</p> <p>Initially, Italy did little to stop the spread of coronavirus. After it registered more deaths than any other country outside China, and the scale of the crisis became clear, it locked down first the northern region at the centre of the crisis and then the entire country.</p> <p>Schools and universities have closed, along with all shops except supermarkets and pharmacies.

Even after the toll began to rise rapidly, and senior politicians tested positive, health workers in small hospitals did not initially use protective gear.</p> <p>Now schools have been closed and most Friday prayer services are cancelled.

      "body": "<p>Amid a global pandemic, Hong Kong\u2019s famously crowded streets are eerily quiet. Most of the city\u2019s 7.5m people have been practising various forms of social distancing for months.</p> <p>Shops and restaurants are empty, already struggling in a recession after nine months of teetering on the brink of revolution.</p> <p>It\u2019s a far cry from last year when one in four people took to the streets in protest marches that stretched for kilometres, tightly packed between the towering highrises.</p> <p>In Hong Kong the coronavirus, which causes the Covid-19 illness, has infected about 130 people.</p> <p>It\u2019s an extraordinarily low number, given Hong Kong\u2019s proximity to mainland China, where the outbreak started. The city learned hard lessons during the Sars outbreak of 2003, when 299 Hong Kongers died.</p> <p>After a rocky start, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/mass-testing-alerts-and-big-fines-the-strategies-used-in-asia-to-slow-coronavirus\">the response to Covid-19 has been comprehensive</a> \u2013 schools and public attractions have been closed for months, and there are tight restrictions and laws on incoming travellers. Working from home is common, as is the enthusiasm for wearing masks, avoiding germs, and staying away from public gatherings.</p> <p>There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/mass-testing-alerts-and-big-fines-the-strategies-used-in-asia-to-slow-coronavirus\">tentative talk that containment efforts are working</a> and because of that, there is also speculation over what this means for the protesters who spent months demonstrating against Hong Kong\u2019s authorities.</p> <p>The protests were sparked by an extradition bill which would have allowed suspected or accused criminals to be sent to mainland China. It went to the heart of Hong Kong concerns about the region\u2019s impending return to Beijing control in 2047, and current intrusions on their freedom and democracy.</p> <p>The bill was eventually withdrawn but not before the protests escalated and four new demands were made: true universal suffrage for Hong Kongers, an inquiry into police brutality, amnesty for arrested protesters, and a retraction of the government\u2019s classification of protesters as \u201crioters\u201d.</p> <p>Only one of the movement\u2019s five demands have been met and members are still subject to waves of crackdowns.</p> <p>\u201cI think the government is gaining confidence that it is getting better control over the situation and is gradually prodding to see how far it can go with its crackdown,\u201d says Kong Tsung-gan, a writer, educator and activist who participated in the Umbrella movement.</p> <p>\u201cQuestion one is when and if people will feel that the coronavirus epidemic is under control. My sense is that the period of panic is over and confidence is growing.\u201d</p> <p>Andrew Junker, honorary assistant professor with The Chinese University of Hong Kong\u2019s sociology department, says the protests \u201clost steam\u201d, due to both the virus seizing public attention and the movement reaching something of a peak in November, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/28/hong-kong-police-enter-campus-despite-pleas-from-protesters\">the traumatic university sieges</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/24/hong-kong-residents-turn-up-for-local-elections-in-record-numbers\">success of pro-democracy candidates at the local elections</a>.</p> <p>Even before then, protests had entered a new phase which turned away some of the public, evolving from mass public marches to \u201cwarrior style disobedience\u201d \u2013 short, sharp, unauthorised protests seeking to provoke police into overreactions which would drive support and media attention to the movement.</p> <p>A social media administrator of a popular protest-update account tells the Guardian they and friends remained committed to getting back out on the streets.</p> <p>\u201cTo us, of course protecting ourselves from the coronavirus is vital.

      "bodyText": "Amid a global pandemic, Hong Kong\u2019s famously crowded streets are eerily quiet. Most of the city\u2019s 7.5m people have been practising various forms of social distancing for months. Shops and restaurants are empty, already struggling in a recession after nine months of teetering on the brink of revolution. It\u2019s a far cry from last year when one in four people took to the streets in protest marches that stretched for kilometres, tightly packed between the towering highrises. In Hong Kong the coronavirus, which causes the Covid-19 illness, has infected about 130 people. It\u2019s an extraordinarily low number, given Hong Kong\u2019s proximity to mainland China, where the outbreak started. The city learned hard lessons during the Sars outbreak of 2003, when 299 Hong Kongers died. After a rocky start, the response to Covid-19 has been comprehensive \u2013 schools and public attractions have been closed for months, and there are tight restrictions and laws on incoming travellers. Working from home is common, as is the enthusiasm for wearing masks, avoiding germs, and staying away from public gatherings. There is tentative talk that containment efforts are working and because of that, there is also speculation over what this means for the protesters who spent months demonstrating against Hong Kong\u2019s authorities. The protests were sparked by an extradition bill which would have allowed suspected or accused criminals to be sent to mainland China. It went to the heart of Hong Kong concerns about the region\u2019s impending return to Beijing control in 2047, and current intrusions on their freedom and democracy. The bill was eventually withdrawn but not before the protests escalated and four new demands were made: true universal suffrage for Hong Kongers, an inquiry into police brutality, amnesty for arrested protesters, and a retraction of the government\u2019s classification of protesters as \u201crioters\u201d. Only one of the movement\u2019s five demands have been met and members are still subject to waves of crackdowns. \u201cI think the government is gaining confidence that it is getting better control over the situation and is gradually prodding to see how far it can go with its crackdown,\u201d says Kong Tsung-gan, a writer, educator and activist who participated in the Umbrella movement. \u201cQuestion one is when and if people will feel that the coronavirus epidemic is under control. My sense is that the period of panic is over and confidence is growing.\u201d Andrew Junker, honorary assistant professor with The Chinese University of Hong Kong\u2019s sociology department, says the protests \u201clost steam\u201d, due to both the virus seizing public attention and the movement reaching something of a peak in November, with the traumatic university sieges and the success of pro-democracy candidates at the local elections. Even before then, protests had entered a new phase which turned away some of the public, evolving from mass public marches to \u201cwarrior style disobedience\u201d \u2013 short, sharp, unauthorised protests seeking to provoke police into overreactions which would drive support and media attention to the movement. A social media administrator of a popular protest-update account tells the Guardian they and friends remained committed to getting back out on the streets. \u201cTo us, of course protecting ourselves from the coronavirus is vital. But when it comes to seeing our home being destroyed by tyranny in every way possible, values we have been upholding are twisted and devastated, the virus seems too minor an issue to hinder us from guarding our home,\u201d she says. \u201cWe will never back off. We are willing to do everything to fight against injustice and expose the truth even if our efforts seemed small and powerless.\u201d There is widespread acceptance that the fear of infection at mass gatherings has played a part in the diminished numbers. However it has also driven its own protests. The already low support and trust in the Hong Kong government and chief executive, Carrie Lam, were compounded by early missteps in responding to the virus. \u201cThe wrong and inefficient allocation of resources [eg masks] and slow border closures incited hatred in our community too,\u201d the administrator says, in reference to protests and strikes over Lam\u2019s reluctance to close borders or place restrictions on travellers from mainland China. \u201cIf the government had closed the border, we could have been able to stop the epidemic spreading in Hong Kong even more effectively.\u201d Kong says the policing of protests during the outbreak has been \u201cmore oppressive than ever\u201d. Alleged police brutality and mass arrests continue, including three high-profile pro-democracy figures on charges which observers said could apply to almost any protester, as well as hundreds of others at smaller events since. Last Sunday, police were filmed pepper-spraying journalists and bystanders at a demonstration against the establishment of a Covid-19 clinic in a high-density residential area. Just hours later they were again accused of excessive force in trying to shut down a vigil for a young man who died when he fell from a car park during a protest in November. On Wednesday the US State Department accused the Hong Kong government of an \u201capparent unwillingness to criticise the police force\u201d or investigate alleged breaches of civil liberties. Hong Kong dismissed the report as foreign interference. Albert Ho, a solicitor and high-profile pro-democracy politician in Hong Kong, says it is clear there have been fewer confrontations and clashes since the virus, and authorities appear to be using the quiet time to round up key figures and organisers. \u201cI think they have come to a stage where they can say they have clamped down on these movements by the youngsters,\u201d he says. \u201cSo they have to do everything to deter the social organisers from continuing to organise marches and demonstrations on a big scale.\u201d Views differ within the movement on whether another organised, police-approved rally could draw people out in their millions again. Junker says it looks like the movement is now trying to re-energise, but there\u2019s \u201ca lot of fatalism at this point, saying nothing is working\u201d. \u201cThe government has all the resources and institutional levers to follow up in these retributional ways.\u201d But it\u2019s hard to predict. \u201cIt\u2019s like a weird kind of effervescent chemistry where [if] the right things converge and boom, you have two million people out on the street.\u201d Kong says: \u201cOne thing is certain \u2013 distrust and anger with the government has only grown, and people\u2019s views haven\u2019t changed: we\u2019re sick of an unrepresentative and unresponsive government. We want democracy. How that manifests itself is hard to say.\u201d",

And \u2013 since we are in the beginning stages of a pandemic for which the United States is not remotely prepared and in which the uninsured, elderly, and poor are much more likely to die \u2013 well, let\u2019s just say the timing creates a certain tone.</p> <p>The co-writer and producer Damon Lindelof \u2013 who recently read the legendary anti-fascist comic Watchmen and thought, huh, okay, but <a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/dr-manhattan-cop-watchmen-frantz-fanon/\">what if instead we made the cops the heroes</a>? \u2013 has created a world where a group of rich, NPR-listening liberals, who bicker about gendered language and whether \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cAfrican-American\u201d is the more acceptable term, drug, abduct, and murder Trump voters for sport.

It\u2019s similar to how one segment of the population will remember the culture wars of the 1990s as a discussion about whether a crucifix of Jesus Christ submerged in urine should be considered art, and not about whether the thousands of gay people, IV drug users, hemophiliacs, and others deemed ultimately disposable by the government and society should have been allowed to die from Aids. Or as a debate about whether children should be exposed to vulgarity in music, and not about whether black people or people in poor neighborhoods should be murdered, brutalized, and harassed by the police forces that claim to protect them.</p> <p>It\u2019s not clear that anyone involved with this film has ever even been to the south. The star, Betty Gilpin, plays a working-class woman named Crystal who spends the entirety of the film holding her jaw as if she is trying not to let any spit from the chewing tobacco dribble out, and yet at no time does she partake in chewing tobacco. It\u2019s like she saw a picture of someone once and thought, Oh, that must be how they do it down there, but no one explained to her it\u2019s not just that all southerners have a severe underbite. But then no one involved in the production thought it might be weird for the action of the film to play out in Croatia, a country still dealing with the aftermath of its own \u2026 uh, let\u2019s call it political polarity and divisiveness, I guess.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure the millionaires who endorsed billionaire Mike Bloomberg in the Democratic primaries will watch this movie on their private jets and have a good chuckle at the depiction of clueless and out-of-touch elites heading to Croatia on their private plane with a cargo full of white trash. \u201cOh my God, that\u2019s so us! I also enjoy a little caviar snack while on my way to my private manor in the Balkans.\u201d And then they\u2019ll go back to deciding which underprivileged group should receive their charity this month \u2013 instead of just paying their taxes, which could fund an adequate public healthcare system that would keep people from having to beg online to afford chemotherapy.</p> <p>Cinemas across the US are currently closing because of coronavirus; perhaps only the elites who can afford private screenings of The Hunt in their palatial estates will be able to see it. In the meantime, the rest of us are about to go on quarantine lockdown, forced to sustain ourselves on whatever mediocre bilge Netflix has put out this week. I think that\u2019s a metaphor.

But then no one involved in the production thought it might be weird for the action of the film to play out in Croatia, a country still dealing with the aftermath of its own \u2026 uh, let\u2019s call it political polarity and divisiveness, I guess. I\u2019m sure the millionaires who endorsed billionaire Mike Bloomberg in the Democratic primaries will watch this movie on their private jets and have a good chuckle at the depiction of clueless and out-of-touch elites heading to Croatia on their private plane with a cargo full of white trash. \u201cOh my God, that\u2019s so us! I also enjoy a little caviar snack while on my way to my private manor in the Balkans.\u201d And then they\u2019ll go back to deciding which underprivileged group should receive their charity this month \u2013 instead of just paying their taxes, which could fund an adequate public healthcare system that would keep people from having to beg online to afford chemotherapy. Cinemas across the US are currently closing because of coronavirus; perhaps only the elites who can afford private screenings of The Hunt in their palatial estates will be able to see it. In the meantime, the rest of us are about to go on quarantine lockdown, forced to sustain ourselves on whatever mediocre bilge Netflix has put out this week. I think that\u2019s a metaphor.

      "body": "<p>Briefly there was the possibility England\u2019s cricketers may provide a semblance of normality given Sri Lanka has so far managed to avoid having many coronavirus cases. In such extraordinary times there just might have been the reassurance of waking up in the morning to news of an England batting collapse on foreign soil and everyone could conclude that all was well with the world. Life was going on as usual. But on Friday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/england-cricket-tour-of-sri-lanka-called-off-due-to-coronavirus\" title=\"\">cricket bowed to the inevitable</a>.</p> <p>Covid-19 has caused an upheaval to the schedules in a manner way beyond anything the terrorists have ever managed. England, following the lead of their rugby team at the height of the troubles in Ireland (\u201cWe may not be very good but at least we turn up,\u201d said the captain, John Pullin, at the post-match dinner in Dublin in 1972 after England had been soundly beaten), have often brazened it out when tours have been under threat. In India in 1984\u201185 they stayed on despite the civil unrest following the assassination of Indira Gandhi; they travelled \u2013 well, most of them did \u2013 to India in 2001 and 2008 when there were security concerns, and also to Bangladesh in 2016.</p> <p>But the current threat is beyond the realm of Reg Dickson, the England and Wales Cricket Board\u2019s cheerfully ubiquitous security officer. Like all of us the players must have been concerned they were now in uncharted territory. Sri Lanka is almost virus-free but the yearning to be alongside one\u2019s family in such uncertain times is easy to understand. Moreover, the notion of playing in front of empty stadiums (even though that already happens too often in Test cricket, especially when England are not involved) is unpalatable. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/14/joe-root-says-england-players-minds-were-elsewhere-over-coronavirus\">Joe Root says England players\u2019 minds were elsewhere over coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>We are all losers here. Sri Lanka is a wonderful place to tour and in different circumstances there would have been thousands of England supporters there to enjoy the cricket and add to the atmosphere. Among the players, Matt Parkinson probably deserves more sympathy than any of the others. On his third tour of the winter there was just a chance that he would make his Test debut in Galle, where the ball always turns. But will there ever be another chance for him?

      "bodyText": "Briefly there was the possibility England\u2019s cricketers may provide a semblance of normality given Sri Lanka has so far managed to avoid having many coronavirus cases. In such extraordinary times there just might have been the reassurance of waking up in the morning to news of an England batting collapse on foreign soil and everyone could conclude that all was well with the world. Life was going on as usual. But on Friday cricket bowed to the inevitable. Covid-19 has caused an upheaval to the schedules in a manner way beyond anything the terrorists have ever managed. England, following the lead of their rugby team at the height of the troubles in Ireland (\u201cWe may not be very good but at least we turn up,\u201d said the captain, John Pullin, at the post-match dinner in Dublin in 1972 after England had been soundly beaten), have often brazened it out when tours have been under threat. In India in 1984\u201185 they stayed on despite the civil unrest following the assassination of Indira Gandhi; they travelled \u2013 well, most of them did \u2013 to India in 2001 and 2008 when there were security concerns, and also to Bangladesh in 2016. But the current threat is beyond the realm of Reg Dickson, the England and Wales Cricket Board\u2019s cheerfully ubiquitous security officer. Like all of us the players must have been concerned they were now in uncharted territory. Sri Lanka is almost virus-free but the yearning to be alongside one\u2019s family in such uncertain times is easy to understand. Moreover, the notion of playing in front of empty stadiums (even though that already happens too often in Test cricket, especially when England are not involved) is unpalatable. We are all losers here. Sri Lanka is a wonderful place to tour and in different circumstances there would have been thousands of England supporters there to enjoy the cricket and add to the atmosphere. Among the players, Matt Parkinson probably deserves more sympathy than any of the others. On his third tour of the winter there was just a chance that he would make his Test debut in Galle, where the ball always turns. But will there ever be another chance for him? Not next summer for a variety of reasons; just possibly next winter in India or indeed in Sri Lanka if the postponed tour is somehow rescheduled in between England\u2019s already taxing commitments. Will he have to bounce grandchildren on his knee and explain to them wistfully the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic for his career? Like every other sphere of life the immediate future of the game is shrouded with uncertainty, which may have been reflected by the words of Tom Harrison, the chief executive of the ECB. \u201cOur main priorities are to ensure we scope out the landscape for financial, logistical and scheduling implications.\u201d That landscape is starting to look barren.

We\u2019ve been looking and we can\u2019t afford them and the places we can afford are so awful, we and our children would not want us to go there.\u201d</p> <p>In a state with sky-high rents, more than are willing to admit teeter on the edge of housing insecurity. Self-quarantine without the option to work from home, or getting sick without paid sick leave could mean not being able to pay the bills. Fewer work shifts because no one is going out to eat, or a cancelled gig because the governor recommended postponing large gatherings could mean not being able to make rent. \u201cSo many of us are just one or two paychecks away from not being able to afford one of our basic needs, which is housing,\u201d said Lupe Arreola, the executive director of Tenants Together.</p> <p>In a state with 17m renters, more than 55% are cost-burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on rent.

London Breed, the San Francisco mayor, issued a moratorium on Friday, and and Oakland is working on a similar measure as well.</p> <p>\u201cThe impact of this is far and far-reaching,\u201d said the San Francisco lawmaker Dean Preston, who introduced the legislation there. \u201cThere\u2019s lost income for a lot of folks. There are direct health impacts. There\u2019s cancellation of events, there are folks who are small business owners who are struggling to stay afloat. Everyone is trying to make sure the impact of that is mitigated.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/california-coronavirus-homeless-communities\">'We're not prepared': coronavirus could devastate homeless communities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Though Merika Reagan considers herself lucky so far in terms of coronavirus-related cancellations, the panic and uncertainty is palpable on the pet care worker networks and message boards that she frequents.</p> <p>Dog walkers are posting about their walks getting cancelled because their clients are working from home now. Pet sitters are losing jobs because their clients will no longer travel \u2013 Reagan, the owner of City Hikes Dog Walking and Pet Sitting, has had two cancellations and a third job fall through for this reason.</p> <p>She thinks herself lucky, but when she tallied up her losses, she realized she missed out on half a month\u2019s rent.

They thought that maybe another company that specialized in assisted living would take over, but in January, they received eviction notices from the building\u2019s owner \u2013 around the time coronavirus began to spread in China.</p> <p>There were 83 of them originally, and some left, forced to move farther away from their doctors and their families. Now 12 remain, with the cloud of coronavirus hanging overhead. \u201cThe virus makes it much more difficult for us,\u201d Angell said. \u201cEverybody has been talking about the fact that even to go to look at a new place, if we got on paratransit and come back, it\u2019s all risky.\u201d</p> <p>She and the other seniors are determined to stay until the end. They hope that the governor or the building\u2019s owner will let them stay, at least until they\u2019re out of danger of exposure.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no place like this nearby at this price or at this quality,\u201d Angell said. \u201cThey\u2019re putting us out on the streets.\u201d</p>",

We\u2019re the ones that coronavirus is hitting the hardest, and here we are, being forced out on to the streets with no place to go.\u201d When a global pandemic hits a state already gripped by a housing affordability crisis, the impact is both devastating and far-reaching. Those on the margins bear the brunt the hardest, forced to venture out to fight for their housing when public health warnings are discouraging people from social contact. \u201cWe\u2019re caught between anxiety and terror,\u201d Angell said. \u201cSome of us don\u2019t have places to go. We\u2019ve been looking and we can\u2019t afford them and the places we can afford are so awful, we and our children would not want us to go there.\u201d In a state with sky-high rents, more than are willing to admit teeter on the edge of housing insecurity. Self-quarantine without the option to work from home, or getting sick without paid sick leave could mean not being able to pay the bills. Fewer work shifts because no one is going out to eat, or a cancelled gig because the governor recommended postponing large gatherings could mean not being able to make rent. \u201cSo many of us are just one or two paychecks away from not being able to afford one of our basic needs, which is housing,\u201d said Lupe Arreola, the executive director of Tenants Together. In a state with 17m renters, more than 55% are cost-burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on rent. Arreola said she\u2019s concerned that many more will end up homeless in California because of coronavirus \u2013 and before the outbreak is under control. \u201cBeing evicted is horrible, but being evicted during a global health crisis and during an affordability crisis is the making of a societal disaster that will further complicate being able to have positive public health outcomes,\u201d she said. The concern over the intersection of the coronavirus crisis and the housing crisis is enough that Sam Liccardo, the San Jose mayor, issued an eviction moratorium for people whose wages have been affected by coronavirus-related closures and cancellations. London Breed, the San Francisco mayor, issued a moratorium on Friday, and and Oakland is working on a similar measure as well. \u201cThe impact of this is far and far-reaching,\u201d said the San Francisco lawmaker Dean Preston, who introduced the legislation there. \u201cThere\u2019s lost income for a lot of folks. There are direct health impacts. There\u2019s cancellation of events, there are folks who are small business owners who are struggling to stay afloat. Everyone is trying to make sure the impact of that is mitigated.\u201d Though Merika Reagan considers herself lucky so far in terms of coronavirus-related cancellations, the panic and uncertainty is palpable on the pet care worker networks and message boards that she frequents. Dog walkers are posting about their walks getting cancelled because their clients are working from home now. Pet sitters are losing jobs because their clients will no longer travel \u2013 Reagan, the owner of City Hikes Dog Walking and Pet Sitting, has had two cancellations and a third job fall through for this reason. She thinks herself lucky, but when she tallied up her losses, she realized she missed out on half a month\u2019s rent. Her $2,250-a-month housing cost is always a concern for her. But she\u2019s pragmatically optimistic when it comes to the coronavirus crisis \u2013 if she loses more vacationers, she\u2019ll make up the work elsewhere. \u201cI\u2019ll have to take on more walking clients, maybe two or three more, which will be murder on my ankles,\u201d Reagan said. But if she gets sick? \u201cI don\u2019t get sick,\u201d she said. \u201cMy plan is to never get sick. That\u2019s my plan. It sounds crazy, but that\u2019s my plan.\u201d \u201cIn this business, if you don\u2019t work you don\u2019t get paid,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not like you get paid time off.\u201d Local lawmakers and tenant advocates hope that measures like an eviction moratorium can help ease the minds of workers like Reagan. \u201cNo one should have to choose between their housing and their health,\u201d Arreola said. But besides being the ethical choice, prohibiting evictions is strategic in curbing the spread of the virus, Preston said. \u201cOne of the primary ways to prevent the spread of coronavirus is for folks to stay in their homes and if folks don\u2019t have a home to go to, that\u2019s impossible,\u201d he said. That\u2019s why Angell and the seniors at Brookdale San Pablo are petitioning California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, to issue a moratorium on all evictions, coronavirus-related or otherwise, until the crisis passes. The seniors at Brookdale San Pablo were alerted at the end of November that Brookdale, a national senior-living company, was not renewing its lease. They thought that maybe another company that specialized in assisted living would take over, but in January, they received eviction notices from the building\u2019s owner \u2013 around the time coronavirus began to spread in China. There were 83 of them originally, and some left, forced to move farther away from their doctors and their families. Now 12 remain, with the cloud of coronavirus hanging overhead. \u201cThe virus makes it much more difficult for us,\u201d Angell said. \u201cEverybody has been talking about the fact that even to go to look at a new place, if we got on paratransit and come back, it\u2019s all risky.\u201d She and the other seniors are determined to stay until the end. They hope that the governor or the building\u2019s owner will let them stay, at least until they\u2019re out of danger of exposure. \u201cThere is no place like this nearby at this price or at this quality,\u201d Angell said. \u201cThey\u2019re putting us out on the streets.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Since the whole of Italy was put in quarantine last Monday, it has been surreal here in the northern city of Parma. When you wander around the alleys and squares, you begin to feel like the protagonist of a post-apocalyptic film, constantly asking yourself, \u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d</p> <p>If you do see a solitary human, their reaction is diffidence, if not alarm: they adjust their face mask and move away. The habitual warmth of Italians has been replaced by self-preserving coolness. A very touchy-feely country is now obsessed by personal space.</p> <p>That eerie sense of living in the end times only increases when you watch the news. <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/inmates-die-prison-riots-coronavirus-rules-italy-200309125813658.html\" title=\"\">Prison riots erupted</a> across the country last week. There was a mass<a href=\"https://www.thelocal.it/20200311/police-hunt-escaped-prisoners-in-southern-italy-after-prison-riots\" title=\"\"> break-out in Foggia</a> (six inmates are still at large). At Milan\u2019s San Vittore prison, black smoke was seen gushing from the windows, and seven inmates died in violence in Modena. The police patrols and blockades only make things feel more ominous.</p> <p>Free movement within a borderless Europe already seems like a distant memory: there were 90km queues on the Brenner pass (into Austria) last week, and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-slovenia/slovenia-closes-some-italy-border-crossings-performs-coronavirus-checks-at-others-idUSKBN20Y1KO\" title=\"\">Slovenia has blocked</a><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-slovenia/slovenia-closes-some-italy-border-crossings-performs-coronavirus-checks-at-others-idUSKBN20Y1KO\" title=\"\"> its roads</a> with Italy. It is understandable that Italy, the country with the highest rate of coronavirus infections outside China, should be isolated, but to Italians it feels as if the country is being left to rot. Italy has received more <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/coronavirus-china-sends-medical-aid-to-spain-and-italy\" title=\"\">aid from China</a> than from the US or the EU.</p> <p>Every day the numbers of Italy\u2019s infections and deaths leap by 20% or 30%. Parma is in the Emilia-Romagna region, where so far more than 2,000 people have tested positive and more than 200 have died. In the province of Parma there have been more than 518 cases. One of those, Giovanna, is a close family friend. It feels as if the darkness just keeps getting closer.</p> <p>The intensive care units are now all full. Hospital wards are spilling out into corridors, tents, car parks, gardens and commercial warehouses. We are hearing words \u2013 like \u201ctriage\u201d \u2013 which are usually associated with warfare. Medics and nurses are having to make decisions on which patients to prioritise. Some doctors have died, and others have compared the numbers of admissions to dealing with \u201can earthquake every day\u201d.</p> <p>Part of the weirdness comes from that fact that you can\u2019t go anywhere. Museums, gyms, schools, cinemas and libraries are all closed. Your instinct is to hunker down with the wider family, but all the advice is to stay away from the older generation, who are the most vulnerable to infection. You can\u2019t gather round those who, like Giovanna, are ill. Not even her ailing husband is allowed close to her. You can\u2019t go to church because they, too, are now closed. I would like to head to my mother-in-law\u2019s house in the hills, but we\u2019re not allowed out of the city.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ba4938a6afbad6dd01157295205db94b42973371\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba4938a6afbad6dd01157295205db94b42973371/0_70_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Duomo and Battistero in Parma illuminated at dusk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Duomo and Battistero in Parma illuminated at dusk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s amazing how quickly you become used to new habits: not getting in the lift with other people or standing well apart in a queue (normally we\u2019re bunched tight to foil the queue-bargers). When you ask a shopkeeper for a loaf of bread, they put it on the counter then step away. You pick it up, pay and step away. They put your change out and move back as you move forward. You feel like repelling magnets.</p> <p>Some friends are fretful, washing their hands every half-hour or putting on surgical gloves to open doors. It\u2019s hard not to begin to doubt your own sanity and wonder whether it\u2019s rational to be following all these restrictions and rituals.</p> <p>Then, last Wednesday night, another emergency decree ramped up the restrictions: all shops, except chemists and food stores, were <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-51845817\" title=\"\">ordered to remain closed</a>. If you want to leave the house, you now have to print off a document to explain to police your timing, destination and motive.</p> <p>In some ways it feels a little as you might imagine the Middle Ages. It\u2019s as if we\u2019re inside a city with metaphorical walls where rumours abound: that a friend, Marco, has a rasping cough; that politician Silvio Berlusconi has tested positive; that our kids will have to attend school throughout Italy\u2019s baking summer. And Parma feels medieval because it is so quiet. I\u2019ve never known it so safe to cycle around an Italian city. It\u2019s as if the cars, as well as the humans, are keeping their distance.</p> <p>So everything feels softer somehow. I never knew there was someone in the next block of flats who played the guitar. You can hear them strumming late at night. The natural world \u2013 all the turtle doves and cherry blossom \u2013 seems brighter or emboldened. That quietness extends to the football. Watching Juventus v Inter Milan the other night (before Serie A, too, was suspended) you could hear, in the absence of the crowds, almost everything from the actual game: the laces on leather, the players\u2019 groans, shouts and insults. It made them seem mortal, like Sunday league players. Now, of course, several players \u2013 Juventus\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51844945\" title=\"\">Daniele Rugani</a> and the former Southampton (now Sampdoria) striker <a href=\"https://www.goal.com/en/news/coronavirus-sampdoria-forward-gabbiadini-becomes-second/v6yah8i6ugmx19m85rxpj6en1\" title=\"\">Manolo Gabbiadini</a> \u2013 have tested positive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"11b17e502f2e0ef82bf59df612e5d3958bae7f9b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11b17e502f2e0ef82bf59df612e5d3958bae7f9b/0_0_3072_1844/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Players from Parma vs Spal line up in an empty stadium\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Players from Parma vs Spal prepare to play without spectators in early March, before Serie A was suspended.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elisabetta Baracchi/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s intriguing is that all the adjectives you might normally use to describe Italy (sociable, excitable, chaotic, undisciplined, polemical, fun and \u2013 despite all its troubles \u2013 somehow optimistic) have become redundant. It feels completely the opposite: isolated, calm, orderly, obedient, cowed, dour and pessimistic. It\u2019s as if the country has suddenly discovered a different, maybe deeper, side. It\u2019s a sterner, more serious place.</p> <p>It\u2019s sombre, of course, because there have now been more than 1,200 deaths from Covid-19 in Italy. There\u2019s bafflement at the fact that the mortality rate here is (at time of writing) 7.17% compared with 0.05% in Sweden and 0.2% in Germany. We don\u2019t understand why we\u2019ve got it so bad, whether it\u2019s related to hospital capacity, superbugs, a very aged population, a high proportion of smokers or something else entirely. Nor do we understand why the contagion has spread so fast in Italy: the cases per million of the population is, at 250, far higher than anywhere else in the world: Iran stands at 120, China at 56.</p> <p>There are also well-founded fears about the Italian economy, which was in deep trouble even before this crisis. The Milan stock market plunged 11% last Monday, then plummeted another 17% on the Thursday. With shops and businesses at a standstill, the government has promised a <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/italy-plans-debt-moratorium-to-cope-with-coronavirus-lockdown-11583849663\" title=\"\">moratorium on mortgage payments</a>, childcare vouchers for working parents and a suspension of tax payments. The costs of unemployment benefit (the country\u2019s <em>cassa integrazione</em>) is likely to spike. Those measures will cost the treasury an estimated \u20ac25bn.</p> <p>The trouble is that the cupboard is bare. If banks are not receiving mortgage repayments, nor the government its usual tax revenue in spite of soaring expenditure, there will suddenly be a liquidity crisis. The ruthless markets know that: the yields on Italy\u2019s 10-year bonds (a clear indication of the cost of government borrowing) rose more in one day last week than ever before \u2013 50 basis points. Shares in some of Italy\u2019s biggest banks \u2013 Intesa and Unicredit \u2013 saw double-digit falls. Hence the fury in Italy when the European Central Bank <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11ab8f84-6452-11ea-b3f3-fe4680ea68b5\" title=\"\">offered no assistance</a> to the country. The response from Italy\u2019s president, Sergio Mattarella, was close to institutional incandescence. \u201cWe need solidarity, not impediments to our actions,\u201d he seethed.</p> <p>Many of us feel deeply melancholic at the suffering Italy is going through. For all my frustrations with this country, I\u2019m an Italian patriot, obsessed by the underdog heroics of the Risorgimento in the mid-late 19th century, when Giuseppe Garibaldi\u2019s guerrillas fought for Italian reunification against the European super-powers. When they were younger, my kids used to salute Garibaldi every time they passed his statue in Parma\u2019s main square, and I would repeat my favourite Garibaldi line: \u201cItaly will never be wholly without sons [and daughters, I added] who can astound the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"acbdc16c9f52e392b79e3ce23a9d968b76225752\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acbdc16c9f52e392b79e3ce23a9d968b76225752/0_319_5130_3078/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The statue of Garibaldi in Parma\u2019s main square.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The statue of Garibaldi in Parma\u2019s main square.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So I, too, felt offended at the latest international media coverage. There was a discernible glee in some quarters that the \u201csilly Eye-ties\u201d had messed things up again. \u201cThey\u2019ll never follow the rules,\u201d said some.</p> <p>Prejudices about Italy \u2013 assuming that problem was the country itself, and not coronavirus \u2013 meant that few people abroad took note when, for weeks, Italian leaders, epidemiologists and journalists urged similarly decisive action across Europe. Even as this slow-motion, medical tsunami was moving towards the UK, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, was sneering at the need for \u201cdraconian\u201d measures. We watched in disbelief as thousands of people travelled to watch horse racing in Cheltenham and 3,500 gathered in Paris dressed as smurfs just to break a world record.</p> <p>From our lockdown in Italy, it seemed at that time as if the world\u2019s addiction to sport, partying and frivolity was blinding it to the most serious pandemic in our lifetimes.</p> <p>Because actually Italians are very well-informed (some might even say obsessive) about personal health. They learn about plague and contagion at school because two of the classics of Italy\u2019s literary canon \u2013 Alessandro Manzoni\u2019s <em>The Betrothed</em> and Giovanni Boccaccio\u2019s <em>The Decameron</em>, deal with precisely those themes. Italians, on the whole, know far more about hygiene and medicine than their European counterparts. Now that so many other countries are following Italy\u2019s lead \u2013 closing schools, universities and sports events \u2013 we feel, at least, somewhat vindicated.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the five of us are all holed up at home. This is the third week our kids have not been to school with, at least, another three to go. They are sent homework by their teachers through the school websites. There are endless technical hitches and there\u2019s barely enough work to fill a morning. Benedetta attends her ballet school online, using a chair as the bar and dancing around her (neither tidy nor spacious) bedroom.</p> <p>We\u2019re fortunate that we all get along and that Francesca and I both work flexibly or from home. But some families, and couples, are really struggling with being cooped up, and as well as a spike in birth rates later this year, one suspects divorce rates may also rise.</p> <p>Even for us, this forced time together is subtly shifting the way we all rub along and who does what. With their usual, frenetic hobbies cancelled, the children have a lot of spare time, so we\u2019re shamelessly giving them domestic chores.

      "bodyText": "Since the whole of Italy was put in quarantine last Monday, it has been surreal here in the northern city of Parma. When you wander around the alleys and squares, you begin to feel like the protagonist of a post-apocalyptic film, constantly asking yourself, \u201cWhere is everyone?\u201d If you do see a solitary human, their reaction is diffidence, if not alarm: they adjust their face mask and move away. The habitual warmth of Italians has been replaced by self-preserving coolness. A very touchy-feely country is now obsessed by personal space. That eerie sense of living in the end times only increases when you watch the news. Prison riots erupted across the country last week. There was a mass break-out in Foggia (six inmates are still at large). At Milan\u2019s San Vittore prison, black smoke was seen gushing from the windows, and seven inmates died in violence in Modena. The police patrols and blockades only make things feel more ominous. Free movement within a borderless Europe already seems like a distant memory: there were 90km queues on the Brenner pass (into Austria) last week, and Slovenia has blocked its roads with Italy. It is understandable that Italy, the country with the highest rate of coronavirus infections outside China, should be isolated, but to Italians it feels as if the country is being left to rot. Italy has received more aid from China than from the US or the EU. Every day the numbers of Italy\u2019s infections and deaths leap by 20% or 30%. Parma is in the Emilia-Romagna region, where so far more than 2,000 people have tested positive and more than 200 have died. In the province of Parma there have been more than 518 cases. One of those, Giovanna, is a close family friend. It feels as if the darkness just keeps getting closer. The intensive care units are now all full. Hospital wards are spilling out into corridors, tents, car parks, gardens and commercial warehouses. We are hearing words \u2013 like \u201ctriage\u201d \u2013 which are usually associated with warfare. Medics and nurses are having to make decisions on which patients to prioritise. Some doctors have died, and others have compared the numbers of admissions to dealing with \u201can earthquake every day\u201d. Part of the weirdness comes from that fact that you can\u2019t go anywhere. Museums, gyms, schools, cinemas and libraries are all closed. Your instinct is to hunker down with the wider family, but all the advice is to stay away from the older generation, who are the most vulnerable to infection. You can\u2019t gather round those who, like Giovanna, are ill. Not even her ailing husband is allowed close to her. You can\u2019t go to church because they, too, are now closed. I would like to head to my mother-in-law\u2019s house in the hills, but we\u2019re not allowed out of the city. It\u2019s amazing how quickly you become used to new habits: not getting in the lift with other people or standing well apart in a queue (normally we\u2019re bunched tight to foil the queue-bargers). When you ask a shopkeeper for a loaf of bread, they put it on the counter then step away. You pick it up, pay and step away. They put your change out and move back as you move forward. You feel like repelling magnets. Some friends are fretful, washing their hands every half-hour or putting on surgical gloves to open doors. It\u2019s hard not to begin to doubt your own sanity and wonder whether it\u2019s rational to be following all these restrictions and rituals. Then, last Wednesday night, another emergency decree ramped up the restrictions: all shops, except chemists and food stores, were ordered to remain closed. If you want to leave the house, you now have to print off a document to explain to police your timing, destination and motive. In some ways it feels a little as you might imagine the Middle Ages. It\u2019s as if we\u2019re inside a city with metaphorical walls where rumours abound: that a friend, Marco, has a rasping cough; that politician Silvio Berlusconi has tested positive; that our kids will have to attend school throughout Italy\u2019s baking summer. And Parma feels medieval because it is so quiet. I\u2019ve never known it so safe to cycle around an Italian city. It\u2019s as if the cars, as well as the humans, are keeping their distance. So everything feels softer somehow. I never knew there was someone in the next block of flats who played the guitar. You can hear them strumming late at night. The natural world \u2013 all the turtle doves and cherry blossom \u2013 seems brighter or emboldened. That quietness extends to the football. Watching Juventus v Inter Milan the other night (before Serie A, too, was suspended) you could hear, in the absence of the crowds, almost everything from the actual game: the laces on leather, the players\u2019 groans, shouts and insults. It made them seem mortal, like Sunday league players. Now, of course, several players \u2013 Juventus\u2019s Daniele Rugani and the former Southampton (now Sampdoria) striker Manolo Gabbiadini \u2013 have tested positive. What\u2019s intriguing is that all the adjectives you might normally use to describe Italy (sociable, excitable, chaotic, undisciplined, polemical, fun and \u2013 despite all its troubles \u2013 somehow optimistic) have become redundant. It feels completely the opposite: isolated, calm, orderly, obedient, cowed, dour and pessimistic. It\u2019s as if the country has suddenly discovered a different, maybe deeper, side. It\u2019s a sterner, more serious place. It\u2019s sombre, of course, because there have now been more than 1,200 deaths from Covid-19 in Italy. There\u2019s bafflement at the fact that the mortality rate here is (at time of writing) 7.17% compared with 0.05% in Sweden and 0.2% in Germany. We don\u2019t understand why we\u2019ve got it so bad, whether it\u2019s related to hospital capacity, superbugs, a very aged population, a high proportion of smokers or something else entirely. Nor do we understand why the contagion has spread so fast in Italy: the cases per million of the population is, at 250, far higher than anywhere else in the world: Iran stands at 120, China at 56. There are also well-founded fears about the Italian economy, which was in deep trouble even before this crisis. The Milan stock market plunged 11% last Monday, then plummeted another 17% on the Thursday. With shops and businesses at a standstill, the government has promised a moratorium on mortgage payments, childcare vouchers for working parents and a suspension of tax payments. The costs of unemployment benefit (the country\u2019s cassa integrazione) is likely to spike. Those measures will cost the treasury an estimated \u20ac25bn. The trouble is that the cupboard is bare. If banks are not receiving mortgage repayments, nor the government its usual tax revenue in spite of soaring expenditure, there will suddenly be a liquidity crisis. The ruthless markets know that: the yields on Italy\u2019s 10-year bonds (a clear indication of the cost of government borrowing) rose more in one day last week than ever before \u2013 50 basis points. Shares in some of Italy\u2019s biggest banks \u2013 Intesa and Unicredit \u2013 saw double-digit falls. Hence the fury in Italy when the European Central Bank offered no assistance to the country. The response from Italy\u2019s president, Sergio Mattarella, was close to institutional incandescence. \u201cWe need solidarity, not impediments to our actions,\u201d he seethed. Many of us feel deeply melancholic at the suffering Italy is going through. For all my frustrations with this country, I\u2019m an Italian patriot, obsessed by the underdog heroics of the Risorgimento in the mid-late 19th century, when Giuseppe Garibaldi\u2019s guerrillas fought for Italian reunification against the European super-powers. When they were younger, my kids used to salute Garibaldi every time they passed his statue in Parma\u2019s main square, and I would repeat my favourite Garibaldi line: \u201cItaly will never be wholly without sons [and daughters, I added] who can astound the world.\u201d So I, too, felt offended at the latest international media coverage. There was a discernible glee in some quarters that the \u201csilly Eye-ties\u201d had messed things up again. \u201cThey\u2019ll never follow the rules,\u201d said some. Prejudices about Italy \u2013 assuming that problem was the country itself, and not coronavirus \u2013 meant that few people abroad took note when, for weeks, Italian leaders, epidemiologists and journalists urged similarly decisive action across Europe. Even as this slow-motion, medical tsunami was moving towards the UK, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, was sneering at the need for \u201cdraconian\u201d measures. We watched in disbelief as thousands of people travelled to watch horse racing in Cheltenham and 3,500 gathered in Paris dressed as smurfs just to break a world record. From our lockdown in Italy, it seemed at that time as if the world\u2019s addiction to sport, partying and frivolity was blinding it to the most serious pandemic in our lifetimes. Because actually Italians are very well-informed (some might even say obsessive) about personal health. They learn about plague and contagion at school because two of the classics of Italy\u2019s literary canon \u2013 Alessandro Manzoni\u2019s The Betrothed and Giovanni Boccaccio\u2019s The Decameron, deal with precisely those themes. Italians, on the whole, know far more about hygiene and medicine than their European counterparts. Now that so many other countries are following Italy\u2019s lead \u2013 closing schools, universities and sports events \u2013 we feel, at least, somewhat vindicated. Meanwhile, the five of us are all holed up at home. This is the third week our kids have not been to school with, at least, another three to go. They are sent homework by their teachers through the school websites. There are endless technical hitches and there\u2019s barely enough work to fill a morning. Benedetta attends her ballet school online, using a chair as the bar and dancing around her (neither tidy nor spacious) bedroom. We\u2019re fortunate that we all get along and that Francesca and I both work flexibly or from home. But some families, and couples, are really struggling with being cooped up, and as well as a spike in birth rates later this year, one suspects divorce rates may also rise. Even for us, this forced time together is subtly shifting the way we all rub along and who does what. With their usual, frenetic hobbies cancelled, the children have a lot of spare time, so we\u2019re shamelessly giving them domestic chores. They\u2019re cleaning the fridge and the windows, mopping the floors and hanging out laundry. I\u2019m also setting them daily challenges with a didactic dad\u2019s earnestness: if they want to watch TV they have to learn the Nato phonetic alphabet (three passes), the names and dates of the Plantagenet monarchs (two passes), how to tie knots (three passes) or a Shakespeare soliloquy (only one pass). I\u2019m learning quite a lot myself. But you do wonder what\u2019s going through their minds. Quite apart from the fear, they\u2019re dealing with disappointments which, at their age, must seem huge. Benedetta had won, along with her dance troupe, an international ballet competition, the prize for which was to dance in New York in April. That won\u2019t now happen. Emma, Mozart-obsessed, was due to go with her grandmother to the opera house in Giuseppe Verdi\u2019s birthplace, Busseto, to see The Marriage of Figaro. That, too, has been cancelled. She has started playing melancholic Chopin instead of playful Mozart. Leonardo, like me, just longs to be able to play football again. In our manic matches of indoor one-aside, we\u2019ve accidentally pruned the Victoria spiderworts and smashed the odd lightbulb. They\u2019re finding new passions too. They love playing euchre and blackjack, betting with matchsticks. Leo is teaching himself Spanish and now calls me el padre or hombre. Benedetta is sewing, she says from behind her bedroom door, a suit jacket. Emma is pretending to get fit. It\u2019s all fairly wholesome in a Waltons kind of way.

Up until a month ago this seemed far-fetched. It was assumed that the coronavirus outbreak would be a localised problem for China and that any spillover effects to the rest of the world could be comfortably managed by a bit of policy easing by central banks. When it became clear that Covid-19 was not confined to China and that the economic effects would be more widespread, forecasts started to be revised down. But central banks, finance ministries and independent economists took comfort from the fact that there would be a sharp but short hit to activity followed by a rapid return to business as usual. This line of thinking has exact parallels with the events of 2007, when it was initially assumed that the subprime mortgage crisis was a minor and manageable problem affecting only the US \u2013 and nobody needs reminding how that ended. If history is any guide, the global economy will eventually recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, but the idea that this is going to be a V-shaped recession in the first half of 2020 followed by a recovery in the second half of the year looks absurd after the tumultuous events of the past week. What\u2019s more, policymakers know as much. The Federal Reserve \u2013 the US central bank \u2013 did not need to be told by Donald Trump that it needed to cut interest rates and resume large-scale asset purchases known as quantitative easing. The world\u2019s most powerful central bank pulled out the stops on Sunday night by slashing rates to nearly zero and pledging to expand its balance sheet by $700bn. In the UK the coordinated response by the Bank of England and the Treasury last week was seen as a textbook example of how policymakers ought to respond to the crisis. It was, though, only the start. Airline companies will quickly go bust unless they receive financial assistance. The same goes for retailers, many of them hanging on by their fingertips even before Covid-19.

So, in the coming weeks the Bank can be expected to cut interest rates to 0.1% \u2013 the lowest they have ever been \u2013 and to resume its QE programme. Sunak will have to add to the \u00a312bn he has set aside to deal with Covid-19. As in 2008-09, the authorities in the eurozone have been slowest to act but there have been welcome signs in recent days \u2013 from Germany, most significantly \u2013 of the need for governments to spend, and spend big.

A large proportion of the population is at lower risk of developing severe disease: roughly speaking anyone up to the age of 40. So the reasoning goes that even though in a perfect world we\u2019d not want anyone to take the risk of infection, generating immunity in younger people is a way of protecting the population as a whole.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"04fecb04-934a-4af1-baee-358948ad8ba5\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0hG3V9378fg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>We talk about vaccines generating herd immunity, so why is this different? Because this is not a vaccine. This is an actual pandemic that will make a very large number of people sick, and some of them will die. Even though the mortality rate is likely quite low, a small fraction of a very large number is still a large number. And the mortality rate will climb when the NHS is overwhelmed. This would be expected to happen, even if we make the generous assumption that the government were entirely successful in restricting the virus to the low-risk population, at the peak of the outbreak the numbers requiring critical care would be greater than the number of beds available. This is made worse by the fact that people who are badly ill tend to remain so for a long time, which increases the burden.</p> \n<p>And of course you can\u2019t restrict it to this age group. Think of all the people aged between 20 and 40 who work in healthcare, or old people\u2019s homes. You don\u2019t need many introductions into settings like these for what we might coyly call \u201csevere outcomes\u201d. In Washington State, nearly all the deaths reported so far have been associated with nursing homes. Is everyone in a high-risk group supposed to withdraw themselves from society for six months until they can emerge once the (so far entirely imaginary) second wave has been averted?</p> \n<p>About that second wave: let me be clear. Second waves are real things, and we have seen them in flu pandemics. This is not a flu pandemic. Flu rules do not apply. There might well be a second wave, I honestly don\u2019t know. But vulnerable people should not be exposed to a virus right now in the service of a hypothetical future.</p> \n<p>Keeping people safe means self-isolation if you develop symptoms, but the official advice here is also misleading. While it is of paramount importance that sick people stay at home to avoid infecting others, it is increasingly clear that transmission can occur before symptoms develop. We know this is true from modelling and observational studies. I have seen it happen myself. We do not know how often it occurs or how important it is in the epidemiology, but it definitely does happen.</p> \n<p>However, arguments about the case fatality rate, the transmission parameters and presymptomatic transmission all miss the point. This virus is capable of shutting down countries. You should not want to be the next after Wuhan, Iran, Italy or Spain. In those places, the healthcare systems have broken down. In Italy, the choices of whom to save and whom to allow to die are real. You should instead look to the example of South Korea, which, through a combination of intense surveillance and social distancing, appears to have gained some semblance of control over the virus. We can learn from South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, all of which have so far done a good job mitigating the worst outcomes despite having reported cases early in the pandemic, and in the case of South Korea, suffering a substantial outbreak.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/this-coronavirus-crisis-has-forced-the-retirement-of-pantomime-johnson\">This coronavirus crisis has forced the retirement of pantomime Johnson | Andrew Rawnsley</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The UK should not be trying to create herd immunity, that will take care of itself.

Even though they knew it was coming, and could see what happened to the neighbours as they were overwhelmed with terrifying speed, the UK government has inexplicably chosen to encourage the flames, in the misguided notion that somehow they will be able to control them. When I first heard about this, I could not believe it. I research and teach the evolution and epidemiology of infectious disease at Harvard\u2019s Chan School of Public Health. My colleagues here in the US, even as they are reeling from the stumbling response of the Donald Trump administration to the crisis, assumed that reports of the UK policy were satire \u2013 an example of the wry humour for which the country is famed.

      "bodyText": "A group of Crystal Palace fans have cycled 120 miles from Selhurst Park to Bournemouth\u2019s Vitality Stadium. The plan was for them to watch the two sides meet in the Premier League but the game was called off halfway through the ride because of the coronavirus crisis. The journey was undertaken to support Palace for Life Foundation, the club\u2019s official charity that works with vulnerable young people in south London. The 28 riders, who have raised almost \u00a315,000 so far, were undeterred when they found out the game had been postponed, carrying on regardless. Anthony Wright, one of the participants, said: \u201cIt was a bit eerie arriving to an empty ground but it was worth it knowing that it was all for a good cause. It was a tough two days but it was amazing, going through the New Forest and seeing all the scenery. I\u2019m really pleased to be here. Up the Eagles!\u201d Setting off from Selhurst Park on Friday, the group cycled 80 miles on the first day, taking in the Surrey hills and ending in Winchester. The game was officially postponed just before lunchtime. Stephen Kingdom, who during a previous season cycled to every away game, said: \u201cIt was a bit different getting here and not having a game on, the last time I cycled here we won 2-0. When we heard it was off, we had a quick discussion but we all decided we\u2019d still do it and support the foundation.\u201d The final leg of the journey, 40 miles through the New Forest, was completed on Saturday, with the group arriving at Bournemouth\u2019s unusually quiet ground at lunchtime. Security staff opened the ground and allowed the riders to head pitchside, taking in the empty stands and posing for photos in the dugout. Mike Summers, the chief executive of Palace for Life, said: \u201cConsidering everything that\u2019s gone on this week, there were times we didn\u2019t think this ride was going to go ahead, but it just shows the power of the Palace fanbase; they\u2019ve all been fantastic throughout. \u201cIt was a mixed feeling arriving at the Vitality Stadium. It\u2019s empty and we\u2019re sad there\u2019s not a game but there\u2019s a great feeling of delight and camaraderie in this group.\u201d The money raised will support the foundation\u2019s work with young people who are at risk of being caught up in violent crime or antisocial behaviour. One of the programmes, Divert, was recently named Community Project of the Year at the London Football Awards and has helped 130 youngsters find work or training after being arrested. \u201cWe\u2019re working with young people who are on the edge of getting into difficulties, whether that\u2019s with crime, gangs or antisocial behaviour,\u201d said Summers. \u201cJust because the football won\u2019t be continuing for the next few weeks, our work will carry on. We\u2019ll still be supporting those young people who need us and the money we\u2019re raising here today will really help.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s biggest pub group has warned its publicans that their existing insurance policies will not cover them for loss of business because of coronavirus. Ei Group \u2013 formerly known as Enterprise Inns and which owns a portfolio of more than 4,000 pubs \u2013 has told its managers that Covid-19 is not included in the group\u2019s policy with the insurer Zurich and has advised them to consider seeking further cover elsewhere. Industry sources indicated that it appears likely the problem could be replicated in other sectors. In a letter sent to publicans last week, which has been seen by the Guardian, Ei said: \u201cIt has been confirmed that Zurich is not including Covid-19 in its notifiable diseases section. As such, any business affected by Covid-19 will not be able to claim for loss of trade.\u201d The move comes after many small-business owners had thought a problem with making insurance claims for coronavirus losses had been solved. Earlier this month, the government bowed to pressure by changing its stance on insurance to declare coronavirus as a \u201cnotifiable disease\u201d \u2013 a formal classification required by many insurance policies. However, many of these existing policies cite specific diseases that businesses can claim for. As coronavirus is so new, it is not included in most of the lists. A spokesperson for the Association of British Insurers said: \u201cA small number of businesses may have cover in place that will specifically provide for business interruption arising from notifiable diseases. However, this type of extension is not commonly included as standard. Standard business insurance policies are designed and priced to cover standard risks and are therefore unlikely to provide cover for the effects of global pandemics like Covid-19.\u201d Viv English, who runs the Lansdown Arms in Lewes, Sussex, said: \u201cWe have no Premier League games and maybe a 20% to 30% hit on trade. I have been paying into the policy for almost 20 years, it is compulsory for us to have it [as an Ei tenant] and it is going to let us down just when we need it. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take a real hit and I already know I can\u2019t pay my VAT bill. We are now paying VAT [due from] December when it was Christmas and everything was fab. We are now thinking if it is better to close down for a few months and pick up then?\u201d Last week, Rishi Sunak unveiled a range of moves in his first budget that were designed to assist pubs and other small businesses where trade is likely to be hit by the virus. The chancellor said he was also making big changes to the business rates paid by pubs this year, in an effort to insulate them from the economic effects of the coronavirus. Leisure businesses with a rateable value of less than \u00a351,000 will pay no rates for the next 12 months, while the \u201cpub discount\u201d given to bars with a rateable value of up to \u00a3100,000 will increase from \u00a31,000 to \u00a35,000 this year. A spokesman for Zurich said: \u201cZurich\u2019s cover for business interruption is fully aligned with the rest of the insurance market. We will always respond whenever one of our policies is triggered and are continuing to support our customers on a case-by-case basis.\u201d",

The government machine suddenly looks less like the sclerotic inconvenience that annoys people like Dominic Cummings than the most basic means of help we have. Only weeks ago, people close to Boris Johnson were declaring war on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/04/dominic-cummings-warned-civil-service-whitehall-shake-up-plan\" title=\"\">the civil service</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/15/boris-johnson-threatens-bbc-with-two-pronged-attack\" title=\"\">the BBC</a>; now, both institutions are surely at the heart of however we collectively proceed.

Last week, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/08/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html\" title=\"\">New York Times ran</a> a piece of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnharris1969/status/1238436656216248324\" title=\"\">political analysis</a> headlined \u201cTrump meets an enemy that can\u2019t be tweeted away\u201d.

The kind of denial the president was still pushing only a week or so ago forms part of the same picture: with accidental echoes of the occasion in 2006 when Johnson paid humorous tribute to laissez-faire government by praising the fictional <a href=\"https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/who-said-it-donald-trump-or-larry-vaughn-the-mayor-of-amity-island-from-jaws\" title=\"\">mayor from Jaws</a> and his decision to keep his beaches open, Trump has recently been lampooned as the real thing, downplaying a mounting emergency, lest it threaten the economic success on which his re-election might depend.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3744dc7eb81aeb132784dde4f3c8608af8602f83\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3744dc7eb81aeb132784dde4f3c8608af8602f83/0_226_4607_2765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson during a 13 March press conference on coronavirus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Johnson is now at pains to be seen deferring to the chief medical officer and the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser.\u2019 Boris Johnson at his 13 March press conference on coronavirus.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Woven through this take on the president\u2019s position is a progressive article of faith: the idea that although populists might be capable rabble-rousers, they always fall down when it comes to basic competence.

For a long time now, all over the world, politics and government and their surrounding discourse have increasingly amounted to a spectacle of anger, rhetoric and a supposed battle of values in which the political right \u2013 particularly its latter-day, populist incarnation \u2013 has usually been on the winning side.

And in this one, those of us who cling on to collectivist, egalitarian ideas can discern things that speak to our sense of how the world ought to be organised. To find crumbs of political comfort in a dire public health emergency might seem inappropriate. But unforeseen events always have consequences beyond their immediate impact: just because they fit some of our existing beliefs that does not make them any less real. Even if the new imperative of \u201csocial distancing\u201d sounds like the ultimate example of individualism and frantic panic-buying does not exactly look like an expression of altruism, our shared humanity has also been brought to the surface, or soon will be. As the rapid appearance online of community help initiatives proves, we are already getting used to doing some of what the common good requires. And as usually happens with sudden adverse events, the arrival of the Covid-19 virus has pushed the state and public sector into the foreground.

That doesn\u2019t mean people should be overwhelmed. It means people have to be smart about listening to guidance from healthcare professionals.\u201d</p> <p>The mayor did concede, however, that schools could close quickly if he felt the situation warranted it.</p> <p>\u201cIt is literally a day-to-day reality. If we can keep our schools open we will, if at any point we feel it doesn\u2019t make sense we will make a move,\u201d he said, adding that preparations were in hand to care for the children of essential workers.</p> <p>\u201cA variety of contingencies are being set up. They are far from perfect, let\u2019s be clear, the distance and difference between a functioning school system program for a million kids versus creating alternative centers feeding kids of healthcare workers, that kind of thing.\u201d</p> <p>De Blasio\u2019s stance has angered teachers in the nation\u2019s largest school district, who have watched a steady stream of classroom closures in other sizeable districts, including Los Angeles, Boston and entire states including Florida.</p> <p>Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, which represents about 150,000 educators in New York city schools, said De Blasio\u2019s failure to fall in line risked students\u2019 health.</p> <p>\u201cBecause of his irresponsible decision to keep the public schools open, Mayor Bill de Blasio can no longer assure the health and safety of our students and school communities,\u201d Mulgrew said in an email to parents.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a small window of time to contain the coronavirus before it penetrates into our communities and overwhelms our healthcare system\u2019s capacity to safely care for all the New Yorkers who may become gravely ill.\u201d</p> <p>The Movement of Rank and File Educators, a faction of the UFT, has urged its members to call in sick on Monday as a protest.</p> <p>\u201cTransmission is clearly already happening in the schools and the sooner it stops the fewer people will die,\u201d the group said in a statement. </p> <p>The faction has sent out several tweets with the hashtag \u201csickout\u201d, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MOREcaucusNYC/status/1238933192654159872\">one stating</a> that: \u201cIf de Blasio won\u2019t #closenycpublicschools to protect students and their families, teachers will.\u201d</p> <p>Some parents have taken the decision to keep their children home. </p> <p>\u201cIt would be a hardship if they closed the schools, but I think it\u2019s a necessary one we need to take in the space of this emergency,\u201d said Anna Gold, who pulled her third-grader and kindergartner out of public schools in Brooklyn.</p> <p>In contrast to New York\u2019s relative freedoms, meanwhile, neighboring Hoboken has imposed a 10pm to 5am curfew on residents to try to keep coronavirus at bay.</p> <p>Mayor Ravi S Bhalla announced on Saturday night that exceptions would be made for emergencies and people required to work, adding that restaurants can only offer takeout and delivery services.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Material from the Associated Press was included in this report</em></p></li> </ul>",

There\u2019s health and safety ramifications to that. \u201cThose first responders, those healthcare workers who depend on the schools, they can get to work and we need those workers desperately.\u201d De Blasio said he believed the crisis could last at least six months, and the situation was escalating daily. \u201cBecause of community spread [coronavirus] is clearly widespread already in New York City and will continue to grow,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had 25 confirmed cases on Monday, we have 269 this morning and that\u2019ll grow today, we\u2019ll clearly have a thousand cases probably not too far into next week. That doesn\u2019t mean people should be overwhelmed. It means people have to be smart about listening to guidance from healthcare professionals.\u201d The mayor did concede, however, that schools could close quickly if he felt the situation warranted it. \u201cIt is literally a day-to-day reality. If we can keep our schools open we will, if at any point we feel it doesn\u2019t make sense we will make a move,\u201d he said, adding that preparations were in hand to care for the children of essential workers. \u201cA variety of contingencies are being set up. They are far from perfect, let\u2019s be clear, the distance and difference between a functioning school system program for a million kids versus creating alternative centers feeding kids of healthcare workers, that kind of thing.\u201d De Blasio\u2019s stance has angered teachers in the nation\u2019s largest school district, who have watched a steady stream of classroom closures in other sizeable districts, including Los Angeles, Boston and entire states including Florida. Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, which represents about 150,000 educators in New York city schools, said De Blasio\u2019s failure to fall in line risked students\u2019 health. \u201cBecause of his irresponsible decision to keep the public schools open, Mayor Bill de Blasio can no longer assure the health and safety of our students and school communities,\u201d Mulgrew said in an email to parents. \u201cWe have a small window of time to contain the coronavirus before it penetrates into our communities and overwhelms our healthcare system\u2019s capacity to safely care for all the New Yorkers who may become gravely ill.\u201d The Movement of Rank and File Educators, a faction of the UFT, has urged its members to call in sick on Monday as a protest. \u201cTransmission is clearly already happening in the schools and the sooner it stops the fewer people will die,\u201d the group said in a statement. The faction has sent out several tweets with the hashtag \u201csickout\u201d, one stating that: \u201cIf de Blasio won\u2019t #closenycpublicschools to protect students and their families, teachers will.\u201d Some parents have taken the decision to keep their children home. \u201cIt would be a hardship if they closed the schools, but I think it\u2019s a necessary one we need to take in the space of this emergency,\u201d said Anna Gold, who pulled her third-grader and kindergartner out of public schools in Brooklyn. In contrast to New York\u2019s relative freedoms, meanwhile, neighboring Hoboken has imposed a 10pm to 5am curfew on residents to try to keep coronavirus at bay. Mayor Ravi S Bhalla announced on Saturday night that exceptions would be made for emergencies and people required to work, adding that restaurants can only offer takeout and delivery services.

No awards, books or television career to speak of, but he once saw a bloke on the tube laughing out loud while reading his column. He lives in hope that in another five years or so he might spot another one. Or even the same one</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair has warned Democrats in the US that nominating Bernie Sanders to face Donald Trump for the presidency would be \u201can enormous gamble\u201d, risking defeat on a similar scale to that suffered by the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn. The former prime minister told CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria: \u201cWhen I hear the rhetoric around Bernie Sanders, who by the way is obviously a very capable guy, it\u2019s eerily familiar to anyone who\u2019s just watched the debacle unfold in the British Labour party and our election defeat in the UK, which is essentially the worst in our 120-year history.\u201d In December, in an election primarily centered on Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party was beaten heavily by Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives. Reaction to Blair\u2019s comments on social media was swift, with many pointing out that Sanders\u2019 signature policy \u2013 universal healthcare \u2013 has been a feature of life in Britain since the setting up of the publicly funded National Health Service in 1948. Critics also point out that the British left gained support after Blair began introducing limited privatisation into the NHS. Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont who describes himself as a democratic socialist, surged in the early stages of the Democratic primary and was a clear frontrunner after the Nevada caucuses in February. But Joe Biden has mounted a stunning comeback, dominating the Super Tuesday primaries and subsequent contests. Amid the growing chaos of the coronavirus outbreak and Trump\u2019s attempts to contain it, the senator and the former vice-president will debate behind closed doors in Washington on Sunday night. The next votes will be held in Florida, Ohio, Arizona and Illinois on Tuesday. A NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released on Sunday showed Biden way ahead with Democratic voters and performing better than Sanders in a notional race against Trump. But the Vermont senator has said he will not drop out, aiming instead to shape the ideological outlook of the party on issues such as healthcare, student debt and the minimum wage and perhaps to surge back into contention should Biden stumble or fall. Like establishment figures and moderates in Democratic ranks, Blair doubts the wisdom of that decision. \u201cI just don\u2019t think there\u2019s an appetite for socialist revolution,\u201d he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t in Britain, I\u2019d be surprised if there was in the US. And so I think \u2026 if they go down that path it\u2019s an enormous gamble. \u201cPut it like this: you\u2019re essentially saying, \u2018Put aside the middle ground, we\u2019re not really going to try to reach that, instead we\u2019re going to up the turnout and that\u2019s exactly the strategy of Corbyn\u2019s Labour party in the UK and it failed, drastically.\u201d Biden has attracted moderates, independents, suburban voters and a huge percentage of African Americans, many seemingly motivated to simply choose the candidate most likely to beat Trump in November. Sanders has done well among the young but hopes of a surge in turnout from such voters have not borne fruit. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m a skeptic about him,\u201d Blair said. \u201cNow on the other hand I think what is important to recognise is that progressive politics has got two big challenges. \u201cFirst of all, my view of the populism is you\u2019ve got to be very careful when you\u2019re from the liberal or progressive side of politics, because if you\u2019re not careful you tend to say that, \u2018These people who are voting for Donald Trump or Brexit, they\u2019re just irrational people, I don\u2019t understand why they\u2019re doing it and you\u2019ve just got to hope this is a moment that passes.\u2019 \u201cNo, they\u2019re doing it for reasons, and whereas populism can exploit grievances they don\u2019t invent them. The grievances are real.\u201d Blair said he knew Biden well and thought him \u201chighly capable and decent\u201d, but said the challenge if he did win the White House would be to effect real change while in office.

      "body": "<p>Egypt is likely grappling with a higher rate of coronavirus infections than official figures, according to research by Canadian disease specialists and increasing infection among tourists who departed in recent weeks.</p> \n<p>At least 97 foreign nationals who visited Egypt since mid-February showed symptoms or tested positive for Covid-19 on return home, according to public health data and news reports. Most spent time on Nile cruises believed to be the source of the outbreak in the southern city of Luxor, a tourism hotspot.</p> \n<p>Egyptian officials say that an additional 126 foreign nationals and Egyptians have tested positive for the coronavirus since mid-February. This includes a 60-year-old woman declared dead on Thursday in the Nile Delta city of Mansoura, 465 miles from Luxor.</p> \n<p>Her death, the first of an Egyptian citizen during the current epidemic, came a week after officials removed 45 passengers from the Asara cruise ship later quarantined in Luxor. Some 82 passengers left quarantine on board the ship and travelled home just days later, after officials from Egypt\u2019s ministry of health flew to Luxor to screen 558 more people \u2013 all tested negative. A further 27 people initially diagnosed with the virus retested negative, they added.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/emea\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Tourism is a cornerstone of Egypt\u2019s economy, and officials insisted on business as usual, stressing that tourist sites in Luxor remain open even as the country banned large public gatherings and closed schools. The Egyptian military <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mahmouedgamal44/status/1239130054552170496?s=20\">announced</a> new measures, including using the chemical weapons department to help with testing. But observers fear Egypt\u2019s emergency measures may have begun too late, following limited testing, a tight grip on infection statistics and outbreak locations and potential <a href=\"https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/2174536/egypt-take-legal-action-against-rumor-promoters\">legal action</a> against anyone seen to be \u201cspreading false news or rumours\u201d, about the disease.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe announce everything with complete transparency,\u201d <a href=\"https://gulfnews.com/world/mena/egypt-claims-about-coronavirus-outbreak-rumours-1.70116949\">said</a> Egypt\u2019s prime minister, Mostafa Madbouly. Yet Taiwan\u2019s Centre for Disease Control <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En/Bulletin/Detail/4Xu2VavNqpCl2VwScBa0NA?typeid=158\">disproved</a> statements by Egypt\u2019s ministry of health that a Taiwanese woman on board the Asara cruise was the source of the infection in Luxor in late February. Instead, they said, analyses proved that the strain of the virus she contracted meant she was infected in Egypt.</p> \n<p>Infectious disease specialists from the University of Toronto who <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027375v1\">studied</a> the disparity between official and likely infection rates in places like Iran <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BogochIsaac/status/1239194332462223360?s=20\">provided a grim picture</a> of the possible spread of the virus in Egypt.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/100m-europeans-on-lockdown-as-countries-battle-coronavirus\">100m Europeans on lockdown as countries battle coronavirus</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cUnder the conservative estimate of Covid-2019 burden, where linked and ambiguous cases are eliminated, we estimated an outbreak size of 19,310 cases in Egypt,\u201d they said, using a mix of flight data, traveller data and infection rates. \u201cEgypt likely has a large burden of Covid-2019 cases that are unreported and greater public health clinical capacity may help identify and manage cases.\u201d</p> \n<p>The scientists used data from early March when Egypt officially had three cases of the virus, meaning the numbers are now likely higher. Khaled Megahead, the spokesman for Egypt\u2019s ministry of health, did not respond to requests for comment.</p> \n<p>Egypt has an <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2018/05/22/egypts-population-boom-then-bust/\">overwhelmingly young</a> population, meaning that fewer people will display serious symptoms of Covid-19. Many say privately they would opt to self-isolate if they contracted the virus, reluctant to surrender to a government that has quarantined people in a remote area close to the Libyan border, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/24/threat-of-jail-shapes-egyptian-lives-nine-years-after-uprising\">detained</a> doctors in the past.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo far the testing process is very central. It is based on the scenario of if someone suspects that he is sick, he goes to certain places,\u201d said a doctor at one hospital in Matariya, who asked not to be named.</p> \n<p>Two doctors in Luxor dismissed the idea they could have overlooked cases, despite tourists leaving the city and reporting symptoms on returning home.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is no country in the world that can test the entire population,\u201d said one, who screened passengers on the Asara last Friday and gave his name only as Bakry. Yet examples worldwide show that widespread testing is essential to understanding and fighting the highly contagious virus.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are specific symptoms and guidelines about how many and whom we have to test,\u201d he said, adding that nine further cruise ships were tested on 6 March alongside the Asara. A German tourist on board the Hapi 5 Nile cruiser who was transported from Luxor to Hurghada hospital that day died two days later. Other passengers quarantined on board tested negative, and the cruise continued.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t see people coming to the hospitals with symptoms. It doesn\u2019t look like China, where people are falling down in the street,\u201d said Islam Asery, a surgeon at Luxor International hospital.

      "bodyText": "Egypt is likely grappling with a higher rate of coronavirus infections than official figures, according to research by Canadian disease specialists and increasing infection among tourists who departed in recent weeks. At least 97 foreign nationals who visited Egypt since mid-February showed symptoms or tested positive for Covid-19 on return home, according to public health data and news reports. Most spent time on Nile cruises believed to be the source of the outbreak in the southern city of Luxor, a tourism hotspot. Egyptian officials say that an additional 126 foreign nationals and Egyptians have tested positive for the coronavirus since mid-February. This includes a 60-year-old woman declared dead on Thursday in the Nile Delta city of Mansoura, 465 miles from Luxor. Her death, the first of an Egyptian citizen during the current epidemic, came a week after officials removed 45 passengers from the Asara cruise ship later quarantined in Luxor. Some 82 passengers left quarantine on board the ship and travelled home just days later, after officials from Egypt\u2019s ministry of health flew to Luxor to screen 558 more people \u2013 all tested negative. A further 27 people initially diagnosed with the virus retested negative, they added. Tourism is a cornerstone of Egypt\u2019s economy, and officials insisted on business as usual, stressing that tourist sites in Luxor remain open even as the country banned large public gatherings and closed schools. The Egyptian military announced new measures, including using the chemical weapons department to help with testing. But observers fear Egypt\u2019s emergency measures may have begun too late, following limited testing, a tight grip on infection statistics and outbreak locations and potential legal action against anyone seen to be \u201cspreading false news or rumours\u201d, about the disease. \u201cWe announce everything with complete transparency,\u201d said Egypt\u2019s prime minister, Mostafa Madbouly. Yet Taiwan\u2019s Centre for Disease Control disproved statements by Egypt\u2019s ministry of health that a Taiwanese woman on board the Asara cruise was the source of the infection in Luxor in late February. Instead, they said, analyses proved that the strain of the virus she contracted meant she was infected in Egypt. Infectious disease specialists from the University of Toronto who studied the disparity between official and likely infection rates in places like Iran provided a grim picture of the possible spread of the virus in Egypt. \u201cUnder the conservative estimate of Covid-2019 burden, where linked and ambiguous cases are eliminated, we estimated an outbreak size of 19,310 cases in Egypt,\u201d they said, using a mix of flight data, traveller data and infection rates. \u201cEgypt likely has a large burden of Covid-2019 cases that are unreported and greater public health clinical capacity may help identify and manage cases.\u201d The scientists used data from early March when Egypt officially had three cases of the virus, meaning the numbers are now likely higher. Khaled Megahead, the spokesman for Egypt\u2019s ministry of health, did not respond to requests for comment. Egypt has an overwhelmingly young population, meaning that fewer people will display serious symptoms of Covid-19. Many say privately they would opt to self-isolate if they contracted the virus, reluctant to surrender to a government that has quarantined people in a remote area close to the Libyan border, and detained doctors in the past. \u201cSo far the testing process is very central. It is based on the scenario of if someone suspects that he is sick, he goes to certain places,\u201d said a doctor at one hospital in Matariya, who asked not to be named. Two doctors in Luxor dismissed the idea they could have overlooked cases, despite tourists leaving the city and reporting symptoms on returning home. \u201cThere is no country in the world that can test the entire population,\u201d said one, who screened passengers on the Asara last Friday and gave his name only as Bakry. Yet examples worldwide show that widespread testing is essential to understanding and fighting the highly contagious virus. \u201cThere are specific symptoms and guidelines about how many and whom we have to test,\u201d he said, adding that nine further cruise ships were tested on 6 March alongside the Asara. A German tourist on board the Hapi 5 Nile cruiser who was transported from Luxor to Hurghada hospital that day died two days later. Other passengers quarantined on board tested negative, and the cruise continued. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see people coming to the hospitals with symptoms. It doesn\u2019t look like China, where people are falling down in the street,\u201d said Islam Asery, a surgeon at Luxor International hospital. He stressed that he found official figures credible, and viewed honesty as a patriotic act. Still, he said, \u201cSharing information is sometimes seen as political because it\u2019s attached to income coming from tourism. Our government and all of us dealing with this are being careful.\u201d Sherbiny, a hotel worker in Luxor, said officials arrived at his place of work at 6am on 9 March for tests. \u201cThe medical team entered with full protective gear and masks and took blood samples,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they were accompanied by plain-clothed policemen,\u201d he added, meaning that security officials who often move about the city remained unprotected. Egypt has a population of 100 million people, where 95% live on roughly 5% of the land, a challenge for practising social distancing. The government has taken steps to handle the problem, including shortening prayer times and announcing a \u00a35.2bn fund to combat the \u201cconsequences of the virus\u201d. But it has also sought to control the narrative, even as nearby countries banned entry from Egypt.

There\u2019s an often-shared cartoon by the Pulitzer prize-winning cartoonist Joel Pett where one attendee at a climate summit says to another, \u201cWhat if it\u2019s a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing?\u201d Our financial systems are unlikely to collapse in the near future. In a while things will be back to normal, just as they were after Sars, the global financial crisis and any of the other global challenges that we are confronted with from time to time. But if we used this as an opportunity to wean ourselves off the 24-hour, on-demand, one-click megastore way of life we\u2019ve become addicted to, would that really be so bad?",

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government only engaged a creative agency for its national public health campaign about coronavirus on 3 March, more than a month after the first case of the disease was reported in Australia. According to the contract notice on AusTender, the health department engaged Carbon Media to provide creative services for the Covid-19 campaign on 3 March. A spokesman for the health minister Greg Hunt defended the timeline, telling Guardian Australia the department \u201chad access to creative services from a range of sources, both internal and external, well before Carbon Media was engaged\u201d but conceded the contract for the national campaign began on 3 March. Labor has seized on the revelation to step up its criticism that the Morrison government was too slow to educate the public about preventing the spread of coronavirus through hygiene and social distancing measures. On Sunday the prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced that Australia will require all international arrivals in Australia to self-isolate for 14 days and is now encouraging social distancing for others. The escalation comes on top of a recommendation that from Monday all non-essential mass gatherings of more than 500 people be cancelled. The suite of new measures comes after criticism the government has failed to give clear messages about social distancing. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, advised as late as Sunday morning that handshakes between people who have not returned from overseas were still advisable. The $407,700 Carbon Media contract is due to run until 30 June and was awarded by limited tender, subject to the exemption on open tenders for government advertising contracts. Carbon Media has numerous other contracts with the health department including for seasonal influenza communications and childhood immunisation. Labor\u2019s shadow health minister, Chris Bowen, told Guardian Australia: \u201cTime will tell whether this is in an effective advertising campaign, but Labor questions why it took the government over two months to commence an advertising campaign to provide the most basic public health information on Covid-19. \u201cThey should be doing more, sooner.\u201d The coronavirus ads, which were rolled out on Saturday, direct Australians to visit health.gov.au to access up-to-date advice: Another version of the ad urges people who have been overseas or had contact with people with coronavirus to call ahead before visiting the doctor and stay home if the illness is mild: Australians are directed to cough or sneeze into their arm or a tissue, and to wash their hands regularly: On Wednesday Hunt announced the $30m ad campaign as part of the $2.4bn health response to the coronavirus. So far, the health department has paid $2.3m to Mediabrands Australia for the media buy for the campaign, and $56,375 to Snapcracker Research and Strategy for concept testing for the campaign. Those contracts run from 12 March and 4 March. The department has paid $17,270 to Ansible Pty Ltd to develop a mobile application, although it is unclear if the contract relates to development of a new coronavirus app. At a press conference on Sunday Bowen said Labor welcomed the fact the advertising campaign has started in earnest. \u201cI have made the point consistently that the public information has not always been clear and consistent,\u201d he said. Bowen said the campaign \u201cneeds to be a nationally coordinated, fully integrated campaign to allay misinformation on social media\u201d and should also \u201cmake people\u2019s obligations for self-isolation very clear\u201d. On Monday, Scott Morrison told ABC\u2019s AM resources for the campaign were put in place \u201cseveral weeks ago\u201d and the government had taken coronavirus seriously since mid-January. He cited travel bans and evacuations from Wuhan, without explaining why the health campaign was commissioned on 3 March. The first case of coronavirus in Australia was confirmed on 25 January. On 11 March Hunt defended the pace of rolling out ads by noting the government had already started using signage at airports to communicate about measures to combat coronavirus. \u201cIn addition, we\u2019ll be focusing on online, electronic media and messages to the home to make sure that people have as many avenues [to receive information] as possible,\u201d he said. Hunt\u2019s spokesman said the government had run \u201ca range of messages and advertising, particularly targeted at the Chinese community and international travellers as was the original need in the early phases of the outbreak\u201d. \u201cThe public has been provided with the latest developments regarding the coronavirus outbreak through nearly daily press conferences, media releases, updates on the department\u2019s website and social media channels.\u201d \u201cMultiple fact sheets and communiques have been posted on the website and distributed to key stakeholders and industries to address their specific requirements.\u201d",

So anybody who can should turn production and their engineering minds over to the production of ventilators.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cobra, the government\u2019s emergency committee, will meet again on Monday to discuss the coronavirus pandemic, and on Tuesday the government will announce details of the emergency legislation it plans to pass to give it new powers it may need as the crisis escalate, Hancock said.</p> \n<p>He said the bill had been amended to take in suggestions made by the Labour party, and that it would be published on Thursday. It is due to go through the Commons the following week.</p> \n<p>Among other provisions, the bill will give the government the power to quarantine people deemed a threat to public health, Hancock said. He added: \u201cI doubt that actually we will need to use it much, because people are being very responsible.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hancock also confirmed the government may ban gatherings of more than 500 people \u2013 a move that is already being introduced in Scotland from Monday.</p> \n<p>In recent days, the government has faced growing criticism for not matching some of the more stringent public health measures taken in other European countries, where schools have been closed, public gatherings banned and entry restrictions imposed.</p> \n<p>Hancock defended the UK\u2019s response. He said it was doing more coronavirus testing than in any country apart from China, South Korea, and Italy, where the outbreak has been more severe.</p> \n<p>And he rejected claims that the UK measures were out of step with what was happening elsewhere.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are similar to many countries,\u201d he claimed. \u201cFor instance, we are very similar to the approach being taken in Germany and Australia and others.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is about making sure you do the right thing at the right time. We are prepared to take, if we need to, all the sorts of measures [discussed], but we will do it based on the science.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said that \u201cin the coming days\u201d the government would publish details of the modelling it was using when determining its policy. He also said he was confident food supplies would continue.</p> \n<p>He was also relatively dismissive of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51892402\">an open letter signed by </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51892402\">more than 300</a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51892402\"> scientists from UK universities</a> criticising the government\u2019s approach. In the letter, the group, most of whom are not epidemiologists but instead specialists in subjects like maths, call for \u201csocial distancing\u201d measures to be introduced immediately, and argue that aiming for \u201cherd immunity\u201d is not viable.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Asked about the letter, Hancock said: \u201cWhat we will do is listen to all the credible scientists. What we will not do is deviate from having a plan that is based on the best scientific advice.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hancock also argued that the letter was misstating government policy in suggesting that it wanted to build up herd immunity to coronavirus among the population at large.</p> \n<p>\u201cHerd immunity is not our goal or policy, it\u2019s a scientific concept\u201d, he said. \u201cOur policy is to protect lives and to beat this virus.\u201d</p>",

Ministers are also not ruling out ordering the closure of all bars, restaurants and non-essential shops as the coronavirus pandemic escalates. Such drastic measures would go beyond what the government anticipated in its coronavirus action plan, but countries such as France have ordered closures on this scale and Hancock said the government would do whatever was necessary to protect life. Hancock confirmed the government will soon tell people over 70 that they will need to self-isolate at home for up to four months to protect themselves from the disease \u2013 but his terminology caused some confusion, leading Scottish officials to stress that elderly people would not be asked to avoid all contact with other people.

The health department said guidelines saying exactly what the new advice for the over-70s would mean in practice would be published in due course. In the Marr interview, Hancock was asked if the government would follow countries such as France and Spain, where bars, restaurants and shops have been closed, apart from supermarkets and pharmacies. Hancock replied: \u201cWe have not ruled that out. We will do what is necessary. Because the top priority is to protect life, and you do that by protecting the vulnerable, and by protecting the NHS. That is the goal.\u201d Asked about the state of the NHS, Hancock said hospitals would need more beds and that one solution would be to cancel operations and to convert operating theatres used for non-urgent procedures such as knee operations into wards for coronavirus patients. Operating theatres were suitable because they had oxygen supplies, he said. He also said he was looking at converting hotels, \u201cmany of which are currently empty\u201d, into temporary hospitals. And he said the government would be urging manufacturers to produce more ventilators. He said the NHS already had about 5,000 ventilators, which were needed for people who get severely ill through coronavirus, but he said the country needed \u201cmany times more than that\u201d. He said that, although they were complicated pieces of machinery, they were not so complex that it was impossible for advanced manufacturers to switch to producing them, and he said that in a conference call, scheduled for Monday, Boris Johnson would be urging manufacturing companies to do just this. \u201cWe are saying: you produce a ventilator, then we will buy it. No number is too high,\u201d Hancock said. \u201cThe prime minister is hosting a conference call \u2026 to say very clearly to the nation\u2019s manufacturers: ventilators are the thing that we are going to need, and frankly, right across the world, the demand for them is incredibly high, so it is not possible to produce too many. So anybody who can should turn production and their engineering minds over to the production of ventilators.\u201d Cobra, the government\u2019s emergency committee, will meet again on Monday to discuss the coronavirus pandemic, and on Tuesday the government will announce details of the emergency legislation it plans to pass to give it new powers it may need as the crisis escalate, Hancock said. He said the bill had been amended to take in suggestions made by the Labour party, and that it would be published on Thursday. It is due to go through the Commons the following week. Among other provisions, the bill will give the government the power to quarantine people deemed a threat to public health, Hancock said. He added: \u201cI doubt that actually we will need to use it much, because people are being very responsible.\u201d Hancock also confirmed the government may ban gatherings of more than 500 people \u2013 a move that is already being introduced in Scotland from Monday. In recent days, the government has faced growing criticism for not matching some of the more stringent public health measures taken in other European countries, where schools have been closed, public gatherings banned and entry restrictions imposed. Hancock defended the UK\u2019s response. He said it was doing more coronavirus testing than in any country apart from China, South Korea, and Italy, where the outbreak has been more severe. And he rejected claims that the UK measures were out of step with what was happening elsewhere. \u201cWe are similar to many countries,\u201d he claimed. \u201cFor instance, we are very similar to the approach being taken in Germany and Australia and others. \u201cIt is about making sure you do the right thing at the right time. We are prepared to take, if we need to, all the sorts of measures [discussed], but we will do it based on the science.\u201d He said that \u201cin the coming days\u201d the government would publish details of the modelling it was using when determining its policy. He also said he was confident food supplies would continue. He was also relatively dismissive of an open letter signed by more than 300 scientists from UK universities criticising the government\u2019s approach. In the letter, the group, most of whom are not epidemiologists but instead specialists in subjects like maths, call for \u201csocial distancing\u201d measures to be introduced immediately, and argue that aiming for \u201cherd immunity\u201d is not viable. Asked about the letter, Hancock said: \u201cWhat we will do is listen to all the credible scientists. What we will not do is deviate from having a plan that is based on the best scientific advice.\u201d Hancock also argued that the letter was misstating government policy in suggesting that it wanted to build up herd immunity to coronavirus among the population at large. \u201cHerd immunity is not our goal or policy, it\u2019s a scientific concept\u201d, he said. \u201cOur policy is to protect lives and to beat this virus.\u201d",

Case 4,000 In the third and most serious case, case 4,000, the prime minister is accused of offering incentives worth close to \u00a3200m to the Israeli telecoms provider Bezeq in exchange for positive stories on an online news website it owns. How has he responded? Netanyahu has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, alleging he is the victim of a politically-motivated witch-hunt. Is that it for his legal woes? No. There was also a separate case not involving Netanyahu, but his wife, Sara, who was convicted in June of illegally misusing thousands of pounds of public funds for lavish meals, despite having an in-house cook provided by the state.",

      "bodyText": "Public health experts and hundreds of doctors and scientists at home and abroad are urging the UK government to change its strategy against coronavirus, amid fears it will mean the epidemic \u201clets rip\u201d through the population. They say the UK is turning its back on strategies that have successfully brought down the numbers of infections and deaths in other countries. On Thursday, Boris Johnson and his medical and scientific advisers announced that only those seriously ill in hospital would be tested. Anyone who had any symptoms should self-isolate at home for seven days, without notifying the NHS. Banning mass gatherings would not help reduce the spread of infections, the prime minister and his advisers said \u2013 although it now seems likely, largely in response to sporting and entertainment bodies cancelling events of their own accord. Anthony Costello, a UK paediatrician and former director of the World Health Organization (WHO), said he had personally written to the chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, asking for testing to continue in the community. \u201cThe key principles from WHO are intensive surveillance,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cYou test the population like crazy, find out where the cases are, immediately quarantine them and do contact tracing and get them out of the community. This deals with family clusters. That\u2019s the key bedrock of getting this under control.\u201d This was how South Korea, China, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan had brought their case numbers down. \u201cYou can really take people out of the population and make sure they are quarantined. That is vital \u2013 before you get to social distancing.\u201d Yet the UK government was stopping tests outside of hospital. \u201cFor me and the WHO people I have spoken to, this is absolutely the wrong policy. It would mean it just lets rip,\u201d he said. Costello thinks we will be in the same position as Italy within two weeks. \u201cThe basic public health approach is playing second fiddle to mathematical modelling,\u201d he said. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO\u2019s director general, expressed his deep concern on Friday at the end of testing and contact tracing in the UK and some other European countries. \u201cYou can\u2019t fight a virus if you don\u2019t know where it is,\u201d he said. \u201cFind, isolate, test and treat every case to break the chains of Covid transmission. Every case we find and treat limits the expansion of the disease.\u201d Devi Sridhar, professor of global public health at The University of Edinburgh, listed on Twitter the reasons for continuing to test. \u201c1 People can alter behaviour based on whether they have Covid. 2 Break chains of transmission. 3 Local hospitals can plan for how many patients will need care. 4 To know where cases are emerging (hotspots). 5 How do we know how large problem is?\u201d A government minister in Singapore has also expressed dismay. \u201cOne concern we have with cases such as UK and Switzerland isn\u2019t just about the numbers. It is that these countries have abandoned any measure to contain or restrain the virus,\u201d minister for national development, Lawrence Wong, said at a press briefing on Sunday. \u201cIf there\u2019s no attempt to contain, we estimate the number of cases in these countries to rise significantly in the coming days and weeks.\u201d An open letter from a group including some of the UK\u2019s most senior doctors asked the government to publish the modelling and any other evidence for the policies it is pursuing. \u201cOur country\u2019s public health response to Covid-19 is demonstrably different to most other countries\u2019 responses globally and in Europe \u2026 There is also no clear indication that the UK\u2019s response is being informed by experiences of other countries in containing the spread of Covid-19,\u201d it said, pointing out the risks to the NHS of a rapid and huge surge in cases of people needing hospital treatment. The UK has 2.5 beds per 1,000 people in the population, they said, which is fewer than France (6), Italy (3.2) and the United States (2.8). Immunologists, in a separate open letter, said they had \u201csignificant questions\u201d about the government\u2019s apparent strategy to rely on building up \u201cherd immunity\u201d by exposure to the virus in the UK. Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, has suggested this might be a good outcome from many people becoming infected. Herd immunity is usually brought about by vaccination \u2013 not exposing people to the risks of a disease. \u201cThe ultimate aim of herd immunity is to stop disease spread and protect the most vulnerable in society. However, this strategy only works to reduce serious disease if, when building that immunity, vulnerable individuals are protected from becoming ill, for example through social distancing. If not, the consequences could be severe,\u201d says the letter from the British Society for Immunology. Behavioural scientists joined the concern, saying they believed the government should immediately bring in social distancing measures and not delay for fear of the public getting \u201cbehavioural fatigue\u201d. \u201cIf \u2018behavioural fatigue\u2019 truly represents a key factor in the government\u2019s decision to delay high-visibility interventions, we urge the government to share an adequate evidence base in support of that decision.

We were not extremely stressed in the way that we were fearful, but we did not want to be put in quarantine. That was the main goal.\u201d</p> <p>The essence of tennis is that it never stops. The full professional calendar spans 51 weeks of the year. Even when the likes of Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal are far from the courts for their own paltry four-week off\u2011season, there is normally always somebody, somewhere competing in a live streamed tournament and being awarded points under the same ranking system.</p> <p>As a result, the domino effect of tennis coming to a halt has been a worldwide phenomenon. In Indian Wells, 200 of the best male and female players were blindsided by the news that it had been called off. After days of debates between the players stranded in the Californian desert, both across the grounds and in mammoth Whatsapp groups, the ATP, WTA and ITF suspended the tour for 5-6 weeks.</p> <p>Jack Draper, Britain\u2019s best young player, did not even have the opportunity to contemplate his future. The 19 year old was 1hr 44min into his quarter-final match against Tobias Simon at the Potchefstroom $35k challenger in South Africa when rain began to pour and they were hauled off the court with Draper leading 5-4 in the third set. The ATP announced the immediate suspension of the tour during the delay and they never made it back to the court. The match was cancelled and promptly erased from the record books. \u201cWas just about to get the break as well,\u201d Draper tweeted afterwards.</p> <p>The political manoeuverings borne out of coronavirus affected countless players. Dayana Yastremska, a highly rated 19-year-old, panicked after Donald Trump announced his European travel ban. In the fear that she would be trapped in the US, she immediately flitted to the airport and back to Ukraine.</p> <p>Zhu Lin, a Chinese player who lives in Beijing, did not buy a plane ticket out of California until Friday. The uncertainty of Chinese athletes abroad was reflected in her <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ratazana/status/1238531338795442183\" title=\"\">asking her fans on Weibo</a> where on earth she would go if she couldn\u2019t make it back home: \u201cI bought my plane ticket but flight might be blocked,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf I change flight to other countries, I would get sent to quarantine. Feels too risky to stay in the US. Please give me some suggestions.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/12/andy-murray-portrait-by-maggi-hambling-to-go-on-show-in-london\">Andy Murray portrait by Maggi Hambling to go on show in London</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Maden says his current ranking, which peaked at 96 last year, has earnt him enough money for a worry-free six weeks. He will be fine. But tennis players are self-employed and earn money when they play. Like so many workers in affected areas around the world, some lower-ranked players face an extremely difficult time ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate because there is no income coming in and no chance of income. That would be the uncertainty, that would be the most frustrating or unsure aspect,\u201d says Maden.</p> <p>Although tennis set the tone early on with its cancellations, the other sports slowly followed last week. The discourse and decision making seem to reflect the widespread consideration of sports as an escape from the real world, rather than part of it. Almost all of the discussed coronavirus contingency plans in the NBA, Premier League and elsewhere focused on how to manage fans without ever taking into account the fact that the athletes themselves might contract the virus anyway.</p> <p>At the very least, the historic past week should be a reminder that sports and the athletes within them cannot be separated from the world around them and that is how people should always write, think and talk about them.</p>",

Even when the likes of Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal are far from the courts for their own paltry four-week off\u2011season, there is normally always somebody, somewhere competing in a live streamed tournament and being awarded points under the same ranking system. As a result, the domino effect of tennis coming to a halt has been a worldwide phenomenon. In Indian Wells, 200 of the best male and female players were blindsided by the news that it had been called off. After days of debates between the players stranded in the Californian desert, both across the grounds and in mammoth Whatsapp groups, the ATP, WTA and ITF suspended the tour for 5-6 weeks. Jack Draper, Britain\u2019s best young player, did not even have the opportunity to contemplate his future. The 19 year old was 1hr 44min into his quarter-final match against Tobias Simon at the Potchefstroom $35k challenger in South Africa when rain began to pour and they were hauled off the court with Draper leading 5-4 in the third set. The ATP announced the immediate suspension of the tour during the delay and they never made it back to the court. The match was cancelled and promptly erased from the record books. \u201cWas just about to get the break as well,\u201d Draper tweeted afterwards. The political manoeuverings borne out of coronavirus affected countless players. Dayana Yastremska, a highly rated 19-year-old, panicked after Donald Trump announced his European travel ban. In the fear that she would be trapped in the US, she immediately flitted to the airport and back to Ukraine. Zhu Lin, a Chinese player who lives in Beijing, did not buy a plane ticket out of California until Friday. The uncertainty of Chinese athletes abroad was reflected in her asking her fans on Weibo where on earth she would go if she couldn\u2019t make it back home: \u201cI bought my plane ticket but flight might be blocked,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf I change flight to other countries, I would get sent to quarantine. Feels too risky to stay in the US. Please give me some suggestions.\u201d Maden says his current ranking, which peaked at 96 last year, has earnt him enough money for a worry-free six weeks. He will be fine. But tennis players are self-employed and earn money when they play. Like so many workers in affected areas around the world, some lower-ranked players face an extremely difficult time ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate because there is no income coming in and no chance of income. That would be the uncertainty, that would be the most frustrating or unsure aspect,\u201d says Maden. Although tennis set the tone early on with its cancellations, the other sports slowly followed last week. The discourse and decision making seem to reflect the widespread consideration of sports as an escape from the real world, rather than part of it. Almost all of the discussed coronavirus contingency plans in the NBA, Premier League and elsewhere focused on how to manage fans without ever taking into account the fact that the athletes themselves might contract the virus anyway. At the very least, the historic past week should be a reminder that sports and the athletes within them cannot be separated from the world around them and that is how people should always write, think and talk about them.",

Last Friday alone, my quick review of reporting across web and print found that more than 90 Guardian journalists wrote in some way about the new coronavirus. Reflecting the impact of Covid-19, coverage went right across specialisms, including politics, business, sport, transport, culture, education and food. It even reached the chess column. Since the first death was reported in China on 11 January, teams have worked around the clock and globe to report and explain this now-pandemic disease. Through words, visuals and audio, including a new twice-weekly Science Weekly Extra podcast, they have sometimes produced upwards of 100 pieces of content a day. Five journalists at the forefront spoke in Saturday\u2019s pages about the challenges of reporting on an unknown disease, with the Beijing bureau chief, Lily Kuo, describing it as one of \u201cthe most complicated, difficult and important stories I have covered\u201d.

      "body": "<p>The Iranian ambassador to the UK says the British government is taking a new approach to the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, adding bilateral talks were taking place over the payment of an outstanding \u00a3400m debt owed by the UK to Iran.</p> <p>Hamid Baeidinejad said the two sides were looking at novel ways for the debt to be paid.</p> <p>It is the first time a UK or Iranian official has admitted in public that talks on the matter are underway, including the possibility of the debt being paid off through medicines and humanitarian goods.</p> <p>Neither side will openly acknowledge there is a link between the debt and the retention of the British-Iranian dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe in jail. She was sentenced to five years on spying charges in 2016, a charge she has always denied.</p> <p>Interviewed by the Iranian newspaper Etemad, Baeidinejad said the previous UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, had taken a counter-productive, aggressive approach to the issue of Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s release, but Boris Johnson\u2019s new government was adopting a different line.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIn Britain media and public opinion were engaged because of her being a mother with a young child. The ministry of foreign affairs of Iran has also relayed this media and psychological atmosphere to the country\u2019s judicial system. But it is up to the judiciary to decide whether or not to release her.</p> <p>\u201cAs we know, classes of prisoners who spend half their time in prison can be subject to reduced sentences. We have tried to advise Ms Zaghari\u2019s family to think of trying to use such legal and judicial remedies in Iranian law, rather than taking psychological measures and designing political and media campaigns on Iran.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/mar/09/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffes-health-improves-despite-coronavirus-fears\">Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's health improves despite coronavirus fears</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe have repeatedly urged the British government to refrain from politicising the case, and instead of abusive actions such as granting \u2018diplomatic protection\u2019 to Zaghari \u2013 which would only further politicise the situation \u2013 to pursue the issue through legal and judicial channels.\u201d</p> <p>With regards to the debt, Baeidinejad said the size and the interest was agreed between the two parties, and it was natural for discussions to start from how the payment could be made.</p> <p>The UK says it cannot make the payment since the Iranian ministry of defence, to which the sum is owed, is subject to EU sanctions. Similarly, the pervasive US sanctions make it difficult to make a payment to Iran\u2019s central bank.</p> <p>Baeidinejad added: \u201cThe legal process of this long-running case, which has been going on for more than 50 years, is nearing its end. The court has ordered the British government to pay the Iranian debt plus interest, and this cannot be changed. At the same time, the opposing lawyers have tried to use every legal opportunity to delay the practical execution of the court\u2019s decision.\u201d</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt is natural to come up with ideas for the type of payment as the time comes to pay off the debt, given the complexities and banking problems. The Islamic Republic of Iran also has ideas for expediting the debt. Finalising the payment method requires a mutual agreement, and talks are underway to determine the details of how the agreements will be implemented.\u201d</p> <p>Separately, Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s family are still pressing the Tehran prison authorities to allow her to be released temporarily due to the threat of coronavirus spreading through Iran\u2019s jails.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of prisoners have been released, but few political or security prisoners have been allowed out on bail.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Iranian ambassador to the UK says the British government is taking a new approach to the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, adding bilateral talks were taking place over the payment of an outstanding \u00a3400m debt owed by the UK to Iran. Hamid Baeidinejad said the two sides were looking at novel ways for the debt to be paid. It is the first time a UK or Iranian official has admitted in public that talks on the matter are underway, including the possibility of the debt being paid off through medicines and humanitarian goods. Neither side will openly acknowledge there is a link between the debt and the retention of the British-Iranian dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe in jail. She was sentenced to five years on spying charges in 2016, a charge she has always denied. Interviewed by the Iranian newspaper Etemad, Baeidinejad said the previous UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, had taken a counter-productive, aggressive approach to the issue of Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s release, but Boris Johnson\u2019s new government was adopting a different line. He said: \u201cIn Britain media and public opinion were engaged because of her being a mother with a young child. The ministry of foreign affairs of Iran has also relayed this media and psychological atmosphere to the country\u2019s judicial system. But it is up to the judiciary to decide whether or not to release her. \u201cAs we know, classes of prisoners who spend half their time in prison can be subject to reduced sentences. We have tried to advise Ms Zaghari\u2019s family to think of trying to use such legal and judicial remedies in Iranian law, rather than taking psychological measures and designing political and media campaigns on Iran. \u201cWe have repeatedly urged the British government to refrain from politicising the case, and instead of abusive actions such as granting \u2018diplomatic protection\u2019 to Zaghari \u2013 which would only further politicise the situation \u2013 to pursue the issue through legal and judicial channels.\u201d With regards to the debt, Baeidinejad said the size and the interest was agreed between the two parties, and it was natural for discussions to start from how the payment could be made. The UK says it cannot make the payment since the Iranian ministry of defence, to which the sum is owed, is subject to EU sanctions. Similarly, the pervasive US sanctions make it difficult to make a payment to Iran\u2019s central bank. Baeidinejad added: \u201cThe legal process of this long-running case, which has been going on for more than 50 years, is nearing its end. The court has ordered the British government to pay the Iranian debt plus interest, and this cannot be changed. At the same time, the opposing lawyers have tried to use every legal opportunity to delay the practical execution of the court\u2019s decision.\u201d He said: \u201cIt is natural to come up with ideas for the type of payment as the time comes to pay off the debt, given the complexities and banking problems. The Islamic Republic of Iran also has ideas for expediting the debt. Finalising the payment method requires a mutual agreement, and talks are underway to determine the details of how the agreements will be implemented.\u201d Separately, Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s family are still pressing the Tehran prison authorities to allow her to be released temporarily due to the threat of coronavirus spreading through Iran\u2019s jails. Tens of thousands of prisoners have been released, but few political or security prisoners have been allowed out on bail.",

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus epidemic in the UK will last until next spring and could lead to 7.9 million people being hospitalised, a secret Public Health England (PHE) briefing for senior NHS officials reveals. The document, seen by the Guardian, is the first time health chiefs tackling the virus have admitted that they expect it to circulate for 12 more months and lead to huge extra strain on an already overstretched NHS. It also suggests that health chiefs are braced for as many as 80% of Britons becoming infected with the coronavirus over that time. Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, has previously described that figure as the worst-case scenario and suggested that the real number would turn out to be less than that. However, the briefing makes clear that four in five of the population \u201care expected\u201d to contract the virus. The document says that: \u201cAs many as 80% of the population are expected to be infected with Covid-19 in the next 12 months, and up to 15% (7.9 million people) may require hospitalisation.\u201d The briefing sets out the latest official thinking about how severely the infection could affect both the public\u2019s health and that of personnel in critical services such as the NHS, police, the fire brigade and transport. It has been drawn up in recent days by PHE\u2019s emergency preparedness and response team and approved as accurate by Dr Susan Hopkins, PHE\u2019s lead official dealing with the outbreak. It has been shared with hospital bosses and senior doctors in the NHS in Engand. \u201cFor the public to hear that it could last for 12 months, people are going to be really upset about that and pretty worried about that\u201d, said Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia. \u201cA year is entirely plausible. But that figure isn\u2019t well appreciated or understood,\u201d added Hunter, an expert in epidemiology. \u201cI think it will dip in the summer, towards the end of June, and come back in November, in the way that usual seasonal flu does. I think it will be around forever, but become less severe over time, as immunity builds up,\u201d he added. The admission that the virus will continue to cause problems for another year appears to undermine hopes that the arrival of warmer weather this summer would kill it.

However, the briefing raises questions about how Britain would continue to function normally, warning that: \u201cIt is estimated that at least 10% of people in the UK will have a cough at any one time during the months of peak Covid-19 activity.\u201d Under revised health advice Boris Johnson unveiled last Thursday, anyone with a cough should self-isolate for at least seven days. The document also states that: The health service cannot cope with the sheer number of people with symptoms who need to be tested because laboratories are \u201cunder significant demand pressures\u201d. From now on only the very seriously ill who are already in hospital and people in care homes and prisons where the coronavirus has been detected will get tested. Testing services are under such strain that even NHS staff will not be swabbed, despite their key role and the risk of them passing the virus on to patients. A senior NHS figure involved in preparing for the growing \u201csurge\u201d in patients whose lives are being put at risk by Covid-19 said an 80% infection rate could lead to more than half a million people dying. If the mortality rate turns out to be the 1% many experts are using as their working assumption then that would mean 531,100 deaths.

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 16 March.</p> \n<h2>Coronavirus</h2> \n<p><strong>Covid-19 continues to cause havoc across the world with deaths in Europe from the virus leaping overnight. In Spain, </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/spain-city-streets-turn-quiet-coronavirus-lockdown-madrid-barcelona\">288 people have now died and more than 8,000 people have tested positive</a>. One week ago there were just 10 deaths and 589 cases. Spain is now the second-hardest hit country in Europe after Italy, where the death toll increased by 368 in just one day. The Spanish government has instigated a near-nationwide lockdown to try and stem the spread of the disease. There is chaos in the French Alps after the French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, announced that the country must close all non-essential locations, including cafes, restaurants, cinemas, nightclubs and shops from midnight. Some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/coronavirus-chaos-as-30000-british-tourists-told-to-leave-french-ski-resorts\">30,000 UK tourists have to be repatriated.</a> Outside of Europe, there was good news in China, where the number of imported coronavirus cases <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/coronavirus-measures-india-france-spain-china\">now exceeds locally transmitted new infections for the first time</a>. And there are fears that coronavirus will start to spread throughout India. The world\u2019s second-most populous country now has 102 cases.</p> \n<p><strong>In Australia, the opposition has questioned why the federal government took <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/australian-government-did-not-commission-coronavirus-campaign-until-a-month-after-first-case\">more than a month to launch its public health campaign</a>, following the first case to be reported in Australia. </strong>Labor\u2019s shadow health minister, Chris Bowen, told Guardian Australia: \u201cThey should be doing more, sooner.\u201d Morrison also announced a 30-day ban on cruise ships on the weekend and strict new requirements for all people arriving in Australia to self-isolate for 14 days, with<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/all-overseas-arrivals-in-australia-must-self-isolate-for-14-days-amid-new-coronavirus-rules\"> substantial fines for those ignoring the advice</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Meanwhile, schools in NSW will remain open</strong> <strong>but bring in social distancing measures.</strong> The secretary of the NSW department of education, Mark Scott, said excursions, assemblies, travel, concerts and other events would be cancelled to limit exposure. There were also cancellations throughout the sporting calendar, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/15/nrl-will-ask-government-for-financial-assistance-if-season-is-suspended\">although the AFL and NRL leagues have controversially decided to persevere with their seasons</a>. </p> \n<p><strong>In the US, president Donald Trump has reportedly offered a German medical company \u201clarge sums of money\u201d for exclusive access to a coronavirus vaccine. </strong>The German government is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/trump-offers-large-sums-for-exclusive-access-to-coronavirus-vaccine\">trying to fight off what it sees as an aggressive takeover bid by the US</a>, the broadsheet Die Welt reports, citing German government circles. <strong>Trump has faced considerable domestic criticism</strong> for his lax approach to the disease, but has recently instigated travel bans to US for Europe and the UK, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/coronavirus-airlines-face-meltdown-as-global-travel-bans-multiply\">disastrous effects for the strained global airline industry</a>.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 16 March. Coronavirus Covid-19 continues to cause havoc across the world with deaths in Europe from the virus leaping overnight. In Spain, 288 people have now died and more than 8,000 people have tested positive. One week ago there were just 10 deaths and 589 cases. Spain is now the second-hardest hit country in Europe after Italy, where the death toll increased by 368 in just one day. The Spanish government has instigated a near-nationwide lockdown to try and stem the spread of the disease. There is chaos in the French Alps after the French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, announced that the country must close all non-essential locations, including cafes, restaurants, cinemas, nightclubs and shops from midnight. Some 30,000 UK tourists have to be repatriated. Outside of Europe, there was good news in China, where the number of imported coronavirus cases now exceeds locally transmitted new infections for the first time. And there are fears that coronavirus will start to spread throughout India. The world\u2019s second-most populous country now has 102 cases. In Australia, the opposition has questioned why the federal government took more than a month to launch its public health campaign, following the first case to be reported in Australia. Labor\u2019s shadow health minister, Chris Bowen, told Guardian Australia: \u201cThey should be doing more, sooner.\u201d Morrison also announced a 30-day ban on cruise ships on the weekend and strict new requirements for all people arriving in Australia to self-isolate for 14 days, with substantial fines for those ignoring the advice. Meanwhile, schools in NSW will remain open but bring in social distancing measures. The secretary of the NSW department of education, Mark Scott, said excursions, assemblies, travel, concerts and other events would be cancelled to limit exposure. There were also cancellations throughout the sporting calendar, although the AFL and NRL leagues have controversially decided to persevere with their seasons. In the US, president Donald Trump has reportedly offered a German medical company \u201clarge sums of money\u201d for exclusive access to a coronavirus vaccine. The German government is trying to fight off what it sees as an aggressive takeover bid by the US, the broadsheet Die Welt reports, citing German government circles. Trump has faced considerable domestic criticism for his lax approach to the disease, but has recently instigated travel bans to US for Europe and the UK, with disastrous effects for the strained global airline industry. Washington reporter David Smith\u2019s analysis asks whether Covid-19 is the \u201cacid test\u201d for Trump\u2019s presidency. And if you\u2019re suffering from the effects of the virus, it may be advisable to stick to paracetamol. The French government have advised that anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen may worsen the disease. Anti-inflammatory drugs are known to be a risk for those with infectious illnesses because they tend to diminish the response of the body\u2019s immune system. Australia Independent MP Zali Steggall has launched an ad campaign to support the climate change bill. The three-week campaign will kick off today and feature images of the destruction wreaked by the summer bushfire season. March 15 was the anniversary of the massacre in Christchurch, where 49 Muslims were murdered at two mosques. Labor has used the anniversary to call for a review of the criteria Australia uses to judge terrorist organisations, citing the fact no rightwing extremist groups are listed. NSW MPs have reacted with dismay at NSW Forestry Corporation\u2019s decision to log unburnt forest in the aftermath of the state\u2019s bushfire crisis. The forest is habitat for some of the most imperilled species. The world Democracy protests in Hong Kong could resume now the coronavirus is under control. In Hong Kong the coronavirus has only infected about 130 people, following a comprehensive response to the disease. Israeli political parties have backed the opposition leader, Benny Gantz, to form a government, in a shocking blow to Benjamin Netanyahu after he appeared to come out ahead in an election held earlier this month. The dramatic news came as a Jerusalem court postponed the prime minister\u2019s corruption trial due to the coronavirus pandemic. UK ministers have been told they can no longer say there have been \u201cno successful examples\u201d of Russian interference in the country\u2019s election system. Boris Johnson refused to allow a report on Russian infiltration in the UK to be published before the 2019 general election. Donald Trump is considering a pardon for Michael Flynn, the national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his dealings with the Russian ambassador. Flynn, who has not yet been sentenced, cut a deal as part of the Mueller investigation. The Western Sahara liberation movement has taken New Zealand\u2019s superannuation fund to court over investments in farms that use illegally mined phosphate. New Zealand is one of the few remaining countries \u2013 and last western nation \u2013 that accepts imports from the contested territory in West Africa.

      "body": "<p>French voters stayed away from polling stations on Sunday with early indications that fewer than half the electorate turned out for municipal elections after the country went into partial lockdown to stop the spread of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/15/coronavirus-latest-updates-trump-tests-negative-as-spain-orders-nationwide-lockdown-uk-us-australia-italy-europe-global-economy\">coronavirus.</a></p> <p>As the voting booths closed, it was estimated that the rate of abstention may have reached up to 56% in ballots to elect local mayors and councillors \u2013 traditionally more popular that national representatives.</p> <p>Election observers described the abstention rate as historic, while accepting the exceptional circumstances of the vote. Figures announced after the polling stations closed were that 120 people had died from the coronavirus in France, a rise of 29 in 24 hours. There are 5,400 confirmed cases in the country.</p> <p>Around 47 million people were called to vote in the first round of the election; the low turnout raised questions about whether the second round would \u2013 or could \u2013 take place next Sunday. The government is expected to make a decision on Tuesday.</p> <p>Anne Hidalgo, the socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, won the first round of municipal elections on Sunday, polling just over 30% of the votes \u2013 well ahead of her closest rival, Rachida Dati, from the mainstream rightwing Les R\u00e9publicains. The government-backed candidate, Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, from the president\u2019s centrist LREM party, came in third.

      "bodyText": "French voters stayed away from polling stations on Sunday with early indications that fewer than half the electorate turned out for municipal elections after the country went into partial lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus. As the voting booths closed, it was estimated that the rate of abstention may have reached up to 56% in ballots to elect local mayors and councillors \u2013 traditionally more popular that national representatives. Election observers described the abstention rate as historic, while accepting the exceptional circumstances of the vote. Figures announced after the polling stations closed were that 120 people had died from the coronavirus in France, a rise of 29 in 24 hours. There are 5,400 confirmed cases in the country. Around 47 million people were called to vote in the first round of the election; the low turnout raised questions about whether the second round would \u2013 or could \u2013 take place next Sunday. The government is expected to make a decision on Tuesday. Anne Hidalgo, the socialist mayor of Paris since 2014, won the first round of municipal elections on Sunday, polling just over 30% of the votes \u2013 well ahead of her closest rival, Rachida Dati, from the mainstream rightwing Les R\u00e9publicains. The government-backed candidate, Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, from the president\u2019s centrist LREM party, came in third. All three go through to the second round, along with the Europe Ecology-Greens candidate. Polling stations opened at 8am on Sunday and within hours it was clear participation would be low. Hours earlier, the prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, announced the closure of all non-essential shops and businesses, including museums, restaurants and cinemas until 15 April. The official decree authorising the shutdown was published on Sunday. It also covered conference and meeting rooms, shopping centres, libraries and archives, dance halls and discos, exhibitions and sports halls. Bars and restaurants can continue offering a takeaway or delivery service. France\u2019s centrist government has also banned gatherings of more than 100 people, while advising all citizens to keep a distance of 1 metre between them. Parisians have been accused of being irresponsible after numerous videos and photographs appeared of groups sitting around in close clusters at popular areas of the capital, including the Canal Saint-Martin and Place de la R\u00e9publique north of the city and public gardens, such as the Jardins de Luxembourg. \u201cIt\u2019s not reasonable,\u201d Dr Alain Ducardonnet, a cardiologist, told French TV channel BFMTV. \u201cBut we have difficulty changing our behaviour. Normally the constraints on us are relatively limited and in 48 hours we have to change \u2026 but it\u2019s the only way to limit the spread of the virus.\u201d J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, head of France\u2019s national health authority, Sant\u00e9 Publique France, had already sounded an alarm over the number of young people with coronavirus being treated in intensive care. \u201cIf you talk to hospital doctors and intensive care staff, they are shocked by the influx of seriously ill patients, especially the young,\u201d Salomon said. He added: \u201cWe are heading towards a general epidemic in the very next few days, but everything depends on the behaviour of the virus and above all people\u2019s respect for barrier measures.

On Sunday, French economy minister Bruno Le Maire said the country was not planning to introduce any kind of rationing on food and household products, but asked that people behave with restraint. \u201cThere will be no shortages in terms of what products people can buy; there\u2019s no problem of supplies, so there will be no rationing,\u201d Le Maire said. \u201cBut we are calling on French people to behave responsibly.

      "bodyText": "The populist leaders of Brazil and Mexico have come under fire after publicly thumbing their noses at growing fears over the spread of the coronavirus. In recent days both Brazil\u2019s Jair Bolsonaro and Mexico\u2019s Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2013 nationalists from opposite ends of the political spectrum \u2013 have enraged opponents and observers by making high-profile public appearances in which they came into close physical contact with citizens. They did so in defiance of medical advice and despite growing alarm over the spread of the virus through Latin America, where at least 17 countries have confirmed cases. Bolsonaro, a far-right rabble-rouser who recently dismissed coronavirus as a media \u201cfantasy\u201d, left his presidential palace on Sunday to exchange fist bumps and mingle with supporters who turned out for highly controversial protests targeting Brazil\u2019s democratic institutions. \u201cThis is priceless. We politicians must change Brazil\u2019s destiny,\u201d Bolsonaro enthused during his hour-long jaunt, during which he used supporters\u2019 mobile phones to take selfies before handing them back into the crowd. Bolsonaro left his palace despite reportedly being placed in isolation there on Friday after members of a Brazilian delegation to the US, which he led, were found to have contracted the virus. Bolsonaro claimed he tested negative for coronavirus on Friday after initial reports that a preliminary test came back positive. The president is due to repeat the test next week and at least five senior officials have been confirmed to have coronavirus, including communications chief F\u00e1bio Wajngarten and ambassador to the US Nestor Forster. On Friday one of Bolsonaro\u2019s doctors told the conservative Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper the president would be \u201cquarantined\u201d until early next week. Bolsonaro\u2019s decision to ignore that advice on Sunday sparked fury among critics and commentators. Gleisi Hoffmann, president of Brazil\u2019s leftist Workers\u2019 party, tweeted: \u201cThe country needs a responsible and serious government that thinks first about the population. But what we have in the presidency is a loud-mouthed coward who behaves like a boor.\u201d The political commentator Vera Magalh\u00e3es tweeted: \u201cPresident Bolsonaro is promoting corona day.\u201d Major cities including Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo have unveiled tough measures to fight coronavirus, including the closure of schools, creches, nightclubs and cinemas. Brazilian authorities have confirmed at least 121 cases and have advised citizens to remain at home. But on Sunday Bolsonaro used his official Twitter account to encourage controversial street protests targeting his political enemies in Congress. One prominent Bolsonarista congressman tweeted: \u201cPandemic my arse\u201d. In an editorial, the Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo lamented: \u201cThe major crisis Brazil now faces isn\u2019t the stuttering economy or the threat of coronavirus. The real crisis is lacking a government when one is needed most.\u201d Mexico\u2019s leftwing president, L\u00f3pez Obrador, who some compare to Bolsonaro despite their ideological differences, is also facing criticism for what many see as his cavalier attitude to the crisis. On Saturday, as authorities announced schools would be suspended until at least 20 April, he tweeted a video of himself hugging fans, posing for photos and even kissing one child during a visit to the south-western state of Guerrero. \u201cLeaving the hotel in Ometepec, I greeted and attended to the petitions of the people,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador tweeted. The president, best known as Amlo, also suggested Mexicans read Love in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, calling it \u201ca balm to calm us\u201d. Confirmed Covid-19 cases in Mexico continued to increase: 41 were counted on Saturday, according to the health secretariat, 15 more than the day before. Mexico has been slow to impose travel restrictions and testing has been scant. The public education secretariat, however, announced an extension of the Easter break, starting on 20 March. Not all public events have been called off, with Amlo\u2019s administration citing economic considerations. The Mexican football league continues and a massive music festival headlined by Guns N\u2019 Roses attracted 40,000 fans on Saturday. Xavier Tello, a healthcare consultant in Mexico City, said health authorities were slowly changing their position but their leader remained in \u201ctotal denial\u201d. \u201cAnd that\u2019s dangerous,\u201d he said. On Sunday morning, L\u00f3pez Obrador briefly alluded to the global health crisis, telling reporters: \u201cI have great faith that we will move our dear Mexico forwards, that misfortunes and pandemics won\u2019t affect us. Nothing of the sort.\u201d",

Everyone in Wuhan, a city of 11 million, ordered their food online, and had it delivered. And the strategy worked. In seven weeks China <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/how-did-china-get-grips-with-coronavirus-outbreak\" title=\"\">stopped the epidemic</a> in its tracks.

What is the scientific justification for this departure from WHO policy? I have questions:</p> <p>Why have they abandoned population testing and contact tracing to identify and seclude clusters of infections? They recommend only testing cases in hospital. Won\u2019t this strategy ensure that the spread of the virus is intense and will cause more infections and more deaths in the near term?</p> <p>Why do they recommend self-isolation only for people with symptoms when Maria Van Kerkhove of the WHO reports that \u201cit seems that people shed more virus in the early phases rather than the late phases of disease\u201d?

Without an all-out national mobilisation for social distancing, are the behavioural and nudge strategies really evidence-based to flatten the peak? Or simply based on models?</p> <p>Why are we emphasising herd immunity now? Does coronavirus induce strong herd immunity or is it like flu, where immunity remains weak and new strains emerge each year? We have much to learn about Covid-19 immune responses.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/who-declares-coronavirus-pandemic\" title=\"\">declaring a pandemic</a>: \u201cThe idea that countries should shift from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>Shouldn\u2019t we wait to see the China situation? They have contained the epidemic after seven weeks of intensive national effort. Will epidemics break out again in new states? Maybe.

Is it wise or ethical to adopt a policy that threatens immediate casualties on the basis of uncertain future benefit?</p> <p>What is the policy to promote social distancing? How can we promote advice for families, mass gatherings, schools, workplaces, restaurants, theatres? And can we make it locally relevant? School closures might be phased depending on the intensity of transmission based on local data about clusters, as they did in Singapore.

Why are we emphasising herd immunity now? Does coronavirus induce strong herd immunity or is it like flu, where immunity remains weak and new strains emerge each year? We have much to learn about Covid-19 immune responses. Doesn\u2019t this contradict WHO policy? Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said after declaring a pandemic: \u201cThe idea that countries should shift from containment to mitigation is wrong and dangerous.\u201d Shouldn\u2019t we wait to see the China situation? They have contained the epidemic after seven weeks of intensive national effort. Will epidemics break out again in new states? Maybe. Will their strengthened systems not contain them quickly and effectively? What is their herd immunity to date? We don\u2019t have the data available but new tests are coming online. It might be substantial, without a massive epidemic. The WHO policy \u2013 practised by China, South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong \u2013 is to keep things damped down until drugs and a vaccine are available. Vaccines are a safer way to develop herd immunity, without the risks associated with the disease itself. Is it wise or ethical to adopt a policy that threatens immediate casualties on the basis of uncertain future benefit? What is the policy to promote social distancing? How can we promote advice for families, mass gatherings, schools, workplaces, restaurants, theatres? And can we make it locally relevant? School closures might be phased depending on the intensity of transmission based on local data about clusters, as they did in Singapore. But we need testing and sharing of information online for local decisions. Finally, on the precautionary principle, shouldn\u2019t we go all out to damp this epidemic down, with all possible measures, whether evidence is strong, uncertain or weak, and worry about herd immunity when we have more evidence? The stated government policy is to allow 40 million people to become infected. This could mean 6 million hospital admissions, 2 million requiring special or intensive care, and 402,000 deaths if the chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty\u2019s 1% estimate of mortality is correct. We can suppress this epidemic in the way that China and other countries have done. Then we can worry about how to loosen up, and hope that a vaccine comes onboard. But we need to act now. Every day of delay will mean more people become infected or die. \u2022 Anthony Costello is professor of global health and sustainable development at University College London and a former director of maternal and child health at the WHO",

But Cohn argued on Friday that the spread of Covid-19 had already \u201ccurtailed consumer demand\u201d and that it was \u201cmost likely \u2026 we are already in a recession\u201d, a view shared by experts including Barack Obama\u2019s former top economic adviser, Jason Furman. On Friday, he said that \u201cat this point, this feels much worse than 2008\u201d, the last global financial crisis. The latest numbers from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which have not been updated since Friday, document 1,629 confirmed US cases of Covid-19, with 41 fatalities. Other estimates are higher and most experts think thousands of cases have not been diagnosed, in part because of a slow start to testing. Mnuchin\u2019s confidence in the economy came in the face of state and local leaders mandating policy designed to limit exposure to the virus. Eighteen states, for example, have announced some form of school closure. In Illinois, schools will be closed from 17 March until the end of the month and St Patrick\u2019s Day celebrations over the weekend were severely curtailed. On Sunday, Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, issued stinging criticism of Trump. \u201cWe [state governors] are the ones who\u2019ve had to provide the leadership because the federal government just has fallen down on this,\u201d he told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u201cSo they didn\u2019t advise us to shut down major events, sporting events, parades, we made those decisions on our own. They are not the ones that advised us to close schools, we made those decisions on our own. So we are on our own out here. I wish we had leadership from Washington, we are not getting it.\u201d Ohio\u2019s governor, Mike DeWine, a Republican, has closed schools until 3 April. He said he was considering closing all bars and restaurants. \u201cWe are certainly looking at that,\u201d he said, also on NBC. \u201cYou know, we started off last week closing the schools. We reduced the number of people gathered together to 100. You know, we have restricted access to our nursing homes, to our prisons. So we are taking tough steps \u2026 Every day counts so much and you just cannot wait.\u201d On Saturday Florida\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, a Republican, urged the White House to consider restricting domestic travel, after a fourth death in his state. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing cases where people clearly contracted it somewhere else and brought it here,\u201d DeSantis said. The comments came shortly after Trump \u2013 who was tested for coronavirus on Friday and found to be clear \u2013 expanded a European travel ban to include the UK and Ireland, and cautioned that the administration was considering domestic restrictions. On ABC, Fauci said: \u201cTravel restrictions within the country have not been seriously discussed. I don\u2019t see that now in the immediate future.\u201d",

Johnson, who for most of his time in office has shown little enthusiasm for exposing himself to media scrutiny, announced the plan after the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said daily briefings were needed to ensure people got \u201cmuch clearer guidance\u201d on what the government was doing and why. All three Labour leadership candidates and Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, had also demanded greater clarity. On Monday, Johnson is also due to hold a conference call with British manufacturers, who will be urged to switch production to start making the ventilators required by hospitals, and he will participate in a conference call with fellow G7 leaders in which he will be calling for global action to fight the disease and its economic impact. Calls for a daily ministerial press conference intensified over the weekend, following at least three incidents of Whitehall giving out contradictory messages over coronavirus, with the uncertainty compounded by the fact that some key reporting was based on unattributable sources. On Friday morning Vallance gave an interview defending the government\u2019s decision not to ban large sporting events \u2013 only for No 10 to brief that evening that a ban would soon be implemented. In his interview Vallance also spoke about the potential advantage of the UK acquiring some element of herd immunity to coronavirus. But his comments triggered a fierce backlash on social media, with people claiming it amounted to evidence that the government was happy for large numbers of people to get coronavirus. On Sunday Matt Hancock, the health secretary, had to distance himself from Vallance, saying \u201cherd immunity is not our goal or policy\u201d. The health secretary then found himself being contradicted by officials in Scotland. He said the government would soon ask the over-70s to \u201cstay self-isolated\u201d at home for four months, but his use of the term \u201cself-isolate\u201d was taken by some to mean the elderly would be told not just to minimise contact with others, but to avoid it altogether. Although Johnson\u2019s decision to front many of the daily press conferences himself will be seen as testimony to the seriousness with which he is approaching the crisis, former Labour health secretary Andy Burnham, now mayor of Greater Manchester, said it would be better for the chief medical officer to chair the daily government briefings. Burnham added that this was what happened when the government was handling swine flu during his time in office and that everything became \u201ca bit calmer\u201d when the official briefings were no longer entangled with politics. Although a poll at the weekend suggests 53% of voters trust the government to deal with the pandemic, ministers have come under pressure to explain why the UK is not matching some of the tougher measures being taken in other European countries, where bars, restaurants and non-essential shops have been closed, as well as schools. In an interview on Sunday, Hancock rejected the claim that the UK measures were out of step with what was happening elsewhere. \u201cWe are similar to many countries,\u201d he claimed. \u201cFor instance, we are very similar to the approach being taken in Germany and Australia and others. \u201cIt is about making sure you do the right thing at the right time.

None of those decisions are made yet.</p> <p>\u201cWe understand that they have to make their own decisions. But we are trying to look at it in the context of the whole competition.\u201d</p> <p>FFA announced earlier that fans will not be able to attend the remaining six rounds of the men\u2019s competition and the women\u2019s title decider between Melbourne City and Sydney FC.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an unprecedented time and extremely complex for the sport and society at large,\u201d FFA CEO James Johnson said.</p> <p>There is also the likelihood the rest of the A-League season will be compressed into three or four weeks, with shorter turnarounds in between matches. A decision on the finals series is yet to be made.</p> <p>\u201cWe have got 30 matches left, six competition rounds to go, it is our intent to compress the rest of that season,\u201d FFA\u2019s head of leagues Greg O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cWe have spoken to the clubs. And we\u2019re now speaking to the venues to see whether or not it\u2019s possible for us to complete those six rounds in three to four weeks.</p> <p>\u201cWe will also have all our games behind closed doors. We think, at this point of time, that is a better solution ... rather than suspend it.\u201d</p> <p>The Australian government\u2019s requirement that all travellers Australia arriving in Australia from Monday will have to self-isolate for a period of 14 days means matches involving Melbourne Victory and Wellington Phoenix will not proceed in rounds 24 and 25.</p> <p>The Phoenix, who are likely to leave New Zealand on Tuesday, will play the remainder of their games in Australia once out of isolation.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not helpful ... but both of those clubs are willing to participate,\u201d FFA\u2019s head of leagues, Greg O\u2019Rourke said.</p> <p>FFA also confirmed that grassroots football, including under-age competitions, can continue but with additional measures implemented, including recommended hygiene measures and appropriate social distancing at football matches.</p> <p>\u201cThe scale of football means that we have a key role to play in maintaining the health and wellbeing of Australians, as well as their families and the wider community,\u201d Johnson said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are doing so by allowing people to play, in line with the current government position but with additional guidance to further improve social distancing at football fields around the country.\u201d</p>",

The New Zealand-based Warriors will play Canberra on the Gold Coast on Saturday, but whether they return home after that remains unclear. Even if they did, Greenberg said the NRL season could still go ahead. \u201cOf course we want all 16 clubs playing in the competition but that\u2019s a step ... we\u2019ll only get to that after this weekend,\u201d Greenberg said. \u201cAt the end of round two, they\u2019re going to make some key decisions. None of those decisions are made yet. \u201cWe understand that they have to make their own decisions. But we are trying to look at it in the context of the whole competition.\u201d FFA announced earlier that fans will not be able to attend the remaining six rounds of the men\u2019s competition and the women\u2019s title decider between Melbourne City and Sydney FC. \u201cThis is an unprecedented time and extremely complex for the sport and society at large,\u201d FFA CEO James Johnson said. There is also the likelihood the rest of the A-League season will be compressed into three or four weeks, with shorter turnarounds in between matches. A decision on the finals series is yet to be made. \u201cWe have got 30 matches left, six competition rounds to go, it is our intent to compress the rest of that season,\u201d FFA\u2019s head of leagues Greg O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cWe have spoken to the clubs. And we\u2019re now speaking to the venues to see whether or not it\u2019s possible for us to complete those six rounds in three to four weeks. \u201cWe will also have all our games behind closed doors. We think, at this point of time, that is a better solution ... rather than suspend it.\u201d The Australian government\u2019s requirement that all travellers Australia arriving in Australia from Monday will have to self-isolate for a period of 14 days means matches involving Melbourne Victory and Wellington Phoenix will not proceed in rounds 24 and 25. The Phoenix, who are likely to leave New Zealand on Tuesday, will play the remainder of their games in Australia once out of isolation. \u201cIt\u2019s not helpful ... but both of those clubs are willing to participate,\u201d FFA\u2019s head of leagues, Greg O\u2019Rourke said. FFA also confirmed that grassroots football, including under-age competitions, can continue but with additional measures implemented, including recommended hygiene measures and appropriate social distancing at football matches. \u201cThe scale of football means that we have a key role to play in maintaining the health and wellbeing of Australians, as well as their families and the wider community,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe are doing so by allowing people to play, in line with the current government position but with additional guidance to further improve social distancing at football fields around the country.\u201d",
