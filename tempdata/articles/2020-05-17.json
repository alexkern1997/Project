Tens of thousands of impoverished migrant workers are on the move across India, walking on highways and railway tracks or riding in trucks, buses and crowded trains in blazing heat, Associated Press reports. Some are accompanied by pregnant wives and young children, braving threats from the coronavirus pandemic. They say they have been forced to leave cities and towns where they had toiled for years building homes and roads after they were abandoned by their employers casualties of a nationwide lockdown to stop the virus from spreading. On Saturday, at least 23 laborers died in northern India when a truck they were traveling in smashed into a stationary truck on a highway. Last week, a train crashed into a group of tired workers who fell asleep on the tracks while walking back home in western Maharashtra state, killing 16. The government and charities have tried to set up shelters for them, but their numbers are simply overwhelming, leaving them little choice but to head on a perilous journey home. Brazil confirmed 14,919 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, as well as 816 related deaths, according to data from the country\u2019s health ministry. Brazil has now registered 233,142 confirmed coronavirus cases since the start of the pandemic, the fifth highest in the world, and 15,633 deaths. Hello, I\u2019m taking over from my colleague Jedidajah Otte in London. If you think we\u2019ve missed a story or want to draw our attention to something please do get in touch. My email is rebecca.ratcliffe@theguardian.com and I\u2019m @rebeccarat on Twitter. Italy\u2019s prime minister Giuseppe Conte announced the easing of a series of lockdown restrictions, including the reopening of all shops, bars, restaurants and hairdressers, from 18 May, and free travel to Italy for people coming from EU countries from 3 June without having to undergo quarantine. Nepal has reported its first coronavirus death late on Saturday, a 29-year-old woman who recently gave birth, as the total number of people infected in the country reached 281. Ireland recorded 92 more cases, the lowest daily number in nine weeks, with the total now at 24,048. A further 15 people with Covid-19 have died in Ireland, which brings the country\u2019s official death toll to 1,533.Turkey records lowest death toll since end of March Turkey\u2019s health ministry said 41 more people have died from Covid-19 in the 24 hours to Saturday, bringing the death toll to 4,096. The daily death toll is the lowest registered since the end of March. Dozens of people were detained in the Polish capital of Warsaw during a protest by business owners against coronavirus restrictions. 19 protesters were arrested in London, and police dispersed rallies in several German cities. Tens of thousands of India\u2019s migrant workers on the move, as impoverished workers are leaving cities and walking on highways and railway tracks towards their home communities as they see themselves forced to leave cities and towns after they were abandoned by their employers amid the nationwide coronavirus lockdown. Schoolchildren and their families will be tested for coronavirus if they develop symptoms, the British education secretary Gavin Williamson announced on Saturday in a bid to reassure parents and appease unions, as some children in England are set to go back to school on 1 June. The Israeli government has approved the resumption of school for all grades in areas that are not considered coronavirus hotspots, starting on Sunday. Beaches will officially open on Wednesday. The Spanish government will seek to extend its coronavirus state of emergency for the last time until late June, as the country\u2019s daily death toll reached a near eight-week low. Lockdown easing is driving up infections in New York, the governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, said on Saturday. The state\u2019s new confirmed Covid-19 cases are predominantly coming from people who left their homes to go shop, exercise or socialise, and not from essential workers. The state\u2019s daily death toll was 157 and half the regions in the state are now in the process of reopening. That\u2019s all from me, thanks for reading and writing in. It\u2019s midnight in London now but my colleagues over in Australia are just gearing up for another day of news, which you can follow here: I\u2019m now handing over to my colleague Rebecca Ratcliffe. The British government is to invest \u00a393m ($112m) to bring forward the opening of a new vaccine-manufacturing centre ready to begin production if a coronavirus vaccine is found. The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis) said on Saturday that the Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre (VMIC) will now open in summer 2021 - 12 months earlier than planned, the Press Association reports. The not-for-profit facility, located on the Harwell Science and Innovation Campus in Oxford, will have the capacity to produce enough doses for the entire UK population in as little as six months. A further \u00a338m is being invested in a rapid deployment facility which will be able to begin manufacturing at scale from the summer of this year if a vaccine becomes available before the new centre is complete. Officials said the VMIC would also boost the UK\u2019s long-term capacity for dealing with future viruses and accelerate the production of vaccines for existing illnesses such as the flu virus. Announcing the investment, business secretary Alok Sharma said: \u201cOnce a breakthrough is made, we need to be ready to manufacture a vaccine by the millions.\u201d Nepal has reported its first coronavirus death late on Saturday, a 29-year-old woman who recently gave birth, as the total number of people infected in the country reached 281. The victim, who was from Sindhupalchowk district, some 90 kilometres (about 55 miles) from the capital Kathmandu, was on her way to a hospital for treatment when she died, Agence France-Presse reports. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau said on Saturday that his government had approved the first Canadian clinical trials of a potential Covid-19 vaccine, at Dalhousie University\u2019s Canadian Center for Vaccinology in Nova Scotia. The candidate vaccine was developed by Chinese pharmaceutical company CanSino Biologics, two Canadian government spokesmen said, according to Reuters. Canada\u2019s National Research Council on Tuesday said it was collaborating with CanSino to \u201cpave the way\u201d for future Canadian trials. The council will work with manufacturers so that the vaccine can be produced in Canada if the trials are successful, Trudeau said. Trudeau also said he would look at possible ways to help airlines further, but laid out no new measures after the country\u2019s biggest airline announced mass layoffs due to the coronavirus pandemic. Air Canada said on Friday it would cut its workforce by up to 60% as the airline tries to save cash amid the Covid-19 pandemic and adjust to a lower level of traffic. The World Health Organization has warned countries ending lockdown that now should be a \u201ctime for preparation, not celebration\u201d, to avoid a deadly winter surge in new infections, my colleague Emma Graham-Harrison reports. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a total of 1,435,098 coronavirus cases on Saturday, an increase of 22,977 cases from its previous count, and said the number of deaths had risen by 1,325 to 87,315. The CDC reported its tally of Covid-19 cases, caused by the new coronavirus, as of 15 May, compared with its count a day earlier, Reuters reports. The former US president Barack Obama criticised some officials overseeing the coronavirus response on Saturday, telling college graduates in an online commencement address that the pandemic shows many officials \u201caren\u2019t even pretending to be in charge\u201d. Obama spoke on Show Me Your Walk, HBCU Edition, a two-hour livestreaming event for historically black colleges and universities broadcast on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. His remarks were surprisingly political and touched on current events beyond the virus and its social and economic impacts. \u201cMore than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said. Obama did not name president Donald Trump or any other federal or state officials. Here my colleague Jessica Glenza\u2019s story: Schools and beaches in Israel will reopen this week as the country further lifts its lockdown, Haaretz reports. The government has approved the resumption of school for all grades in areas that are not considered coronavirus hotspots. The return to school starting on Sunday will be at the discretion of local authorities. Some regional councils have already announced that they will delay the opening of schools by a day due to difficulties in organising school buses at such short notice. Beaches will officially open on Wednesday, but thousands of people already flocked to Tel Aviv\u2019s beaches over the weekend despite a ban still being in place. Palestinian prime minister Mohammad Shtayyeh announced that the Palestinian government will allow shops to reopen from Saturday and up until next Friday, from morning until the evening and during the Ramadan break-fast meal. The Spanish government will re-open some airports on several islands and in the southern part of the country to international travel, the country\u2019s transport minister Jose Luis Abalos, announced on Saturday. More details are expected Sunday, Abalos said, according to CNN. \u201cTomorrow [Sunday] I will sign a resolution so the airports of Tenerife Sur, Alicante-Elche, Sevilla, Menorca and Ibiza become designated points of entry, capable of handling international public health emergencies,\u201d Abalos tweeted. \u201cLittle by little, other centers will be opened.\u201d Here is another amazing picture of today\u2019s Bundesliga match between Borussia Dortmund and Schalke 04 that was played in \u201ceerie silence\u201d at the Signal Iduna Park stadium in Dortmund, Germany on Saturday. US swing states such as Michigan and Wisconsin helped bring Donald Trump to power in 2016. How they handle the pandemic may well be crucial at the presidential election this November too, writes my colleague David Smith. Restaurants can now reopen in New Orleans, a city famous for its cuisine, but they must take reservations and limit the number of diners, the Associated Press reports. US officials cautiously eased more restrictions on Saturday regarding eateries, shops and outdoor venues as they tried to restart local economies without triggering a surge in new coronavirus infections. New Orleans took its first steps on Saturday to loosen restrictions that have been in place for two months, one day after the rest of Louisiana state did the same. The city is restricting buildings to 25% of capacity, like the rest of the state, but also requires restaurants, nail salons and other businesses to take customers by reservation. New Orleans has capped the number of people allowed in houses of worship and movie theatres at fewer than 100. Malls and retail stores can reopen, but casinos, video poker, live entertainment and bars are still closed. Some restaurateurs in the city decided to try reopening. Others planned to stick to takeout or stay closed all together. So far, the pandemic has killed more than 88,000 people in the US. Italy\u2019s prime minister Giuseppe Conte has announced the easing of a series of lockdown restrictions, including the reopening of all shops, bars, restaurants and hairdressers, from 18 May, provided that the regional guidelines aimed at containing the risk of infection are observed. In an address to the nation on Saturday evening, Conte said efforts to control the coronavirus outbreak had brought results, and that Italy was ready for a new phase in the fight against the pandemic, provided there was enough trust and responsibility in the population. On 25 May, gyms, swimming pools and sports centres will be able to open, but will be required to adhere to safety protocols. From 3 June, people can travel from region to region, unless the Italian government exercises containment measures based on the risk of infection in any given area, and people arriving from EU member states will no longer be subject to a mandatory quarantine. Conte added that specific restrictions could be introduced at local level if necessary. More certainties were needed, he said, before the country\u2019s top football league, Serie A, could resume games, but said teams were allowed to resume full squad training from 18 May. \u201cWe are taking a calculated risk, aware that the contagion curve could rise again,\u201d Conte told reporters in the courtyard of his official Rome residence, according to Bloomberg. \u201cWe are taking this risk and we have to accept it, otherwise we could not restart. We cannot wait for a vaccine.\u201d Schoolchildren and their families will be tested for coronavirus if they develop symptoms, the British education secretary Gavin Williamson announced on Saturday in a bid to reassure parents and appease unions. With some children in England set to go back to school on 1 June under proposals announced last week, relations between teaching unions and the government became fraught in recent days. My colleague Mattha Busby has more: A further 15 people with Covid-19 have died in Ireland, which brings the country\u2019s official death toll to 1,533. There have also been 92 new cases of the virus, the lowest daily number in nine weeks, with the total now at 24,048, the Department of Health confirmed on Saturday, according to RTE. \u201cToday is the first time we have seen the number of confirmed cases fall below 100 since mid-March,\u201d said Tony Holohan, chief medical officer in the department. \u201cWhile the past nine weeks have been particularly difficult for those cocooning, and for parents with young children, today\u2019s numbers give reassurance that we have all learned and adopted new behaviours of handwashing, respiratory etiquette and social distance that will serve us well as we work together to re-open retail, business and society.\u201d Tens of thousands of impoverished migrant workers are on the move across India, walking on highways and railway tracks or riding in trucks, buses and crowded trains in blazing heat. Some are accompanied by pregnant wives and young children, and say they have been forced to leave cities and towns after they were abandoned by their employers amid the nationwide coronavirus lockdown, the Associated Press reports. The government and charities have tried to set up shelters for them, but their numbers are simply overwhelming, leaving them little choice but to head on a perilous journey home. Last week, a train crashed into a group of tired workers who fell asleep on the tracks while walking back home in western Maharashtra state, killing 16. \u201cI dont know what the future holds for me,\u201d said Hari Ram, a 28-year-old mason who set out for his village in central India this week on foot, hoping to hitch a ride on the way. \u201cOne thing is certain: If I die, I will die in my home. I will never set foot in New Delhi again,\u201d he said. Half of India\u2019s population earns less than $3 a day. Over 90% of the workforce is employed in the informal sector, without access to social protection benefits such as paid sick leave or insurance, according to the World Bank. The exodus of these migrant workers is causing worries for India\u2019s top consumer goods companies, which fear a possible labour shortage as they resume production. A group of migrants rescued off the coast of Fuerteventura have been placed in mandatory quarantine on arrival as Spain moves to reduce the likelihood of imported virus cases, local officials said Saturday. Their boat was pulled to safety by the Spanish coastguard on Friday night and all 38 migrants were taken to a port on Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands, Agence France-Presse reports. The migrants were rescued on the day that Spain began imposing a new mandatory 14-day quarantine on any incoming travellers arriving by sea or air in a bid to avoid any imported coronavirus cases. The new measures will remain in force until 24 May when the state of emergency expires, although the government on Saturday signalled its intent to extend the restrictions until the end of June. Tourists from England have continued to flout the stricter lockdown rules in Wales and have travelled to the country\u2019s tourist destinations, the Press Association reports. The lockdown rules have been relaxed in England so people can now \u201cdrive to other destinations\u201d and meet one person outside their households outdoors. But in Wales the stricter stay-at-home rules remain in force and people must exercise locally. Police forces across Wales have continued to patrol beaches, coastal areas, and other public spaces, with the weather forecast to be sunny, and have also been conducting checks on motorists. A tourist from New York was arrested in Hawaii after he posted beach pictures on Instagram while he was supposed to be in quarantine, CNN reports. The 23-year-old man was arrested for violating Hawaii\u2019s mandatory 14-day quarantine rule and for \u201cunsworn falsification to authority,\u201d the Hawaii governor\u2019s office said in a statement. He arrived in O\u2019ahu on Monday and quickly posted numerous pictures of himself on the beach on Instagram. He allegedly used public transportation to get to the many places he was pictured, the statement said. \u201cAuthorities became aware of his social media posts from citizens who saw posts of him - on the beach with a surfboard, sunbathing, and walking around Waikiki at night,\u201d the governor\u2019s office added. Turkey\u2019s health ministry says 41 more people have died from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 4,096. The daily death toll is the lowest registered since the end of March. Minister Fahrettin Koca tweeted on Saturday that 1,610 new infections had been confirmed, bringing the total number of cases to 148,067 in the country of 82 million people. Fifteen provinces, including Istanbul, are on a four-day lockdown, one of a series of temporary and regional lockdowns Turkey has instituted to combat the pandemic, the Associated Press reports. People under 20 and above 65 have been stuck at home for weeks, but are now allowed to leave for a few hours on allotted days. Other easing measures have gone into effect, including the opening of malls, barbershops and hair dressers. The number of provinces under lockdown on weekends and national holidays has dropped from 31 to 15. Also on Saturday, Turkey\u2019s tourism minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy told private broadcaster NTV he hoped for domestic tourism to begin after 28 May, subject to coronavirus statistics continuing on a downward trend. Churches in New York are being used as temporary coronavirus testing centres in an effort to bolster outreach to Black and Latinx neighborhoods, the Huffington Post reports. People queued in a long socially distanced line around the block to get tested at Bethany Baptist Church, a congregation in Brooklyn, New York, just one day after it had launched its testing site. Bethany Baptist is one of 11 temporary Covid-19 testing sites that opened at New York churches this week. Burundi holds its first competitive presidential election next week since a civil war erupted in 1993, but simmering political violence and fears that campaign rallies could accelerate the spread of the coronavirus have marred campaigning, Reuters reports. President Pierre Nkurunziza, who has faced accusations of political repression at home and abroad, is stepping down after 15 years in office, although the former rebel leader is set to remain a prominent force in the east African nation, one of the poorest countries in the world. Opponents boycotted the 2015 poll, accusing the government of election abuses and rights violations, charges it denied. French health authorities reported 96 new coronavirus deaths on Saturday, bringing the total to 27,625, the fourth highest in the world. The health ministry said the number of people in hospitals fell to 19,432 from 19,861 on Friday and the number of people in intensive care units dropped to 2,132 from 2,203 on Friday. Dozens of people, including a senator, were detained during a protest by business owners in the Polish capital against coronavirus restrictions, while police used tear gas against protesters, the Associated Press reports. The city of Warsaw said the gathering was illegal because it had not been previously approved. Jacek Bury, a senator for the opposition Civic Platform party, said he was hurt by police when trying to defend another protester. Warsaw police said they faced cases of aggression against police officers. Police denied using force against Bury. In Britain, anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine protesters held a gathering in Hyde Park in central London and were met by a heavy police presence. Officers tried to disperse the groups, threatening them with fines if they didn\u2019t comply. 19 people were arrested, the London metropolitan police service said. Police in several German cities enforced distancing rules as thousands of people gathered on Saturday to express a mix of frustrations at restrictions battering the economy and a perceived loss of civic freedom. The popularity of India\u2019s prime minister Narendra Modi has soared since the pandemic has started, with some approval ratings reaching 80 and even 90 per cent, the New York Times reports. But not everyone is rallying around Modi. An app designed to help control the spread of Covid-19 that was downloaded by 50 million users in one day is raising concerns that India\u2019s increasingly authoritarian government may be using the pandemic to further erode civil liberties. People living in low-infection zones of France, so-called green zones, were able to go to the beach after the government began easing restrictions on Monday. Local officials reopened selected beaches in Northern France and Mediterranean coasts on Saturday. Bathers took a dip in the sea or strolled along Nice\u2019s promenade on the French Riviera on Saturday, with many wearing protective masks, as the beach reopened to the public for the first time since a nationwide coronavirus lockdown in mid-March, Reuters reports. But there are new rules: individual activities such as swimming, fishing or surfing are allowed, provided social-distancing is respected, but sunbathing or staying on a beach for hours is not permitted. Interior minister Christophe Castaner went to Veules-Les-Roses beach in the northern region of Normandy to check on the situation. \u201cThe virus is still around. We must learn to live with it. One can go fishing but not linger on the beach for hours. We are all responsible in the fight against Covid-19,\u201d he said, warning that the easing of the restrictions would be reversed if people didn\u2019t respect the rules. The easing of France\u2019s eight-week lockdown, one of the strictest in Europe, started on 11 May, allowing non-essential shops, factories and other businesses to re-open. To date, France has recorded 141,919 cases and 27,529 deaths from the disease. Theatres, restaurants and bars will remain closed across the country until at least June. The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, said in a press briefing on Saturday that the state\u2019s new confirmed Covid-19 cases are predominantly coming from people who left their homes to go shop, exercise or socialise, and not from essential workers. \u201cThat person got infected and went to the hospital or that person got infected and went home and infected the other people at home,\u201d he said during his daily news conference. State data showed that the number of new cases statewide has fluctuated between 2,100 and 2,500 per day. The number of new cases decreased to 2,419 on Saturday from 2,762 on Friday. Cuomo said he had theorised last week that new cases were coming from essential workers. \u201cThat was exactly wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cThe infection rate among essential workers is lower than the general population and those new cases are coming predominantly from people who are not working and they are at home.\u201d Hospitalisations in the state were down again, as well as the number of new reported cases. The daily death toll was 157, Cuomo said, and half the regions in the state were now in the process of reopening. \u201cWe just want to make sure we don\u2019t go back to the hell that we\u2019ve gone through,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem here are crowds and gatherings,\u201d he said, stressing that economic activity would have to resume \u201cwithout the crowds\u201d. Italy\u2019s coronavirus death toll has risen to 31,763, as a further 153 deaths were reported, its lowest 24-hour increase in deaths since 9 March. Lombardy, the region most severely affected by coronavirus, registered 39 deaths, down from 115 on Friday, my colleague Angela Giuffrida reports. New infections rose by 875, up by 86 from Friday, with 399 of the cases in Lombardy. The day before, 242 deaths had been reported, the Civil Protection Agency said, while the daily tally of new cases increased to 875 from 789 on Friday. The country\u2019s total official death toll now stands at 31,763 the agency said, the third highest in the world after those of the United States and Britain. Italy has 224,260 confirmed cases of Covid-19 to date, including the deaths and 122,810 survivors. People registered as currently carrying the illness fell to 70,187 from 72,070 the day before. There were 775 people in intensive care on Saturday, down from 808 on Friday, maintaining a long-running decline. Domestic flights between major cities in Pakistan took off again for the first time in nearly two months on Saturday. Passengers are required to wear face masks and vacant seats need to be left between passengers, officials said, according to Reuters. International flights will remain suspended till 31 May. \u201cIn view of the difficulties faced by passengers in traveling between major cities, the Federal Government has allowed limited domestic flight operations from five major airports, Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar and Quetta with effect from May 16,\u201d said a statement issued by the Aviation Division. Domestic and chartered flight operations will require disinfection of the aircraft prior to boarding. No food and beverages will be allowed during domestic flights, the statement added. Prime minister Imran Khan on Friday said that the country could not afford an indefinite lockdown and the nation would have to learn to live with the pandemic. Dozens of babies born to Ukrainian surrogate mothers are trapped in lockdown and unable to join their adoptive parents abroad as the country\u2019s borders remain closed, CNN reports. Lyudmila Denisova, the Ukrainian parliament\u2019s human rights ombudsman, said in a briefing on Thursday that she is working with the country\u2019s Foreign Ministry to help their parents get permits to enter the country. BioTexCom, a reproduction clinic, said in a video posted online that 46 babies are currently in its care at the Hotel Venice, a facility in Kiev that parents from US, UK, Spain and other countries are trying to travel to so they can take home their children. \u201cWe ask other countries to make an exception from their policy and to let their citizens to unite with their children,\u201d BioTexCom lawyer Denis Herman said. Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, just announced an increase to the country\u2019s child benefit, which was introduced four years ago, to help families struggling because of the pandemic. \u201cTo all the moms and dads out there: This means that your monthly CCB payments will go up this July to help you pay for things like food, clothes, and activities you and your family can do together at home. And next week, you\u2019ll get an extra one-time payment of $300 per child,\u201d Trudeau wrote on Twitter. \u201cYou should be able to focus on what matters most right now: raising your kids and keeping your family healthy. And by increasing your monthly CCB payments, we\u2019re making sure that\u2019s exactly what you can do,\u201d he added. Canada\u2019s death toll has increased to 5,595, up from 5,499, as the country\u2019s number of confirmed coronavirus infections has risen to 74,993 from 73,818, according to Reuters. Several US states are beginning to reopen, but are struggling to come up with effective tracing programs, my colleague Joanna Walters reports. Local health departments charged with tracking down everyone who has been in close contact with those who test positive for coronavirus are still scrambling to hire the number of people they need to do the job. Read the full report here: Some beaches in Greece, France and Italy opened today, and there are various reports that people wasted no time to take the opportunity. More than 500 beaches reopened across Greece, although with strict physical distancing rules, and citizens in Athens flocked to the city\u2019s shores, according to MailOnline. Government guidelines state no more than 40 people are allowed per 1,000 sq metres (10,750 sq ft), while umbrella poles have to be 4 metres (13 ft) apart, with canopies no closer than 1 metre. If you visited a Greek, Italian or French beach this weekend I\u2019d love to hear from you and see your pictures. The Spanish government will seek to extend its coronavirus state of emergency for the last time until late June, the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said on Saturday as the country\u2019s daily death toll reached a near eight-week low. \u201cThe path that we are taking is the only one possible,\u201d Sanchez said at a news conference, saying he would ask parliament for an extension of about a month until the end of June when most of the hard-hit nation should be returning to normality, according to Reuters. Spain first introduced a state of emergency decree on 14 March. Officials say that while the outbreak has been brought largely under control, restrictions must stay in place a bit longer as the lockdown is gradually phased out. The country\u2019s Covid-19 death toll rose by 102 to 27,563 on Saturday, the lowest daily increase since 18 March. Confirmed coronavirus cases climbed to 230,698 from 230,183, the health ministry said. After pushing four previous extensions through parliament, support for Sanchez\u2019s left-wing coalition is waning among lawmakers and voters. Some small protests against the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis and its economic fallout sprang up around Madrid this week, with demonstrators gathering to bang pots and pans and call for the government to resign. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what the demonstrations are about. The important thing is to maintain social distancing,\u201d Sanchez said. Hello, I\u2019ll be steering this blog through this evening, please feel free to get in touch with updates, you can get me on Twitter or you can email me. I\u2019m handing this live blog over to my colleague Jedidajah Otte now. Thanks for your company over the past few hours, and for all your emails and tweets. Zimbabwe will keep its coronavirus lockdown for the time being, though businesses will be allowed to open for longer and the restrictions will be reviewed every two weeks, the president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, has confirmed. The southern African nation, which has reported 42 cases and four deaths from coronavirus, went into lockdown on 30 March and has been gradually easing the measures to help revive its troubled economy. \u201cZimbabwe will ... continue on the level two lockdown for an indefinite period. The country needs to ease out of the lockdown in a strategic and gradual manner,\u201d Mnangagwa said in a live broadcast. Reuters reports that Mnangagwa said informal street markets, where millions of Zimbabweans eke a leaving selling everything from used clothes to vegetables, will remain shut while the government consults health specialists on how to reopen them safely. Businesses such as manufacturers, supermarkets and banks, which have been allowed to continue operating, will now be able to work between 8am and 4.30pm, compared with the six-hour day imposed previously. Shared taxi minibuses will remain banned, forcing commuters to use buses operated by the state, which have struggled to cope with demand. If you\u2019re in the UK \u2013 and plenty of other places, for that matter \u2013 then you might consider there is no time better spent than a Saturday afternoon holed up in the pub. Nowadays, it\u2019s takeaway pints if you are very lucky. This piece in the New York Times asks a troubling and pertinent question: will such a fundamental pillar of British life survive the Covid-19 crisis? Our US coronavirus live blog is now up, with Joanna Walters. The vast majority of states are reopening for some form of business this weekend, and all the latest is here: Thousands of Germans have taken to the streets to protest against restrictions imposed by the government to contain the coronavirus pandemic, according to police and organisers. Germany\u2019s death toll from the virus has been lower than most of its European neighbours and some lockdown measures have already been relaxed, Reuters reports. However, protests against the measures the chancellor, Angela Merkel, insists are needed to slow down the coronavirus outbreak have become more vocal and demonstrators have filled the streets for the second weekend in a row. Derided on social media as \u201ccovidiots\u201d who risk causing a second wave of infections that could lead to a tightening of restrictions, protesters staged demonstrations at several locations across the capital Berlin and the surrounding state of Brandenburg. In Stuttgart, where some protesters last weekend had been flouting social distancing rules and not wearing face masks, police expected another rally of up to 5,000 people. In Munich, organisers asked authorities to give the green light for a rally of up to 10,000 people on the Thersienwiese, a large square in the city centre on which Munich normally stages its world famous Oktoberfest beer festival. But city officials pointed to the need to respect social distancing rules and allowed a demonstration of up to 1,000 people. The hard core of protesters is being led by several new groups. One group is Resistance 2020, led by a lawyer from eastern Leipzig and a doctor from south-west Germany who question official corona statistics and view the main political parties as constructs of an elitist rule. Another group called Compact describes itself as the \u201csharp sword against imperial propaganda\u201d. German media have suggested Russia could be behind a misinformation campaign that is spurring on protesters. Coronavirus has so far infected more than 173,000 people in Germany and killed nearly 7,900. Most Germans approve of Merkel\u2019s crisis management, with polls showing support for her conservative CDU/CSU alliance surging to 40%. A survey released on Thursday showed 56% of the population back the current lockdown measures. Kenya\u2019s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, has banned movement across the country\u2019s borders with Tanzania and Somalia to help curb the spread of coronavirus. He exempted cargo trucks but said drivers would have to be tested for Covid-19. \u201cThere will be a cessation of movement of persons and any passenger-ferrying automobiles and vehicles into and out of the territory of Kenya through the Kenya-Tanzania international border,\u201d Kenyatta said in a televised address. The same measures would apply on the border with Somalia, he said. Reuters reports that Kenyatta also extended an existing dusk-to-dawn curfew by 21 days, as well as a ban on movement in and out of areas of Kenya worst hit by the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cI know there is growing global pressure for easing of measures against this disease and for all of us to get back to normal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to step up our defence by employing stricter, more localised prevention actions.\u201d Kenya has 830 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with 50 deaths. The UK\u2019s death toll from confirmed coronavirus cases has risen by 468 and now stands at 34,466. There have also been 3,451 new positive tests, making a total of 240,161 confirmed cases. Our UK live blog is covering this, and other developments from the United Kingdom, in full. Donald Trump\u2019s top health officials, Drs Deborah Birx and Anthony Fauci, reappeared at Friday\u2019s taskforce press briefing but \u2013 like other experts \u2013 have recently been absent from the media. This piece from Kenya Evelyn investigates their fluctuating public presence. As the White House increased control over communications and refocused its message toward reopening the economy, appearances by the pair and others had all but stopped. Before Friday, Birx and Fauci\u2019s most recent televised interviews occurred on 4 and 5 May, respectively. Other health officials, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director, Robert Redfield, surgeon general, Jerome Adams, and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner, Stephen Hahn, had not appeared in interviews since April. Here is the article in full: Hungary\u2019s government will gradually lift lockdown restrictions in Budapest from Monday, two weeks after it ended the lockdown in the rest of the country, the prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, said on his official Facebook page. \u201cIt has become clear that we have managed to curb the epidemic in Budapest as well,\u201d Orb\u00e1n said in a video, as reported by Reuters. \u201cTherefore, we can shift to the second phase of defence in Budapest as well, cautiously ... and thus we lift the lockdown.\u201d The number of coronavirus cases in Saudi Arabia has topped 50,000, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. An official reported 2,840 new cases, taking the cumulative total to 51,980. That was up from an average of around 1,500 new cases a day over the past week. The death toll in the kingdom increased by 10 to 302, the official said on state television. Saudi Arabia recorded its first Covid-19 infection on 2 March. Germany\u2019s top football division, the Bundesliga, will restart in a few minutes after its hiatus of more than two months. The big game is Borussia Dortmund v Schalke 04, probably the country\u2019s most hotly-contested local \u201cderby\u201d. Some may see it as welcome escapism in troubled times; others may regard it as needless folly. Whichever camp you sit in, our sport team are covering it with this live blog by Scott Murray: I\u2019m back with you for the next couple of hours now. You can contact me at nick.ames@theguardian.com or @NickAmes82. Thanks for following the Guardian live feed. I am running it for the next half an hour or so while Nick has a break. Please do send me your thoughts, comments and news tips. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Thailand on Saturday extended a ban on international passenger flights until the end of June, the country\u2019s aviation regulator said, as new cases in the country dwindle. The Civil Aviation Authority\u2019s ban extends a previous order that was set to run until the end of May. The announcement comes as the country begins to relax local restrictions after reporting single-digit increases of infections from the new coronavirus this month. On Sunday the government will allow malls and department stores to re-open. It will also shorten a nighttime curfew by one hour, to 2300 to 0400, from 2200 to 0400. The aviation regulator first introduced the suspension of international flights in April in a bid to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Thailand has reported a total of 3,025 cases of the coronavirus and 56 fatalities. The Watford manager, Nigel Pearson, has raised the possibility of a coronavirus-related death should the Premier League season resume too quickly. English top-flight teams could return to some type of training next week following a Premier League meeting on Monday where medical protocols will be voted on and there are plans to get matches going again by mid-June. Pearson, however, has doubts about \u201cProject Restart\u201d with much of Britain still in lockdown due to Covid-19. \u201cGod forbid we have a fatality,\u201d he told the Times. \u201cPeople are closing their eyes to the threat. Yes, we would like to restart it but it\u2019s got to be safe. We should be cautious. To ignore possibilities is foolhardy. It\u2019s about safeguarding people\u2019s health.\u201d Pearson, whose Watford side are just above the relegation zone on goal difference alone, added: \u201cWe have to try to believe [the British government] advice that we\u2019re being given that we\u2019ve reached the peak but there\u2019s still an incredible number of people losing their lives through this. \u201cThe death toll in the UK is anything between 33,000 and 38,000. That\u2019s filling our stadium and then filling it half again. It\u2019s a sobering thought.\u201d Here is our story: Kenya\u2019s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, on Saturday ordered a cessation of movement between the country and neighbouring Tanzania and Somalia to help curb the spread of coronavirus. He exempted cargo trucks but said drivers would have to be tested for the disease. Iran reported 35 new deaths from the coronavirus on Saturday \u2013 the lowest number since 7 March despite infections rising \u2013and announced a further relaxation of Covid-19 closures. \u201cDespite the unfortunate loss of 35 of our compatriots in the past 24 hours, this number is the lowest in the past 70 days,\u201d health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said. The new deaths brought the overall toll to 6,937, he added. But in an ominous sign, Iran on Friday reported its highest number of new infections in more than a month. \u201cWe are in no way in a normal situation yet,\u201d Jahanpour said. He said 1,757 new coronavirus cases had been confirmed across Iran in the 24 hours to Saturday, bringing the overall total to 118,392. Austria\u2019s borders with the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary will fully reopen on 15 June, the interior ministry said on Saturday, extending an easing of eastern border controls previously agreed with many of its neighbours to the west. The announcement follows a previously coordinated step to fully remove barriers on travel between Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Liechtenstein from 15 Juneonwards and ease restrictions on who is allowed transit in the meantime. Restrictions remain in place for transit from Italy. \u201cOur goal is to have as much freedom as possible and as few restrictions as necessary,\u201d the country\u2019s interior, foreign and Europe ministers said in a joint statement. \u201cThese easings create a bit more normality for people in the border region and make it easier for commuters to lead a smoother everyday life.\u201d The European Union on Wednesday pushed to reopen internal borders and restart travel, but recommended Europe\u2019s external borders remain closed for most travel at least until mid-June. Hello everyone, as Nick just said I am taking over the Guardian\u2019s live feed. Please do get in touch to share your thoughts, comments and news tips with me. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com My colleague Sarah Marsh will be at the helm for the next hour while I take a lunch break. If you\u2019re on lockdown, wherever you are, solace can be taken in nature. Lucy Jones writes on the comfort we can take by being curious about our surroundings. Our lives are made from the things we pay attention to. Slowing down and observing \u2013 these are radical things to do in our accelerated age. It is only by being in lockdown that I have seen new treasures that I\u2019d previously have overlooked: the bright pink cones of the larch tree, blankets of blue speedwell, neon red velvet mites. The more we pay attention, the more we see. The senses can help us notice more. I have heard a cuckoo twice this last week for the first time since childhood, in two different spots. It must be a combination of fewer aircraft and cars, and a craving and alertness for as much life as possible during that precious time outside. The German finance minister, Olaf Scholz, is working on an aid package worth \u20ac57bn to help municipalities cope with plunging tax revenues caused by the coronavirus crisis, shows a ministry document. Scholz\u2019s aid package aims to help cities and towns stabilise their finances, according to the finance ministry document seen by Reuters. The plan also contemplates extra relief for some heavily indebted municipalities. \u201cThis protective shield should not only bring cities and municipalities through the current difficult situation, but also enable them to do their job even better,\u201d Scholz was quoted as saying in the strategy paper. The federal government wants the 16 state governments to shoulder half of the costs, with parliament expected to approve the plan before the end of this year, the document said. Under Germany\u2019s federal system, local authorities are in charge of a large chunk of public investments such as building roads and bridges as well as modernising schools and hospitals. Scholz is expected to present further details of his plan later today. He said earlier this week that plunging tax revenues would not stop the government from unleashing another fiscal stimulus package next month and that the measures should include emergency aid for struggling municipalities. In March, the German parliament suspended a debt brake and approved an initial rescue package worth more than \u20ac750bn to help the economy cope with the fallout of the pandemic. The first package already included a debt-financed supplementary budget of \u20ac156bn. Qatar\u2019s number of coronavirus infections topped 30,000 on Saturday, according to a Reuters tally based on official figures. The health ministry reported 1,547 new cases on Saturday, according to the state-run Qatar News Agency. That took the cumulative total to 30,972, according to the Reuters count. So far the country has recorded 14 deaths attributable to Covid-19. New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, found out there are no exceptions when it comes to physical distancing after she was initially turned away from a cafe because it was too full under coronavirus guidelines. Mattha Busby has more: The Covid-19 pandemic is causing major issues in Latin American prisons, with inmates rioting for better protection. We have a report from Clavel Rangel, Joe Parkin Daniels and Tom Phillips. \u201cI thought the death penalty was illegal in Colombia but we\u2019re all on death row now,\u201d said the man, who gave his name as Nelson and said he was one of 12 inmates in a cell designed for four. Villavicencio\u2019s prison has become the centre of Colombia\u2019s Covid-19 outbreak, reporting nearly 900 cases \u2013 over 7% of the country\u2019s confirmed total. Images circulating on social media show harrowing scenes inside, with dozens of inmates crammed into tight spaces, often without face masks. In late April, authorities discovered a tunnel dug by inmates desperate to escape the infection-ridden prison. \u201cThis virus is spreading like crazy. Someone help us. We\u2019re going to die here,\u201d Nelson said by phone. Read it in full here: A nine-year-old child from Marseille, France, is reported to have died of Kawasaki disease, the rare inflammatory disorder which has been linked to Covid-19. The boy is the first victim of the disorder in France and the second in Europe after a teenager died in London last week. Although Kawasaki disease is said to mainly affect children under five, those diagnosed in France are aged from one to 14. About 230 suspected cases have been reported across Europe. Afghanistan\u2019s health ministry has warned of a surge in deaths if the country\u2019s lockdown is not adhered to. Confirmed cases of Covid-19 reached 6,402 amid war raging on across the country. \u201cIf people continue to not heed, we will witness a big catastrophe among families,\u201d said Wahid Majroh, the deputy health minister. Russia has recorded its highest daily Covid-19 death toll. The country reported 9,200 new confirmed cases of coronavirus on Saturday, with 119 deaths over the last 24 hours. The latter figure is the highest daily figure of deaths the country has recorded so far. Burundi is pushing on with plans to hold a controversial election on Wednesday despite concerns over the Covid-19 pandemic. It could be the first truly peaceful transfer of authority in the east African nation since independence in 1962. The Trump administration has fired the state department\u2019s inspector general, Steve Linick. He is reported to have been investigating the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, for a potential abuse of office. Spain has reported lowest rise in Covid-19 deaths since mid-March. Spain\u2019s overnight death toll from Covid-19 was 102 on Saturday, the health ministry has said, marking the country\u2019s lowest 24-hour rise in eight weeks. Spain\u2019s overnight death toll from Covid-19 was 102 on Saturday, the health ministry has said, marking the country\u2019s lowest 24-hour rise since mid-March. The cumulative death toll rose to 27,563. Meanwhile, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases rose to 230,698 on Saturday from 230,183 on Friday.

At least 25 migrant workers have been killed after a truck they were packed into hit another vehicle in northern India during a nationwide coronavirus lockdown. The pre-dawn accident in Uttar Pradesh state was the latest involving some of the millions of migrants left stranded and jobless by the seven-week shutdown, AFP reports. Scores have died in road and rail accidents and even from exhaustion walking home. The vehicle, carrying about 40 men, women and children, struck another truck also carrying labourers and their families that was parked at a roadside cafe in Auraiya district, local magistrate Abishek Singh said. The dead were all men, but women and children were among about 30 injured, Singh said. He said the driver of the truck was suspected to have fallen asleep. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, called the accident \u201cextremely tragic\u201d in a Twitter post. He said relief work was in \u201cfull swing\u201d at the scene. Many businesses shut down overnight after the government-imposed lockdown began on 25 March, leaving millions of migrant workers destitute. Desperate to return to their home states, many have walked hundreds of kilometres or hitched rides on trucks. More than a dozen labourers were killed earlier this month when a train ran over them as they slept on a railway track. Many others have been killed in road accidents. The lockdown is due to be eased from Monday. Talking of sport, Germany\u2019s Bundesliga restarts in about three hours and 40 minutes. It\u2019s a big topic that cuts right across the board of Covid-19 issues \u2013 is it safe, is it moral, is it economically necessary, does it give a green light for top-level sport of all kinds to return globally? Later on I\u2019ll direct you to our live coverage, but for now this is a good primer from Andy Brassell: At the WHO/IOC press conference, Thomas Bach has been asked how all the physical contact involved in sport can be safely managed at next year\u2019s Olympics, given there is no vaccine in prospect for Covid-19 yet. He replied: \u201cWe are one year and two months away from these games. We will take all the necessary decisions at the right time, relying on the advice of the WHO, discussing it in our joint taskforce. I think nobody can at this moment in time really give you a reliable answer on how the world will look like in July 2021. So we have to be vigilant and we have to be patient, at the same time, to take the right measures to ensure the safe participation of everybody in the games.\u201d Our UK live blog is up and running alongside this global blog \u2013 you can join my colleague Lucy Campbell here: As Wuhan, the Chinese city where the Covid-19 pandemic began, revs up a massive testing campaign, some residents crowding the testing centres have expressed concern that the very act of getting tested could expose them to the coronavirus. Safety has become a hot topic on social media groups among the 11 million residents of Wuhan, people told Reuters as they converged on open-air test sites at clinics and other facilities. Many said, though, that they supported the voluntary campaign. Wuhan health authorities sprang back into action after confirming last weekend the central Chinese city\u2019s first cluster of new infections since it was released from virtual lockdown on 8 April. The new cases \u2013 all of them people who had previously shown no symptoms of the disease \u2013 spurred Wuhan authorities to launch a citywide search for asymptomatic carriers of the virus, aiming to gauge the level of Covid-19 risk. Although Wuhan\u2019s cinemas and banquet halls remain shut to curb large gatherings, the testing requires people to wait in long, sometimes messy, queues. \u201cSome people have expressed worry in the [social media] groups about the tests, which require people to cluster, and whether there\u2019s any infection risk,\u201d said one Wuhan resident. \u201cBut others rebutted those worries, saying such comments are not supportive of the government.\u201d The unprecedented scale of testing indicates the official level of concern, some experts say. Others say it is an extremely costly exercise and question its effectiveness. Residents said the authorities have not told them when they would get the results of their tests. To cope with the surge in work, more Wuhan hospitals have been asked to set up testing points, and other institutions have been roped in to help process tests, said a doctor involved in the exercise. \u201cWe are now working 24 hours a day,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of pressure.\u201d China has confirmed 82,941 cases of Covid-19 as of Friday and 4,633 deaths. The government does not include people found to be asymptomatic carriers of the virus in its tally and does not publish a cumulative number of asymptomatic cases. National Health Commission spokesman Mi Feng told reporters 194 asymptomatic carriers were confirmed in the first half of May, down 62% from the second half of April. At the WHO/IOC press conference, Bach is stressing the need for sport to play a crucial part in governments\u2019 Covid-19 recovery programmes. \u201cSport is not only a very important economic factor, offering millions of jobs, it is also an extremely important social and health factor. The crisis has told us how important health is for the basis of everything we do in society. I\u2019m really calling on governments to honour this and make sport an important part of their programmes.\u201d The World Health Organization director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and the International Olympic Committee president, Thomas Bach, are holding a press conference. You can watch it here: A nine-year-old child from Marseille, France, is reported to have died of Kawasaki disease, the rare inflammatory disorder which has been linked to Covid-19. The boy is the first victim of the disorder in France and the second in Europe after a teenager died of the syndrome in London last week. Doctors treating the French boy said he had developed a form of coronavirus but had no symptoms. He was admitted to hospital on 2 May suffering from what medics at first thought was scarlet fever. After being given treatment for scarlet fever he was allowed to return home as doctors said his symptoms were mild. Later the same day the child was rushed to hospital by ambulance and admitted to intensive care where he was diagnosed as suffering \u201csigns of Kawasaki disease\u201d. He died six days later on 8 May after suffering a heart attack that caused brain damage. There are believed to be 144 diagnosed cases of Kawasaki disease in France, most of them in the Paris area, more than half of whom have tested positive for Covid-19. The French public health authority, Sant\u00e9 Publique France, said research suggested the little-known syndrome appeared on average around four weeks after the children were infected by Covid-19, and was possibly a reaction to the virus. This has yet to be confirmed by scientific research. Although Kawasaki disease is said to mainly affect children under five, those diagnosed in France are aged from one to 14. About 230 suspected cases have been reported in Europe, including in the UK where a 14-year-old boy died last week at the Evelina London Children\u2019s Hospital. The Trump administration has fired the state department\u2019s inspector general, who is reported to have been investigating the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, for a potential abuse of office, reports Julian Borger. The inspector general, Steve Linick, was given notice of his dismissal late on Friday night and is to be replaced by Stephen Akard, a close ally of the vice-president, Mike Pence, from his home state of Indiana. A state department spokesperson said that Akard, who has been running the office for foreign missions, would take over immediately as acting inspector general. According to a Democratic congressional aide, just before his abrupt dismissal Linick had opened an investigation into allegations that Pompeo had been using a political appointee at the state department to run personal errands for him and his wife, Susan. Under US law the president is required to give 30 days\u2019 notice before firing an inspector general, to allow Congress to investigate the reasons for dismissal. In recent months Congress has not used that month-long notice period to prevent the termination of other watchdog officials fired by the president. Here is the piece in full: Afghanistan\u2019s health ministry warned of a surge in deaths as confirmed cases of Covid-19 reached 6,402 amid war raging on across the country. Wahid Majroh, the country\u2019s deputy health minister, said 1,113 suspected patients were tested over 24 hours, of whom 349 came back positive. Fifteen Covid-19 deaths were recorded overnight, pushing the toll to 168. There have been 788 recoveries. \u201cIf people continue to not heed, we will witness a big catastrophe among families,\u201d Majroh said in a press conference in Kabul. He said the ministry had a three-phase plan to ease the lockdown. \u201cAccording to our plan, the lockdown should be in place for one year so we can get back to normal life,\u201d he said. Despite a government-authorised lockdown in several provinces, streets are still crowded, raising fears of a surge in number of death and infections. Experts fear the real number of people with Covid-19 may be much higher than reported by the ministry as testing capacity remains low. \u201cWe talk about our concerns about the virus in the country each day, but people still go out and break the lockdowns, which will help the numbers to go higher,\u201d Majroh said. The ministry has pledged to increase number of daily tests. Majroh said this week that the country was waiting to receive more testing kits to increase daily testing capacity to around 2,500 in the first phase, \u201c5,000 in the second, and 10,000 tests each day\u201d. So far, 21,969 patients have been tested in Afghanistan. Most of the new cases and deaths reported on Saturday were in the country\u2019s capital, Kabul, with 126 new cases and six deaths. The total number of infections in Afghanistan\u2019s worst-affected area is 1,844, with 25 deaths. The eastern province of Paktia, where a car bomb killed at five civilians this week, reported its biggest one-day rise of infections \u2013 with 56 cases reported out of 119 tests today. Paktia has so far recorded 234 confirmed cases and five deaths from Covid-19. The number of new infections in southern province of Kandahar has slowed compared with recent days, as 10 new cases were reported over the past 24 hours. The eastern province of Nangarhar recorded 37 new cases; concerns are high in the province as six cases were confirmed in its prison last week. Meanwhile, war rages on across the country. The president, Ashraf Ghani, in response to an attack on a maternity hospital in Kabul, ordered a resumption of a full offensive against the Taliban and other militant groups, ending a period of reduced military activity ahead of US-brokered peace talks that had been expected to start this year. Burundi is pushing on with plans to hold a controversial \u2013 but crucial \u2013 election on Wednesday 20 May despite concerns over the Covid-19 pandemic. The election will end the divisive and bloody 15-year rule of the country\u2019s president, Pierre Nkurunziza, reports AP. It could be the first truly peaceful transfer of authority in the east African nation since independence in 1962. But coronavirus poses a threat to the vote. Burundi has kicked out World Health Organization workers after concerns were raised. The WHO Africa director messaged the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention chief about political rallies the day that Burundi\u2019s campaigning launched and images of crowds circulated online. Authorities have been accused by critics of downplaying the pandemic and citing divine protection. But the government appears to be using virus measures to limit election observers, warning the east African regional bloc on 8 May that arriving foreigners face a 14-day quarantine. More than the virus, however, the fear of violence weighs on many of the more than 5 million people eligible to vote. Government agents have been accused of harassing the main opposition party, the CNL, whose leader, Agathon Rwasa, is believed to be in a close race with Nkurunziza\u2019s chosen successor in the ruling CNDD-FDD, Evariste Ndayishimiye. More than 145 CNL members have been arrested since campaigning began on 27 April, according to SOS Medias Burundi, a group of independent journalists. Police spokesman Pierre Nkurikiye has accused Rwasa of making incendiary and defamatory remarks and inciting revolt. Rwasa, the deputy parliament speaker, has drawn large crowds despite the risks of openly supporting him, according to an online group of activists known as i-Burundi. The group worries that a rigged election could spark the kind of street demonstrations that marked the previous vote in 2015. Rwasa feels it is important not to boycott the election even if the outcome is not expected to be fair. \u201cEverything has its right time,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, it is not the time to give up and abandon our people.\u201d Russia reported 9,200 new confirmed cases of coronavirus on Saturday, with 119 deaths over the last 24 hours. The latter figure is the highest daily figure of deaths the country has recorded so far. The rise is down on the 10,598 new cases reported on Friday. The number of confirmed cases nationwide stands at 272,043 and the official death toll is 2,537. On Thursday, Russia defended its methods of recording data on Covid-19 deaths: Singapore has registered 465 new coronavirus infections, according to its health ministry. That figure takes the city-state\u2019s total to 27,356 cases. The vast majority of the newly-infected people are migrant workers living in dormitories, the ministry said in a statement. Four are permanent residents. To date, Singapore has recorded 21 deaths from Covid-19. Attempts to combat Covid-19 in western Uganda have been severely complicated by a series of devastating floods and rockslides that are believed to have affected as many as 173,000 people, Samuel Okiror reports. Many now find themselves in temporary displacement camps in schools or churches. Samuel\u2019s report quotes Stephen Oluka, the director of Uganda\u2019s national emergency coordination and operations centre: Oluka says overcrowding in makeshift centres had complicated efforts to combat Covid-19. \u201cThe guidelines have been compromised. I didn\u2019t see anyone [displaced] in the camps with a mask. The leaders are telling people to maintain social distancing but it\u2019s not attainable. There is overcrowding in camps.\u201d He adds: \u201cI don\u2019t think they are now bothered about coronavirus, which they haven\u2019t seen. They are bothered about what has affected them now [floodings], safety from waters and their livelihoods.\u201d Here is the piece in full: Leopards, jackals and other creatures living in Islamabad\u2019s tree-covered hills have been enjoying rare respite from the throngs of hikers and joggers that normally pack the trails of Pakistan\u2019s capital, reports AFP. Rangers in the Margalla Hills National Park saw animal activity increase soon after the city was locked down in March to counter the coronavirus. Islamabad\u2019s normally reclusive leopards have been roaming onto deserted pathways, and social networks are rife with talk of purported sightings. Motion-triggered wildlife cameras have been clicking away as animals explore areas they had long been nervous to visit. \u201cThere is a big increase in the number of animals [seen] in the national park,\u201d ranger Imran Khan \u2013 not to be confused with the namesake prime minister \u2013 said. Images the park provided include pictures of leopards padding along paths, an inquisitive jackal and a muddy boar. \u201cWildlife is comfortable as there are no visitors here. They are wandering here comfortably, which is a good sign for the jungle,\u201d Khan said. The park was locked down for about a month and foot traffic remains light as families, picnickers and walkers stay away during the fasting period of Ramadan. Hello everyone. I\u2019ll be taking you through the next eight hours or so of Coronavirus news and updates from around the world. As ever, we\u2019d be glad to hear any tips, information, feedback or observations from you. My email address is nick.ames@theguardian.com or you can send me a direct Twitter message @NickAmes82. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. Thank you for following along. My colleague Nick Ames will be taking it from here. I\u2019m signing off from my home in Sydney, where I\u2019ve been reunited with several lip balms that had been in the pockets of various long-unused jackets. I flew to Greece and began solo IVF. Then the world shut down It is 7.53am, the last Wednesday in March, and at a courier depot in Athens, the sperm of a Bermudian mechanical engineering student arrives, carried in a nitrogen tank. For the last three days, I have followed the tank\u2019s journey across Europe, loading and reloading the courier website as it made its way from a cryobank in Denmark through Germany to mainland Greece. The continent has been shutting down, borders closing as coronavirus spreads, and as the days have passed, the improbability of this delivery, its chances of ever reaching its destination, have seemed increasingly slim. Here\u2019s one way to get suited up for a hospital shift: Global report: Democrats push for $3tn stimulus as experts track Covid-linked syndrome The US House of Representatives has narrowly approved a $3tn bill pushed for by Democrats to battle the coronavirus and stimulating a faltering economy. But Republicans who control the Senate have vowed to block the bill, though some support its provisions aimed at helping state and local governments. Donald Trump has promised to veto the bill if it ever reaches his desk. But its House passage could trigger new negotiations with the president. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House, called it a \u201cstarting point\u201d for talks. Earlier on Friday the House also approved a change in its rules to allow members to temporarily cast their votes by proxy during the crisis if Pelosi deems it necessary. The Trump administration is set to restore partial funding to the World Health Organization, Fox News reported late on Friday, citing a draft letter. The Trump administration would \u201cagree to pay up to what China pays in assessed contributions\u201d to the WHO, Fox reported, quoting from the letter. Trump has announced details of a \u201cwarp-speed\u201d effort to create a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year, even as experts warn that such a breakthrough could take longer than 18 months. Earlier in the week, Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned: \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee that the vaccine is actually going to be effective.\u201d The number of deaths in the US is projected to exceed 100,000 by 1 June, the CDC director, Robert Redfield, has said. Invisible deaths: from nursing homes to prisons, the corona toll is out of sight \u2013 and out of mind? John Delano was six years old when the contagion struck his neighborhood in New Haven, Connecticut. There was a morgue just down the road. Coffins began spilling on to the sidewalk. It made the perfect stage for an exciting new game. \u201cWe thought, \u2018Boy, this is great,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s like climbing the pyramids.\u2019 Then one day, I slipped and broke my nose on one of the coffins. My mother was very upset. She said, didn\u2019t I realize there were people in those boxes who had died?\u201d Delano\u2019s account, recorded in Catharine Arnold\u2019s history of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, encapsulates a crucial aspect of that disaster: the public nature of death. Coffins became a feature of daily life, stacked on sidewalks and in people\u2019s front rooms. Roads were jammed dawn to dusk with horse-drawn hearses, heading for the cemeteries. A century on, death has disappeared from the streets of America. The 2020 pandemic is memorable not for coffins piled high but for data modeling and statistics. For most Americans, the figure of 85,901 deaths in the US is as visceral as it gets. A virus that is in itself invisible has spawned a nationwide response in which the most extreme manifestation of the disease, loss of life, is invisible too. You can\u2019t play coffin pyramids when funerals have been transferred to that great resting place in the cyber-sky: Zoom. Global number of confirmed cases passes 4.5m. According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University at least 4,542,910 people are known to have been infected and 307,696 people have died worldwide since the pandemic began. The figures are likely to represent a significant underestimate of the true scale of the pandemic. Democrats push $3tn response bill forwards. The US House of Representatives has narrowly approved a $3tn bill crafted by Democrats to provide more aid for battling the coronavirus and stimulating a faltering economy. But Republican leaders, who control the Senate, and Donald Trump have vowed to block it, despite some Republican support for provisions aimed at helping state and local governments. Trump unveils \u2018warp-speed\u2019 drive for vaccine by year\u2019s end. Donald Trump has announced details of a \u201cwarp-speed\u201d effort to create a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year, even as experts warn that such a breakthrough could take longer than 18 months. During remarks in the White House Rose Garden on Friday that had to compete with honking from protesting truck drivers, the US president also urged schools to reopen in the autumn and insisted: \u201cVaccine or no vaccine, we\u2019re back.\u201d Mexico sees highest daily confirmed infections. As Mexico moves toward a gradual reactivation of its economy from Monday, the number of new coronavirus infections grows higher every day, raising fears of a new wave of infections that other countries have seen after loosening restrictions, AP reports. There were 2,437 new coronavirus test confirmations Friday, the highest daily total yet and the second straight day with over 2,000 new cases. Trump to restore partial funding to WHO - report. Donald Trump\u2019s administration is set to restore partial funding to the World Health Organization, Fox News reported late on Friday, citing a draft letter. The Trump administration will \u201cagree to pay up to what China pays in assessed contributions\u201d to the WHO, Fox News reported, quoting from the letter. Trump suspended US contributions to the WHO on 14 April, accusing it of promoting China\u2019s \u201cdisinformation\u201d about the coronavirus outbreak. Italy to allow travel to and from abroad from 3 June. Italy\u2019s government has approved a decree allowing travel to and from abroad from 3 June, moving to unwind one of the world\u2019s most rigid coronavirus lockdowns. The government will allow free travel across the country from that same day. Some regions had pushed for a swifter rollback but the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has insisted on a gradual return to normal to prevent a second wave of infections. Tens of thousands of impoverished migrant workers are on the move across India, walking on highways and railway tracks or riding trucks, buses and crowded trains in blazing heat, the AP reports. Some are accompanied by pregnant wives and young children, braving threats from the coronavirus pandemic. They say they have been forced to leave cities and towns where they had toiled for years building homes and roads after they were abandoned by their employers casualties of lockdown to stop the virus from spreading. The government and charities have tried to set up shelter homes for them but their numbers are simply overwhelming, leaving them little choice but to head on a perilous journey home. Last week, a train crashed into a group of tired workers who fell asleep on the tracks while walking back home in western Maharashtra state, killing 16. On Saturday, at least 23 labourers died in northern India when a truck they were travelling in smashed into a stationary truck on a highway. \u2018People still need to laugh\u2019: how lipsyncing spoofs saved lockdown In the TikTok videos going viral across social media, the voices are familiar: a rambling presidential whine, or a patronising prime minister. But the people apparently speaking are altogether \u2013 and hilariously \u2013 different. In uncannily calibrated lipsyncs, Donald Trump is shown as a hectoring schoolteacher or drunken clubgoer, while Boris Johnson reads a bedtime story to a petulant Theresa May. As unsettling as the effect may be, the videos are enormously popular \u2013 and the women behind them are at the forefront of a boom in self-produced political comedy on both sides of the Atlantic, highlighting the limits to our leaders\u2019 authority by making them look ridiculous. \u201cI look at it as taking off the emperor\u2019s clothes,\u201d explains Sarah Cooper, the US comedian behind a series of Trump videos highlighted by the Guardian earlier this week. \u201cI\u2019ve basically taken away the podium and the suit and the people behind him nodding \u2026 That\u2019s why it highlights how ridiculous his words are.\u201d \u2018We\u2019re on virus time\u2019: Las Vegas on edge amid reopening gamble Brittany Bronson reports for the Guardian from Las Vegas: On Tuesday evening, the parade of cars backed up traffic for miles as occupants honked their horns and held signs out their windows that read \u201ctransparency = safety\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t roll the dice with workers\u2019 lives\u201d. Led by housekeepers, bartenders and frontline workers, the event was organized by Unite Here\u2019s Culinary Union Local 226 to demand that casino companies \u201cshare their full reopening plans\u201d. The union\u2019s 60,000 members in Las Vegas have been out of work since mid-March, when the Nevada governor, Steve Sisolak, ordered the mandatory closure of all non-essential business to curb the spread of the coronavirus. As Nevada begins to reopen, there is uncertainty among workers, residents and tourists about what a post-pandemic Vegas will look like. The hospitality-centered economy has been strained under the shutdown and has pushed the state government into deficits, stripped its primary tax revenue, and drained the unemployment fund dry. Now, many are worried the public and private sectors can\u2019t hold out for much longer. Although Nevada has appeared to reach a plateau in Covid-19 cases, many fear the possibility of a second wave, particularly in the \u201cpetri dish\u201d environment of casinos. Confirmed cases worldwide top 4.5m. According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, there are 4,531,811 confirmed cases worldwide. The number of people who have lost their lives is 307,001 according to official tolls, but the true number is likely to be much higher. Trump administration to restore partial funding to World Health Organization - Fox News. US President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is set to restore partial funding to the World Health Organization, Fox News reported late on Friday, citing a draft letter. The Trump administration will \u201cagree to pay up to what China pays in assessed contributions\u201d to the WHO, Fox News reported, quoting from the letter. The United States was the WHO\u2019s biggest donor. If the US matches China\u2019s contribution, as the Fox report adds, its new funding level will be about one-tenth of its previous funding amount of about US$400 million per year. US House of Representatives narrowly approves $3tn response bill. The US House of Representatives on Friday narrowly approved a $3 trillion bill crafted by Democrats to provide more aid for battling the coronavirus and stimulating a faltering economy rocked by the pandemic, Reuters reports.\u201cThe bill no chance of moving forward. The Republican-led Senate opposes the bill, and the White House has vowed to veto it,\u201d AP reports. The number of deaths in the US is projected to exceed 100,000 by 1 June, according to the CDC director Robert Redfield. The agency came to the conclusion after tracking 12 different forecasting models; all of which predicted at least that number of deaths. Trump has oscillated, but has previously said the toll would be lower. Brazilian health minister resigns as record cases confirmed again. Brazil\u2019s health minister resigned Friday after less than a month on the job in a sign of continuing upheaval over how the nation should battle the coronavirus pandemic, quitting a day after President Jair Bolsonaro stepped up pressure on him to expand use of the antimalarial drug chloroquine in treating patients. Record increase in cases in Brazil. Brazil has confirmed 15,305 new cases; a record for a 24-hour period, as well as 824 related deaths, according to data from the country\u2019s Health Ministry. Brazil has registered 218,223 confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic, as well as 14,817 deaths. Italy to allow travel to and from abroad from 3 June. Italy\u2019s government on Saturday approved a decree which will allow travel to and from abroad from 3 June in a major development as it moves to unwind one of the world\u2019s most rigid coronavirus lockdowns. Mexico sees highest daily confirmed infections. As Mexico moves toward a gradual reactivation of its economy Monday, the number of new coronavirus infections grows higher every day, raising fears of a new wave of infections that other countries have seen after loosening restrictions. There were 2,437 new coronavirus test confirmations Friday, the highest daily total yet and the second straight day with over 2,000 new cases. There were 2,409 on Thursday. Beijing increases pressure on European states to reject Taiwan\u2019s WHO inclusion. China has stepped up the pressure on European states to reject Taiwan\u2019s call to be represented at next week\u2019s assembly of the World Health Organization, arguing that its presence can only be justified if it accepts that it is part of China.The World Health Assembly is being held virtually on Monday, and Taiwan\u2019s attendance \u2013 as well as a possible international inquiry into the start of the pandemic \u2013 are likely to be the two big political flashpoints between China and the west. US president Donald Trump said on Friday the US government was working with other countries to develop a coronavirus vaccine at an accelerated pace. Trump expressed his hope that a vaccine would be in place before the end of the year at an event in the White House Rose Garden and said his administration would mobilise its forces to get a vaccine distributed once one was in place. UK\u2019s reproduction rate still close to 1, bringing lockdown-easing steps into question. The latest official estimate places the national R value - the rate at which people are passing on infections to others \u2013 at between 0.7 and 1. An R value above 1 means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which would result in a new surge of cases. Europe could face deadly second wave of winter infections, WHO warns. Dr Hans Kluge, director for the WHO European region, warned countries beginning to ease their lockdown restrictions that now is \u201ctime for preparation, not celebration\u201d. From anger over lockdown measures to a purported vaccine plan by Bill Gates: a growing wave of demonstrations in Germany by conspiracy theorists, extremists and anti-vaxxers has alarmed even Chancellor Angela Merkel, AFP reports. Initially starting as a handful of protesters decrying tough restrictions on public life to halt transmission of the coronavirus, the protests have swelled in recent weeks to gatherings of thousands in major German cities. Thousands are set to mass again in Stuttgart, Munich and Berlin on Saturday, with police out in force after some protests turned violent. The growing demonstrations have sparked comparison to the anti-Muslim Pegida marches at the height of Europe\u2019s refugee crisis in 2015, raising questions over whether the strong support that Merkel is currently enjoying due to her handling of the virus crisis could evaporate. Just like it won popularity by fanning anti-migrant sentiment five years back, the far-right AfD party is now openly encouraging protesters and repositioning itself as an anti-lockdown party. A recent poll commissioned by the Spiegel news magazine found that almost one in four Germans surveyed voiced \u201cunderstanding\u201d for the demonstrations. The development has shocked the political establishment, with Merkel reportedly telling top brass of her centre-right CDU party of the \u201cworrying\u201d trend that may bear some hallmarks of Russia\u2019s disinformation campaigns. In the US, as uncertainty about the spread of Covid-19 continues, the biggest university system in the United States decided this week to make fall term classes virtual, one of the first to do so, amid fears of a second wave of infections in the month ahead. California State University said almost all classes across its 23 university campuses would be online at least until the end of the fall term. Programs such as the maritime academy, which holds classes aboard a training ship, may be among a handful of exceptions. The Cal State university system serves 482,000 students. \u201cAs the largest four-year system of higher education in the country, while the spotlight is on us in terms of the decision, we weren\u2019t hoping to influence anyone,\u201d said Cal State spokesperson Mike Uhlenkamp. \u201cThis is a decision that the chancellor and the campus presidents arrived at that we feel is in the best interests of our students and our employees.\u201d Colleges and universities across the United States are grappling with similar decisions. But it was the timing of Cal State\u2019s announcement that came to some as a surprise. Other colleges and universities have said their decisions would come later in the summer. In case you missed it: The US House of Representatives on Friday narrowly approved a $3 trillion bill crafted by Democrats to provide more aid for battling the coronavirus and stimulating a faltering economy rocked by the pandemic. By a vote of 208-199 Democrats won passage of a bill that Republican leaders, who control the Senate, have vowed to block despite some Republican support for provisions aimed at helping state and local governments. Republican President Donald Trump has promised a veto if it were to reach his desk. However, the Democrats\u2019 measure could trigger a new round of negotiations with congressional Republicans and Trump, who have been talking about the need for new business liability protections in the age of coronavirus or additional tax cuts. Democrats oppose both of those ideas. Following the vote, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer announced that May 27-28 would be set aside for voting on some sort of coronavirus-related bill if one is ready by then. He provided no details on the contents of such a bill. The US economy has suffered a devastating blow from the coronavirus outbreak. Some 36.5 million people - or more than one in five workers - in the United States have filed for unemployment since the crisis began. The 1,800-page relief bill passed on Friday, called the Heroes Act, would extend to all corners of the US economy. It includes $500bn in aid to struggling state governments, another round of direct payments to individuals and families to help stimulate the economy, and hazard pay for healthcare workers and others on the front line of the pandemic. US President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is set to restore partial funding to the World Health Organization, Fox News reported late on Friday, citing a draft letter. The Trump administration will \u201cagree to pay up to what China pays in assessed contributions\u201d to the WHO, Fox News reported, quoting from the letter. Trump suspended US contributions to the WHO on 14 April, accusing it of promoting China\u2019s \u201cdisinformation\u201d about the coronavirus outbreak and saying his administration would launch a review of the organization, Reuters reports. WHO officials denied the claims and China has insisted it was transparent and open. The United States was the WHO\u2019s biggest donor. If the US matches China\u2019s contribution, as the Fox report adds, its new funding level will be about one-tenth of its previous funding amount of about US$400 million per year. In Australia, the state of Victoria on Saturday reported 11 new cases, including some linked to known clusters at a meat factory and a McDonald\u2019s restaurant. The state is struggling to curb the spread of the coronavirus while the rest of Australia has begun relaxing a two-month lockdown, Reuters reports. The nationwide tally of new cases had still to be compiled for Saturday, but on Friday the southeastern state had accounted for 20 of the 31 new cases reported across the country. New South Wales, the most populous state, has been hardest hit by Covid-19, but new cases there have subsided, with just three reported on Saturday. For the first weekend since mid-March, restaurants, cafes and bars were re-opening in most parts of Australia, including New South Wales, but Victoria retained most of its lockdown measures. The northeast state of Queensland, where just one case was reported on Saturday, also eased its restrictions over the weekend, allowing restaurants, cafes and beauty salons to reopen, and groups of 10 people to meet for recreational purposes in parks, at playgrounds or for barbecues. Australia has recorded just over 7,000 Covid-19 cases, including 98 deaths, significantly below levels reported in North America and Europe, but health officials continued to urge vigilance and encouraged people to stay home. Earlier this week, Australia reported record high job losses as a result of the lockdown and Prime Minister Scott Morrison warned that worse was still to come.

Mainland China reported eight new confirmed Covid-19 cases for 15 May, up from four the previous day, the National Health Commission (NHC) said in a statement on Saturday. Six of the eight confirmed cases are so-called imported infections, while two are locally transmitted in northeastern Jilin Province. The number of new asymptomatic cases of the coronavirus rose to 13 from 11, the NHC said. The number of confirmed cases in the mainland stands at 82,941 and the death toll at 4,633. Italy\u2019s government on Saturday approved a decree which will allow travel to and from abroad from 3 June in a major development as it moves to unwind one of the world\u2019s most rigid coronavirus lockdowns. The government will allow free travel across the country from that same day. Some regions had pushed for a swifter rollback, but Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has insisted on a gradual return to normal to prevent a second wave of infections. More than 31,600 Italians have died of Covid-19 since the outbreak came to light on 21 February, the third-highest death toll in the world after that of the United States and Britain. Shops are due to open on 18 May and the government decided that all movement within individual regions should be allowed that same day, meaning people will be able to visit friends, Reuters reports. The inter-regional and foreign travel ban will remain in place until after Italy\u2019s 2 June Republic Day holiday, preventing any mass travel over that long-holiday weekend. But all travel curb will be lifted from 3 June - a major milestone on Italy\u2019s road to recovery, with the government hoping to salvage the forthcoming vacation season, when Italians traditionally escape the cities for their annual summer breaks. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 620 to 173,772, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Saturday. The reported death toll rose by 57 to 7,881, the tally showed. In other news from Germany, the country has fallen into recession following the sharpest economic slump since the 2008 financial crisis, as the coronavirus pandemic causes severe damage for growth and jobs across the eurozone. Europe\u2019s largest economy shrank by 2.2% in the three months to the end of March, the country\u2019s second-largest decrease since reunification: \u2018It still meets the test\u2019: Hancock defends easing of lockdown as R number shown to increase - video The UK health secretary on Friday defended the easing of lockdown restrictions despite the R number being close to 1. Matt Hancock said the R number was based on data collected weeks ago, so there was a \u2018lag\u2019. However, he insisted that the number remained below 1. The reproduction level, or R number, is a measure of the average number of people that will be infected by one individual with coronavirus. An R value above 1 means the epidemic will start to grow again, resulting in a surge of new cases: JC Penney, the more than 100-year old US department store chain, filed for bankruptcy on Friday, making it the latest business to hit bottom amid the coronavirus pandemic. The chain, known for selling family apparel, cosmetics and jewelry, is the latest in a series of victims of the pandemic-induced economic downturn. With its 850 stores and almost 90,000 workers, it is also reportedly the largest retail casualty so far. The Covid-19 fallout represented a final blow to the company, which had been struggling for some time. Many brick-and-mortar retailers are also battling to stay afloat, according to a report from the Associated Press. In the past two weeks, J Crew, Neiman Marcus and Stage Stores have filed for bankruptcy protection. The US House of Representatives on Friday narrowly approved a $3 trillion bill crafted by Democrats to provide more aid for battling the coronavirus and stimulating a faltering economy rocked by the pandemic, Reuters reports. \u201cThe bill no chance of moving forward.

A massive scientific, industrial and logistical endeavour unlike anything our country has seen since the Manhattan Project.\u201d He added: \u201cIts objective is to finish developing and then manufacture and distribute a proven coronavirus vaccine as fast as possible. Again, we\u2019d love to see if we can do it prior to the end of the year.\u201d Standing just behind him, Anthony Fauci, an infectious diseases expert wearing a face mask, cast his glance down and reached to adjust his tie. Trump did not wear a face mask. US President Donald Trump has retweeted a video of protestors expressing anger at a journalist: Despite an earlier failed attempt, Democrats tried again Friday to adopt a massive expansion of voting by mail during the coronavirus outbreak, including $3.6bn in funding for states to adjust their election systems to deal with the pandemic, AP reports. The money was included in a $3tn coronavirus response bill that was passed Friday by the Democratic-led House. But it has no chance of moving forward. The Republican-led Senate opposes the bill, and the White House has vowed to veto it. The most controversial aspect of the election funding section of the bill is another round of mandates that Democrats wish to place on states to ensure they have fair and safe elections at a time when crowded polling stations are a potential health risk. The bill would require states to end requirements that voters get a legal excuse to request an absentee ballot, mandate 15 days of early voting and order states to mail a ballot to every voter during emergencies. The Senate blocked similar requirements in a coronavirus relief bill in March. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Five sailors on the US aircraft carrier sidelined in Guam due to a Covid-19 outbreak have tested positive for the virus for the second time and have been taken off the ship, according to the Navy. The resurgence of the virus in the five sailors on the USS Theodore Roosevelt underscores the befuddling behavior of the highly contagious virus and raises questions about how troops that test positive can be reintegrated into the military, particularly on ships. All five sailors had previously tested positive and had gone through at least two weeks of isolation. As part of the process, they all had to test negative twice in a row, with the tests separated by at least a day or two before they were allowed to go back to the ship. The Roosevelt has been at port in Guam since late March after the outbreak of the virus was discovered. More than 4,000 of the 4,800 crew members have gone ashore since then for quarantine or isolation. Earlier this month hundreds of sailors began returning to the ship, in coordinated waves, to get ready to set sail again. As Mexico moves toward a gradual reactivation of its economy Monday, the number of new coronavirus infections grows higher every day, raising fears of a new wave of infections that other countries have seen after loosening restrictions, AP reports. There were 2,437 new coronavirus test confirmations Friday, the highest daily total yet and the second straight day with over 2,000 new cases. There were 2,409 on Thursday. The numbers suggest the pandemic has not yet peaked in Mexico, while the daily number of deaths rose by 290, below the one-day peak of 353 deaths reported Tuesday. Mexico has seen a total of 4,767 deaths so far. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador is straddling the issue, telling the public that the fight against the virus depends on continued social distancing in many places while describing how other areas will begin to return to work Monday. \u201cWe\u2019re at the point where we begin to have fewer cases,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said Friday. \u201cBut in these days we have to be more careful, not relax the discipline, don\u2019t trust ourselves.\u201d The comments came on the same day the government clarified guidelines for the construction, mining and automotive industries to return to work Monday. The next two weeks will serve as a period to formalise their protocols to keep workers safe, but if they do so and get approval they can open any time before 1 June. UK lockdown causing \u2018serious mental illness in first-time patients\u2019 People with no history of mental illness are developing serious psychological problems for the first time as a result of the lockdown, amid growing stresses over isolation, job insecurity, relationship breakdown and bereavement, the Royal College of Psychiatrists has disclosed. Adults and children are having psychotic episodes, mania and depression, with some taken to hospital because of the heavy toll on their mental wellbeing. Men aged 18-25 are reported to have been badly affected by first-time mental health issues. Previous research has suggested they feel the worst affected by restrictions on their movement, and are most likely to flout the lockdown. Eight weeks into lockdown measures, the Royal College of Psychiatrists is warning that services could be overwhelmed by \u201ca tsunami of mental illness\u201d. Hundreds of people in Aden, southern Yemens main city, have died in the past week with symptoms of what appears to be the coronavirus, local health officials said in interviews with The Associated Press. The officials fear the situation is only going to get worse: Yemen has little capacity to test those suspected of having the virus and a 5-year-long civil war has left the health system in shambles. One gravedigger in Aden told AP he had never seen such a constant flow of dead even in a city that has seen multiple bouts of bloody street battles during the civil war. Officially, the number of coronavirus virus cases in Yemen is low 106 in the southern region, with 15 deaths. Authorities in the Houthi rebel-controlled north announced their first case on May 5 and said only two people had infections, one of whom a Somali migrant died. But doctors say the Houthis are covering up an increasing number of cases to protect their economy and troops. And the surge in deaths in Aden more than 500 in just the past week, according to the city registrar has raised the nightmare scenario that the virus is spreading swiftly in a country with almost no capacity to resist it. The upswing in suspected Covid-19 cases in Yemen is sounding alarms throughout the global health community, which fears the virus will spread like wildfire throughout the worlds most vulnerable populations such as refugees or those impacted by war. As Donald Trump spoke to the press in his Rose Garden on Friday, a low hum could be heard from outside the White House grounds. The president said the sound was truckers \u201cshowing support\u201d and insisted: \u201cThey love their president.\u201d In fact, the noise, which grew to include the honking of airhorns, was a protest. According to a long-haul trucking industry website, the Trucker, the protest has been active for 15 days. The drivers involved say they have not received targeted support in any coronavirus stimulus package and do not have adequate access to protective equipment and healthcare. They have also voiced serious concerns about the rates they are getting through brokers who connect them with people needing to ship goods. UK researchers hope dogs can be trained to detect coronavirus Dogs are to be trained to try to sniff out the coronavirus before symptoms appear in humans, under trials launched with \u00a3500,000 of government funding. Dogs have already been successfully trained to detect the odour of certain cancers, malaria and Parkinson\u2019s disease, and a new study will look at whether labradors and cocker spaniels can be trained to detect Covid-19 in people. Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine will carry out the first phase of a trial in collaboration with Durham University and the charity Medical Detection Dogs. The initial stage of the research will see odour samples collected from coronavirus patients in London hospitals. Six specialist dogs will then undergo training to identify the virus from the samples. In case you missed it: The number of deaths in the US is projected to exceed 100,000 by 1 June, according to the CDC director Robert Redfield. The agency came to the conclusion after tracking 12 different forecasting models; all of which predicted at least that number of deaths.Trump has oscillated, but has previously said the toll would be lower. The US toll, the highest in the world, currently stands at 87,493. Brazil\u2019s health minister resigned Friday after less than a month on the job in a sign of continuing upheaval over how the nation should battle the coronavirus pandemic, quitting a day after President Jair Bolsonaro stepped up pressure on him to expand use of the antimalarial drug chloroquine in treating patients. Dr. Nelson Teich, an oncologist and health care consultant, took the job 17 April faced with the task of aligning the ministry\u2019s actions with the presidents view that Brazil\u2019s economy must not be destroyed by restrictions to control spread of the virus. Brazil confirmed 15,305 new cases on Friday; a record for a 24-hour period, as well as 824 related deaths, according to data from the country\u2019s Health Ministry. Teich\u2019s predecessor, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, also had rejected the use of chloroquine, which also had been touted by US President Donald Trump as a treatment. \u201cLife is made up of choices and today I decided to leave,\u201d Teich told journalists in capital Brasilia. He did not explain why he left the job and refused to answer questions. Officials say almost 15,000 people have died in Brazil from Covid-19, though some experts say the figure is significantly higher due to insufficient testing. The peak of the crisis has yet to hit Latin Americas largest nation, experts say. General Eduardo Pazuello, who had no health experience until he became the Health Ministry\u2019s No 2 official in April, will be the interim minister until Bolsonaro chooses a replacement. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic from around the world. I\u2019m Helen Sullivan and I\u2019ll be with you for the next few hours. As Brazil again sees a record daily increase in cases, the health minister has resigned, less than a month into the job. Dr. Nelson Teich quit a day after President Jair Bolsonaro stepped up pressure on him to expand use of the antimalarial drug chloroquine in treating patients. Meanwhile the director of the US Centers for Disease Control says deaths in the US are projected to exceed 100,000 by 1 June \u2013 just over two weeks\u2019 time. The US toll currently stands at 87,427. Here are the main developments from the last few hours: Confirmed cases worldwide top 4.5m. According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, there are 4,531,811 confirmed cases worldwide. The number of people who have lost their lives is 307,001 according to official tolls, but the true number is likely to be much higher.

Brazil has confirmed 15,305 new cases; a record for a 24-hour period, as well as 824 related deaths, according to data from the country\u2019s Health Ministry. Brazil has registered 218,223 confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic, as well as 14,817 deaths. Beijing increases pressure on European states to reject Taiwan\u2019s WHO inclusion. China has stepped up the pressure on European states to reject Taiwan\u2019s call to be represented at next week\u2019s assembly of the World Health Organization, arguing that its presence can only be justified if it accepts that it is part of China.The World Health Assembly is being held virtually on Monday, and Taiwan\u2019s attendance \u2013 as well as a possible international inquiry into the start of the pandemic \u2013 are likely to be the two big political flashpoints between China and the west. US president Donald Trump said on Friday the US government was working with other countries to develop a coronavirus vaccine at an accelerated pace. Trump expressed his hope that a vaccine would be in place before the end of the year at an event in the White House Rose Garden and said his administration would mobilise its forces to get a vaccine distributed once one was in place. UK\u2019s reproduction rate still close to 1, bringing lockdown-easing steps into question. The latest official estimate places the national R value - the rate at which people are passing on infections to others \u2013 at between 0.7 and 1. An R value above 1 means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which would result in a new surge of cases. Europe could face deadly second wave of winter infections, WHO warns. Dr Hans Kluge, director for the WHO European region, warned countries beginning to ease their lockdown restrictions that now is \u201ctime for preparation, not celebration\u201d. Second health minister resigns in Brazil after less than a month on the job. Brazil\u2019s health minister, Nelson Teich, handed in his resignation on Friday, his office said, after less than a month on the job as the country becomes a world hotspot for coronavirus. Teich is believed to have disagreed with the rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro. Brazil has now surpassed Germany and France and had more than 200,000 confirmed cases of the virus as of Thursday. Spain hails large-scale antibody study as a key tool in the fight against the coronavirus. The Spanish government has hailed a large-scale antibody study as a key tool in the fight against the coronavirus, but warned that any premature or irresponsible relaxation of restrictions could have \u201cenormous consequences\u201d given that only 5% of Spaniards have had the disease. Denmark reports zero coronavirus-related deaths for the first time since March. The country reported zero coronavirus-related deaths in the last 24 hours for the first time since 13 March",

Jews were blamed for the Black Death of the 14th century; conspiracy theories erupted in the first world war, that Germany had created the Spanish flu as a bioweapon; during the 2003 Sars epidemic, Asian American communities faced stigmatization and discrimination. \u201cEvery pandemic I\u2019ve looked at has seen a rise of racism,\u201d said Steven Taylor, a clinical psychologist at the University of British Columbia in Canada. Taylor has launched a study of 7,000 representative adults from the US and Canada to gauge how they are coping. His early findings suggest that the invisible nature of the harm inflicted by Covid-19 is provoking volatile behavior at opposite ends of the spectrum. At one extreme, about 15% of those surveyed were found to be suffering from what Taylor has dubbed \u201cCovid stress syndrome\u201d. These people are so hyper-aware about the contagion, even though they cannot see it, that they experience profound anxiety about coming into contact with it, to the extent of becoming virtually housebound. At the other extreme, a similar-sized subset have drunk Trump\u2019s Kool-Aid and are convinced that the scourge is a hoax or overblown. \u201cThey are coming out and saying, \u2018We can see the economic devastation of the lockdown all around us, but we can\u2019t see people who are sick and dying,\u2019\u201d Taylor said. The wave of lockdown demonstrations outside state capitolsis the sharpest manifestation yet of this. At its most dystopian, it has stoked a new generation of conspiracy theories such as Plandemic, a misinformation video which has attracted millions of viewers online by falsely claiming coronavirus is the creation of drug companies and Bill Gates. With the scramble to find a vaccine for Covid-19 still months if not years away from success, Taylor has some alarming news about the prevalence of anti-vaccination sentiment. In a fresh sampling of his survey group which has yet to be published, he found that a startling 21% of Americans said they would refuse a coronavirus vaccine. Were that proportion to translate into actual vaccine rejection, it could jeopardize the herd immunity upon which the health and safety of all Americans will depend.",

Brazil\u2019s health ministry registered 14,919 new confirmed cases in the prior 24 hours, taking the total to 233,142, behind the US, Russia and the UK.

A lot of them aren\u2019t even pretending to be in charge.\u201d</p> <h2>UK councils revolt against Boris Johnson\u2019s \u2018London-centric\u2019 strategy</h2> <p>Boris Johnson has been hit by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/16/revolt-over-easing-lockdown-spreads-as-poll-slump-hits-prime-minister\">growing revolt over his strategy</a> for easing the Covid-19 lockdown as council leaders across the north of England joined unions in vowing to resist plans to reopen schools on 1 June. In a further sign of discord, the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, writing in today\u2019s Observer, says no one thought to tell the leaders of the biggest towns and cities outside London in advance of the prime minister\u2019s decision to encourage people to go back to work last Monday.</p> <h2>Australian state of Victoria to reopen restaurants and pubs</h2> <p>Victoria, Australia\u2019s second most-populous state, will reopen restaurants and pubs on June 1, but patrons will have to provide their name and phone number before they can enter. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews said venues would initially be limited to 20 patrons, rising to 100 by mid-July. New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian, meanwhile, called for all Australian states to lift border restrictions. Victoria and NSW are the only states not to have closed their borders during the lockdown.</p> <h2>US states continue to loosen lockdown</h2> <p>New Orleans took its first steps to loosen restrictions that have been in place for two months, one day after the rest of Louisiana did the same, Associated Press reports.<br>The city is restricting buildings to 25% of capacity, like the rest of the state, but also requires restaurants, nail salons and other businesses to take customers by reservation. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said horse racing tracks and the Watkins Glen International auto track can reopen with no crowds, no fans.</p> <h2><strong>Germans press for return to Mallorca holiday homes</strong></h2> <p>Germans with holiday homes in Mallorca are clamouring to return to the sun-soaked island as the coronavirus lockdowns ease, but Spanish authorities are pushing back, Agence France-Presse reports. Several hundred Germans have in recent weeks sent pleading, sometimes angry letters to the regional government of the Balearic Islands asking them to allow foreign property owners to return to their second homes.</p> <h2>UK to invest \u00a393m in vaccine manufacturing centre</h2> <p>The British government will invest up to \u00a393m to bring forward construction of a new vaccine manufacturing centre, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said on Saturday. The funding will ensure the new centre opens in summer 2021, a year ahead of schedule. The Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre (VMIC) is a key component of the government\u2019s programme to ensure that once a coronavirus vaccine is available, it can be rolled out quickly in mass quantities, the department said.</p>",

A lot of them aren\u2019t even pretending to be in charge.\u201d UK councils revolt against Boris Johnson\u2019s \u2018London-centric\u2019 strategy Boris Johnson has been hit by a growing revolt over his strategy for easing the Covid-19 lockdown as council leaders across the north of England joined unions in vowing to resist plans to reopen schools on 1 June. In a further sign of discord, the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, writing in today\u2019s Observer, says no one thought to tell the leaders of the biggest towns and cities outside London in advance of the prime minister\u2019s decision to encourage people to go back to work last Monday. Australian state of Victoria to reopen restaurants and pubs Victoria, Australia\u2019s second most-populous state, will reopen restaurants and pubs on June 1, but patrons will have to provide their name and phone number before they can enter. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews said venues would initially be limited to 20 patrons, rising to 100 by mid-July. New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian, meanwhile, called for all Australian states to lift border restrictions. Victoria and NSW are the only states not to have closed their borders during the lockdown. US states continue to loosen lockdown New Orleans took its first steps to loosen restrictions that have been in place for two months, one day after the rest of Louisiana did the same, Associated Press reports. The city is restricting buildings to 25% of capacity, like the rest of the state, but also requires restaurants, nail salons and other businesses to take customers by reservation. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said horse racing tracks and the Watkins Glen International auto track can reopen with no crowds, no fans. Germans press for return to Mallorca holiday homes Germans with holiday homes in Mallorca are clamouring to return to the sun-soaked island as the coronavirus lockdowns ease, but Spanish authorities are pushing back, Agence France-Presse reports. Several hundred Germans have in recent weeks sent pleading, sometimes angry letters to the regional government of the Balearic Islands asking them to allow foreign property owners to return to their second homes. UK to invest \u00a393m in vaccine manufacturing centre The British government will invest up to \u00a393m to bring forward construction of a new vaccine manufacturing centre, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said on Saturday. The funding will ensure the new centre opens in summer 2021, a year ahead of schedule. The Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre (VMIC) is a key component of the government\u2019s programme to ensure that once a coronavirus vaccine is available, it can be rolled out quickly in mass quantities, the department said.",

      "body": "<p>Revelations about Neil Ferguson\u2019s private life, on which the dust has now settled, did raise the question of why there are certain words that are only ever used in newspapers. were commonly referred to as \u201ctrysts\u201d, yet when did you last hear anyone use that word in everyday conversation? Thought as much. I\u2019m only sorry that \u201clove nest\u201d didn\u2019t seem to get a mention and that there wasn\u2019t a \u201cgal pal\u201d only too eager to spill the beans. I feel a scandal is only a good one when there is one of these blabbermouths in the offing.</p> <p>Another phrase that is beloved by both newspapers and politicians is \u201croad map\u201d. When he wasn\u2019t talking about baby steps (ickle wickle things) in his last <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/boris-johnson-details-first-careful-steps-to-ease-covid-19-lockdown\" title=\"\">televised address to the nation</a>, Boris Johnson was citing his bumper book of routes out of this crisis. His roads all seemed to feature mountains, though whether we\u2019re going up one or coming down the other side was a little opaque. Perhaps if he used Ordnance Survey maps, the \u201cpath\u201d (another favourite) would be a little clearer. In future, I think \u201cguidance\u201d would be the mot juste.</p> <p>We also read much about the possibility of cashless societies at the moment. For the cashiers in my supermarket it seemingly can\u2019t come soon enough as they look at me with ill-disguised disdain when I proffer notes for my groceries. One such <a href=\"https://www.raconteur.net/sponsored/preparing-for-a-new-world-of-payments\">report included the following</a>: \u201cPersonalisation will take the user experience of payment solutions to the next level, with artificial intelligence and big data the key drivers... making it possible to build a unique user journey for each consumer.\u201d I think you\u2019ll agree that that is pretty ripe tosh, and convinces me that I\u2019m really quite happy to pay in tenners for the time being. </p> <p><br>\u2022Jonathan Bouquet is an Observer columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Revelations about Neil Ferguson\u2019s private life, on which the dust has now settled, did raise the question of why there are certain words that are only ever used in newspapers. were commonly referred to as \u201ctrysts\u201d, yet when did you last hear anyone use that word in everyday conversation? Thought as much. I\u2019m only sorry that \u201clove nest\u201d didn\u2019t seem to get a mention and that there wasn\u2019t a \u201cgal pal\u201d only too eager to spill the beans. I feel a scandal is only a good one when there is one of these blabbermouths in the offing. Another phrase that is beloved by both newspapers and politicians is \u201croad map\u201d. When he wasn\u2019t talking about baby steps (ickle wickle things) in his last televised address to the nation, Boris Johnson was citing his bumper book of routes out of this crisis. His roads all seemed to feature mountains, though whether we\u2019re going up one or coming down the other side was a little opaque. Perhaps if he used Ordnance Survey maps, the \u201cpath\u201d (another favourite) would be a little clearer. In future, I think \u201cguidance\u201d would be the mot juste. We also read much about the possibility of cashless societies at the moment. For the cashiers in my supermarket it seemingly can\u2019t come soon enough as they look at me with ill-disguised disdain when I proffer notes for my groceries. One such report included the following: \u201cPersonalisation will take the user experience of payment solutions to the next level, with artificial intelligence and big data the key drivers... making it possible to build a unique user journey for each consumer.\u201d I think you\u2019ll agree that that is pretty ripe tosh, and convinces me that I\u2019m really quite happy to pay in tenners for the time being. \u2022Jonathan Bouquet is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p>One effect of the unprecedented socioeconomic impact of Covid-19 has been to catapult the secretary of state for health and social care to the forefront of British politics. For the long month of April, with the prime minister either in intensive care with the disease or recuperating in isolation, there was no one with a more prominent government profile than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/matt-hancock\">Matt Hancock</a>.</p> <p>It was, to say the least, an unusual predicament for a health secretary. Since the controversy around the target of 100,000 daily coronavirus tests and Boris Johnson\u2019s return to work, Hancock has taken a small step back from the limelight. But if, in the final analysis, he is adjudged to have had a good pandemic, he could well be seen as a leader in waiting.</p> <p>On the other hand, if the UK\u2019s death count ends up the highest in Europe, as it currently stands, and the reports continue to mount of shortages in protective clothing and problems with testing and tracing, then history\u2019s equivalent of a surgical waste bin may well await him.</p> <p>Glory or infamy \u2013 those are the grand stakes in this unparalleled peacetime civil operation. Yet any halfway ambitious politician would relish the chance to be in Hancock\u2019s shoes right now. And it\u2019s rare that that can be said about the occupant of his office.</p> <p>Come the casino hour of our parliamentary system \u2013 the cabinet reshuffle \u2013 very few politicians entering No 10 hope to be named health secretary. It\u2019s a post with no visible upside. When anything goes wrong in health, someone usually dies. And things always go wrong. On top of which, the terrain is knee-deep in well-organised interest groups, all demanding more of everything.</p> <p>A widespread wariness about the job was most memorably captured in the response of the pugnacious Labour politician John Reid when appointed in 2003 by Tony Blair. \u201cOh fuck,\u201d he\u2019s supposed to have said, \u201cnot health.\u201d</p> <p>Kenneth Clarke, who was health secretary in the last couple of years of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s premiership, says that over the years he has issued a warning to various successors, both Labour and Conservative: \u201cYou\u2019re going to a political graveyard. If you can survive it, then you\u2019re ready, really ready, for the heat of frontline politics.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke describes the role as one of constant bombardment, unrelenting demands to do what others say, ceaseless criticism in the press, from opposition and interest groups, repeated declarations of a crisis and almost universal unpopularity, including among your cabinet colleagues. It sounds, I say, like the job from hell.</p> <p>\u201cI thought it was just immense fun,\u201d says Clarke.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c05dbe61b279a45ad9ba40bcecf4fb74e43b8dbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c05dbe61b279a45ad9ba40bcecf4fb74e43b8dbf/0_115_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Hancock giving the government\u2019s daily press briefing on 1 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A post with no visible upsides\u2019: Matt Hancock giving the government\u2019s daily press briefing on 1 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pippa Fowles/10 Downing Street/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He\u2019s not being ironic. He really did savour the challenge. The key thing, he says, is that you have to be prepared to \u201croll your sleeves up and defend yourself\u201d. If that conjures up an image of the health secretary working in a bare-knuckle boxing ring rather than a government department, then Norman Fowler makes a similar observation. \u201cIn my day,\u201d he says, \u201cthe most important quality [of a health secretary] was an ability to fight your corner in the public spending battles.\u201d</p> <p>As a belligerent spirit was the signature style of the first modern health secretary, Aneurin Bevan, perhaps it should be no surprise that, like ministerial red boxes, it has become part of the job description. The machismo might explain why the health ministry has been largely a male preserve. There have only been three female health secretaries, beginning in 1974 with Barbara Castle, who, it must be said, was no shrinking violet. (Virginia Bottomley and Patricia Hewitt were approached for this piece, but both declined to speak.)</p> <p>Although there has been some kind of minister for health dating back to the mid-19th century, it was not until a hundred years later, and the arrival in 1945 of Bevan, that the role we recognise today first took shape. A former miner who left school at 13, Bevan was a renowned political bruiser who drove through the National Health Service Act with unyielding determination.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you can survive it, then you\u2019re ready, really ready, for the heat of frontline politics</p> <footer> <cite>\u2013 Kenneth Clarke</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He had to overcome opposition from his own Labour benches as well as from within the Conservative party and the British Medical Association (BMA), whose members disparaged him as the \u201cTito of Tonypandy\u201d. But facing down his opponents, Bevan created a free-at-the-point-of-delivery health service for all, one that opened its doors on 5 July 1948. By the time he died 12 years after the NHS\u2019s birth, Bevan had become a national hero.</p> <p>That can\u2019t be said of any of his often unloved successors, although each of them has played a part in developing an NHS that has grown far beyond what Bevan envisaged.</p> <p>\u201cThe budget was \u00a3200m the year Nye Bevan introduced the NHS,\u201d says Alan Johnson, health secretary under Gordon Brown. \u201cIt was \u00a3110 bn when I left the job.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d81087ac43f2219b2d87143c02597efc62fe1a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d81087ac43f2219b2d87143c02597efc62fe1a9/0_236_4051_2430/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nye Bevan talks to constituents during the 1951 general election campaign.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nye Bevan talks to constituents during the 1951 general election campaign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Konig/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is currently <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/projects/nhs-in-a-nutshell/nhs-budget\">\u00a3140</a><a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/projects/nhs-in-a-nutshell/nhs-budget\">bn</a>. Even accounting for inflation, that\u2019s an extraordinary increase; yet whatever the figure, it\u2019s never enough. The NHS is the fifth-largest employer in the world. It\u2019s a gargantuan operation that necessarily contains large inefficiencies and daunting shortages. But we pay less per head of population for our health system than any other major western nation.</p> <p>That\u2019s one reason the NHS is perennially viewed as underfunded \u2013 even though health is about the only government department whose budget has never been cut. Nearly all governments are accused of shortchanging the NHS, but in particular Conservatives, who have traditionally been seen as, at best, reluctant supporters of the NHS, and more often as would-be privatisers.</p> <p>All the Conservative former health secretaries I spoke to think this accusation is unfair and inaccurate, and bemoan the fact that they had to spend rather too much time in office contesting a falsehood. Nonetheless, Margaret Thatcher was once keen to see the UK adopt a US-style private insurance-funded health service. And from time to time, a Conservative thinktank or backbench ideologue will revisit the proposal, to keep the dream alive.</p> <p>Fowler, who served as health secretary for six years under Thatcher, accepts these points. \u201cBut,\u201d he protests, \u201cthe significant thing is that those ideas have never got anywhere. And if they didn\u2019t get anywhere under Margaret Thatcher, they\u2019re not likely to get anywhere under any other prime minister.\u201d</p> <p>Matt Hancock\u2019s immediate predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, complains that whatever he did in the job, he always faced the same charge of having a secret agenda.</p> <p>\u201cI was accused of starving the NHS of funds as a way of persuading the public that the only option was privatisation,\u201d he says. \u201cI then secured a \u00a320bn rise in budget and the very same people said on Twitter: \u2018Ah, he\u2019s fattening the NHS up for privatisation.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In fact, Conservative spending on health was limited for most of Hunt\u2019s time in office and during that of his predecessor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/andrewlansley\">Andrew Lansley</a>, at least by comparison with the boom times of the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. In large part this was due to the austerity measures that the Coalition and Conservative governments imposed, following the 2008 financial crisis.</p> <p>Some critics have suggested that the shortfall in protective clothing for NHS staff witnessed in this pandemic is in part a legacy of underfunding during Hunt\u2019s tenure. \u201cI felt throughout my time as health secretary that it did need more resources,\u201d Hunt concedes. \u201cThere is more you can do on efficiency, but in the end only so much, and it needed more resources.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016, while Hunt was still in office, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/what-was-exercise-cygnus-and-what-did-it-find\">Exercise Cygnus</a> was conducted to test how the UK would respond to a pandemic. According to leaked sections of the report, which has never been published, it was found that the country was not ready to cope, particularly in the area of social care.</p> <p>Hunt still maintains that austerity was the right policy to put the economy back on its feet, but he adds: \u201cI don\u2019t want to minimise the fact that this was a very tough period for the NHS.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Best practice for managing coronavirus has been in Asia. We could have looked at Korea, Taiwan, Singapore</p> <footer> <cite>\u2013 Jeremy Hunt</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hunt is now chair of the Health and Social Care select committee, in which position he has questioned some of Hancock\u2019s decisions during the pandemic, such as prematurely discontinuing community testing. He\u2019s reluctant to put Hancock on the spot, but says the key concern is to ask if we\u2019re following the most effective international policy. \u201cIt\u2019s been very clear that international best practice for managing coronavirus has been in Asia. I think because China\u2019s totalitarian it was thought there was not much point looking too closely at what was happening there, because they can do things we could never do in a free society. But I think we could have looked at [South] Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, which are all democracies.\u201d</p> <p>One fan of Hunt\u2019s work on the health select committee is Alan Johnson. \u201cI think he\u2019s doing a great job as chair,\u201d he says, which is probably not the verdict he would give on Hunt\u2019s time in office. Like Hunt, Johnson emphasises the drive to improve patient care as his biggest motivating factor when he was health secretary. He therefore had little time for those who perceived any outsourcing of services as backdoor privatisation. \u201cYou talk to people on the left and the job of the NHS is to employ public service workers,\u201d he says, shaking his head in our FaceTime call. \u201cNot to improve disgraceful waiting times.\u201d</p> <p>For all his modernising zeal, Johnson says the NHS\u2019s greatest strength is its old-fashioned social solidarity, a quality, be argues, that Conservatives don\u2019t really understand. \u201cIt\u2019s against all the philosophy they\u2019ve imbibed.\u201d The irony, then, is that social solidarity has never been more loudly promoted among Tories than by this current government. The NHS has been rebranded \u201cOur NHS\u201d, its workers hailed as national heroes, invoked at every turn by politicians and applauded every Thursday evening by the public. Although the form of expression is new, the sentiment is not. The NHS invariably features at the top of the list of institutions of which Britons feel most proud. The problem for health secretaries is that this national pride can manifest as an over-protectiveness \u2013 \u201cHands off the NHS\u201d \u2013 that leaves them limited room for manoeuvre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e166cf5765ad4de0d2e3c3a39fe2d507feb1795\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e166cf5765ad4de0d2e3c3a39fe2d507feb1795/0_0_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nurses protesting outside 10 Downing Street last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nurses protesting outside 10 Downing Street last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As such, they often find themselves caught between contradictory instructions: improve the service and leave it alone. Fowler knows the syndrome well. \u201cPut it this way,\u201d he says, \u201cone of the most serious bursts of applause I\u2019ve ever had was when I was introduced at a conference of medical experts as the only secretary of state who didn\u2019t try to reorganise the health service.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke is less familiar with that kind of resounding applause. He embarked on a major overhaul of management, creating an internal market inspired in part, he says, by a need to head off Thatcher\u2019s more radical proposals. It led to a series of massive rows between the prime minister and her health secretary. \u201cSomeone once told me we had 14 meetings about it,\u201d he says, both amazed and amused by the number. \u201cShe was even more combative than I am. It was basically a bureaucratic shambles,\u201d he says of the service he set about reforming, \u201cas there was no proper management or control of the system.\u201d</p> <p>In spite of his own restructuring of the NHS, which he says has stood the test of time because no one has reversed it, Clarke doesn\u2019t think constant organisational reform is a good thing. \u201cThat must sound off coming from me. But you can\u2019t have every secretary of state going in for an upheaval like that.\u201d</p> <p>In a highly competitive field, perhaps the greatest upheaval was wrought by Andrew Lansley, David Cameron\u2019s first health secretary. He is the exemplar of a longstanding NHS paradox \u2013 decentralisation from above. The more he argued for local empowerment, the more he micromanaged the transition, bolstering GPs, creating Public Health England, abolishing primary care trusts and much else besides. The consensus among his fellow health secretaries is that the reforms were misjudged, confusing and unnecessary.</p> <p>\u201cI think Cameron thinks of [the Lansley reforms] as the biggest mistake he made,\u201d says Johnson, cunningly<strong> </strong>recruiting the former prime minister to make his point. A little more diplomatically, Clarke says that he\u2019s not convinced the reforms were \u201cthe main thing the health service needed\u201d. Andy Burnham, who took over from Johnson and then shadowed Lansley,<strong> </strong>suggests that many of the changes have subsequently been abandoned or ignored.</p> <p>If reorganisational exhaustion in the wake of Lansley dampened the appetite for re-envisioning the NHS, Covid-19 has removed it from the agenda for the foreseeable future. For all its terrible toll of death and devastation, a major pandemic is a clarifying experience. Suddenly, discussions about rationalising regional management structures are beside the point. There is instead a unity of purpose and a galvanising sense of clear battle lines. It\u2019s no coincidence that the most common political metaphors employed in the Covid-19 debate are military ones. Just as every defence secretary works to avoid war, but only really comes into his or her own when war breaks out, no health secretary wants a pandemic, and yet it\u2019s their career-defining moment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"42adc2b44045a942e149fdaf8c68f573274ff536\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42adc2b44045a942e149fdaf8c68f573274ff536/0_18_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A government Aids awareness campaign billboard, 1986.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A government Aids awareness campaign billboard, 1986.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ltd/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If Fowler is remembered by some clinicians for his executive light touch, he is better known for his performance during the Aids crisis in the mid-1980s. It\u2019s easy to forget, amid the relentless news coverage of Covid-19, but HIV was a killer virus for which there was no treatment when it first came to light. It has since <a href=\"https://www.who.int/gho/hiv/en/\">killed tens of millions around the world</a>, though in the UK today, HIV is seldom fatal. Initially, it sparked enormous fear and stigmatisation, particularly of the gay community, which suffered a disproportionate number of deaths. But it was a period that Fowler looks back on with most professional and political satisfaction. \u201cThe whole health service worked together; no question, no arguments,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd when it acts together it really is a wonderful service.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Don't Die of Ignorance campaign was criticised for being over the top\u2026 but 90% of the public agreed with it</p> <footer> <cite>\u2013 Norman Fowler</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is also another feature of pandemics that can bring the best out in politicians. As few, if any, health secretaries come from medical backgrounds, they usually find themselves deferring to clinical expertise. This is especially true in a pandemic. The difference is that the art of communication \u2013 the politician\u2019s area of expertise \u2013 also becomes increasingly important. In Fowler\u2019s case, he had the job of informing the public and reforming its behaviour \u2013 primarily, encouraging the use of condoms. Hence the government\u2019s bold <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/sep/04/how-we-made-dont-die-of-ignorance-aids-campaign\">advertising campaign \u201cDon\u2019t Die of Ignorance\u201d</a>, which grabbed the nation\u2019s anxious attention in 1987.</p> <p>\u201cThe campaign was criticised for being over the top, but the follow-up survey showed that over 90% of the public agreed with it,\u201d says Fowler.</p> <p>He also had to do battle with Thatcher, and some of his cabinet colleagues, who were either squeamish or positively damning about issues of gay sexual practice and intravenous drug use \u2013 the main conduits of HIV transmission in this country.</p> <p>\u201cI got totally frustrated in 1986,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was a national crisis and I didn\u2019t think we were making the progress we should be making in a national crisis. I remember being asked: \u2018Do we have to have this section on risky sex?\u2019 The whole point of the advertisement was to explain to people why they should avoid what they called risky sex!\u201d</p> <p>Given the prime ministerial scrutiny he was under, I ask him whether it\u2019s at all liberating for a health secretary if your boss is, as Johnson recently was, out of commission. \u201cI never had that luxury,\u201d he laments. \u201cTheoretically, it\u2019s not an ideal circumstance.\u201d</p> <p>Fowler is not the only health secretary in living memory who faced a pandemic in office.</p> <p>\u201cI was three days into the job when a global pandemic was declared with swine flu,\u201d says Burnham, adding as a humorous aside: \u201cAs he exited the door, Mr Alan Johnson proved again that he\u2019s a master of political timing.\u201d Interestingly, Johnson recalls the pandemic as something that happened on his shift. \u201cWhat took up most of my time?\u201d he asks. \u201cWell, there was the pandemic, of course.\u201d</p> <p>In the event, regardless of who was in the hot seat, the H1N1 swine flu was not nearly as life-threatening as first feared. Some critics consequently suggested that the Labour government and the two health secretaries overreacted. But both men highlight the fact that a pandemic was top of the government risk register and they were well prepared to deal with it. Just as a flawed or under-resourced plan can leave a health secretary on the defensive, the more successful a strategy is, the less people get to see how bad things might have been. In a political sense it\u2019s a lose-lose situation.<strong> </strong>\u201cIt was kind of a fraught terrain in those early days of swine flu,\u201d remembers Burnham. \u201cI made mistakes wrestling with these issues and sometimes came down on the wrong side.\u201d He regrets putting the worst-case scenario statistics in the public domain \u2013 60,000 deaths were predicted at the upper end, but there were actually fewer than 500. He also recalls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/11/swine-flu-tamiflu-andrew-castle\">a \u201ccar crash\u201d TV interview with Andrew Castle</a>, whose daughter had had a seriously adverse<strong> </strong>reaction to Tamiflu, the prophylactic issued to children. \u201cI came away thinking, I\u2019m not the person to be defending Tamiflu on national television,\u201d he says.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nobody will privatise the NHS now. It\u2019s finally entered into that sort of sacred space</p> <footer> <cite>\u2013 Andy Burnham</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>His advice for Hancock is to resist the temptation to front the message too much on TV. Hunt, however, has only praise for what he says has been a strong communications campaign with a clear message \u2013 we spoke before the much-criticised change from \u201cstay home\u201d to \u201cstay alert\u201d. That said, he believes a longer-term strategy should be clearly outlined. \u201cPeople need to understand how we\u2019re going to exit the current situation.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke picks out Hancock as a good performer among some less impressive government ministers, but he offers a word of caution directly to the young health secretary. \u201cMy advice to you will be, don\u2019t start giving forecasts when we\u2019re dealing with a total unknown here, and don\u2019t start making forecasts on testing.\u201d</p> <p>Several of the former health secretaries thought that Hancock made himself a hostage to fortune with his promise of reaching 100,000 coronavirus tests by the end of April. But all agree that it won\u2019t be until an inquiry is held after the crisis has passed that any worthwhile or lasting judgments can be made on the government\u2019s and Hancock\u2019s handling of the pandemic. In the meantime, Burnham thinks the best thing to come out of the crisis is that the NHS will no longer be under any kind of existential threat, real or imagined. \u201cNobody will privatise it now; nobody will introduce different funding models. It\u2019s finally entered into that sort of sacred space.\u201d<strong> </strong>He argues that social care provision should be folded into the NHS. While he\u2019s long supported this option, he says the case is irrefutable now the limitations of the social care system have been thoroughly exposed by Covid-19. \u201cHow can someone who is so essential that they are caring for another human being not be paid the living wage?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful.\u201d</p> <p>There seems little doubt that social care is the neglected side of the portfolio in the Department of Health and Social Care, the unloved child forever in the shadow of its revered sibling. It would amount to a massive undertaking and significant investment to bring social care under the NHS umbrella. Whether or not it\u2019s something Hancock will consider, it\u2019s hard to believe that what Johnson<strong> </strong>calls the \u201cscandalous crisis in adult social care\u201d can be allowed to continue after the viral dust has settled.</p> <p>There have been no shortage of predictions \u2013 some wildly optimistic, others darkly ominous \u2013 about the post-Covid-19 world.

It\u2019s far too early to know what the outcome will look like, or when it will arrive, but perhaps we can tentatively suggest that in the next cabinet reshuffle the word on the health job won\u2019t be a four-letter one.</p> <h2>In brief: how was it for them?</h2> <h2><strong>Norman Fowler,</strong> Conservative, in post 1981\u20131987</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5dbb25cdb15cab903fa73f838373fc1d94afbdf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5dbb25cdb15cab903fa73f838373fc1d94afbdf/0_398_5976_3586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Norman Fowler in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Norman Fowler in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Key issue </strong> How to mount an Aids public awareness campaign.</p> <p><strong>Initial view of the post? </strong> \u201cI knew all the problems.

      "bodyText": "One effect of the unprecedented socioeconomic impact of Covid-19 has been to catapult the secretary of state for health and social care to the forefront of British politics. For the long month of April, with the prime minister either in intensive care with the disease or recuperating in isolation, there was no one with a more prominent government profile than Matt Hancock. It was, to say the least, an unusual predicament for a health secretary. Since the controversy around the target of 100,000 daily coronavirus tests and Boris Johnson\u2019s return to work, Hancock has taken a small step back from the limelight. But if, in the final analysis, he is adjudged to have had a good pandemic, he could well be seen as a leader in waiting. On the other hand, if the UK\u2019s death count ends up the highest in Europe, as it currently stands, and the reports continue to mount of shortages in protective clothing and problems with testing and tracing, then history\u2019s equivalent of a surgical waste bin may well await him. Glory or infamy \u2013 those are the grand stakes in this unparalleled peacetime civil operation. Yet any halfway ambitious politician would relish the chance to be in Hancock\u2019s shoes right now. And it\u2019s rare that that can be said about the occupant of his office. Come the casino hour of our parliamentary system \u2013 the cabinet reshuffle \u2013 very few politicians entering No 10 hope to be named health secretary. It\u2019s a post with no visible upside. When anything goes wrong in health, someone usually dies. And things always go wrong. On top of which, the terrain is knee-deep in well-organised interest groups, all demanding more of everything. A widespread wariness about the job was most memorably captured in the response of the pugnacious Labour politician John Reid when appointed in 2003 by Tony Blair. \u201cOh fuck,\u201d he\u2019s supposed to have said, \u201cnot health.\u201d Kenneth Clarke, who was health secretary in the last couple of years of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s premiership, says that over the years he has issued a warning to various successors, both Labour and Conservative: \u201cYou\u2019re going to a political graveyard. If you can survive it, then you\u2019re ready, really ready, for the heat of frontline politics.\u201d Clarke describes the role as one of constant bombardment, unrelenting demands to do what others say, ceaseless criticism in the press, from opposition and interest groups, repeated declarations of a crisis and almost universal unpopularity, including among your cabinet colleagues. It sounds, I say, like the job from hell. \u201cI thought it was just immense fun,\u201d says Clarke. He\u2019s not being ironic. He really did savour the challenge. The key thing, he says, is that you have to be prepared to \u201croll your sleeves up and defend yourself\u201d. If that conjures up an image of the health secretary working in a bare-knuckle boxing ring rather than a government department, then Norman Fowler makes a similar observation. \u201cIn my day,\u201d he says, \u201cthe most important quality [of a health secretary] was an ability to fight your corner in the public spending battles.\u201d As a belligerent spirit was the signature style of the first modern health secretary, Aneurin Bevan, perhaps it should be no surprise that, like ministerial red boxes, it has become part of the job description. The machismo might explain why the health ministry has been largely a male preserve. There have only been three female health secretaries, beginning in 1974 with Barbara Castle, who, it must be said, was no shrinking violet. (Virginia Bottomley and Patricia Hewitt were approached for this piece, but both declined to speak.) Although there has been some kind of minister for health dating back to the mid-19th century, it was not until a hundred years later, and the arrival in 1945 of Bevan, that the role we recognise today first took shape. A former miner who left school at 13, Bevan was a renowned political bruiser who drove through the National Health Service Act with unyielding determination. He had to overcome opposition from his own Labour benches as well as from within the Conservative party and the British Medical Association (BMA), whose members disparaged him as the \u201cTito of Tonypandy\u201d. But facing down his opponents, Bevan created a free-at-the-point-of-delivery health service for all, one that opened its doors on 5 July 1948. By the time he died 12 years after the NHS\u2019s birth, Bevan had become a national hero. That can\u2019t be said of any of his often unloved successors, although each of them has played a part in developing an NHS that has grown far beyond what Bevan envisaged. \u201cThe budget was \u00a3200m the year Nye Bevan introduced the NHS,\u201d says Alan Johnson, health secretary under Gordon Brown. \u201cIt was \u00a3110 bn when I left the job.\u201d It is currently \u00a3140bn. Even accounting for inflation, that\u2019s an extraordinary increase; yet whatever the figure, it\u2019s never enough. The NHS is the fifth-largest employer in the world. It\u2019s a gargantuan operation that necessarily contains large inefficiencies and daunting shortages. But we pay less per head of population for our health system than any other major western nation. That\u2019s one reason the NHS is perennially viewed as underfunded \u2013 even though health is about the only government department whose budget has never been cut. Nearly all governments are accused of shortchanging the NHS, but in particular Conservatives, who have traditionally been seen as, at best, reluctant supporters of the NHS, and more often as would-be privatisers. All the Conservative former health secretaries I spoke to think this accusation is unfair and inaccurate, and bemoan the fact that they had to spend rather too much time in office contesting a falsehood. Nonetheless, Margaret Thatcher was once keen to see the UK adopt a US-style private insurance-funded health service. And from time to time, a Conservative thinktank or backbench ideologue will revisit the proposal, to keep the dream alive. Fowler, who served as health secretary for six years under Thatcher, accepts these points. \u201cBut,\u201d he protests, \u201cthe significant thing is that those ideas have never got anywhere. And if they didn\u2019t get anywhere under Margaret Thatcher, they\u2019re not likely to get anywhere under any other prime minister.\u201d Matt Hancock\u2019s immediate predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, complains that whatever he did in the job, he always faced the same charge of having a secret agenda. \u201cI was accused of starving the NHS of funds as a way of persuading the public that the only option was privatisation,\u201d he says. \u201cI then secured a \u00a320bn rise in budget and the very same people said on Twitter: \u2018Ah, he\u2019s fattening the NHS up for privatisation.\u2019\u201d In fact, Conservative spending on health was limited for most of Hunt\u2019s time in office and during that of his predecessor, Andrew Lansley, at least by comparison with the boom times of the Labour governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. In large part this was due to the austerity measures that the Coalition and Conservative governments imposed, following the 2008 financial crisis. Some critics have suggested that the shortfall in protective clothing for NHS staff witnessed in this pandemic is in part a legacy of underfunding during Hunt\u2019s tenure. \u201cI felt throughout my time as health secretary that it did need more resources,\u201d Hunt concedes. \u201cThere is more you can do on efficiency, but in the end only so much, and it needed more resources.\u201d In 2016, while Hunt was still in office, Exercise Cygnus was conducted to test how the UK would respond to a pandemic. According to leaked sections of the report, which has never been published, it was found that the country was not ready to cope, particularly in the area of social care. Hunt still maintains that austerity was the right policy to put the economy back on its feet, but he adds: \u201cI don\u2019t want to minimise the fact that this was a very tough period for the NHS.\u201d Hunt is now chair of the Health and Social Care select committee, in which position he has questioned some of Hancock\u2019s decisions during the pandemic, such as prematurely discontinuing community testing. He\u2019s reluctant to put Hancock on the spot, but says the key concern is to ask if we\u2019re following the most effective international policy. \u201cIt\u2019s been very clear that international best practice for managing coronavirus has been in Asia. I think because China\u2019s totalitarian it was thought there was not much point looking too closely at what was happening there, because they can do things we could never do in a free society. But I think we could have looked at [South] Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, which are all democracies.\u201d One fan of Hunt\u2019s work on the health select committee is Alan Johnson. \u201cI think he\u2019s doing a great job as chair,\u201d he says, which is probably not the verdict he would give on Hunt\u2019s time in office. Like Hunt, Johnson emphasises the drive to improve patient care as his biggest motivating factor when he was health secretary. He therefore had little time for those who perceived any outsourcing of services as backdoor privatisation. \u201cYou talk to people on the left and the job of the NHS is to employ public service workers,\u201d he says, shaking his head in our FaceTime call. \u201cNot to improve disgraceful waiting times.\u201d For all his modernising zeal, Johnson says the NHS\u2019s greatest strength is its old-fashioned social solidarity, a quality, be argues, that Conservatives don\u2019t really understand. \u201cIt\u2019s against all the philosophy they\u2019ve imbibed.\u201d The irony, then, is that social solidarity has never been more loudly promoted among Tories than by this current government. The NHS has been rebranded \u201cOur NHS\u201d, its workers hailed as national heroes, invoked at every turn by politicians and applauded every Thursday evening by the public. Although the form of expression is new, the sentiment is not. The NHS invariably features at the top of the list of institutions of which Britons feel most proud. The problem for health secretaries is that this national pride can manifest as an over-protectiveness \u2013 \u201cHands off the NHS\u201d \u2013 that leaves them limited room for manoeuvre. As such, they often find themselves caught between contradictory instructions: improve the service and leave it alone. Fowler knows the syndrome well. \u201cPut it this way,\u201d he says, \u201cone of the most serious bursts of applause I\u2019ve ever had was when I was introduced at a conference of medical experts as the only secretary of state who didn\u2019t try to reorganise the health service.\u201d Clarke is less familiar with that kind of resounding applause. He embarked on a major overhaul of management, creating an internal market inspired in part, he says, by a need to head off Thatcher\u2019s more radical proposals. It led to a series of massive rows between the prime minister and her health secretary. \u201cSomeone once told me we had 14 meetings about it,\u201d he says, both amazed and amused by the number. \u201cShe was even more combative than I am. It was basically a bureaucratic shambles,\u201d he says of the service he set about reforming, \u201cas there was no proper management or control of the system.\u201d In spite of his own restructuring of the NHS, which he says has stood the test of time because no one has reversed it, Clarke doesn\u2019t think constant organisational reform is a good thing. \u201cThat must sound off coming from me. But you can\u2019t have every secretary of state going in for an upheaval like that.\u201d In a highly competitive field, perhaps the greatest upheaval was wrought by Andrew Lansley, David Cameron\u2019s first health secretary. He is the exemplar of a longstanding NHS paradox \u2013 decentralisation from above. The more he argued for local empowerment, the more he micromanaged the transition, bolstering GPs, creating Public Health England, abolishing primary care trusts and much else besides. The consensus among his fellow health secretaries is that the reforms were misjudged, confusing and unnecessary. \u201cI think Cameron thinks of [the Lansley reforms] as the biggest mistake he made,\u201d says Johnson, cunningly recruiting the former prime minister to make his point. A little more diplomatically, Clarke says that he\u2019s not convinced the reforms were \u201cthe main thing the health service needed\u201d. Andy Burnham, who took over from Johnson and then shadowed Lansley, suggests that many of the changes have subsequently been abandoned or ignored. If reorganisational exhaustion in the wake of Lansley dampened the appetite for re-envisioning the NHS, Covid-19 has removed it from the agenda for the foreseeable future. For all its terrible toll of death and devastation, a major pandemic is a clarifying experience. Suddenly, discussions about rationalising regional management structures are beside the point. There is instead a unity of purpose and a galvanising sense of clear battle lines. It\u2019s no coincidence that the most common political metaphors employed in the Covid-19 debate are military ones. Just as every defence secretary works to avoid war, but only really comes into his or her own when war breaks out, no health secretary wants a pandemic, and yet it\u2019s their career-defining moment. If Fowler is remembered by some clinicians for his executive light touch, he is better known for his performance during the Aids crisis in the mid-1980s. It\u2019s easy to forget, amid the relentless news coverage of Covid-19, but HIV was a killer virus for which there was no treatment when it first came to light. It has since killed tens of millions around the world, though in the UK today, HIV is seldom fatal. Initially, it sparked enormous fear and stigmatisation, particularly of the gay community, which suffered a disproportionate number of deaths. But it was a period that Fowler looks back on with most professional and political satisfaction. \u201cThe whole health service worked together; no question, no arguments,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd when it acts together it really is a wonderful service.\u201d There is also another feature of pandemics that can bring the best out in politicians. As few, if any, health secretaries come from medical backgrounds, they usually find themselves deferring to clinical expertise. This is especially true in a pandemic. The difference is that the art of communication \u2013 the politician\u2019s area of expertise \u2013 also becomes increasingly important. In Fowler\u2019s case, he had the job of informing the public and reforming its behaviour \u2013 primarily, encouraging the use of condoms. Hence the government\u2019s bold advertising campaign \u201cDon\u2019t Die of Ignorance\u201d, which grabbed the nation\u2019s anxious attention in 1987. \u201cThe campaign was criticised for being over the top, but the follow-up survey showed that over 90% of the public agreed with it,\u201d says Fowler. He also had to do battle with Thatcher, and some of his cabinet colleagues, who were either squeamish or positively damning about issues of gay sexual practice and intravenous drug use \u2013 the main conduits of HIV transmission in this country. \u201cI got totally frustrated in 1986,\u201d he recalls. \u201cIt was a national crisis and I didn\u2019t think we were making the progress we should be making in a national crisis. I remember being asked: \u2018Do we have to have this section on risky sex?\u2019 The whole point of the advertisement was to explain to people why they should avoid what they called risky sex!\u201d Given the prime ministerial scrutiny he was under, I ask him whether it\u2019s at all liberating for a health secretary if your boss is, as Johnson recently was, out of commission. \u201cI never had that luxury,\u201d he laments. \u201cTheoretically, it\u2019s not an ideal circumstance.\u201d Fowler is not the only health secretary in living memory who faced a pandemic in office. \u201cI was three days into the job when a global pandemic was declared with swine flu,\u201d says Burnham, adding as a humorous aside: \u201cAs he exited the door, Mr Alan Johnson proved again that he\u2019s a master of political timing.\u201d Interestingly, Johnson recalls the pandemic as something that happened on his shift. \u201cWhat took up most of my time?\u201d he asks. \u201cWell, there was the pandemic, of course.\u201d In the event, regardless of who was in the hot seat, the H1N1 swine flu was not nearly as life-threatening as first feared. Some critics consequently suggested that the Labour government and the two health secretaries overreacted. But both men highlight the fact that a pandemic was top of the government risk register and they were well prepared to deal with it. Just as a flawed or under-resourced plan can leave a health secretary on the defensive, the more successful a strategy is, the less people get to see how bad things might have been. In a political sense it\u2019s a lose-lose situation. \u201cIt was kind of a fraught terrain in those early days of swine flu,\u201d remembers Burnham. \u201cI made mistakes wrestling with these issues and sometimes came down on the wrong side.\u201d He regrets putting the worst-case scenario statistics in the public domain \u2013 60,000 deaths were predicted at the upper end, but there were actually fewer than 500. He also recalls a \u201ccar crash\u201d TV interview with Andrew Castle, whose daughter had had a seriously adverse reaction to Tamiflu, the prophylactic issued to children. \u201cI came away thinking, I\u2019m not the person to be defending Tamiflu on national television,\u201d he says. His advice for Hancock is to resist the temptation to front the message too much on TV. Hunt, however, has only praise for what he says has been a strong communications campaign with a clear message \u2013 we spoke before the much-criticised change from \u201cstay home\u201d to \u201cstay alert\u201d. That said, he believes a longer-term strategy should be clearly outlined. \u201cPeople need to understand how we\u2019re going to exit the current situation.\u201d Clarke picks out Hancock as a good performer among some less impressive government ministers, but he offers a word of caution directly to the young health secretary. \u201cMy advice to you will be, don\u2019t start giving forecasts when we\u2019re dealing with a total unknown here, and don\u2019t start making forecasts on testing.\u201d Several of the former health secretaries thought that Hancock made himself a hostage to fortune with his promise of reaching 100,000 coronavirus tests by the end of April. But all agree that it won\u2019t be until an inquiry is held after the crisis has passed that any worthwhile or lasting judgments can be made on the government\u2019s and Hancock\u2019s handling of the pandemic. In the meantime, Burnham thinks the best thing to come out of the crisis is that the NHS will no longer be under any kind of existential threat, real or imagined. \u201cNobody will privatise it now; nobody will introduce different funding models. It\u2019s finally entered into that sort of sacred space.\u201d He argues that social care provision should be folded into the NHS. While he\u2019s long supported this option, he says the case is irrefutable now the limitations of the social care system have been thoroughly exposed by Covid-19. \u201cHow can someone who is so essential that they are caring for another human being not be paid the living wage?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful.\u201d There seems little doubt that social care is the neglected side of the portfolio in the Department of Health and Social Care, the unloved child forever in the shadow of its revered sibling. It would amount to a massive undertaking and significant investment to bring social care under the NHS umbrella. Whether or not it\u2019s something Hancock will consider, it\u2019s hard to believe that what Johnson calls the \u201cscandalous crisis in adult social care\u201d can be allowed to continue after the viral dust has settled. There have been no shortage of predictions \u2013 some wildly optimistic, others darkly ominous \u2013 about the post-Covid-19 world. The first task, obviously, is to make it a post-Covid-19 world, and in that endeavour the health secretary has a vital role to play. It\u2019s far too early to know what the outcome will look like, or when it will arrive, but perhaps we can tentatively suggest that in the next cabinet reshuffle the word on the health job won\u2019t be a four-letter one. In brief: how was it for them? Norman Fowler, Conservative, in post 1981\u20131987 Key issue How to mount an Aids public awareness campaign. Initial view of the post? \u201cI knew all the problems. [But] it was not at all clear where the political advantages were.\u201d Most satisfying aspect of the job? \u201cIt goes back to Aids again. With something like the virus, you know more than your medical experts about how to communicate to the public.\u201d Greatest strength of the NHS? \u201cIt\u2019s an institution that is valued and recognised by the vast majority of the public.\u201d Greatest weakness? \u201cIt tends to be a bit of a political football.\u201d Do you think public health workers are adequately rewarded? \u201cYou could make a very strong case for looking at all this again, particularly with nurses, who have been working, at times, at peril.\u201d Kenneth Clarke, Conservative, in post 1988\u20131990 Key issue How to reform the NHS without adopting an American system. Advice he was given? \u201cYou\u2019ve got to find a concession to give the BMA at least once a year.\u201d His own advice? \u201cThe aim of any decent department minister is to get the prime minister to take as little interest in the subject as possible.\u201d Most satisfying aspect of the job? \u201cKnowing that you\u2019re trying to make a difference to something that is vitally important \u2013 the wellbeing of the country.\u201d Do you think public health workers are adequately rewarded? \u201cYes, though it\u2019s gone up and down over the years. They\u2019re much better paid now than they were in my time.\u201d Alan Johnson, Labour, in post 2007\u20132009 Key issue \u201cWe had a bad deal with the drug companies that was supposed to last for six years. I pulled it and went through the whole process again to get a better deal on drugs.\u201d Most satisfying aspect of the job? \u201cThe feeling that you were in a small way part of something so crucial to people\u2019s lives. That was a privilege.\u201d On Matt Hancock\u2019s performance: \u201cI\u2019m not really impressed. I don\u2019t think Matt Hancock\u2019s as good as he thinks he is.\u201d Do you think public health workers are adequately rewarded? \u201cBy the time we left office they were a lot more adequately rewarded than they had been. But it\u2019s slipped back again; so no, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re adequately rewarded.\u201d Andy Burnham, Labour, in post 2009\u20132010 Key issue Organising the response to the H1N1 swine flu pandemic. Most satisfying aspect of the job? \u201cThere was an independent review that said the response to the swine flu was highly satisfactory.\u201d What did you find difficult about the job? \u201cI inherited stuff I never felt comfortable with. I would point to the use of the private sector. I was never an advocate of that.\u201d Do you have sympathy for Matt Hancock? \u201cI thought it was awful when one of the newspapers had a Number 10 briefing against him. That was a cruel moment. I think he needs to be given the benefit of the doubt. It\u2019s a tough gig and he\u2019s made some obvious mistakes, but given the severity of what he\u2019s been dealing with, he\u2019s not doing badly.\u201d Do you think public health workers are adequately rewarded? \u201cLet me talk about social care workers: 58% of carers, the majority of whom are women, do not receive a real living wage. That\u2019s disgraceful.\u201d Jeremy Hunt, Conservative, in post 2012-2018 Key issue The imposition of new contracts for junior doctors which led to prolonged strike action. Most satisfying aspect of the job? \u201cMy greatest satisfaction was in some of the interactions I had with patients and families who had really suffered badly as a result of something going wrong. They were people actually who kept me going for nearly six years.\u201d Biggest surprise? \u201cI found out that 150 people a week die in the NHS because of errors in their medical treatment. I was gobsmacked by that. Then I discovered this was actually true all over the world; this is what happens in medicine.\u201d Have you ever been interested in privatising the NHS? \u201cI\u2019ve always been a passionate believer in the NHS. There\u2019s something about what the NHS stands for which speaks to the best of British values.\u201d Do you think this pandemic calls for the help of former health secretaries? \u201cI think there\u2019s a role for people outside politics to come in in moments of national crisis. There are times when you need people who can \u2013 to use that horrible business phrase \u2013 JFDI things.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Only a few weeks ago Boris Johnson was invoking the spirit of Winston Churchill when he called on the nation to unite in the fight against the coronavirus. As he took the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/23/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-boris-johnson-minister-condemns-people-ignoring-two-metre-distance-rule-in-parks-as-very-selfish\">momentous decision</a> to order the closure of pubs, restaurants and many shops on 23 March, much of the United Kingdom seemed ready to respond and rally round the flag at a time of crisis. Similar lockdowns were ordered in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Rival political leaders offered to abandon hostilities and seek consensus. There was talk of forming a government of national unity. Johnson\u2019s ratings soared in the polls as voters heard the call to join a great collective effort. \u201cWe will get through this together,\u201d he told the country.</p> <p>That was then. Last week the short-lived unity fractured, and trust in the government in London started to haemorrhage away. Political leaders in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast began to resist and go their own ways in the fight against Covid-19. In England, open dissent started to break out in the regions. This weekend some council leaders in England have vowed to defy the government at Westminster by refusing to re-open schools on 1 June, as Johnson wants, because of fears for their pupils\u2019 and teachers\u2019 safety. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/regional-differences-in-covid-19-transmission-rate-emerge-in-england\">R rate</a> (of the virus\u2019s reproduction) is too high and the move too risky, they say, echoing the views of worried teaching unions. Yesterday Hartlepool council issued a statement: \u201cGiven that coronavirus cases locally continue to rise, Hartlepool borough council has been working with schools and we have agreed they will not reopen on Monday 1 June. Whilst we recognise the importance of schools reopening, we want to be absolutely clear that we will be taking a measured and cautious approach to this.\u201d</p> <p>The worry in northern parts of the country where the R rate is rising is that there could be a surge in cases that would then spread nationally. As Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester writes in this newspaper today, reflecting on the past week: \u201cLife has changed and, suddenly, everything feels very fractious.\u201d</p> <p>The unravelling of consensus began with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/24/boris-johnsons-covid-19-address-is-one-of-most-watched-tv-programmes-ever\">Johnson\u2019s televised address</a> to more than 27m viewers from Downing Street, in which he announced a number of minor relaxations of lockdown rules and dropped his government\u2019s \u201cstay at home\u201d message in favour of a new slogan \u2013 \u201cstay alert\u201d. People in the UK would, he said, be allowed to travel more freely, go outside for unlimited amounts of exercise, play tennis and golf, and meet someone outside from another household so long as they stayed two metres apart. </p> <p>Those in charge in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were both dismayed that Johnson had abandoned the \u201cstay at home\u201d slogan and furious at the lack of consultation. \u201cThere has been dialogue and it has always been in a convivial atmosphere,\u201d said the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford. \u201cBut the problem is that this has been after decisions have been taken. It seemed on Sunday night as if Johnson thought he was announcing policy for the whole United Kingdom.\u201d</p> <p> If that was the case, the prime minister knows better now. The devolved administrations have flatly rejected Johnson\u2019s strategy and warned that they will continue with the \u2018stay at home\u2019 guidelines. Ahead of what is expected to be a spell of good weather over the next few days, Adam Price, the leader of Plaid Cymru \u2013 a party whose raison d\u2019etre is Welsh independence \u2013 warned that English people would be pulled up by the police if they ventured into his country to visit beauty spots such as Snowdonia.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s not beat about the bush,\u201d Price said. \u201cIf you drove into Wales from England at the moment without a legitimate excuse you would get arrested. Many people would not have thought that it was even possible but it is the reality on the ground.\u201d </p> <p>Snowdonia national park\u2019s chief executive, Emyr Williams, said wardens and the police would be working to enforce Welsh rules. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 15 wardens patrolling. We have also got North Wales police patrolling. They have issued 70 fines so far and they have turned away many more before they even reach the park.\u201d</p> <p>The first minister of Scotland and leader of the SNP, Nicola Sturgeon, also spoke of repelling the English if they tried to cross the border to her country without good reason. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/10/sturgeon-reveals-irritation-over-uk-lockdown-messaging\">Appearing against a \u201c</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/10/sturgeon-reveals-irritation-over-uk-lockdown-messaging\">stay at </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/10/sturgeon-reveals-irritation-over-uk-lockdown-messaging\">home\u201d backdrop</a>, Sturgeon said: \u201cIf you are coming into Scotland for reasons that are not covered by those essential purposes then you potentially would be in breach of the law.\u201d</p> <p> </p> <p>As disunity and confusion reign, the government\u2019s poll ratings have nosedived. Since last weekend, approval ratings for Johnson\u2019s government\u2019s handling of Covid-19 have dropped by nine percentage points. For the first time since Opinium began polling on Covid-19 for the <em>Observer</em>, more people disapprove of the government\u2019s handling of the crisis than approve.

      "bodyText": "Only a few weeks ago Boris Johnson was invoking the spirit of Winston Churchill when he called on the nation to unite in the fight against the coronavirus. As he took the momentous decision to order the closure of pubs, restaurants and many shops on 23 March, much of the United Kingdom seemed ready to respond and rally round the flag at a time of crisis. Similar lockdowns were ordered in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Rival political leaders offered to abandon hostilities and seek consensus. There was talk of forming a government of national unity. Johnson\u2019s ratings soared in the polls as voters heard the call to join a great collective effort. \u201cWe will get through this together,\u201d he told the country. That was then. Last week the short-lived unity fractured, and trust in the government in London started to haemorrhage away. Political leaders in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast began to resist and go their own ways in the fight against Covid-19. In England, open dissent started to break out in the regions. This weekend some council leaders in England have vowed to defy the government at Westminster by refusing to re-open schools on 1 June, as Johnson wants, because of fears for their pupils\u2019 and teachers\u2019 safety. The R rate (of the virus\u2019s reproduction) is too high and the move too risky, they say, echoing the views of worried teaching unions. Yesterday Hartlepool council issued a statement: \u201cGiven that coronavirus cases locally continue to rise, Hartlepool borough council has been working with schools and we have agreed they will not reopen on Monday 1 June. Whilst we recognise the importance of schools reopening, we want to be absolutely clear that we will be taking a measured and cautious approach to this.\u201d The worry in northern parts of the country where the R rate is rising is that there could be a surge in cases that would then spread nationally. As Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester writes in this newspaper today, reflecting on the past week: \u201cLife has changed and, suddenly, everything feels very fractious.\u201d The unravelling of consensus began with Johnson\u2019s televised address to more than 27m viewers from Downing Street, in which he announced a number of minor relaxations of lockdown rules and dropped his government\u2019s \u201cstay at home\u201d message in favour of a new slogan \u2013 \u201cstay alert\u201d. People in the UK would, he said, be allowed to travel more freely, go outside for unlimited amounts of exercise, play tennis and golf, and meet someone outside from another household so long as they stayed two metres apart. Those in charge in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were both dismayed that Johnson had abandoned the \u201cstay at home\u201d slogan and furious at the lack of consultation. \u201cThere has been dialogue and it has always been in a convivial atmosphere,\u201d said the SNP\u2019s leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford. \u201cBut the problem is that this has been after decisions have been taken. It seemed on Sunday night as if Johnson thought he was announcing policy for the whole United Kingdom.\u201d If that was the case, the prime minister knows better now. The devolved administrations have flatly rejected Johnson\u2019s strategy and warned that they will continue with the \u2018stay at home\u2019 guidelines. Ahead of what is expected to be a spell of good weather over the next few days, Adam Price, the leader of Plaid Cymru \u2013 a party whose raison d\u2019etre is Welsh independence \u2013 warned that English people would be pulled up by the police if they ventured into his country to visit beauty spots such as Snowdonia. \u201cLet\u2019s not beat about the bush,\u201d Price said. \u201cIf you drove into Wales from England at the moment without a legitimate excuse you would get arrested. Many people would not have thought that it was even possible but it is the reality on the ground.\u201d Snowdonia national park\u2019s chief executive, Emyr Williams, said wardens and the police would be working to enforce Welsh rules. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 15 wardens patrolling. We have also got North Wales police patrolling. They have issued 70 fines so far and they have turned away many more before they even reach the park.\u201d The first minister of Scotland and leader of the SNP, Nicola Sturgeon, also spoke of repelling the English if they tried to cross the border to her country without good reason. Appearing against a \u201cstay at home\u201d backdrop, Sturgeon said: \u201cIf you are coming into Scotland for reasons that are not covered by those essential purposes then you potentially would be in breach of the law.\u201d As disunity and confusion reign, the government\u2019s poll ratings have nosedived. Since last weekend, approval ratings for Johnson\u2019s government\u2019s handling of Covid-19 have dropped by nine percentage points. For the first time since Opinium began polling on Covid-19 for the Observer, more people disapprove of the government\u2019s handling of the crisis than approve. In late March the government had a net approval rating of plus 42. Now it is -3. Prof Robert Ford of Manchester University says that whereas entering the lockdown seemed momentous, it was in fact easier, and less politically divisive, than extricating ourselves from it is proving to be. \u201cWe went into the lockdown with a sense of national unity, but now it looks like we will be coming out of it with sharper political arguments than ever,\u201d he says. As the past week has made clear, the crucial battles \u2013 for power, money and control as lockdown is eased \u2013 will now be fought between London, the devolved administrations and England\u2019s regions and local councils. The argument for a more decentralised Britain has been unleashed in earnest by Covid-19. Prof Tony Travers, an expert in local government at the London School of Economics, says the UK\u2019s highly centralised system of government, and its NHS, do not respond well to crises and challenges that require flexible, fast and effective local responses. \u201cIt does appear that some smaller countries and federally structured nations like Germany seem to have been more flexible than the somewhat monolithic approach in Britain. But, Travers added, a UK version would have to also involve properly funding local government, whose financial resources had been cut by over 40% since 2010. The cuts had also severely impeded their ability to respond to the current crisis. For a Tory party traditionally committed to low taxes, which has relentlessly squeezed public services and local authorities in the past, giving the regions their head is an ideological challenge. But a second, even more severe, bout of austerity to pay the Covid-19 bill will not satisfy the many new Conservative MPs in the Midlands and North who won Johnson his majority at the election in December. They will also be aware that, for Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour party, championing the regions may offer a way to re-connect with traditional areas of support that abandoned the party in the general election. Former home secretary Amber Rudd said she expected a \u201cbig debate\u201d on the way forward and Johnson to address some of the challenges in a big, defining speech, imminently. The former cabinet minister Damian Green, chairman of the 100-strong One Nation caucus of Tory MPs, said his party had to learn the lessons of Covid-19 and respond in the light of the strains it had created. He said: \u201cThe time is right for one nation Conservative policies of supporting public services to help the disadvantaged and spreading power out from the centre to local people.\u201d Ford agreed that a big Tory battle was in prospect, asking: \u201cWill home counties fiscal conservatives be willing to swallow more taxes, more government, more freedom for local councils? For much of the past three years our politics has been driven by a civil war within the Tory party. This may end up being true again, but this time the war will be fought on a different front. It will be a fiscal civil war instead of a Europe civil war.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>\u2018There are,\u201d said a former top Treasury official last week, \u201csome strange people in this cabinet with strange ideas.\u201d The speaker was Lord Macpherson, the former Treasury permanent secretary, who during his time at the department now run by Chancellor Sunak had the unrivalled experience of serving Ken Clarke, Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling and George Osborne. Both Macpherson and Osborne <a href=\"https://thestrandgroup.kcl.ac.uk/event/transatlantic-trade-and-economic-cooperation-through-the-pandemic/\" title=\"\">were on a \u201cwebinar\u201d</a> \u2013 yes, a word that is new to me too \u2013 hosted by the Strand Group of King\u2019s College London to discuss a report co-authored by a former shadow chancellor, Ed Balls.</p> <p>Balls is still actively involved in the economic debate, and it was in his capacity as a visiting fellow at Harvard that he was presenting a report on the prospects for a US/UK trade deal. Well, to put it mildly, the Harvard team found precious little for the UK to gain from such a deal. Even if something can, as it were, be trumped up, it would hardly be worth the cellphone from which it would no doubt be tweeted.</p> <p>Correspondingly, there is quite a lot to lose from the no-deal Brexit that the cabinet seems fixated on. That strange trade secretary with strange ideas, Liz Truss, proclaims that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/04/uk-government-begins-transatlantic-trade-talks-with-washington\" title=\"\">increased overseas trade</a> is essential to overcome the economic hit from coronavirus. But the report concludes that there would be a mere \u00a33.4bn gain from a US deal, compared with a \u00a3112bn loss from departure from the EU. At present we do 43% of our trade with what I can still call the rest of the EU, and 15% with the US. All serious authorities on this subject, including the great Paul Krugman \u2013 who won his Nobel prize for research on trade \u2013 insist that geographical proximity to markets is the most important factor.</p> <p>Now, I hope, on his performance thus far, that Sunak will prove to be an exception to the Macpherson rule about this cabinet. His massive furlough scheme was, and continues to be, necessary; but, alas, not sufficient. There are going to be millions of victims of the huge rise in unemployment and potential bankruptcies the economy is experiencing, and God knows how much permanent damage. I have a feeling that because we are all so absorbed with the lockdown and the death toll, the full extent of the economic crisis has not yet been appreciated.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Starmer has been saying that Brexit cannot be reversed. I comfort myself with the hope that he is being cautious and playing politics</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I wrote my last book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/09/william-keegan-nine-british-financial-crises-since-1967\" title=\"\"><em>Nine Crises</em></a>, I had no idea of what was yet to come. This depression is gigantic, and only in its beginning. There is a limit to which one can derive solace from the debate about whether there will shortly be a V-shaped or a U-shaped recovery. As Llewellyn Consulting has pointed out, many analysts are so obsessed with growth rates in supposed \u201crecoveries\u201d when what matters are the levels of output. Thus output in the UK \u2013 gross domestic product \u2013 had only just got back to pre-banking-crisis levels shortly before coronavirus hit town, and had not even reached that level in Italy. Recoveries from recessions take a very long time; <em>a fortiori</em> when it comes to Depressions.</p> <p>So the cabinet wants to press on with the real Brexit, apparently in the hope that the undoubted short-term damage it will do will be lost in the smokescreen of the virus. Have they not noticed that four-fifths of our imported food comes from the rest of the EU? The panic about food shortages when the virus struck was mercifully short-lived. Why? Because, even now, we are an integral region of the biggest trading group in the world. Just imagine the chaos next January if these strange people are allowed to get away with their strange ideas.</p> <p>Now, there is, I think, growing support for the idea that there should be a Brexit extension of up to two years in order to effect a reasonable UK/EU trade agreement. But so far, Keir Starmer \u2013 while having impressed many of us, including senior Tories, that he has the makings of a formidable leader of the opposition \u2013 has been saying that Brexit cannot be reversed and the government has got to get a deal within its chosen timetable.</p> <p>I comfort myself with the hope that he is being cautious and playing politics. My related hope is that even the strange people with strange ideas are going to recognise reality later in the year. In which context, the Irish foreign minister seems to have <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/savvy-diplomacy-needed-to-achieve-brexit-talks-extension-coveney-1.4247920\" title=\"\">given sage advice to the rest of the EU</a>, in suggesting that they should effect a way of letting No 10 off the hook by making it feasible for a two-year delay without allowing it to look like a humiliation.</p> <p>Finally, since Johnson\u2019s adviser Dominic Cummings thinks he knows everything, I recommend that he re-read Bertrand Russell\u2019s short 1946 lecture Philosophy And Politics, in which he says: \u201cSince, broadly speaking, the distant consequences of actions are more uncertain than the immediate consequences, it is seldom justifiable to embark on any policy on the ground that, though harmful in the present, it will be beneficial in the long run.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018There are,\u201d said a former top Treasury official last week, \u201csome strange people in this cabinet with strange ideas.\u201d The speaker was Lord Macpherson, the former Treasury permanent secretary, who during his time at the department now run by Chancellor Sunak had the unrivalled experience of serving Ken Clarke, Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling and George Osborne. Both Macpherson and Osborne were on a \u201cwebinar\u201d \u2013 yes, a word that is new to me too \u2013 hosted by the Strand Group of King\u2019s College London to discuss a report co-authored by a former shadow chancellor, Ed Balls. Balls is still actively involved in the economic debate, and it was in his capacity as a visiting fellow at Harvard that he was presenting a report on the prospects for a US/UK trade deal. Well, to put it mildly, the Harvard team found precious little for the UK to gain from such a deal. Even if something can, as it were, be trumped up, it would hardly be worth the cellphone from which it would no doubt be tweeted. Correspondingly, there is quite a lot to lose from the no-deal Brexit that the cabinet seems fixated on. That strange trade secretary with strange ideas, Liz Truss, proclaims that increased overseas trade is essential to overcome the economic hit from coronavirus. But the report concludes that there would be a mere \u00a33.4bn gain from a US deal, compared with a \u00a3112bn loss from departure from the EU. At present we do 43% of our trade with what I can still call the rest of the EU, and 15% with the US. All serious authorities on this subject, including the great Paul Krugman \u2013 who won his Nobel prize for research on trade \u2013 insist that geographical proximity to markets is the most important factor. Now, I hope, on his performance thus far, that Sunak will prove to be an exception to the Macpherson rule about this cabinet. His massive furlough scheme was, and continues to be, necessary; but, alas, not sufficient. There are going to be millions of victims of the huge rise in unemployment and potential bankruptcies the economy is experiencing, and God knows how much permanent damage. I have a feeling that because we are all so absorbed with the lockdown and the death toll, the full extent of the economic crisis has not yet been appreciated. When I wrote my last book, Nine Crises, I had no idea of what was yet to come. This depression is gigantic, and only in its beginning. There is a limit to which one can derive solace from the debate about whether there will shortly be a V-shaped or a U-shaped recovery. As Llewellyn Consulting has pointed out, many analysts are so obsessed with growth rates in supposed \u201crecoveries\u201d when what matters are the levels of output. Thus output in the UK \u2013 gross domestic product \u2013 had only just got back to pre-banking-crisis levels shortly before coronavirus hit town, and had not even reached that level in Italy. Recoveries from recessions take a very long time; a fortiori when it comes to Depressions. So the cabinet wants to press on with the real Brexit, apparently in the hope that the undoubted short-term damage it will do will be lost in the smokescreen of the virus. Have they not noticed that four-fifths of our imported food comes from the rest of the EU? The panic about food shortages when the virus struck was mercifully short-lived. Why? Because, even now, we are an integral region of the biggest trading group in the world. Just imagine the chaos next January if these strange people are allowed to get away with their strange ideas. Now, there is, I think, growing support for the idea that there should be a Brexit extension of up to two years in order to effect a reasonable UK/EU trade agreement. But so far, Keir Starmer \u2013 while having impressed many of us, including senior Tories, that he has the makings of a formidable leader of the opposition \u2013 has been saying that Brexit cannot be reversed and the government has got to get a deal within its chosen timetable. I comfort myself with the hope that he is being cautious and playing politics. My related hope is that even the strange people with strange ideas are going to recognise reality later in the year. In which context, the Irish foreign minister seems to have given sage advice to the rest of the EU, in suggesting that they should effect a way of letting No 10 off the hook by making it feasible for a two-year delay without allowing it to look like a humiliation. Finally, since Johnson\u2019s adviser Dominic Cummings thinks he knows everything, I recommend that he re-read Bertrand Russell\u2019s short 1946 lecture Philosophy And Politics, in which he says: \u201cSince, broadly speaking, the distant consequences of actions are more uncertain than the immediate consequences, it is seldom justifiable to embark on any policy on the ground that, though harmful in the present, it will be beneficial in the long run.\u201d",

There was no way, surely, that Boris Johnson was going to wake up and find himself transformed, as in a horror film, into Boris Johnson.</p> <p> A few signs <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/ten-zen-questions/202005/covid-19-near-death-experiences-and-boris-johnson\">suggested </a>that the prime minister might, like near-death cases cited by the psychologist, Susan Blackmore, really emerge with changed priorities, with something at least resembling empathy. In his first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/12/boris-johnson-leaves-hospital-as-he-continues-recovery-from-coronavirus\">bulletin</a>, Johnson did appear, if not exactly the recovered Beethoven, then a bit more, some thought, like Coleridge\u2019s traumatised Wedding Guest, \u201ca sadder and a wiser man/ he rose the morrow morn\u201d.</p> <p>In a video he said the NHS was \u201cpowered by love\u201d. One reviewer thought this resurrection message the finest speech he\u2019d delivered: \u201cThe glibness and bluster had been replaced by a hard-earned sincerity.\u201d It was in his next speech that a recovering Johnson alluded to \u201cour apparent success\u201d, to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/27/muggers-and-invisible-enemies-how-boris-johnsons-metaphors-reveals-his-thinking\">an unexpected and invisible mugger</a>\u201d that, following his mighty example, we will \u201cwrestle to the floor\u201d.</p> <p>After pausing to add another child to his collection, Johnson could still convince a <em>Sun</em> <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11535369/boris-johnson-on-fight-against-coronavirus/\">interviewer </a>that he\u2019d become a different, \u201cmuch more complex figure\u201d. The face of the new Boris \u2013 \u201cBoris 2.0\u201d \u2013 betrayed, the paper\u2019s David Wooding said, \u201ca mixture of terror, exhaustion and joy. But most of all relief\u201d.</p> <p>Or was it indigestion? Supposing his hard-won improvements did happen, they had, by the time new improved Johnson recorded his \u201cstay alert\u201d address, and related routines, vanished \u2013 perhaps into the same black hole containing the daily briefing\u2019s international death comparisons.</p> <p>True, whether it\u2019s the result of some infernal deathbed bargain or emulation of Mao\u2019s <a href=\"http://100photos.time.com/photos/charman-mao-swims-yangtze\">swim in the Yangtze</a>, he has a new morning routine, processing around St James\u2019s Park with a coffee cup. But if the reborn Johnson no longer attempts virus gags like \u201csquashing the sombrero\u201d, his post-recovery sensitivity still allows him a regular reminder that is possibly more insulting to many thousands of bereaved people, and more revealing of his unmodified emotional illiteracy: that this could have been a proper, bona fide catastrophe. Imagine, goes this Villanelle-style reasoning, if he\u2019d done nothing. We\u2019re actually lucky so many of us are still alive!</p> <p>Perhaps buoyed by this happy thought, Johnson dumped, at last week\u2019s briefing, the expression of sympathy that conventionally separates the latest death toll from chart-strewn attempts to detach ministers from any conceivable responsibility.</p> <p>On his current form, then, it is hard to argue with the actress Miriam Margolyes\u2019 diagnosis, that when Johnson recovered, \u201che didn\u2019t get better as a human being\u201d. That her prefatory remark \u2013 she\u2019d managed to suppress a wish for him to die \u2013 provoked countless complaints, confirmed that the public likes to see, at least from her sex, a performance of compassion. Which in turn underlines Johnson\u2019s achievement in normalising a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/12/boris-johnson-accused-of-outrageous-lack-of-concern-about-floods\">long-evident empathy deficit</a>.</p> <p>He may have benefited, given his proud history of not giving a toss, from the scholarly backlash against depictions of empathy as a critical human quality. In <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/06/against-empathy-paul-bloom-the-empathy-instinct-peter-bazalgette-review\">Against </a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/06/against-empathy-paul-bloom-the-empathy-instinct-peter-bazalgette-review\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/06/against-empathy-paul-bloom-the-empathy-instinct-peter-bazalgette-review\">Empathy: The Case for Rational Compassion</a></em>, Paul Bloom argued that over-identification with other people\u2019s suffering could actually impair judgment. But it\u2019s notable that Johnson\u2019s predecessor was not forgiven \u2013 like Thatcher \u2013 an early diagnosis of coldness. As with so many of the prime minister\u2019s qualities, from greed to idleness, that would be impermissible in Doris Johnson \u2013 as I like to think of his female doppelg\u00e4nger \u2013 an empathy deficit was, in Theresa May, to be virtually her <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/knock-knock-who-was-that-prime-minister-g66x5xsbx\">epitaph</a>. \u201cThe same tests,\u201d she has mildly <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/15/theresa-may-says-women-either-seen-weak-robotic/\">pointed out</a>, \u201care not applied to men.\u201d What makes Luke Jennings\u2019 Villanelle extraordinary is not so much absence of empathy \u2013 Patricia Highsmith\u2019s Ripley went there a while back \u2013 but its absence in a woman.</p> <p>After May\u2019s historic difficulties at Grenfell, nobody protested, as they might reasonably have done, that an inadequately empathetic politician might have compensatory qualities including, say, decency, fairness, honesty, diligence, respect, an ability to compromise. But what if, even as a male leader, you possess none of those qualities either? Then empathy might be a saving grace.</p> <p>If Johnson\u2019s post-Brexit hubris, idiot exceptionalism, economic priorities and habitual negligence help account, as has been suggested, for his ignoring warnings and delaying action on the pandemic, his stunted awareness of others may have contributed to this initial inclination to do sod all to help them, and a subsequent struggle to communicate. Even as he <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-address-to-the-nation-on-coronavirus-23-march-2020\">explained </a>the lockdown on 23 March, it was beyond him, or his aides, to convey anything resembling togetherness. Johnson: \u201cThe way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost.\u201d</p> <p>Compare <a href=\"https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/angelamerkelcoronavirusaddresstonation.htm\">Angela Merkel</a>: \u201cThese are not just abstract numbers in statistics, but this is about a father or grandfather, a mother or grandmother, a partner \u2013 this is about people. And we are a community in which each life and each person counts.\u201d</p> <p>Had members of his inner circle not been selected, not just for dumb allegiance but their proven indifference to lived consequences, as applied to Brexit, they might have challenged \u201ctake it on the chin\u201d, remembered care homes, or anticipated the possibility that some people might not respond to Johnson\u2019s instructions to shop online, commute by car, retrieve their nannies pronto. Instead, presumably guided by Dominic Cummings (whose <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-ten-days-that-shook-britain-and-changed-the-nation-for-ever-spz6sc9vb\">reported</a> \u201cif that means some pensioners die, too bad\u201d has yet to be withdrawn by the <em>Sunday Times</em>), this struggling pathocracy <a href=\"https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/boris-johnson-explains-uks-core-17981539\">recited lines </a>it was assured sounded human: \u201cThe government is putting its arms around every single worker.\u201d</p> <p>In the Commons, Johnson does not just collapse intellectually under Keir Starmer\u2019s interrogations, he reveals, blustering back, the emotional void that accompanies his incompetence. Has anyone ever paid so many magnificent tributes to the British people, their grit and guts, fortitude and sacrifice, while caring so little about them?</p> <p>\u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist</p>",

A few signs suggested that the prime minister might, like near-death cases cited by the psychologist, Susan Blackmore, really emerge with changed priorities, with something at least resembling empathy. In his first bulletin, Johnson did appear, if not exactly the recovered Beethoven, then a bit more, some thought, like Coleridge\u2019s traumatised Wedding Guest, \u201ca sadder and a wiser man/ he rose the morrow morn\u201d. In a video he said the NHS was \u201cpowered by love\u201d. One reviewer thought this resurrection message the finest speech he\u2019d delivered: \u201cThe glibness and bluster had been replaced by a hard-earned sincerity.\u201d It was in his next speech that a recovering Johnson alluded to \u201cour apparent success\u201d, to \u201can unexpected and invisible mugger\u201d that, following his mighty example, we will \u201cwrestle to the floor\u201d. After pausing to add another child to his collection, Johnson could still convince a Sun interviewer that he\u2019d become a different, \u201cmuch more complex figure\u201d. The face of the new Boris \u2013 \u201cBoris 2.0\u201d \u2013 betrayed, the paper\u2019s David Wooding said, \u201ca mixture of terror, exhaustion and joy. But most of all relief\u201d. Or was it indigestion? Supposing his hard-won improvements did happen, they had, by the time new improved Johnson recorded his \u201cstay alert\u201d address, and related routines, vanished \u2013 perhaps into the same black hole containing the daily briefing\u2019s international death comparisons. True, whether it\u2019s the result of some infernal deathbed bargain or emulation of Mao\u2019s swim in the Yangtze, he has a new morning routine, processing around St James\u2019s Park with a coffee cup. But if the reborn Johnson no longer attempts virus gags like \u201csquashing the sombrero\u201d, his post-recovery sensitivity still allows him a regular reminder that is possibly more insulting to many thousands of bereaved people, and more revealing of his unmodified emotional illiteracy: that this could have been a proper, bona fide catastrophe. Imagine, goes this Villanelle-style reasoning, if he\u2019d done nothing. We\u2019re actually lucky so many of us are still alive! Perhaps buoyed by this happy thought, Johnson dumped, at last week\u2019s briefing, the expression of sympathy that conventionally separates the latest death toll from chart-strewn attempts to detach ministers from any conceivable responsibility. On his current form, then, it is hard to argue with the actress Miriam Margolyes\u2019 diagnosis, that when Johnson recovered, \u201che didn\u2019t get better as a human being\u201d. That her prefatory remark \u2013 she\u2019d managed to suppress a wish for him to die \u2013 provoked countless complaints, confirmed that the public likes to see, at least from her sex, a performance of compassion. Which in turn underlines Johnson\u2019s achievement in normalising a long-evident empathy deficit. He may have benefited, given his proud history of not giving a toss, from the scholarly backlash against depictions of empathy as a critical human quality. In Against Empathy: The Case for Rational Compassion, Paul Bloom argued that over-identification with other people\u2019s suffering could actually impair judgment. But it\u2019s notable that Johnson\u2019s predecessor was not forgiven \u2013 like Thatcher \u2013 an early diagnosis of coldness. As with so many of the prime minister\u2019s qualities, from greed to idleness, that would be impermissible in Doris Johnson \u2013 as I like to think of his female doppelg\u00e4nger \u2013 an empathy deficit was, in Theresa May, to be virtually her epitaph. \u201cThe same tests,\u201d she has mildly pointed out, \u201care not applied to men.\u201d What makes Luke Jennings\u2019 Villanelle extraordinary is not so much absence of empathy \u2013 Patricia Highsmith\u2019s Ripley went there a while back \u2013 but its absence in a woman. After May\u2019s historic difficulties at Grenfell, nobody protested, as they might reasonably have done, that an inadequately empathetic politician might have compensatory qualities including, say, decency, fairness, honesty, diligence, respect, an ability to compromise. But what if, even as a male leader, you possess none of those qualities either? Then empathy might be a saving grace. If Johnson\u2019s post-Brexit hubris, idiot exceptionalism, economic priorities and habitual negligence help account, as has been suggested, for his ignoring warnings and delaying action on the pandemic, his stunted awareness of others may have contributed to this initial inclination to do sod all to help them, and a subsequent struggle to communicate. Even as he explained the lockdown on 23 March, it was beyond him, or his aides, to convey anything resembling togetherness. Johnson: \u201cThe way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost.\u201d Compare Angela Merkel: \u201cThese are not just abstract numbers in statistics, but this is about a father or grandfather, a mother or grandmother, a partner \u2013 this is about people. And we are a community in which each life and each person counts.\u201d Had members of his inner circle not been selected, not just for dumb allegiance but their proven indifference to lived consequences, as applied to Brexit, they might have challenged \u201ctake it on the chin\u201d, remembered care homes, or anticipated the possibility that some people might not respond to Johnson\u2019s instructions to shop online, commute by car, retrieve their nannies pronto. Instead, presumably guided by Dominic Cummings (whose reported \u201cif that means some pensioners die, too bad\u201d has yet to be withdrawn by the Sunday Times), this struggling pathocracy recited lines it was assured sounded human: \u201cThe government is putting its arms around every single worker.\u201d In the Commons, Johnson does not just collapse intellectually under Keir Starmer\u2019s interrogations, he reveals, blustering back, the emotional void that accompanies his incompetence. Has anyone ever paid so many magnificent tributes to the British people, their grit and guts, fortitude and sacrifice, while caring so little about them? \u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist",

The Conservative government\u2019s \u201ctriple tax lock\u201d promise not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT, made before the election, would need to be ditched, along with its promise to protect the state pension.</p> <p>There is another option though, one that George Osborne considered far too risky 10 years ago. That it is to live with a high level of government debt and focus on expanding the economy.</p> <p>Thankfully, we have a chancellor who has suggested he would prefer enlarging the economy as the primary means of cutting the deficit.</p> <p>Without hesitation, Sunak publicly rejected a return to austerity, telling parliament that the government\u2019s \u201clevelling-up\u201d agenda would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-uk-live-news-lockdown-extended-peak-dominic-raab-boris-johnson-latest-updates\" title=\"\">take priority</a>. \u201cIndeed I believe this can still be a critical part of how we get back to normal,\u201d he said.</p> <p>This will not be an easy task. In the short term, the government has to find a way to restart the economy without sparking a return of the disease. Then it must begin the task of identifying how public investment can support the industries that can accelerate quickly out of the crisis, and not just those that are in need of rescuing.</p> <p>There will be many challenges, not least from a health and social care crisis that is likely to persist, even as both sectors attempt to get back to normal.</p> <p>A levelling-up agenda that favours the regions and nations of the UK beyond London and south-east will take time, and will also need to focus on green growth so that the cuts in carbon emissions seen over the past few months are not thrown away.</p> <p>One advantage the chancellor has over his predecessors is a consensus among economists of all persuasions that this time is different and the level of debt he finds himself with next year will be irrelevant.</p> <p>Even the architects of post-2008 austerity agree that almost-zero borrowing costs and low inflation give the Treasury an opportunity to use the instruments of the state to drive growth while large parts of the private sector are fighting to recover. In the battle against coronavirus and its consequences, austerity must be off the table.</p> <h2>Kenya\u2019s Amina Mohamed could be the leader the WTO needs</h2> <p>The World Trade Organization ranks alongside the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations and the World Bank as one of the pillars of the global multilateral system. Running it is one of the international community\u2019s plum jobs. And among its toughest.</p> <p>That job is now vacant because Roberto Azev\u00eado is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/roberto-azevedo-quits-as-wto-world-trade-organization-chief-a-year-early\" title=\"\">stepping down early</a> as director general \u2013 and few will blame him. Trying to achieve consensus among the WTO\u2019s 164 members is a thankless task and even at the best of times as difficult as herding cats. These are not the best of times. The weapon of choice in the new cold war between the US and China is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/01/us-and-china-begin-imposing-new-tariffs-as-trade-war-escalates\" title=\"\">the tariff</a>. Protectionist pressures abound. Donald Trump has neutered the WTO by refusing to allow the appointment of new judges to its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/11/uk-post-brexit-trade-at-risk-as-wto-top-court-shuts-down\" title=\"\">appeals body</a>.</p> <p>The person lucky \u2013 or unlucky \u2013 enough to get the job will need a thick skin, the highest diplomatic skills and a personality that commands respect. What\u2019s more, the successful candidate has to be from a limited group of countries.</p> <p>There is no chance of Trump agreeing to the appointment of a Chinese candidate, nor would president Xi Jinping allow an American to get the gig. Neither Washington nor Beijing would agree to either of the two Europeans whose names are being mentioned: Spanish foreign minister Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez Laya or former EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m. A Latin American is ruled out because Azev\u00eado is Brazilian.</p> <p>The view in Geneva is that it is time a woman ran the WTO, and the one to watch is Amina Mohamed, currently Kenya\u2019s sports minister, but formerly the country\u2019s much-respected ambassador to the WTO. If the rest of the continent gets behind her she has a chance of becoming the first African to run the WTO. She would be a good choice.</p> <h2>Dark theatres herald dark days for TV, as talent pipeline dries up</h2> <p>If Netflix and its peers are winners in the coronavirus disaster, it will not compensate for the wider disaster culture in general will suffer. Figures published last week showed that, since the lockdown, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/15/streaming-services-uk-netflix-amazon-prime-video-disney-subscribers-coronavirus\" title=\"\">4.6 million British households</a> have signed up to streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video or Disney+.</p> <p>At the same time, one of the UK\u2019s most prestigious theatres, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/13/old-vic-theatre-perilous-matthew-warchus\" title=\"\">Old Vic, warned last week that it was in a \u201cseriously perilous\u201d financial situation</a> owing to the pandemic.</p> <p>Netflix and the Old Vic are not competitors. If a household puts \u00a38.99 a month into the world\u2019s most popular streaming service, that money has not been taken out of the theatre world\u2019s pocket.</p> <p>However, the cultural ecosystem that Netflix, Amazon and Disney all rely upon will be diminished if the Old Vic and countless other theatres are to disappear.</p> <p>In 2018 the Old Vic staged the world premiere of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/03/mood-music-review-joe-penhall-songwriting-pop-industry\" title=\"\">Joe Penhall\u2019s play <em>Mood Music</em></a>. Penhall, a highly successful British playwright, recently wrote <em>Mindhunter</em> for Netflix. In 2019 the Old Vic staged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/oct/20/lungs-review-old-vic-london-claire-foy-and-matt-smith-shine-in-climate-crisis-drama\" title=\"\"><em>Lungs</em>, starring Claire Foy and Matt Smith</a> from <em>The Crown</em>, a major Netflix hit. In the food chain of talent and ideas, the stage plays a crucial role in nurturing writing, acting, directing and technical talent.</p> <p>Just as broadcasters and cinemas are realising that a global production shutdown is going to mean empty schedules in the near future, an existential disaster for theatre will, ultimately, deal a blow to the originality and excellence that is a major part of the appeal of streaming services, as well as the supply of talent into the worlds of TV and film.</p> <p>So the Old Vic last week became another thread pulled by the disease, which could unravel all the way to the apogee of modern broadcasting.</p> <p>Cultural loss can be difficult to quantify \u2013 the album that was never recorded, the online magazine that was never launched, the exhibition that never opened \u2013 but the threat to one of the arts\u2019 cornerstones is real: and it is immeasurable.</p>",

Money to support businesses that have closed down make up the lion\u2019s share, and the rest can be accounted for by increased welfare costs and the loss of billions of pounds to the exchequer in taxes that will never be paid. The total debt pile, which has already hit 83% of GDP, or more than \u00a32 trillion, will probably reach around 115% of national income (GDP) by next year. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis this level of debt was associated with profligate governments that had spent well beyond their means on white elephant infrastructure projects and wasteful subsidies. These were government debt levels to be avoided rather than emulated. Italy saw its debts increase beyond 130% of GDP, and Greece suffered a sudden increase in sovereign debts to 183% of GDP. Now, the panic is much closer to home. A Treasury memo leaked last week showed that there is concern in some quarters at the escalating costs of fighting the coronavirus. The alarm raised by the document\u2019s anonymous authors was that, far from being a one-off financial hit, the coronavirus pandemic will cause the economy lasting harm and the debts built up during the crisis will, at least to some extent, recur in subsequent years. Taking this argument a step further, the authors reverted to a Treasury mindset \u2013 one dating back hundreds of years that stresses the need for prudence and repeats the calls that followed 2008 for spending cuts and tax rises to begin the process of balancing the books. The memo argued that a public sector wage freeze could save about \u00a36.5bn by 2023-24. The Conservative government\u2019s \u201ctriple tax lock\u201d promise not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT, made before the election, would need to be ditched, along with its promise to protect the state pension. There is another option though, one that George Osborne considered far too risky 10 years ago. That it is to live with a high level of government debt and focus on expanding the economy. Thankfully, we have a chancellor who has suggested he would prefer enlarging the economy as the primary means of cutting the deficit. Without hesitation, Sunak publicly rejected a return to austerity, telling parliament that the government\u2019s \u201clevelling-up\u201d agenda would take priority. \u201cIndeed I believe this can still be a critical part of how we get back to normal,\u201d he said. This will not be an easy task. In the short term, the government has to find a way to restart the economy without sparking a return of the disease. Then it must begin the task of identifying how public investment can support the industries that can accelerate quickly out of the crisis, and not just those that are in need of rescuing. There will be many challenges, not least from a health and social care crisis that is likely to persist, even as both sectors attempt to get back to normal. A levelling-up agenda that favours the regions and nations of the UK beyond London and south-east will take time, and will also need to focus on green growth so that the cuts in carbon emissions seen over the past few months are not thrown away. One advantage the chancellor has over his predecessors is a consensus among economists of all persuasions that this time is different and the level of debt he finds himself with next year will be irrelevant. Even the architects of post-2008 austerity agree that almost-zero borrowing costs and low inflation give the Treasury an opportunity to use the instruments of the state to drive growth while large parts of the private sector are fighting to recover. In the battle against coronavirus and its consequences, austerity must be off the table. Kenya\u2019s Amina Mohamed could be the leader the WTO needs The World Trade Organization ranks alongside the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations and the World Bank as one of the pillars of the global multilateral system. Running it is one of the international community\u2019s plum jobs. And among its toughest. That job is now vacant because Roberto Azev\u00eado is stepping down early as director general \u2013 and few will blame him. Trying to achieve consensus among the WTO\u2019s 164 members is a thankless task and even at the best of times as difficult as herding cats. These are not the best of times. The weapon of choice in the new cold war between the US and China is the tariff. Protectionist pressures abound. Donald Trump has neutered the WTO by refusing to allow the appointment of new judges to its appeals body. The person lucky \u2013 or unlucky \u2013 enough to get the job will need a thick skin, the highest diplomatic skills and a personality that commands respect. What\u2019s more, the successful candidate has to be from a limited group of countries. There is no chance of Trump agreeing to the appointment of a Chinese candidate, nor would president Xi Jinping allow an American to get the gig. Neither Washington nor Beijing would agree to either of the two Europeans whose names are being mentioned: Spanish foreign minister Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez Laya or former EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m. A Latin American is ruled out because Azev\u00eado is Brazilian. The view in Geneva is that it is time a woman ran the WTO, and the one to watch is Amina Mohamed, currently Kenya\u2019s sports minister, but formerly the country\u2019s much-respected ambassador to the WTO. If the rest of the continent gets behind her she has a chance of becoming the first African to run the WTO. She would be a good choice. Dark theatres herald dark days for TV, as talent pipeline dries up If Netflix and its peers are winners in the coronavirus disaster, it will not compensate for the wider disaster culture in general will suffer. Figures published last week showed that, since the lockdown, 4.6 million British households have signed up to streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video or Disney+. At the same time, one of the UK\u2019s most prestigious theatres, the Old Vic, warned last week that it was in a \u201cseriously perilous\u201d financial situation owing to the pandemic. Netflix and the Old Vic are not competitors. If a household puts \u00a38.99 a month into the world\u2019s most popular streaming service, that money has not been taken out of the theatre world\u2019s pocket. However, the cultural ecosystem that Netflix, Amazon and Disney all rely upon will be diminished if the Old Vic and countless other theatres are to disappear. In 2018 the Old Vic staged the world premiere of Joe Penhall\u2019s play Mood Music. Penhall, a highly successful British playwright, recently wrote Mindhunter for Netflix. In 2019 the Old Vic staged Lungs, starring Claire Foy and Matt Smith from The Crown, a major Netflix hit. In the food chain of talent and ideas, the stage plays a crucial role in nurturing writing, acting, directing and technical talent. Just as broadcasters and cinemas are realising that a global production shutdown is going to mean empty schedules in the near future, an existential disaster for theatre will, ultimately, deal a blow to the originality and excellence that is a major part of the appeal of streaming services, as well as the supply of talent into the worlds of TV and film. So the Old Vic last week became another thread pulled by the disease, which could unravel all the way to the apogee of modern broadcasting. Cultural loss can be difficult to quantify \u2013 the album that was never recorded, the online magazine that was never launched, the exhibition that never opened \u2013 but the threat to one of the arts\u2019 cornerstones is real: and it is immeasurable.",

      "bodyText": "China\u2019s commercial hub of Shanghai announced the restart of classes for younger students amid falling virus cases, while New Orleans\u2019 famed restaurants have been allowed to reopen with a limited number of diners. China\u2019s airline regulator also reported numbers of flights had returned to 60% of pre-outbreak levels, exceeding 10,000 per day for the first time since 1 February. No new deaths have been reported in a month in the world\u2019s second-largest economy, where the coronavirus was first detected late last year. China reported just five new cases on Sunday, while South Korea recorded 13, raising hopes that a new outbreak linked to nightclubs in Seoul may be waning. In New Orleans, a city famous for its cuisine, restaurants will have to limit the number of reservations as officials cautiously ease more restrictions on eateries, shops and outdoor venues. Louisiana is among a number of US states trying to restart their economies without triggering a surge in new coronavirus infections. \u201cWe\u2019re going to trial run what it is to operate in the new normal,\u201d said Kirk Estopinal, one of the owners of Cane &amp; Table in the French Quarter. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at a restaurant experience that is almost touchless for our guests.\u201d Public health experts warn that the pandemic, which has killed more than 88,000 people in the US and 300,000 worldwide, could pick up again if precautions are not taken or people return to work too soon. Familiar ways of dining out or watching sporting events are gone for now. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said horse racing tracks and the Watkins Glen International auto track can reopen with \u201cno crowds, no fans.\u201d He also said he could envision a return of Major League Baseball in New York, the centre of the US outbreak, also without spectators. \u201cIf it works economically, that would be great,\u201d he said. Former president Barack Obama again criticised some US leaders overseeing the coronavirus response, telling college graduates online that the pandemic showed that many officials \u201caren\u2019t even pretending to be in charge\u201d. In California, more parks and hiking trails welcomed visitors again in a second phase of reopening, in which businesses deemed lower risk are allowed to operate with retailers offering kerbside pickup. Similar steps took place around the world as infections declined in many cities and countries. Germany\u2019s top soccer league resumed season play with what fans call \u201c ghost games,\u201d with no spectators in the stands and players warned to keep their emotions in check and desist from spitting, handshakes and hugging. In New Zealand, prime minister Jacinda Ardern and her fiance, Clarke Gayford, were initially turned away for brunch by a restaurant in the capital, Wellington, because it was too full under coronavirus guidelines. There was a happy ending: a spot freed up, and staff chased down the street to call the couple back. Italy\u2019s tourism industry is focused firmly on 3 June, when both regional and international borders reopen. Tourist-reliant Venice was hoping for boost in occupancy of the city\u2019s 50,000 hotel beds , which have been almost all vacant since the March lockdown began. In the country\u2019s financial capital of Milan, 3,400 restaurants planned to open Monday, along with 4,800 bars, 2,900 hairdressers, 2,200 clothing stores and 700 shoe shops. \u201cAfter a long period at home, we will all want to go out and have a good coffee in a bar, eat a pizza in a pizzeria, buy a pair of jeans or go to the hairdressers,\u201d Milan mayor Giuseppe Sala said in a Facebook video. Still, some protested that reopening rules were unclear and dozens protested outside Milan\u2019s main train station calling for an abolition of taxes and more help. France called for a coordinated European effort on opening, while still protecting the country from areas where the virus is still active. As hundreds of beaches reopened, interior minister Christophe Castaner warned that the government would not hesitate to close them again if regulations are not respected. Under the rules, beachgoers can take a dip but may not sunbathe or picnic. In England, officials and tourism boards discouraged people from visiting popular spots like beaches or parks on the first weekend since the lockdown was eased. Stricter rules remain place in other parts of the UK, and English day-trippers have been warned against crossing into Scotland or Wales. Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said he would ask parliament for what he hopes will be the last extension of a state of emergency to battle the pandemic, until around late June. Tourism, which accounts for 12% of GDP, looks set to lose its critical summer season. \u201cSpain needs tourism,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. \u201cBut tourism needs security. It needs health guarantees.\u201d In other developments: Brazil\u2019s confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus rose past those of Spain and Italy, making Brazil\u2019s outbreak the fourth largest in the world. Brazil\u2019s health ministry registered 14,919 new confirmed cases in the prior 24 hours, taking the total to 233,142, behind the US, Russia and the UK. Brazil has done just a fraction of the testing seen in those three countries. Victoria, Australia\u2019s second most-populous state, will reopen restaurants and pubs on June 1, but patrons will have to provide their name and phone number before they can enter. New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian, meanwhile, called for all Australian states to lift border restrictions. Victoria and NSW are the only states not to have closed their borders during the lockdown. Boris Johnson has been hit by a growing revolt over his strategy for easing the Covid-19 lockdown as council leaders across the north of England joined unions in vowing to resist plans to reopen schools on 1 June.",

But he wants to carry on being really, really strict.\u201d</p> <p>Her husband, she says, wants the whole family to stick to the old rules and stay at home while other people follow the new guidelines so he can see what happens to them. \u201cHe\u2019s never been one to push the rules \u2013 and until we get absolute clarity and the numbers of deaths start dropping, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to risk anything,\u201d she says.</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t know that Stanton has already arranged to meet her sister for a socially distanced walk around London in the sunshine \u2013 and she is not planning to tell him. \u201cI won\u2019t flag it up, if he doesn\u2019t ask. I\u2019ll just say I\u2019m going for a walk.\u201d</p> <p>She has also allowed their 13-year-old daughter<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/16/young-people-text-counselling-service-shout-lockdown\"> </a>to meet her best friend in a park last week. \u201cThey sat on the grass two metres apart.\u201d Afterwards, her daughter said she\u2019d had the best day of her life for eight weeks. \u201cBut I had to let her go out and not really tell my husband where she was going. He thought she was with me.\u201d</p> <p>The government\u2019s approach to lifting the lockdown is creating dilemmas like this for many families across the UK, experts have warned. \u201cI think what this government is doing is handing it over to us. So if it fails, guess whose fault it is in the end? It\u2019s our fault,\u201d says Cary Cooper, professor of organisational psychology and health at Manchester Business School.</p> <p>For example, people can refuse to return to work or send their children back to school if they believe it is unsafe. \u201cIt\u2019s quite clever politics.

While she thinks most teenagers will follow the rules, \u201cthere will always be a percentage that absolutely won\u2019t. And it was a lot more difficult for them to break the social distancing rules up until this point. Now it\u2019s not so difficult\u201d.</p> <p>As a result, she expects many parents will feel unable to trust teenagers to meet up with a friend or go outside by themselves at all, and this will cause arguments. \u201cWhile the guidelines were black and white \u2013 you\u2019re not going out, you can\u2019t meet up \u2013 that was your backup as a parent. You could say: that\u2019s just the law. That\u2019s the way it is. Whereas now it\u2019s not very clear cut.\u201d Some teens will be allowed to socialise and go to school; others won\u2019t be. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s really unhelpful, because it will cause conflict.\u201d</p> <p>In general, less risk-averse family members may feel it is unfair that a cleaner, nanny or estate agent is allowed to visit the home, but not a close friend or relative. \u201cIt\u2019s not that these new rules make sense, it\u2019s that the government is trying to find a way to contextualise that things are changing. And yes, they might be choosing economically advantageous ways to pull everyone out of this,\u201d says Zac Seidler, a clinical psychologist for the men\u2019s health charity <a href=\"https://uk.movember.com/\">Movember</a>. He sees the conflict playing out in families as \u201ca challenging of authority, which lots of people have, versus health anxiety\u201d.</p> <p>Stanton, for example, would like her cleaner to return to work in her house. But her husband feels it is too risky, so the cleaner will not be coming back. \u201cI\u2019m not going to overrule him because the atmosphere would be so terrible. And if, God forbid, we did catch it from the cleaner I\u2019d never forgive myself.\u201d</p> <p>The couple have already spent part of the lockdown rowing about how to obey the rules and she no longer thinks her husband is behaving rationally. \u201cIf somebody walks past me on the pavement, I don\u2019t have a heart attack. But if my husband goes with me on a walk, and someone is heading towards us, he will literally cross to the other side of the street and get the kids to stand on the verge.\u201d</p> <p>At one point during the lockdown, after a major row, the couple stopped speaking to each other completely. This created so much tension in their home that their 11-year-old daughter asked if they were going to get divorced. \u201cShe was really upset.\u201d</p> <p>Seidler recommends families facing this kind of conflict seek help from an external mediator or counsellor. At the very least, they should discuss what would need to happen for everyone in the household to feel safe about sticking to the new rules. Any step away from lockdown is \u201calways going to sound random. It\u2019s like: what\u2019s changed in a week? No one knows. But just roll with it. Adaptation is really key.\u201d</p> <p>Otherwise, health anxiety can start to take hold of you, he says. \u201cIf people are stuck in a sense of overwhelming distress and fear, then we\u2019re not going to be able to move forward.

One of the largest holiday park companies, Haven, will reopen at the start of July with limits on numbers who can stay at its sites. Center Parcs expects to extend the closure of its holiday villages in the UK and Ireland into June, but is looking at ways to reopen with social distancing in place between guests and staff. The moves come after health secretary Matt Hancock said was unlikely that foreign holidays would be possible this summer because of the continued threat of coronavirus. Haven announced last week that it would extend the closure of its holiday parks through June, a move which will affect 56,000 breaks. However, it said that it would be reopening in July but with new restrictions in place. \u201cFor guests who will be holidaying with us, we will be making a range of changes to our check-in process and limiting the number of guests staying on park at any time,\u201d said Gerard Tempest, Haven\u2019s guest and proposition director. Holidaymakers hoping to go to one of the Center Parcs villages have been told the sites remain closed until June 11. A spokesman said the closure period was expected to be extended, and that staff were planning how to reopen with social distancing measures. In the Broads National Park, Ian Russell, the owner of Wroxham Barns, a children\u2019s farm and visitor attraction, said it would be operating at 30% capacity when it reopens. \u201cWe are still awaiting guidelines from Visit England and government on what social distancing operating requirements will look like ,\u201d said Russell. Jack Jay, from the indoor Hippodrome Circus in Great Yarmouth, said he and colleagues were looking at whether it was viable to open with hundreds fewer people in the audience to allow social distancing.

      "bodyText": "Four out of five merchants at a major fruit market in Peru have tested positive for coronavirus, revealing shocking levels of infection \u2013 and prompting fears that Latin America\u2019s traditional trading centres may have helped spread Covid-19 across the region. Seventy-nine per cent of stall-holders in Lima\u2019s wholesale fruit market tested positive for Covid-19, while spot tests at five other large fresh food markets in the city revealed at least half were carrying the virus. The results came as local authorities from Mexico City to Rio de Janeiro struggle to enforce social distancing and sanitary measures at wholesale and retail markets, which are mainstays of local economies. Latin America is wrestling with a surging death toll from the pandemic: Mexico and Brazil \u2013 whose presidents have been accused of downplaying the epidemic \u2013 both saw record single-day mortalities last week. But Peru also reported a peak in coronavirus deaths and new infections \u2013 even after two months of one the region\u2019s strictest lockdowns. Peru\u2019s president, Mart\u00edn Vizcarra, said the infected merchants in Lima would be replaced, but stopped short of shutting down the fruit market, arguing that such a move could create food shortages. Soldiers and police officers were deployed at the market to take the temperature of all traders and clients. \u201cMarkets were probably the biggest vector of infection which is why Peru\u2019s quarantine did not work as it should have,\u201d said Eduardo Zegarra, the principal investigator for Grade, a development thinktank in Lima. \u201cThese figures are a bombshell,\u201d he said, calling on the government to shut down the markets and declare a sanitary emergency. Authorities in Lima have left most of the city\u2019s 1,200-plus markets open, carrying out spot tests and sending infected vendors \u2013 most of whom were asymptomatic \u2013 to self-isolate at home or at government facilities. But Zegarra worried Lima\u2019s huge wholesale markets were already \u201cenormous hubs of infection\u201d, particularly Santa Anita, Lima\u2019s largest, where some 30,000 merchants, porters and suppliers distribute and sell around 8,000 tonnes of food per day. Dozens of infections and at least one death have been reported among the market\u2019s porters and fears were growing that the virus could already have spread; not only to thousands of retailers and customers but also to lorry drivers traveling between the city and the country. \u201cI fear that could trigger a second wave of the pandemic,\u201d said Zegarra, a former deputy mayor of Lima. \u201cThe contagion among merchants is terribly high and we don\u2019t know how long they\u2019ve had it or how many people they\u2019ve passed it on to.\u201d Coronavirus cases in Peru rose to more than 88,000 on Saturday, with a death toll of 2,572, according to official figures. Only Brazil has a higher infection rate in Latin America, surging to fourth place in the world with 233,511 confirmed cases and sixth place for coronavirus deaths with 15,662, according to Johns Hopkins University. S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s CEAGESP wholesale market \u2013 one of the largest on the continent \u2013 has already seen \u201cinnumerable\u201d cases and around 30 deaths from Covid-19, according to the president of the market suppliers\u2019 union. \u201cWe are very sad about the deaths of these people \u2013 but if you consider 40,000 people who come here every day, it is quite low,\u201d said Cl\u00e1udio Furquim.

Markets still occupy an important place in Latin American culture and economies \u2013 even as retail giants such as Walmart expand into the region. But that has also tied them closely to the spread of the disease. Colombia\u2019s largest wholesale market, Corabastos, sits in the hardscrabble Kennedy neighbourhood of the capital Bogot\u00e1 \u2013 currently centre of the country\u2019s outbreak. Last week, the city\u2019s mayor, Claudia L\u00f3pez, said the vast market would be operate at just 35% of capacity after 30 cases were detected there. The city\u2019s health minister, Alejandro G\u00f3mez, admitted that local government could have done better but also stressed the importance of food supplies. \u201cWe cannot allow Corabastos to become a risk to the health of Bogot\u00e1, but neither can we allow food shortages,\u201d he said.

      "body": "<p>If Boris Johnson is mishandling the pandemic, he is not alone. Falsely claiming everything is under control, dodging responsibility, hiding from public view, exploiting the crisis for political gain, mounting artificial distractions and blaming the media: these are common behaviour patterns exhibited by some of the world\u2019s most powerful \u2013 and shifty \u2013 leaders.</p> <p>Will they pay a price for their lethal incompetence and cynicism? It\u2019s possible some will, though it may take a while. The pandemic is changing political calculations around the globe. Leaders who looked invulnerable suddenly appear less so. That in turn could shift the strategic calculus and alter the balance of power between countries in ways both unexpected and permanent.</p> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s performance is a lesson in how not to handle an emergency. It may become a compulsory case study for future students of crisis management. Trump minimised the threat early on, offered phoney assurances, and failed to make a plan. He has since accused China of <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/2020-05-13/coronavirus-donald-trump-accuses-china-of-unleashing-a-plague-upon-the-world/\">deliberately spreading \u201cplague\u201d</a> while weaponising the crisis to smear his Democratic rival, Joe Biden.</p> <p>The president\u2019s myriad character flaws need no rehearsal here. But it seems a desperate Trump will stop at nothing to re-boot his re-election prospects. If that means fomenting a cold war with China, or stoking racial divisions and anti-migrant, anti-Muslim bias, he\u2019s up for it. And if all that fails, he may try to delay November\u2019s election, a scenario <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/us/politics/kushner-election-november.html\">not ruled out</a> by his sycophantic son-in-law.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Putin\u2019s decision to shield himself from harm has badly dented his image as fearless tough-guy leader</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Coronavirus has made a sort of leper of Trump. A lack of federal leadership and his support for prematurely ending state lockdowns he never truly supported appears to be propelling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/new-us-coronavirus-hotspots-republican-heartland-areas\">a rise in Covid-19 cases</a> in small midwest towns and rural communities from Iowa to Texas. These are the heartlands of Trump\u2019s America, where his most loyal voters live.<br><br>As a result, Republicans running for Congress are running away from Trump, fearful of infection from the miasma of lies and distrust enveloping the White House.

      "bodyText": "If Boris Johnson is mishandling the pandemic, he is not alone. Falsely claiming everything is under control, dodging responsibility, hiding from public view, exploiting the crisis for political gain, mounting artificial distractions and blaming the media: these are common behaviour patterns exhibited by some of the world\u2019s most powerful \u2013 and shifty \u2013 leaders. Will they pay a price for their lethal incompetence and cynicism? It\u2019s possible some will, though it may take a while. The pandemic is changing political calculations around the globe. Leaders who looked invulnerable suddenly appear less so. That in turn could shift the strategic calculus and alter the balance of power between countries in ways both unexpected and permanent. Donald Trump\u2019s performance is a lesson in how not to handle an emergency. It may become a compulsory case study for future students of crisis management. Trump minimised the threat early on, offered phoney assurances, and failed to make a plan. He has since accused China of deliberately spreading \u201cplague\u201d while weaponising the crisis to smear his Democratic rival, Joe Biden. The president\u2019s myriad character flaws need no rehearsal here. But it seems a desperate Trump will stop at nothing to re-boot his re-election prospects. If that means fomenting a cold war with China, or stoking racial divisions and anti-migrant, anti-Muslim bias, he\u2019s up for it. And if all that fails, he may try to delay November\u2019s election, a scenario not ruled out by his sycophantic son-in-law. Coronavirus has made a sort of leper of Trump. A lack of federal leadership and his support for prematurely ending state lockdowns he never truly supported appears to be propelling a rise in Covid-19 cases in small midwest towns and rural communities from Iowa to Texas. These are the heartlands of Trump\u2019s America, where his most loyal voters live. As a result, Republicans running for Congress are running away from Trump, fearful of infection from the miasma of lies and distrust enveloping the White House. As jobs disappear by the tens of millions, Democrats\u2019 hopes of winning the Senate are rising. Biden\u2019s lead in key battleground states is widening, fuelled by economic meltdown and Trump\u2019s gaffes. Vladimir Putin is another leader in serious viral difficulty. Only months ago, he looked invincible. All the talk in Russia was of constitutional \u201creforms\u201d that would effectively make him president for life. Those plans are now on hold, perhaps permanently. Putin\u2019s decision to shield himself from harm, isolating away from Moscow, has badly dented his image as fearless tough-guy leader.

Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro hit a new low for irresponsibility by ridiculing public protection measures. Brazil has the highest Covid death rate in Latin America. But Bolsonaro prefers barbecue parties to hospital visits. He may yet pay with his job in a country where presidential impeachment actually works. In Turkey, meanwhile, the virus has brought a great many pigeons home to roost. A structurally fragile economy, a hollowed-out civil society and media, and a climate of fear created by Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan have not proved conducive to a unified national effort \u2013 leading analysts to suggest the sultan-president\u2019s reign may be drawing to a close.

      "body": "<p>The most striking feature about the impact of Covid-19 on children is how little research has been conducted in the field. Only a handful of studies have been carried out across the world, and scientists are divided over their interpretation.</p> <p>As a result, politicians are now being asked to decide if they should open schools in order to protect children\u2019s mental health and education without any clear scientific guidance about the risks of triggering a second wave of Covid-19 and infecting school staff in the process.</p> <p>It is known that children are less likely to become ill if infected with the coronavirus but researchers are still unsure how easily they can infect others. Some research indicates that children are far less likely to become infected compared with adults but other studies suggest that when they do become infected, they carry as much viral load as an adult, and therefore pose a real risk of passing the virus on to others.</p> <p>The situation was summed up by a senior Labour frontbencher last week: \u201cEither you put the education of children at risk by keeping schools closed, or you take a risk with their safety. There is no easy answer. The problem is that if we say to parents they must send their children back to school, and there is one awful case involving a teacher or a pupil who contracts Covid-19, then it is all over the media.\u201d</p> <p>Last week, Tory MP Robert Halfon, chairman of the select committee on education, backed calls for a phased re-opening of schools. \u201cIt is vital children get back into the classroom when it is safe to do so. Otherwise we will face a decade of educational poverty and a safeguarding crisis affecting vulnerable children.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Alasdair Munro, a paediatric infectious disease expert at University Hospital Southampton, also favours an early return to school. To support the idea, he highlighted a key study carried out in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/eradicated-coronavirus-mass-testing-covid-19-italy-vo\">Italian town of V\u00f2</a>, where there was a major Covid-19 outbreak in February.</p> <p>\u201cThe authorities tested more than 80% of the population and found 2.8% were positive to the coronavirus. Crucially, not one child under 10 was found to have been infected, and that remained the case when testing was repeated two weeks later.

      "bodyText": "The most striking feature about the impact of Covid-19 on children is how little research has been conducted in the field. Only a handful of studies have been carried out across the world, and scientists are divided over their interpretation. As a result, politicians are now being asked to decide if they should open schools in order to protect children\u2019s mental health and education without any clear scientific guidance about the risks of triggering a second wave of Covid-19 and infecting school staff in the process. It is known that children are less likely to become ill if infected with the coronavirus but researchers are still unsure how easily they can infect others. Some research indicates that children are far less likely to become infected compared with adults but other studies suggest that when they do become infected, they carry as much viral load as an adult, and therefore pose a real risk of passing the virus on to others. The situation was summed up by a senior Labour frontbencher last week: \u201cEither you put the education of children at risk by keeping schools closed, or you take a risk with their safety. There is no easy answer. The problem is that if we say to parents they must send their children back to school, and there is one awful case involving a teacher or a pupil who contracts Covid-19, then it is all over the media.\u201d Last week, Tory MP Robert Halfon, chairman of the select committee on education, backed calls for a phased re-opening of schools. \u201cIt is vital children get back into the classroom when it is safe to do so. Otherwise we will face a decade of educational poverty and a safeguarding crisis affecting vulnerable children.\u201d Dr Alasdair Munro, a paediatric infectious disease expert at University Hospital Southampton, also favours an early return to school. To support the idea, he highlighted a key study carried out in the Italian town of V\u00f2, where there was a major Covid-19 outbreak in February. \u201cThe authorities tested more than 80% of the population and found 2.8% were positive to the coronavirus. Crucially, not one child under 10 was found to have been infected, and that remained the case when testing was repeated two weeks later. Yet quite a number of children were living in households with infected people.\u201d Other studies in Iceland, Norway and South Korea have also found very low rates of infected children in communities. However, these findings contrast with last week\u2019s Office of National Statistics\u2019 disclosure that in its testing of 10,000 individuals in the UK, it found \u201cno evidence\u201d of differences between age groups in the proportions of those testing positive. \u201cThat has thrown a bit of a spanner into the works,\u201d admitted Munro. In addition, there is the question of the amount of virus that a child might carry, which would indicate how easily he or she could go on to infect others. If children have lower viral loads than those typically carried by an adult, children would pose less of a risk in boosting infections rate. However, research carried out by a team led by German coronavirus expert Christian Drosten at the Charit\u00e9 hospital in Berlin found no significant difference between any age categories, including children. \u201cViral loads in the very young do not differ significantly from those of adults.

      "body": "<p>In mid March, when the closure of schools seemed imminent, Rob Ricci readied his family for lockdown. The most crucial of his preparations was two \u00a3300 Acer Chromebooks ordered from Currys so that his daughters could continue their lessons online.</p> <p>The package that arrived at his Glasgow home was gaping open with only one Chromebook inside and the delivery driver beat a retreat citing social distancing rules.</p> <p>Ricci spent an hour queuing on Currys\u2019s customer service line and was told that an investigation would take between three and five working days. That was the last he heard. \u201cI\u2019m getting nowhere with anyone and feel frustrated that, at a time when online retailers should be at their sharpest, I\u2019m being failed,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Down at the other end of the country in West Sussex, Alan Kyle was also counting the hours on the phone to Currys. He had ordered a washing machine in early March. The delivery date was three days before lockdown began and it came and went without word from the company. \u201cThe silence leaves me unsure of what my next move should be,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Some retailers, it seems, are ploughing depleted resources into advertising and sales and skimping on customer service, leaving thousands of customers with faulty, incomplete or non-existent orders. Those who try to claim refunds or replacements report that they are being stalled \u2013 either by inaccessible phone lines or by the command to wait until lockdown ends before lodging a complaint.</p> <p>The travel industry has been widely condemned for ignoring the legal obligation to refund cancelled holidays, but high street customers who have been forced to shop online are also finding that companies are ducking the law during the Covid chaos.</p> <p>The Consumer Credit Act allows customers to claim a refund, repair or a replacement if their purchase is faulty or not as described. If they\u2019ve shopped online, they have 14 days to return an order for any reason under the Consumer Contracts regulations. Although many firms are encouraging customers to accept credit notes or open-ended delivery times during the lockdown in order to remain solvent, consumer rights are unaffected by the crisis.</p> <p>Currys\u2019 latest Facebook post a month ago triggered more than 7,000 comments from customers awaiting missing orders and unable to make contact, and 66% of Trustpilot reviews rate its service as bad or poor.</p> <p>Homebase has attracted similar ire. As the company reopens its stores, hundreds of customers have been waiting a month or more for their orders. It has suspended its customer service phone line in favour of a web form and many who have submitted complaints that way say they have had no response.</p> <p>Barbara Welford from North Yorkshire ordered a set of garden furniture to use during lockdown. Her payment was debited promptly and she was promised delivery within five days. Three weeks later, there was still no sign of her \u00a3316 order or any indication that it existed. \u201cThe website is still encouraging people to buy with generous discounts,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy is the company taking orders which they can\u2019t fulfil?\u201d</p> <p>Holly Wilson* also invested in garden furniture when she realised weeks of quarantine lay ahead. She spent \u00a3200 on a table and two chairs from the online retailer, Very. Her order arrived, but one of the chairs was missing. She was told that complaints will only be dealt with when lockdown is over.</p> <p>\u201cI asked to return the items, but Very requires it to be collected. There is a phone number to arrange this but when I tried it was closed,\u201d she says. \u201cI was then sent a message telling me to return the item and order again which its own website says is not possible because of the size. By the time this crisis is over we will be out of the legal deadline for gaining refunds and, judging by the mass of complaints on social media, I am not the only person who is paying for goods they have not received, cannot cancel or gain a refund.\u201d</p> <p>Groupon, the discount platform, is offering customers whose orders arrive faulty, or not at all, vouchers instead of the refunds they are legally due. It\u2019s also refusing to allow purchases to be returned within the required 14-day deadline, according to multiple reviewers on Trustpilot.</p> <p>Lynn Crawford was refused a refund after a spa break and a hotel stay were cancelled due to the pandemic. Groupon is extending the expiry date of its vouchers but hotels are unlikely to be opening for weeks. \u201cI\u2019ve paid \u00a3255 which, as a self-employed person with no income at the minute, would best serve me back in my bank account,\u201d she says. \u201cThey no longer respond to my emails, and the telephone number they give for customer services is not operational.\u201d</p> <p>The complaints website Resolver reports a surge in complaints from customers whose statutory rights are being ignored. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that some retailers aren\u2019t playing fair,\u201d says spokesperson Martyn James. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge issue, and we\u2019re starting to see a lot of complaints about this. Consumer rights don\u2019t evaporate because of Covid-19, though some businesses seem to be gambling they can bend the rules and get away with it.\u201d</p> <p>Currys blamed an \u201cadministration error\u201d for Kyle\u2019s errant washing machine which was delivered two days after the <em>Observer </em>intervened. However, it confirmed that delays to orders and after-sales service are possible as its offering limited telephone support and staffing levels are unpredictable because of self-isolation. Customers who need to return goods have 21 days so do so after stores reopen. Ricci, meanwhile, has now received a refund for the missing item.</p> <p>Homebase admits delays caused by a surge in online orders after it closed its stores in March. \u201cWe know this has been incredibly frustrating,\u201d it says. \u201cOur team and suppliers are working hard doing everything we can to catch up and get back on track.\u201d It promises customers a refund within seven days of a request.</p> <p>Welford\u2019s order never arrived and she was refunded two days after the <em>Observer </em>contacted the company.</p> <p>Very, meanwhile, acknowledges it had failed Wilson. It has refunded half the cost of the furniture and added a \u00a350 voucher. \u201cTo protect our customer-care team during the coronavirus outbreak, we have fewer advisors than usual taking calls,\u201d it says. \u201cWe are also prioritising customers who are vulnerable or experiencing financial difficulties during this challenging time. This means wait times are longer than usual which we understand is frustrating.\u201d</p> <p>Groupon says it was trying to balance the needs of customers and merchants. It decided to refund Crawford after the <em>Observer</em> queried its policies.</p> <p>\u201cDue to postal service disruptions, some shipments are delayed and we are very sorry about this,\u201d it says. \u201cOur refund policies and the type of refunds that we provide to our customers \u2013 whether it\u2019s cash or credit \u2013 can vary by category, merchant, and circumstances of the particular transaction.\u201d</p> <p>Customers who paid by credit card or a credit agreement can make a claim from their credit provider if a retailer fails to honour a purchase, provided each item was \u00a3100 or more. Debit card users can try to get their money back via the voluntary chargeback scheme operated by banks.</p> <p>However, retailers that are ripping up the rule book should be held to account however dire the situation, according to consumer rights experts.</p> <p><em>* Not their real name</em></p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "In mid March, when the closure of schools seemed imminent, Rob Ricci readied his family for lockdown. The most crucial of his preparations was two \u00a3300 Acer Chromebooks ordered from Currys so that his daughters could continue their lessons online. The package that arrived at his Glasgow home was gaping open with only one Chromebook inside and the delivery driver beat a retreat citing social distancing rules. Ricci spent an hour queuing on Currys\u2019s customer service line and was told that an investigation would take between three and five working days. That was the last he heard. \u201cI\u2019m getting nowhere with anyone and feel frustrated that, at a time when online retailers should be at their sharpest, I\u2019m being failed,\u201d he says. Down at the other end of the country in West Sussex, Alan Kyle was also counting the hours on the phone to Currys. He had ordered a washing machine in early March. The delivery date was three days before lockdown began and it came and went without word from the company. \u201cThe silence leaves me unsure of what my next move should be,\u201d he says. Some retailers, it seems, are ploughing depleted resources into advertising and sales and skimping on customer service, leaving thousands of customers with faulty, incomplete or non-existent orders. Those who try to claim refunds or replacements report that they are being stalled \u2013 either by inaccessible phone lines or by the command to wait until lockdown ends before lodging a complaint. The travel industry has been widely condemned for ignoring the legal obligation to refund cancelled holidays, but high street customers who have been forced to shop online are also finding that companies are ducking the law during the Covid chaos. The Consumer Credit Act allows customers to claim a refund, repair or a replacement if their purchase is faulty or not as described. If they\u2019ve shopped online, they have 14 days to return an order for any reason under the Consumer Contracts regulations. Although many firms are encouraging customers to accept credit notes or open-ended delivery times during the lockdown in order to remain solvent, consumer rights are unaffected by the crisis. Currys\u2019 latest Facebook post a month ago triggered more than 7,000 comments from customers awaiting missing orders and unable to make contact, and 66% of Trustpilot reviews rate its service as bad or poor. Homebase has attracted similar ire. As the company reopens its stores, hundreds of customers have been waiting a month or more for their orders. It has suspended its customer service phone line in favour of a web form and many who have submitted complaints that way say they have had no response. Barbara Welford from North Yorkshire ordered a set of garden furniture to use during lockdown. Her payment was debited promptly and she was promised delivery within five days. Three weeks later, there was still no sign of her \u00a3316 order or any indication that it existed. \u201cThe website is still encouraging people to buy with generous discounts,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy is the company taking orders which they can\u2019t fulfil?\u201d Holly Wilson* also invested in garden furniture when she realised weeks of quarantine lay ahead. She spent \u00a3200 on a table and two chairs from the online retailer, Very. Her order arrived, but one of the chairs was missing. She was told that complaints will only be dealt with when lockdown is over. \u201cI asked to return the items, but Very requires it to be collected. There is a phone number to arrange this but when I tried it was closed,\u201d she says. \u201cI was then sent a message telling me to return the item and order again which its own website says is not possible because of the size. By the time this crisis is over we will be out of the legal deadline for gaining refunds and, judging by the mass of complaints on social media, I am not the only person who is paying for goods they have not received, cannot cancel or gain a refund.\u201d Groupon, the discount platform, is offering customers whose orders arrive faulty, or not at all, vouchers instead of the refunds they are legally due. It\u2019s also refusing to allow purchases to be returned within the required 14-day deadline, according to multiple reviewers on Trustpilot. Lynn Crawford was refused a refund after a spa break and a hotel stay were cancelled due to the pandemic. Groupon is extending the expiry date of its vouchers but hotels are unlikely to be opening for weeks. \u201cI\u2019ve paid \u00a3255 which, as a self-employed person with no income at the minute, would best serve me back in my bank account,\u201d she says. \u201cThey no longer respond to my emails, and the telephone number they give for customer services is not operational.\u201d The complaints website Resolver reports a surge in complaints from customers whose statutory rights are being ignored. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that some retailers aren\u2019t playing fair,\u201d says spokesperson Martyn James. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge issue, and we\u2019re starting to see a lot of complaints about this. Consumer rights don\u2019t evaporate because of Covid-19, though some businesses seem to be gambling they can bend the rules and get away with it.\u201d Currys blamed an \u201cadministration error\u201d for Kyle\u2019s errant washing machine which was delivered two days after the Observer intervened. However, it confirmed that delays to orders and after-sales service are possible as its offering limited telephone support and staffing levels are unpredictable because of self-isolation. Customers who need to return goods have 21 days so do so after stores reopen. Ricci, meanwhile, has now received a refund for the missing item. Homebase admits delays caused by a surge in online orders after it closed its stores in March. \u201cWe know this has been incredibly frustrating,\u201d it says. \u201cOur team and suppliers are working hard doing everything we can to catch up and get back on track.\u201d It promises customers a refund within seven days of a request. Welford\u2019s order never arrived and she was refunded two days after the Observer contacted the company. Very, meanwhile, acknowledges it had failed Wilson. It has refunded half the cost of the furniture and added a \u00a350 voucher. \u201cTo protect our customer-care team during the coronavirus outbreak, we have fewer advisors than usual taking calls,\u201d it says. \u201cWe are also prioritising customers who are vulnerable or experiencing financial difficulties during this challenging time. This means wait times are longer than usual which we understand is frustrating.\u201d Groupon says it was trying to balance the needs of customers and merchants. It decided to refund Crawford after the Observer queried its policies. \u201cDue to postal service disruptions, some shipments are delayed and we are very sorry about this,\u201d it says. \u201cOur refund policies and the type of refunds that we provide to our customers \u2013 whether it\u2019s cash or credit \u2013 can vary by category, merchant, and circumstances of the particular transaction.\u201d Customers who paid by credit card or a credit agreement can make a claim from their credit provider if a retailer fails to honour a purchase, provided each item was \u00a3100 or more. Debit card users can try to get their money back via the voluntary chargeback scheme operated by banks. However, retailers that are ripping up the rule book should be held to account however dire the situation, according to consumer rights experts. * Not their real name",

Berlin\u2019s media apportion the blame for these losses to the indifference of the city\u2019s senate. \u201cBerlin can act as if it is so incredibly dumb,\u201d wrote the listings magazine Tip Berlin. \u201cSo dumb that three art collectors are leaving the city within 14 days.\u201d Der Tagesspiegel, a local newspaper, saw the departure of the Flick collection as \u201cfurther proof of Berlin\u2019s gradual metamorphosis from a creative hub into a stronghold for property speculators\u201d. The senate says its hands are tied when it comes to real-estate deals in a city where local and national structures often overlap. But Stoschek let it be known that it wasn\u2019t so much the imminent rent increase that had frustrated her as the lack of an invitation to find creative solutions, for example by integrating her collection into one of the state\u2019s museums. \u201cNot being the competent authority doesn\u2019t excuse you from feeling responsible for something,\u201d she told the Observer. For some administrators in Berlin\u2019s local coalition government, where the culture sector has since December 2016 been in the hands of leftwing party Die Linke, declining to pamper wealthy art buyers is also a matter of principle, however. Flick, Olbricht and Stoschek are all heirs of industrial fortunes amassed in the wealthy south-west of the country, and two of those dynasties are not without involvement in the darkest chapter of German history. Flick\u2019s grandfather, Friedrich, was sentenced as a war criminal during the Nuremberg trials for the use of slave labour in his mines and factories. Stoschek\u2019s great-grandfather was a member of the Nazi party and his company played an important role in the production of war materials. In Berlin, which has a surplus of artists producing works but a shortage of collectors to buy them, even old money with a problematic past was once eagerly courted by Klaus Wowereit, the city\u2019s mayor from 2001 to 2014. Under the new leftwing Berlin culture senator, Klaus Lederer, the mood has changed, collectors complain. But can they legitimately expect the state to protect them from a property market that is also edging out other, less well-funded cultural institutions, especially as Covid-19 threatens livelihoods across the arts? The Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, which runs the Hamburger Bahnhof museum, has been eager to be diplomatic as it parts ways with Flick. But the manner in which the patron announced his departure, in the middle of a global pandemic, has left some in the city disappointed. The Rieckhallen annex to the museum that houses Flick\u2019s collection stretches across a plot owned by the Austrian real estate company CA Immo, which wants to expand its \u201cEuropacity\u201d complex of high-rise offices and residences and has ruled out selling the land back to the state.",

Opposition parties are becoming more muscular with ministers. The devolved administrations in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland, which initially stayed in lockstep with the UK government, have openly split with Downing Street to pursue divergent policies. Conservative MPs are becoming dramatically more critical of their government\u2019s performance.

The Opinium poll that we publish today indicates <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/16/revolt-over-easing-lockdown-spreads-as-poll-slump-hits-prime-minister\">a nine-point plunge in public confidence in the government\u2019s ability</a> to handle the epidemic. Its approval rating is now negative for the first time since the emergency began. Opinium also reports that Britons now think that only the US has <a href=\"https://www.opinium.co.uk/public-opinion-on-coronavirus-5th-may/\">handled the crisis worse</a> than their own country. </p> <p>The opposition has been emboldened to become more aggressive in prosecuting the government\u2019s mistakes. Sir Keir Starmer has started to build a Labour narrative that avoidable deaths have occurred because the government has been sluggish and shambolic. Since he started to confront Mr Johnson at prime minister\u2019s questions, the Labour leader has played to his strengths by interrogating the government\u2019s performance in the forensic style of the successful barrister that he once was. This also exploits one of Mr Johnson\u2019s greatest weaknesses. He isn\u2019t good on detail. Faced with Mr Starmer\u2019s deployment of damnatory statistics and embarrassing quotations from official documents, the prime minister flannels and blusters like a defendant with a threadbare alibi. Tory MPs complain to me that he hasn\u2019t adjusted to the fact that Mr Starmer is a much more formidable inquisitor than his predecessor. Exasperated Tories also ask why Number 10 isn\u2019t doing more to rehearse the boss for these encounters. Last week the Labour leader skewered the prime minister on the grim death toll in care homes. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take the brains of an archbishop to work out that he would go on care homes,\u201d remarks one senior Tory with personal experience of doing PMQs. \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t Boris properly prepared for that?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"66d4fe1b8805be1b962bc6a6a3156335db80b1f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66d4fe1b8805be1b962bc6a6a3156335db80b1f9/155_385_3024_1815/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson gestures during prime minister's questions\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Faced with Mr Starmer\u2019s deployment of damnatory statistics and embarrassing quotations from official documents, the prime minister flannels and blusters like a defendant with a threadbare alibi.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We are also witnessing the revival of political argument on left/right lines. In the early period of the crisis, Labour found it hard to find an angle of attack when the Tories were responding to the accompanying economic emergency in a Labour way. Rishi Sunak is spending vast sums on government loans, salary subsidies and other state-expanding measures that would normally be associated with the left. After inviting the trade unions to help formulate the job retention scheme, the chancellor even referred to them as \u201csocial partners\u201d.</p> <p>A few weeks on, consensus is breaking down because there are very serious disputes about how quickly to ease out of lockdown. Most of the cabinet, and an even greater proportion of Tory MPs, are desperate for a rapid lifting of restrictions to revive the economy. Business largely agrees. Labour and its trade union allies are more wary and place the greatest emphasis on ensuring that workers are sufficiently protected.</p> <p>This has sparked a classic clash between rival interests and ideologies. One of the starkest is between the government and teachers. The largest teaching union uses the word \u201creckless\u201d to describe ministers\u2019 plans for a partial reopening of schools in June. The education secretary bites back that the union is \u201cscaremongering\u201d. No cosy, consensus-seeking talk about \u201csocial partners\u201d there.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Tory MPs joined the ridicule of the prime minister\u2019s confused and confusing broadcast</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Another sign that politics is returning to fractious business as usual is the rising tension within the Conservative party. The mask of unity that the government managed to maintain in the early weeks is fracturing. Cabinet ministers are letting it be known that they are furious about the lack of prior consultation by Downing Street before it makes key announcements. Tory MPs joined the ridicule of the prime minister\u2019s confused and confusing broadcast. When it was over, one former cabinet minister turned to his wife and said: \u201cWhat has he just said? What did that mean?\u201d <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/health/survey-results/daily/2020/05/13/fa60a/1\">Two-thirds of the public agree</a> that the government\u2019s new rules are not clear. Another former cabinet minister says: \u201cBoris has had his worst week of the crisis. He lost control of the messaging.\u201d I\u2019m told that a WhatsApp group used by about 250 Conservative MPs seethes with \u201csulphurous feelings\u201d towards the cabinet.</p> <p>This return to something resembling pre-crisis politics is not welcome to ministers. Like all governments, they\u2019d prefer it if everyone shut up and did as they were told. After his wounding in parliament over the care homes epidemic, the prime minister complained to Mr Starmer: \u201cThe public expect us to work together.\u201d That\u2019s not in the job description of the leader of the opposition. He is supposed to be invigilating the government. The clue is in his title.</p> <p>When political life was in a version of lockdown, Mr Johnson and his ministers were not being properly held to account. That absence of challenge did not make them a better government, but a worse one.</p> <p>Much of life will remain disrupted for many people for a long time to come, but politics is returning to a kind of normality. Good thing too.</p> <p>\u2022Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

This also exploits one of Mr Johnson\u2019s greatest weaknesses. He isn\u2019t good on detail. Faced with Mr Starmer\u2019s deployment of damnatory statistics and embarrassing quotations from official documents, the prime minister flannels and blusters like a defendant with a threadbare alibi. Tory MPs complain to me that he hasn\u2019t adjusted to the fact that Mr Starmer is a much more formidable inquisitor than his predecessor. Exasperated Tories also ask why Number 10 isn\u2019t doing more to rehearse the boss for these encounters. Last week the Labour leader skewered the prime minister on the grim death toll in care homes. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take the brains of an archbishop to work out that he would go on care homes,\u201d remarks one senior Tory with personal experience of doing PMQs. \u201cWhy wasn\u2019t Boris properly prepared for that?\u201d We are also witnessing the revival of political argument on left/right lines. In the early period of the crisis, Labour found it hard to find an angle of attack when the Tories were responding to the accompanying economic emergency in a Labour way. Rishi Sunak is spending vast sums on government loans, salary subsidies and other state-expanding measures that would normally be associated with the left. After inviting the trade unions to help formulate the job retention scheme, the chancellor even referred to them as \u201csocial partners\u201d. A few weeks on, consensus is breaking down because there are very serious disputes about how quickly to ease out of lockdown. Most of the cabinet, and an even greater proportion of Tory MPs, are desperate for a rapid lifting of restrictions to revive the economy. Business largely agrees. Labour and its trade union allies are more wary and place the greatest emphasis on ensuring that workers are sufficiently protected. This has sparked a classic clash between rival interests and ideologies. One of the starkest is between the government and teachers. The largest teaching union uses the word \u201creckless\u201d to describe ministers\u2019 plans for a partial reopening of schools in June. The education secretary bites back that the union is \u201cscaremongering\u201d. No cosy, consensus-seeking talk about \u201csocial partners\u201d there. Another sign that politics is returning to fractious business as usual is the rising tension within the Conservative party. The mask of unity that the government managed to maintain in the early weeks is fracturing. Cabinet ministers are letting it be known that they are furious about the lack of prior consultation by Downing Street before it makes key announcements. Tory MPs joined the ridicule of the prime minister\u2019s confused and confusing broadcast. When it was over, one former cabinet minister turned to his wife and said: \u201cWhat has he just said? What did that mean?\u201d Two-thirds of the public agree that the government\u2019s new rules are not clear. Another former cabinet minister says: \u201cBoris has had his worst week of the crisis. He lost control of the messaging.\u201d I\u2019m told that a WhatsApp group used by about 250 Conservative MPs seethes with \u201csulphurous feelings\u201d towards the cabinet. This return to something resembling pre-crisis politics is not welcome to ministers. Like all governments, they\u2019d prefer it if everyone shut up and did as they were told. After his wounding in parliament over the care homes epidemic, the prime minister complained to Mr Starmer: \u201cThe public expect us to work together.\u201d That\u2019s not in the job description of the leader of the opposition. He is supposed to be invigilating the government. The clue is in his title. When political life was in a version of lockdown, Mr Johnson and his ministers were not being properly held to account. That absence of challenge did not make them a better government, but a worse one. Much of life will remain disrupted for many people for a long time to come, but politics is returning to a kind of normality. Good thing too. \u2022Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",

At the end of its last day on air on 29 September 1967, with the rebrand due to take place the next morning, announcer David Dunhill described \u201chome\u201d and \u201cservice\u201d as \u201ctwo of the best words in the British language\u201d.

At the end of its last day on air on 29 September 1967, with the rebrand due to take place the next morning, announcer David Dunhill described \u201chome\u201d and \u201cservice\u201d as \u201ctwo of the best words in the British language\u201d. That sounds quaint today largely because, for decades, neoliberal-inspired politics dismissed public service broadcasting as inefficient and lumbering, accusing it of crowding out private enterprise. When lockdown began, many presumed that audiences would drift away from public service television and seek out box-set escapism on streaming services. While subscriptions to the streamers have increased, the bigger story has been a rediscovery of television as a shared national experience. Not only are news programmes attracting record audiences, programmes that instead of providing escape from the crisis are open about the limitations social distancing places on them, have been unexpected hits. Audiences, it appears, are rather fond of the improvisational, make-do-and-mend style adopted by programmes such as Mary Beard\u2019s Lockdown Culture, which is partly made from the classicist\u2019s own home. These improvised lockdown programmes make up for being a bit rough at the edges by offering us vicarious peaks inside the homes of presenters, interviewees and celebrities. This has been a dismal year for making predictions. Yet it does seem reasonable to predict that, once some sort of end to this crisis comes, the case for broadcasting as a national service will be difficult to dismiss. If the prime minister does accept that \u201cthere really is such a thing as society\u201d, the next logical step is to properly value the institutions and the ideas that bind society together. \u2022David Olusoga is an Observer columnist",

Life expectancy here is two years below the national average.\u201d He went on: \u201cWe locked down too late; this unlockdown strategy is premature. The testing capacity isn\u2019t robust enough, neither is the tracking and tracing system, the R-rate [the virus\u2019s reproduction rate] isn\u2019t low enough. They\u2019re doing this too soon; it means a second wave will happen.\u201d Gannon said he had been told by his public health director that the R-rate in Gateshead was around 1.1 \u2013 above the level at which exponential spread takes place. The latest Opinium poll for the Observer shows that approval for the government over its handling of the pandemic has plummeted by nine points in the last week. Whereas net approval of its performance \u2013 the figure reached when the percentage who disapprove is subtracted from percentage who approve \u2013 stood at +42% on 26 March, it has now fallen to -3%. For the first time since Opinium began tracking views on the pandemic in March, more people disapprove of the government\u2019s handling than approve. Only 44% think the new \u201cstay alert\u201d message is clear. Some 56% say they are not clear who they can meet outside their household. Yesterday, the number of people who have died from coronavirus in all settings in the UK rose by 468 to a total of 34,466. A further 3,451 people tested positive for the virus. The number of people tested for Covid-19 rose to its highest daily total of 136,486. Controversy over schools reopening has intensified because of a lack of clear scientific evidence. Only a handful of studies have been carried out worldwide on Covid-19\u2019s impact on children, and scientists disagree about their interpretation. Studies from Italy, Iceland and South Korea suggest there are low rates of infectivity among under-10s compared with adults. However, the UK\u2019s Office for National Statistics contradicted this last week: a survey of 10,000 people showed children were just as likely as adults to be infected with Covid-19, it reported. On the other hand, an Australian study \u2013 reported in Nature \u2013 has revealed children are rarely the first person to bring a Covid-19 infection into a home. That finding was countered by German researchers who have found amounts of virus carried by infected individuals are not significantly different between age groups. Yesterday, after the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, led the daily Covid-19 briefing, Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of school leaders\u2019 union NAHT, said he could not yet back the government. \u201cThe government says its evidence indicates circumstances should be improved enough to safely admit more pupils from 1 June. However, if their tests haven\u2019t been met, the government must follow through on its statement that wider school reopening will be paused,\u201d he said. Burnham writes, unless the government listens more to council leaders outside the south-east, the revolt against his plans will grow. \u201cIf the Government carries on in the same vein, expect to see an even greater fracturing of national unity,\u201d he says. \u201cDifferent places will adopt their own messaging and policies,\u201d he says. \u201cNervousness in the north about the R number will see more councils adopt their own approach on schools, as Liverpool, Gateshead and Hartlepool are doing. Arguments will increase about funding. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get the help we need, there\u2019s a risk of a second spike here which will pass the infection back down the country through the Midlands to London. I\u2019m not sure this is the kind of \u2018levelling-up\u2019 the government has in mind.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "And with that, we\u2019ll leave you for the day. Thanks for following along. Let\u2019s wrap up the main developments of the day. Victoria announced a plan to reopen restaurants and pubs, beginning from 1 June. But patrons in Victoria will need to provide some brief personal details to enter venues for tracing purposes. The fractured relationship between Australia and China has continued, with the trade minister Simon Birmingham revealing his counterparts are not returning his phone calls. NSW wants state borders to reopen, but Queensland is holding firm (the NSW-Victoria border has remained open throughout the crisis). Queensland authorities are investigating a case where an aged care worker kept working while waiting for her Covid-19 test results. She tested positive. The Victorian Department of Health and Human Services says it is working with two Melbourne businesses where Covid-19 cases have been confirmed. The businesses are a Dominos outlet in Fairfield, in the inner north-east, and The Comfort Group, a bedmaker with headquarter at Deer Park in Melbourne\u2019s west. \u201cWhile the risk of transmission is low, as a precaution the Domino\u2019s shop has been closed for two weeks for thorough cleaning. All 16 staff members will be tested and will be quarantined for 14 days,\u201d the department statement read. \u201cAs a precaution, The Comfort Group site has been closed since Friday and will remain closed until at least Wednesday while investigations continue. A deep clean has already been undertaken. The department is currently working to acquire all relevant information and ensure all public health procedures are followed. \u201cAll close and casual contacts will be tested, and quarantine requirements are being implemented as necessary.\u201d The government earlier today confirmed two women in Port Macquarie have been charged over allegedly fraudulent bushfire and Covid-19 welfare claims. A government statement said it was alleged the women used 25 assumed identities to try to claim more than $27,000 in welfare payments they were not entitled to. The statement said more than $10,000 was paid. They allegedly made 25 fraudulent claims for the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment and one fraudulent jobseeker payment claim. The women were arrested on Thursday, granted bail after being charged with eight counts of obtaining financial advantage by deception. They will appear in court on 22 July 2020. If you missed my colleague Daniel Hurst\u2019s piece looking at what the Australian government has been doing on the board of the World Health Organisation, which we published this morning, you can read it here. Labor\u2019s candidate for Eden Monaro, Kristy McBain, has just done a Facebook live campaign catch-up/Q&amp;A - the closest thing we can have to a town hall in the era of Covid-19 and physical distancing. McBain took a question on the $1,100-a-fortnight jobseeker unemployment benefit from Guardian Australia. She said: The rate of Newstart is clearly inadequate to live off, $40 a day - I would challenge anybody to live off that. It is too low, it does prevent people getting back into the workforce and getting a job ... [On] jobseeker, we can\u2019t just snap back. We can\u2019t go back to business as usual. Everyone is feeling a bit uncertain at the moment and we need some certainty. We need the government to outline what will happen after September. McBain also noted the jobkeeper wage subsidy will be reviewed in June, and said it should consider industries \u201cleft behind\u201d and why not everyone was eligible for the $1,500 fortnightly payment. McBain concluded that people are looking \u201cfor vision and a plan\u201d and she\u2019s not sure the government is providing it while Labor will outline priorities that drive \u201ctowards prosperity and hope\u201d. There were no new cases reported in Tasmania overnight, the premier Peter Gutwein told reporters earlier today. But he warned residents not to become complacent, saying it would leave to a second wave of the virus. \u201cA number of countries around the world have already found that they have been hit by second wave. We don\u2019t want to go through that, that would be devastating both in Tasmania and in this country,\u201d Gutwein said on Sunday. AAP reports that Gutwein warned some businesses may not survive if the state has to bring back stricter restrictions. \u201cThey will find that having had to recapitalise once, that the second time around they simply won\u2019t come back, so we need to step through this carefully and sustainably,\u201d he said. No fresh coronavirus cases were confirmed in Tasmania on Sunday, leaving the state\u2019s total number of infections so far at 226. There are 31 Tasmanians currently dealing with the condition, as 195 people have recovered. Under eased restrictions from Monday, restaurants and cafes will be allowed to have up to 10 people seated inside. Other gatherings of up to 10 people are also permitted, including for real estate purposes, small religious gatherings and weddings. While there is a bit of a lull, I might point you to this lovely feature by colleague Elias Visontay. With doubt swirling over the future of Virgin airlines, many will be thinking back to the demise of Ansett, about two decades earlier. As Elias finds, Ansett\u2019s legacy has lived on in some quite unexpected ways. AAP\u2019s Anna Harrington reports that A-League teams could resume training in June before the competition aims to complete its season in a hub format by the end of August. Football Federation Australia (FFA) chief executive James Johnson today said officials wanted to complete the remaining regular season games, plus finals. \u201cWe\u2019d like the remaining part of the season to be finished by the end of August,\u201d Johnson told Fox Sports News. The players could be training as early as June as a team and then we\u2019ve given ourselves that window between June and August to finish the season. We\u2019re in a little bit of a different situation to the AFL and the NRL in that we only have 27 regular-season matches left and five more play-off matches. Starting in August is certainly the very, very latest we\u2019d want to restart but we\u2019re hoping that we\u2019re going to have players up and running again on the football pitch training from June at the earliest. The A-League has been suspended since March. The NSW government said in a statement earlier today that more than 1,200 people who were sleeping rough were \u201chelped into temporary accommodation through the rapid expansion of assertive outreach to prevent the spread of Covid-19\u201d. Minister for families, communities and disability services Gareth Ward said: Our intense work since the beginning of April has resulted in many people sleeping rough accepting the offer of temporary accommodation for the first time in their lives. The Victoria premier, Daniel Andrews, today announced plans to reopen restaurants, bars and pubs from next month. The Liberal state opposition, which has been increasingly critical of the government\u2019s response, is unimpressed with the announcement. Opposition leader Michael O\u2019Brien said: Daniel Andrews will belatedly get \u2018back on the beers\u2019 even before the majority of Victorian students can get back in the classroom. It again shows the wrong priorities of this Labor premier. Our schools should be back already and our small hospitality businesses should be open \u2013 just as they are in other states. Victorian schools will start to reopen for face to face classes from 26 May, before all students return on 9 June. The WA health minister, Roger Cook, says that the state has identified a historical case \u201cfrom about seven weeks ago\u201d: This case is not currently active and is no risk to the community. The woman in her 30s from the metropolitan area had a PCR test in March as she was a close contact of a confirmed case and was showing some symptoms. So she did the right thing, she went out and got herself tested. However, the PCR test result came back as equivocal, which means the test, at the time, was not felt to be conclusive enough to provide her with a positive response, result. Cook says the state has now recorded 557 cases, including five active cases and one person in a hospital. McGowan says bars and restaurants in WA will be able to reopen for dine-in services from Monday. He says more than 8,800 businesses have downloaded the state\u2019s Covid safety plan, which provides guidelines for businesses to reopen. From tomorrow, one of the best things we can do is support each through this pandemic and return to our favourite local cafe or restaurant and resume our sport and recreation as well and help get businesses back to work and back into operations. Venues will be able to accommodate up to 20 people from tomorrow, says McGowan. The WA premier, Mark McGowan, has just started speaking in Perth. McGowan says there were no new cases reported in WA overnight. The social services minister, Anne Ruston, says the government will provide $9m to local community groups and organisations to support Australia\u2019s volunteers: The bushfires had a devastating impact on many of our people and communities across the country and we are now living through a global pandemic. Volunteers freely give their time and skills to support others and will play a key role in communities over the next few months. This funding recognises the sacrifices they make to help deliver vital services to those who need it most. The funding comes ahead of National Volunteer Week on Monday. The government said the funding would be shared by 2,698 organisations. It said: \u201cIn total, New South Wales community groups will receive $2,909,455, Victoria $2,381,770, Queensland $1,778,170, Western Australia $915,010, South Australia $611,440, Tasmania $312,350, ACT$179,100 and the Northern Territory $119,910.\u201d Howdy folks, Luke Henriques-Gomes here taking over from Naaman Zhou. Thanks to Naaman for his work today. I\u2019ll be with you into the evening. Get in touch at luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com or over Twitter @lukehgomes. Over lunch, you can read this piece from The Conversation on why it was economically reasonable to have a shutdown: And here is my colleague Paul Karp\u2019s full write-up of trade minister Simon Birmingham\u2019s comments on China earlier today. Birmingham told Australian businesses to look into diversifying away from China and \u201cbalance the risk and reward\u201d of trading with the superpower. \u201cI would, of course, encourage businesses, where they can see equal reward or similar reward, by spreading their risk across numerous markets, to do so. And that that would be wise business practice.\u201d Hazzard warns people in New South Wales to still stay 1.5 metres apart, and to not see friends if they are sick, even if it is just a runny nose. I would just like to warn everybody that we are still vulnerable. We have to temper it in a way that when we go out, we\u2019re still exercising the social distancing. The 1.5 metres is a magic figure \u2013 it can keep you safe! I\u2019ve observed today, people at cafes and restaurants, and many of them do not appear to be exercising that 1.5 metres. I\u2019ll just say to them \u2013 please be careful. We\u2019re living in dangerous times. We can still have fun, but they\u2019re dangerous times until we sort this virus issue out. New South Wales health minister Brad Hazzard is speaking now. He announces that as of 8pm last night, NSW only had one new case. However, he says the source of that transmission is unknown, which means people should be on high alert. Hazzard says that he has seen a lot of people returning to the outdoors and to cafes. Moving about Sydney this morning, I think it\u2019s fair to say that there has been, in a sense, the great NSW bust-out. People are rewarding themselves for many weeks of sacrifice and having themselves locked inside. Palaszczuk has also ruled out an easing of Queensland\u2019s border restrictions, after New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian called for borders to be \u201copen as soon as possible\u201d. Berejiklian said earlier today she had been pressuring state premiers to open their borders and that \u201cI don\u2019t want people to say \u2018I can go to Auckland\u2019 before I go to Brisbane\u201d. Palaszczuk says that the border will remain closed \u201cwhile there is active community transmission in NSW and Victoria\u201d. \u201cIt would be absolutely negligent of me to lift those restrictions with that community transmission happening down in NSW and Victoria.\u201d She adds that border closures will be reviewed at the end of every month. Six close contacts of the Rockhampton nurse have been identified, and have tested negative, Palaszczuk says. She also said that she will send the chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young, and the health minister, Steven Miles, to Rockhampton tomorrow. Queensland has recorded no new cases of coronavirus. That includes no new cases at the Rockhampton nursing home where a nurse tested positive a few days ago. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk says that 235 staff and residents have been tested at the aged care home, all with negative results. They are still waiting for 37 tests that are outstanding. \u201cBut honestly we are very relieved with the news that we are hearing at the moment,\u201d Palaszczuk says. She reminds people in Rockhampton to get tested if they have any mild symptoms. There are now only 12 active cases in Queensland. Australia\u2019s young people, aged 13 to 17, have been hit especially hard by the Covid-19 pandemic, a study from Unicef has found. It found 67% of young people were worried about their education being disrupted or held back. 40% of those surveyed felt that the discussion around issues that do affect young people, like school closures, were framed more in terms of the impact on parents, carers and the economy. NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian says she has been pressuring other premiers to open their state borders to stimulate the economy. \u201cYou have to get those borders open as soon as possible,\u201d she says. \u201cI have quietly been having a jibe at all my state colleagues who have kept their borders closed,\u201d she tells Sky News. \u201cNSW didn\u2019t and Victoria didn\u2019t.\u201d She says this is for the tourism and manufacturing industries. \u201cThe sooner the borders come down the better. I don\u2019t want people to say I can go to Auckland before I go to Brisbane, or to Perth.\u201d NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian is being interviewed on Sky News. National cabinet is not meeting for another two weeks \u2013 the first week without weekly meetings. She is asked if this is sign of confidence. Berejiklian says that is to allow states to now move \u201cat our own pace\u201d a little bit as they ease restrictions. Health minister Jenny Mikakos says that Victoria cannot immediately return to a full resumption of elective surgery. \u201cOur medical experts are very supportive of this graduated approach,\u201d she says. Victoria\u2019s deputy chief health officer, Dr Annaliese van Diemen, is speaking now. She is asked extensively first up about her tweet about Captain Cook. She says she is focused on dealing with the pandemic and managing the \u201cvery large\u201d public health team. \u201cI regret that it caused a distraction but we are focused on moving on,\u201d she says. There are seven new cases, she says, two linked to Cedar Meats, three in hotel quarantine and two others being investigated. Every patron will have to give their first name, last name and mobile phone number if they want to enter Victoria\u2019s reopened restaurants and dining areas of pubs. Daniel Andrews has just said this will be mandatory for contact tracing. A condition of being in that venue will be providing limited details of who you are. For one purpose only: so you can be contacted if there is a positive case. If you want to get back to restaurants, cafes and pubs, then download the app. I\u2019ve done it. Everyone on this stage has done it. Andrews says that the 20 person limit \u2013 twice the current limit in New South Wales \u2013 is based on data and is safe in the opinion of the chief health officer. We are doing more testing than any other state. We have a really good handle on how much virus is out there in the Victorian community. That can change though. We are giving people notice but it is always predicated on these continuing, stable test results. He clarifies that, like in NSW, the public bar part of a pub will not be open. It will be \u201cthe bistro, the dining area\u201d of a pub that will open. A reporter asks how this will be enforced. Andrews: I am confident these venues will do the right thing. It is in their interest. They will be closed if they don\u2019t follow these rules. Enforcement will be done by combination of the public health team and Victoria police. If there is a headcount that needs to be done, then there absolutely will be. Daniel Andrews says however that work from home will not change. He says that by mid-July as hospitality opens, the government messaging will change from \u201cstay home\u201d to \u201cstay safe\u201d. But the policy of \u201cif you can work from home, work from home\u201d will not change. \u201cThe advice from the chief health officer [has always been] if we have millions of people going to office environments when they don\u2019t need to be there, pressing lift buttons, sharing kitchens, sharing bathrooms, that presents the biggest risk.\u201d \u201cWe have the highest per capita testing rate in the country\u201d, health minister Jenny Mikakos says. \u201cGet tested\u201d, Andrews says. \u201cEven if you have the mildest symptoms.\u201d Andrews adds that he is not announcing lifting restrictions on gyms or outdoor gatherings yet. Premier Dan Andrews has just announced a huge lifting of restrictions in Victoria to come. On 1 June, cafes, restaurants, and the dining areas of pubs and clubs will reopen with up to 20 patrons indoors. Three weeks later, on 22 June, that limit would go up to 50 patrons. In mid-July, that will go up again to 100 patrons. Andrews says that patrons will still need to abide by distancing rules if this is to happen: Based on the results coming in, showing very low numbers, numbers that are not part of a cluster, gives us confidence that today we can foreshadow [this reopening]. This is a significant announcement, but it is based on people getting tested and those results remaining stable. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews is speaking now. He says Victoria has completed a testing blitz since restrictions eased slightly. We set a target of 50,000 tests this week, I can confirm for you we have done something like 92,000 tests. And we have results back for 61,000. Birmingham is asked whether Australia should consider diversifying its trade relations to be less reliant on China. He says that Australia has grown its trade with Japan, Korea, Vietnam and Canada in recent years. Speers asks him why two-way trade with China has increased. Birmingham says that is due to the market and private companies and not the government: China\u2019s economy has continued to grow in that time, which indeed, has seen it drive greater demand for goods and services from right around the region \u2013 not just from Australia, but from many other countries. This is an important point, government doesn\u2019t determine who businesses sell their goods and services to. Australian businesses make those commercial decisions. Now they need to balance the risk and reward of whom they trade with. Birmingham also confirms that Australia could escalate the issue to the World Trade Organisation if the deadlock continues: I\u2019ve publicly indicated that we reserve all rights in that regard. We\u2019ll decide the next steps, which may involve a WTO dispute. Australia has used WTO disputes with other valued partners around the world in recent years. I\u2019ve initiated them with Canada in relation to certain wine practices. With India in relation to certain sugar industry practices. This is about using the system that we strongly support of rules-based international trade, to ensure that where we think that things are operating outside of those rules, we call them out and we seek a resolution through the independent umpire. Earlier, Speers also asked Birmingham whether the beef and barley issues were politically motivated. \u201cYou don\u2019t really believe this has nothing to do with Australia calling for an independent inquiry [into the origins of Covid-19]?\u201d he asked. Birmingham said he \u201ccan understand why people would seek to draw links\u201d after some previous \u201cunhelpful remarks\u201d from the Chinese ambassador. But he says the issue is regulatory: Chinese authorities have been clear that in relation to the barley matter, in relation to the beef matter, these are long-standing issues, and that they are regulatory trade matters. We are taking that at face value and engaging in good faith. Birmingham says Australia has lodged an extensive response in Beijing with more than 10,000 pages of evidence and analysis to counter the barley dumping claim. Trade minister Simon Birmingham confirms that he has still not spoken to the Chinese trade minister as trade tensions rise over barley and beef. ABC Insiders host David Speers asks him if he has been able to get in touch. \u201cI know you\u2019ve been trying all week to talk to your counterpart in China. Has he or anyone returned your calls?\u201d Speers asks. \u201cWe have made a request for me to have discussions with my Chinese counterpart,\u201d Birmingham says. \u201cThat request has not been met with a call being accommodated at this stage.\u201d The trade minister adds that \u201cgovernment to government, we have had lots of communication, we have had lots of dialogue\u201d. Pubs, cafes and restaurants in Victoria will be allowed to open on 1 June, according to a report in the Sunday Herald Sun. The newspaper is reporting this morning that the number of patrons will be limited to 10 at a time. We\u2019ll bring you more on that story when we get it. The head of the Covid-19 coordination commission, Nev Power, has just said that international travel \u2013 and related businesses \u2013 will \u201ctake the longest to come back\u201d. Power told Sky News this morning that hospitality and the arts will come back relatively soon as parts of the economy reopen. \u201cSome of the parts that are going to take longer is anything associated with international travel, that\u2019s going to take the longest to come back,\u201d he said. Trade minister Simon Birmingham will be on the ABC\u2019s Insiders this morning, where he will certainly be asked about Australia\u2019s trade relationship with China, among other things. The Queensland government has launched an investigation into the Rockhampton nurse who worked at an aged care home and tested positive for coronavirus. The North Rockhampton Nursing Centre is currently in lockdown and 193 people have so far tested negative. Thirty-five low-risk residents have been moved from the home, AAP reports. The state\u2019s chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young, said officials were investigating the circumstances of the nurse\u2019s testing. This will include why the woman, who worked in the reception area of the facility, returned to work while waiting for her test results. The health minister, Steven Miles, said it was unacceptable that the nurse had gone to work while having symptoms of the Covid-19 disease. \u201cTo have this happen in a Queensland Health facility is very disappointing,\u201d he said. \u201cI have asked the director general to covey to all 100,000 staff that they need to go above and beyond what the chief health officer has advised.\u201d The nurse did not providing hands-on care to the residents, Young said. Welcome to the coronavirus live blog for Sunday 17 May. I\u2019m Naaman Zhou and I\u2019ll be taking you through the morning. Health authorities are warning Australians to approach their new-found freedoms with care, for fear of sparking a second wave of Covid-19. States and territories have begun lifting restrictions on outdoor and indoor gatherings and business operations, following weeks of measures to limit the spread of coronavirus. On Saturday, deputy chief medical officer Michael Kidd said people cannot afford to be complacent. \u201cThe pandemic is not over. The risk to vulnerable people remains significant,\u201d he told reporters in Canberra. Australian Medical Association president Tony Bartone said there was still a risk the virus could flare up as hot spots or small outbreaks. The number of cases in Australia stood at 7,036 on Saturday after 20 new cases were reported over 24 hours. The death toll from the pandemic remained at 98. The new cases included 11 in Victoria \u2013 which now stands at 98 \u2013 with two of those connected to the west Melbourne abattoir cluster. Elsewhere, a McDonald\u2019s restaurant in the north Melbourne suburb of Fawkner has recorded an additional case, with the outlet\u2019s cluster growing to 11. There was only one new case in Queensland, with 193 people testing negative for the virus at the North Rockhampton Nursing Centre after a nurse was diagnosed with the disease on Friday.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cIt\u2019s like building the plane while we\u2019re in the air.\u201d So said Rachel Anticoni, who happened to be director of operations of London\u2019s Royal Free hospital but could have been any one of the legion of struggling professionals coping as Covid-19 wriggled through their battlements, one weaselly, unconscionable cough at a time. One of the most telling things about the astonishing two nights of <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000j49t/hospital-coronavirus-special-episode-1\">Hospital: Coronavirus Special</a></strong> was that barroom philosophers \u2013 remember them? \u2013 might have to cut back on their instant solutions: our NHS administrators were on this evidence every bit as harried, fraught and dedicated, with muck-sweats and trembles and slept-in hair, as the lads and lasses in the gowns.</p> <p>Not only building the plane, but having to invent cockpit radio and an air traffic control system while wildly hoping, somehow, that those on the ground were in step with some of their thoughts, or at least not using Betamax or Windows 10. We saw how the trickle became a flood \u2013 four chairs set aside for cases, then eight, and by the end of Monday night\u2019s outing four entire floors were quarantined, and the basement morgue beginning to overflow, and concrete being poured for new tanks to store frozen oxygen, some patients needing 15 litres of pure every minute.</p> <p>The <em>Hospital</em> series has always been about access, and for this special \u2013 filmed from the very first evening of lockdown, almost until peak nasty in the week around Easter \u2013 the levels granted were phenomenal in the circumstances: one got the distinct feeling that camera and sound operators were almost accepted as onside friends on the same parapet. Reality cannot perforce be scripted: the editing has to do the dramatic work of a script, and thus I wondered slightly whether the individual stories selected for transmission didn\u2019t skew us, if even very slightly, towards the happier outcomes. I think, overall, the makers balanced any requirement for drama with fairness to the statistics; for every Peter, going home joyous at 88 despite being touch-and-go throughout, there was a Stanley, kind soft eyes shining so hard when first told one morning his breathing had settled, yet so suddenly, on the spiral down. We even got a little backstory: Peter, far from being any anonymous geezer-statistic, had invented the mint chocolate liqueur! Had I had any alcoholic After Eight in the house, and more importantly been able to find my way to a cupboard through the litter of crumpled Kleenex, I would have raised a glass to him.</p> <p>An absolute standout chronicle of our times, sure to be looked back on with something approaching awe, and if nothing else it reminded us of the sheer inventiveness and adaptability of the human animal \u2013 and reminded us too of the true meaning of the word \u201cunprecedented\u201d, rather than its devalued employment to describe having to talk to your family or wipe your nethers with kitchen roll.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8a8ad1b7e5119d8df976fa541d3ce189cdeb498\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8a8ad1b7e5119d8df976fa541d3ce189cdeb498/0_371_7952_4774/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Ruffalo in I Know This Much Is True.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A remarkably fine actor\u2019: Mark Ruffalo in I Know This Much Is True.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We were a little short on wildly light relief this week, unless you count sudden blithering governmental mismanagement as a kind of kooky black comedy (\u201cthe team takes a nation\u2019s six weeks of vaulting goodwill in a crisis and wilfully decides to spin mixed messages\u2026 with hilarious consequences\u2026\u201d). <strong><a href=\"https://www.sky.com/watch/i-know-this-much-is-true\">I Know This Much Is True</a></strong> is a dour, bleak, harrowing adaptation of a dour, bleak etc novel, which showcases Mark Ruffalo, playing twins, one of whom is schizophrenic. It is more than saved from just being a vehicle for awards for Ruffalo \u2013 playing twins, so versatile! Mental illness, a shoo-in! \u2013 by being magnificently shot, and paced, amid the bony trees of Connecticut, and by Ruffalo being in fact a remarkably fine actor, and by featuring, amid all the cancer and hand-amputation and police violence, an intriguing Italian grandfather\u2019s manuscript and Juliette Lewis as the sexiest fruit-loop of an academic translator one might ever encounter, never mind in Connecticut. It is honestly, if slowly and grimly, beautiful and moreish.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000j4c9\">Dave</a></strong>, which started with a doubler last Sunday night and is all about a privileged white wannabe rapper, is actually genuinely funny at many stages, though the humour too often centres on cringing at gaucheness or, more simplistically, penis gags. Ho ho. Dave Burd, the star and creator, who raps in real life under the moniker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/20/lil-dicky-comedy-rapper-video\">Lil Dicky</a>, plays a version of himself, which gets me a little fed up, it all having been done in Seinfeld, but also, I\u2019m getting a twitch fed up with grown men acting as tall toddlers, balls having dropped at least 15 years since yet still utterly unable to cope with women with brains. It is almost rescued by Burd\u2019s winning empathy towards both rich and poor, white and black. But that\u2019s a rather big \u201calmost\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e04bb2c1896a4a38e56c303c45b4b2924d71a643\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e04bb2c1896a4a38e56c303c45b4b2924d71a643/0_77_4251_2552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A wonderful find\u2019: Anne Regine Ellingsaeter in State of Happiness.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A wonderful find\u2019: Anne Regine Ellingsaeter in State of Happiness.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Petter Skafle Henriksen/BBC/NRK_Maipo Film</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Norwegian drama <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000hy8w\">State </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000hy8w\">of Happiness</a></strong> has been a wonderful find, as has its star Anne Regine Ellingsaeter. It\u2019s been gripping some of us over the last few Saturdays, and telling the tale of how sleepy little fish-smelly happy-clappy Stavanger, with its c\u00f8d and its g\u00f8d, became Norway\u2019s oil capital during the 60s and early 70s, and transformed.</p> <p>By focusing on three or four families, the makers have done a wise thing: portrayed, distilled and lucidly, the great changes then afoot. More crucially, they have given us a Scandi tale that did not open with a spreadeagled body, but a spreadsheet. The political misunderstandings between US oil companies, rampant in their belief that \u201csocialism\u201d meant Mao, and Norway, who thought it might better mean \u201csharing, nicely\u201d, are writ large, and young Anna, the sharp-as-a-tack typist played by Ellingsaeter and patronised by all, simply cleans up.</p> <p>It features wonderful old semi-modern phones, and technology, and motels, and attitudes. It shows how, but for oil, Norway, with its mutton farms and Jesus-love, might have taken a very different back route to the 21st century, almost up there with Albania.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3907305efb6152b1802a6a198c38da0db9fe495\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3907305efb6152b1802a6a198c38da0db9fe495/751_0_5551_3331/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marc Warren in the \u2018dire\u2019 remake of Van Der Valk.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marc Warren in the \u2018dire\u2019 remake of Van Der Valk.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The remake of <strong><a href=\"https://www.itv.com/hub/van-der-valk/2a7219\">Van Der Valk</a></strong> is dire. A happy weeknight with a lengthy criminal thriller\u2026 I was thinking with glee of <em>Endeavour</em>, <em>Lewis</em>, <em>Vera</em>, and yet, despite having valked all three <em>Van</em> <em>Der Valk</em>s, I just could not be troubled to keep up with any so-called plot, especially a two-hour 70s remake, notable in its first iteration only for its theme tune and for its being set in wow-that\u2019s-foreign!

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt\u2019s like building the plane while we\u2019re in the air.\u201d So said Rachel Anticoni, who happened to be director of operations of London\u2019s Royal Free hospital but could have been any one of the legion of struggling professionals coping as Covid-19 wriggled through their battlements, one weaselly, unconscionable cough at a time. One of the most telling things about the astonishing two nights of Hospital: Coronavirus Special was that barroom philosophers \u2013 remember them? \u2013 might have to cut back on their instant solutions: our NHS administrators were on this evidence every bit as harried, fraught and dedicated, with muck-sweats and trembles and slept-in hair, as the lads and lasses in the gowns. Not only building the plane, but having to invent cockpit radio and an air traffic control system while wildly hoping, somehow, that those on the ground were in step with some of their thoughts, or at least not using Betamax or Windows 10. We saw how the trickle became a flood \u2013 four chairs set aside for cases, then eight, and by the end of Monday night\u2019s outing four entire floors were quarantined, and the basement morgue beginning to overflow, and concrete being poured for new tanks to store frozen oxygen, some patients needing 15 litres of pure every minute. The Hospital series has always been about access, and for this special \u2013 filmed from the very first evening of lockdown, almost until peak nasty in the week around Easter \u2013 the levels granted were phenomenal in the circumstances: one got the distinct feeling that camera and sound operators were almost accepted as onside friends on the same parapet. Reality cannot perforce be scripted: the editing has to do the dramatic work of a script, and thus I wondered slightly whether the individual stories selected for transmission didn\u2019t skew us, if even very slightly, towards the happier outcomes. I think, overall, the makers balanced any requirement for drama with fairness to the statistics; for every Peter, going home joyous at 88 despite being touch-and-go throughout, there was a Stanley, kind soft eyes shining so hard when first told one morning his breathing had settled, yet so suddenly, on the spiral down. We even got a little backstory: Peter, far from being any anonymous geezer-statistic, had invented the mint chocolate liqueur! Had I had any alcoholic After Eight in the house, and more importantly been able to find my way to a cupboard through the litter of crumpled Kleenex, I would have raised a glass to him. An absolute standout chronicle of our times, sure to be looked back on with something approaching awe, and if nothing else it reminded us of the sheer inventiveness and adaptability of the human animal \u2013 and reminded us too of the true meaning of the word \u201cunprecedented\u201d, rather than its devalued employment to describe having to talk to your family or wipe your nethers with kitchen roll. We were a little short on wildly light relief this week, unless you count sudden blithering governmental mismanagement as a kind of kooky black comedy (\u201cthe team takes a nation\u2019s six weeks of vaulting goodwill in a crisis and wilfully decides to spin mixed messages\u2026 with hilarious consequences\u2026\u201d). I Know This Much Is True is a dour, bleak, harrowing adaptation of a dour, bleak etc novel, which showcases Mark Ruffalo, playing twins, one of whom is schizophrenic. It is more than saved from just being a vehicle for awards for Ruffalo \u2013 playing twins, so versatile! Mental illness, a shoo-in! \u2013 by being magnificently shot, and paced, amid the bony trees of Connecticut, and by Ruffalo being in fact a remarkably fine actor, and by featuring, amid all the cancer and hand-amputation and police violence, an intriguing Italian grandfather\u2019s manuscript and Juliette Lewis as the sexiest fruit-loop of an academic translator one might ever encounter, never mind in Connecticut. It is honestly, if slowly and grimly, beautiful and moreish. Dave, which started with a doubler last Sunday night and is all about a privileged white wannabe rapper, is actually genuinely funny at many stages, though the humour too often centres on cringing at gaucheness or, more simplistically, penis gags. Ho ho. Dave Burd, the star and creator, who raps in real life under the moniker Lil Dicky, plays a version of himself, which gets me a little fed up, it all having been done in Seinfeld, but also, I\u2019m getting a twitch fed up with grown men acting as tall toddlers, balls having dropped at least 15 years since yet still utterly unable to cope with women with brains. It is almost rescued by Burd\u2019s winning empathy towards both rich and poor, white and black. But that\u2019s a rather big \u201calmost\u201d. The Norwegian drama State of Happiness has been a wonderful find, as has its star Anne Regine Ellingsaeter. It\u2019s been gripping some of us over the last few Saturdays, and telling the tale of how sleepy little fish-smelly happy-clappy Stavanger, with its c\u00f8d and its g\u00f8d, became Norway\u2019s oil capital during the 60s and early 70s, and transformed. By focusing on three or four families, the makers have done a wise thing: portrayed, distilled and lucidly, the great changes then afoot. More crucially, they have given us a Scandi tale that did not open with a spreadeagled body, but a spreadsheet. The political misunderstandings between US oil companies, rampant in their belief that \u201csocialism\u201d meant Mao, and Norway, who thought it might better mean \u201csharing, nicely\u201d, are writ large, and young Anna, the sharp-as-a-tack typist played by Ellingsaeter and patronised by all, simply cleans up. It features wonderful old semi-modern phones, and technology, and motels, and attitudes. It shows how, but for oil, Norway, with its mutton farms and Jesus-love, might have taken a very different back route to the 21st century, almost up there with Albania. The remake of Van Der Valk is dire. A happy weeknight with a lengthy criminal thriller\u2026 I was thinking with glee of Endeavour, Lewis, Vera, and yet, despite having valked all three Van Der Valks, I just could not be troubled to keep up with any so-called plot, especially a two-hour 70s remake, notable in its first iteration only for its theme tune and for its being set in wow-that\u2019s-foreign! Amsterdam. I rewound, constantly, never a good sign, and muttered about tattoos and nuns and shitty shoddy writing, and the fact that VDV seems to have taken an entirely spurious dislike, for no discernible reason, to the bright spark in the pack. For evidence of Marc Warren\u2019s undoubted acting chops, see Flack, still the most underrated comedy-drama languishing on the W channel: but VDV is awful in that it combines loss of time with immense boredom. Similarly, Code 404 \u2013 a policeman has been rebuilt after his death, but as a slapsticky cretin \u2013 in which Daniel Mays and Stephen Graham do not have even a premise, unless it\u2019s that of proving how even charmingly great actors, without a script, are reduced to just making noises with their mouths.",

It\u2019s directed by Thomas Kail, who staged the musical, and according to Miranda gives \u201ceveryone the best seat in the house\u201d for a show that has been one of the most wanted on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"346fd190f76cbd1b38022b160a33388a98945d73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/346fd190f76cbd1b38022b160a33388a98945d73/0_153_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kika\u2019s Birthday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Delightful \u2026 Danyah Miller in Kika\u2019s Birthday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Other Richard/Richard Davenport</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Kika\u2019s Birthday</h2> <p>A kids\u2019 show that captures the magic of cookery, this tale of mice planning a birthday celebration under the nose of a watchful cat is delightfully told by Danyah Miller. The puppets are appealing in their ingenuity: not least the colander cat. This is a show to celebrate \u2013 and it\u2019s possibly the only time you\u2019ll be delighted to find a mouse peeping its nose out of a bag of flour. Available to watch from <a href=\"https://www.watfordpalacetheatre.co.uk/whats-on/digital/kikas-birthday/\">Watford Palace</a>, 15-29 May.

You\u2019ll have to supply the snacks yourself but this is a great chance to experience the bewitching 2017 production. The Gate\u2019s staging of Suzy Storck by Magali Mougel, directed by Jean-Pierre Baro, is also available. <a href=\"https://www.gatetheatre.co.uk/from-our-archive/\">Both can be streamed until 30 June</a>.</p> <h2>Caretaker</h2> <p>The Royal Court, like all UK theatres, is closed due to the lockdown. But you can visit it virtually in this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/11/the-royal-court-caretaker-theatre-coronavirus-lockdown\">intriguing installation</a> by Hester Chillingworth. The stage is still set for EV Crowe\u2019s play Shoe Lady, as seen from Chillingworth\u2019s static camera in the balcony. Occasionally it is cloaked in darkness and occasionally we hear messages of hope. Principally, the installation becomes a space to savour the importance of theatregoing until the Court invites audiences back to sit on those comfy leather chairs again.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49wZ43AwS1U\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/49wZ43AwS1U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>A Tiger\u2019s Tale</h2> <p>Mike Kenny is a master story-spinner and he makes magic from a real-life tale in this nifty show created for children aged four and over by Rochdale\u2019s touring theatre company M6. It\u2019s the story of Ma, Pa and Titch, a family of acrobats who are recruited for a circus act in Africa and return home with their own pet tiger, Ella. It\u2019s mild rather than wild, accompanied by gently jolly songs and some nimble tricks, and there\u2019s a splendid carriage contraption of a design. <a href=\"https://m6theatre.co.uk/latest/tt/\">Available until 24 May</a>.</p> <h2>Spymonkey</h2> <p>The anarchic physical theatre and comedy company are unlocking <a href=\"https://www.spymonkey.co.uk/news.html\">their vault</a> of inventive, irreverent shows with many becoming available each Sunday to be streamed for free.

Weigel played the part of the indomitable profiteer and matriarch more than 200 times in her career.</p> <h2>So It Goes</h2> <p>How do we talk about bereavement? It can be hard to find the words, as encapsulated in this bittersweet, dialogue-free fringe hit by the theatre company On the Run. Hannah Moss uses a mixture of mime, doodling and scribbling \u2013 performing with David Ralfe \u2013 to express her relationship with her father, Mike, and her grief following his death.

In this production, filmed at the marvellously atmospheric Bouffes du Nord in Paris in 2015, Peter Brook directs five Beckett shorts with a cast of three (Jos Houben, Marcello Magni and Kathryn Hunter). The production comprises Rough for Theatre I, Rockaby, Neither, Come and Go and Act Without Words II. Feel the rising panic and despair in Rockaby as the solitary, wide-eyed Hunter recounts a descent through long, lonely days.</p> <h2>Palermo Palermo</h2> <p>Even by Pina Bausch\u2019s standards it\u2019s an arresting opening: a huge wall collapses on stage and across the rubble comes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/mar/04/julie-shanahan-on-dancing-in-her-50s-and-life-beyond-pina-bausch\">Julie Shanahan</a>, in high heels and a floral frock. After desperately commanding hugs from two suitors, she takes a seat and is pelted with rotten tomatoes. And so begins an epic patchwork of masochistic rituals, nightmares and games, blending the quotidian with the phenomenal, all inspired by the choreographer\u2019s trip to Sicily.

Bausch\u2019s company memorably balanced apples on their heads in Palermo Palermo, but as Smashed is created by those juggling supremos <a href=\"http://www.gandinijuggling.com/\">Gandini</a>, the fruit is mostly in motion here. Their Bausch homage has the same childlike games, adult fantasy and bruised humour of the German choreographer\u2019s work. Smashed is crisp, fresh and full of flavour. You may never look at an apple in the same way again \u2026</p> <h2>Oscar Wilde season</h2> <p>All four productions in <a href=\"http://www.classicspring.co.uk/about-us\">Classic Spring</a>\u2019s starry Oscar Wilde season in the West End can be watched on the online service <a href=\"https://www.marquee.tv/\">Marquee TV,</a> which is offering a 14-day free trial.

Alternately rousing and yearning, this is a gorgeous hymn to barflies, precious memories and the joys of being a ghost, told with a dash of Edgar Allan Poe and Thelonious Monk.

It\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx2KDNusk9E\">online in full</a> and offers a raw account of adolescent anxiety, slut-shaming and self-belief. In-your-face theatre that stays in your mind.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaKYSUrHSfs\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZaKYSUrHSfs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>Le Patin Libre</h2> <p>Think dance on ice and you\u2019d imagine sequins and staggering TV celebrities, but the Canadian troupe, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaKYSUrHSfs\">Le Patin Libre</a>, has taken the art form into a new dimension. In their double bill, Vertical Influences, the skaters turned the rink into a mesmerising stage slowly decorated by the patterns cut by their blades.</p> <h2>John Leguizamo\u2019s Latin History for Morons</h2> <p>Self-isolation may mean that many of us will use living rooms to both teach children and watch theatre.

      "bodyText": "National Theatre at Home The National has risen to the occasion by unveiling a mighty lineup of some of its greatest NT Live hits, to be streamed online on Thursdays at 7pm and then available for seven days. Inua Ellams\u2019 acclaimed Barber Shop Chronicles, starring Fisayo Akinade, Hammed Animashaun and Cyril Nri, is available 14-21 May. Tennessee Williams\u2019 A Streetcar Named Desire, with Gillian Anderson as Blanche, filmed at the Young Vic in 2014, is on 21 May. The National\u2019s production of the political comedy This House by James Graham follows on 28 May. The Donmar Warehouse\u2019s 2013 staging of Coriolanus, starring Tom Hiddleston in the title role, is on 4 June. Anansi the Spider Re-Spun The Guardian has partnered with the Unicorn theatre to present a free digital theatre series inspired by its acclaimed 2019 production Anansi the Spider. Three tales about the mischievous folkloric webspinner, designed for audiences aged three to eight, will be streamed on Saturday mornings on the Guardian website and the Unicorn\u2019s YouTube channel. The episodes, which will then be available on demand for three weeks, reunite the original cast of the production, Afia Abusham, Juliet Okotie and Sapphire Joy, who filmed themselves performing in their homes. Starts on 30 May at 11am. Sea Wall \u201cShe had us, both of us, absolutely round her finger\u2026\u201d From that first line, Andrew Scott will have you hooked in this half-hour monologue by Simon Stephens that captures truths about family life, art, nature and much else besides. Scott performed the play at the Bush in 2008 and it was a hot ticket when he reprised it at the Old Vic 10 years later. This version was shot in a single take in 2011. Directed by Stephens and Andrew Porter, it has been available to rent online for years but is now free to watch on YouTube until 18 May. Brace yourself. I Wish I Was a Mountain With wonder, wit and sophisticated storytelling, performance poet Toby Thompson creates a beautiful show for over-sevens. Thompson steps in and out of his version of Hermann Hesse\u2019s fairytale Faldum, riffing with the young audience and spinning a handful of jazz LPs. I Wish I Was a Mountain embraces big questions about time and contentment. This is a short but profound show, directed by Lee Lyford, hatched by the Egg theatre\u2019s Incubator development programme and cleverly designed by Anisha Fields. Read the full review. Hamilton Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s phenomenal, Pulitzer prize-winning musical about the \u201c10-dollar founding father without a father\u201d was filmed in New York back in 2016 with the original Broadway cast. It was slated for a 2021 cinema release but has now been fast-tracked for release on the Disney+ streaming service on 3 July. It\u2019s directed by Thomas Kail, who staged the musical, and according to Miranda gives \u201ceveryone the best seat in the house\u201d for a show that has been one of the most wanted on both sides of the Atlantic. Kika\u2019s Birthday A kids\u2019 show that captures the magic of cookery, this tale of mice planning a birthday celebration under the nose of a watchful cat is delightfully told by Danyah Miller. The puppets are appealing in their ingenuity: not least the colander cat. This is a show to celebrate \u2013 and it\u2019s possibly the only time you\u2019ll be delighted to find a mouse peeping its nose out of a bag of flour. Available to watch from Watford Palace, 15-29 May. On 21 May, Miller is giving a special 45-minute performance of Meet Pippi Longstocking and she has a series of other events online. The Unknown Island For her opening production as the Gate\u2019s artistic director, Ellen McDougall staged an intimate, hour-long adaptation of a Jos\u00e9 Saramago short story, which famously saw the cast sharing bread, olives and wine with the audience. You\u2019ll have to supply the snacks yourself but this is a great chance to experience the bewitching 2017 production. The Gate\u2019s staging of Suzy Storck by Magali Mougel, directed by Jean-Pierre Baro, is also available. Both can be streamed until 30 June. Caretaker The Royal Court, like all UK theatres, is closed due to the lockdown. But you can visit it virtually in this intriguing installation by Hester Chillingworth. The stage is still set for EV Crowe\u2019s play Shoe Lady, as seen from Chillingworth\u2019s static camera in the balcony. Occasionally it is cloaked in darkness and occasionally we hear messages of hope. Principally, the installation becomes a space to savour the importance of theatregoing until the Court invites audiences back to sit on those comfy leather chairs again. A Tiger\u2019s Tale Mike Kenny is a master story-spinner and he makes magic from a real-life tale in this nifty show created for children aged four and over by Rochdale\u2019s touring theatre company M6. It\u2019s the story of Ma, Pa and Titch, a family of acrobats who are recruited for a circus act in Africa and return home with their own pet tiger, Ella. It\u2019s mild rather than wild, accompanied by gently jolly songs and some nimble tricks, and there\u2019s a splendid carriage contraption of a design. Available until 24 May. Spymonkey The anarchic physical theatre and comedy company are unlocking their vault of inventive, irreverent shows with many becoming available each Sunday to be streamed for free. Highlights include, from 31 May, The Complete Deaths, a dazzling procession of 75 death scenes from Shakespeare, and from 21 June, the Feydeau farce Every Last Trick. Mother Courage Achtung! Here\u2019s an unmissable opportunity to catch a piece of German theatre history (though without English subtitles). The Berliner Ensemble is streaming a different production each week for its BE at Home programme, and from 15-22 May you can see Brecht\u2019s classic play about the 30 years war in Europe. Legendary actor Helene Weigel, Brecht\u2019s wife, plays the title role. Weigel played the part of the indomitable profiteer and matriarch more than 200 times in her career. So It Goes How do we talk about bereavement? It can be hard to find the words, as encapsulated in this bittersweet, dialogue-free fringe hit by the theatre company On the Run. Hannah Moss uses a mixture of mime, doodling and scribbling \u2013 performing with David Ralfe \u2013 to express her relationship with her father, Mike, and her grief following his death. It\u2019s available to stream for a suggested donation of \u00a33 with 50% of all proceeds donated to Marie Curie Hospice Hampstead, which cared for Mike. Online until 29 May. The Encounter Complicit\u00e9\u2019s sonic adventure uses binaural technology to take you into the Amazonian jungle, into the mind of an American photographer, Loren McIntyre, and in and out of the life of creator and performer Simon McBurney. A recording from the Barbican is available for free from 15-22 May. Don\u2019t forget your headphones! There\u2019s also a live discussion on 20 May with McBurney. A Doll\u2019s House Available for one day only, from 2.30pm until midnight on 20 May, this is Tanika Gupta\u2019s widely admired relocation of Ibsen\u2019s classic to 1879 Calcutta, staged by the Lyric Hammersmith\u2019s new artistic director, Rachel O\u2019Riordan, in 2019. Nora becomes Niru, played by Anjana Vasan in what Michael Billington called a \u201ccareer-defining performance\u201d. On YouTube. Lyric Theatre in Belfast Belfast\u2019s Lyric had to cancel its co-production of 1984 with Bruiser theatre company but instead launched the initiative New Speak: Re-imagined, in which Northern Irish talents including Amadan Ensemble, Dominic Montague and Katie Richardson respond to the lockdown crisis. They are being released in episodes on YouTube. The Lyric is also streaming archive productions. On 22 May it\u2019s the 2015 musical Little Red Riding Hood written by Derek O\u2019Connor. Manchester International festival MIF has an ongoing online programme featuring new shows, archive productions and artist talks. On 22 May, there will be a new online version of the 2017 immersive experience Party Skills for the End of the World, created by Nigel Barrett and Louise Mari from the performance collective Shunt. Latest lineup details. Mountview Live \u2013 Giles Terera Meets \u2026 This isn\u2019t live drama, but should be essential viewing for theatre lovers and students as the Olivier award-winning actor Giles Terera talks to top names from the industry. The hour-long conversations on YouTube include questions from Mountview Academy of Theatre students. Guests include the fabulous Noma Dumezweni, who is a Mountview honorary doctorate, and Lin-Manuel Miranda. Expect some nuanced questions for that one: Terera is best known for his knockout performance as Aaron Burr in Hamilton. The Midnight Gang Here\u2019s one nurse you wouldn\u2019t clap for: equal parts Miss Trunchbull and Miss Hannigan, the monstrous Matron in The Midnight Gang wants the \u201clittle stinkers\u201d on her children\u2019s ward to pass out with fear. Played with swagger and wicked disdain by Jennie Dale, she is a brilliantly hissable villain in Chichester Festival theatre\u2019s funny, touching and spirited musical version of David Walliams\u2019 bestseller. It not only urges you to be kind while confined but also to beat boredom with the instruction: \u201cDo a bit of pretending and your dreams come true.\u201d Available for free until 29 May. Read the full review. Sadler\u2019s Wells The London dance powerhouse is presenting an online programme, Digital Stage, offering Friday night performances on Facebook that remain available for a week. On 15 May, it\u2019s a classic from Cloud Gate Dance Theatre: Moon Water, set to Bach\u2019s Suites for Solo Cello and staged with spellbinding reflections, offers meditative movement to still the mind in tumultuous times. On 22 May there is a new version of the dance-for-camera installation TOM, created by Wilkie Branson, and on 29 May you can see fashion designer Hussein Chalayan\u2019s first theatrical work, Gravity Fatigue. Midnight Your Time The Donmar Warehouse\u2019s first online premiere finds Diana Quick returning to a role that she played in 2011, as a lawyer communicating long-distance from her Islington home to her daughter in Palestine. Written for Quick by Adam Brace, it\u2019s directed again by Michael Longhurst who says its \u201cprescient presentation of a then burgeoning method of digital communication is so entirely a part of our lives under lockdown; and its commentary on ageing and isolation resonate even more profoundly at this time.\u201d On YouTube until 20 May. Read the full review. The Place London\u2019s essential contemporary dance hub is celebrating its 50th birthday this year. Just as some of its dance classes have gone online, so has its performance programme. On Thursdays, the Place is streaming past productions.

Offerings include the \u201cfantastically witty\u201d Wasted, a rock musical about the Bront\u00ebs, directed by Adam Lenson with music by Christopher Ash and book and lyrics by Carl Miller. There\u2019s also a Twelfth Night relocated to a music festival, directed by Anna Girvan, and Jesse Briton\u2019s Bound, about a maritime tragedy.

It Is Easy to Be Dead The Finborough\u2019s tribute to the first world war poet Charles Hamilton Sorley was nominated for an Olivier award, transferred to the West End and toured, and received a five-star review in the Guardian. Neil McPherson\u2019s script draws on Sorley\u2019s letters and poems, and there is music from from composers of the period including George Butterworth and Ralph Vaughan Williams. It\u2019s available until 7 July for free although the theatre welcomes donations as \u201cwe fall between the cracks of government and local authority support\u201d. Read the full review. Dear Ireland The Abbey, Ireland\u2019s national theatre, assembled an extraordinary lineup of 50 actors and 50 writers for this series of rapid-response monologues about the coronavirus crisis, self-taped by the performers from isolation. The writers include Frank McGuinness, Iseult Golden, Stacey Gregg, Sarah Hanly, Nancy Harris, Enda Walsh and David Ireland; the cast includes Nicola Coughlan, Caoilfhionn Dunne, Denise Gough, Br\u00edd N\u00ed Neachtain and Brendan Gleeson. to a simple, rock\u2019n\u2019roll \u2026 song It may hail the alligator and watusi dance crazes of the 60s but music from Patti Smith\u2019s blistering 1975 album, Horses, drives some of Michael Clark\u2019s most deliriously thrilling modern choreography in the first act of this 2017 Barbican production now on BBC iPlayer. These moves are as arresting as any guitar riff, matching Smith\u2019s cantering repetition and a blizzard of trippy visuals from Charles Atlas. The second act celebrates Erik Satie and the third pays tribute to David Bowie. Schaub\u00fchne The Berlin powerhouse, run by Thomas Ostermeier, is streaming a selection of archive productions, many with English subtitles, and often for one night only. It\u2019s a rare opportunity for UK audiences to see works directed by Luc Bondy, Peter Falk and Ostermeier himself. This month\u2019s lineup.

This is Not My Hat The Little Angel theatre is streaming charming versions of three Jon Klassen picturebooks, directed and performed by Ian Nicholson, with characterful puppets made by Sam Wilde. I Want My Hat Back found an otherwise polite bear taking revenge on a bad bunny who has pinched his pointy red hat \u2013 it\u2019s eight and a half minutes of pure joy. The sequel, also staged on top of a wooden dresser and told with music by Jim Whitcher, is a kind of Grand Theft Aqua in which a tiddler has stolen a handsome green bowler from a much bigger fish who reclaims it while enjoying a snack. Just as mischievously macabre as the original book. Another sequel, We Found a Hat, will be online from 24 May. All three films will be online until 7 June. What the Butler Saw Joe Orton\u2019s final farce, completed in the summer of 1967 just before the playwright\u2019s death, is a subversive satire about an irrational world, set in a psychiatrist\u2019s consulting room.

An attractive introduction to ballet\u2019s magic. Read the full review. The Swan Birmingham Royal Ballet\u2019s new director Carlos Acosta has reworked The Dying Swan (originally choreographed by Mikhail Fokine for Anna Pavlova), and BRB principal dancer C\u00e9line Gittens performs the piece from her living room to yours. Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns\u2019s Le Cygne, from Le Carnaval des Animaux, is performed by pianist Jonathan Higgins and cellist Antonio Novais. \u201cThis is a dance of promises,\u201d says Acosta. Fleabag You\u2019ve watched both TV series. You\u2019ve read the scripts. Maybe you\u2019ve even seen the stage show more than once. But you\u2019ll probably still be streaming Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s performance of her wildly successful monologue, recorded at Wyndham\u2019s theatre in London where it sold out last summer. Fleabag is available to stream on Soho theatre\u2019s On Demand site and on Amazon Prime. All proceeds will go towards charities including the National Emergencies Trust, NHS Charities Together and Acting for Others, which provides support to all theatre workers in times of need. Shakespeare\u2019s Globe Itching to get back into that wooden O on the South Bank? Happily, the Globe Player has heaps of full productions to rent, including international productions from the 2012 Globe to Globe festival such as a Lithuanian Hamlet, a Turkish Antony and Cleopatra, a Japanese Coriolanus and an Armenian King John. There is also the candlelit Sam Wanamaker Playhouse\u2019s opening production, The Duchess of Malfi, starring Gemma Arterton. On the Globe\u2019s YouTube channel, a series of free streams, each available for a fortnight, continues with The Two Noble Kinsmen (2018), The Winter\u2019s Tale (2018) and The Merry Wives of Windsor (2019). Mushy: Lyrically Speaking Musharaf Asghar became a reality TV star in 2013 when the schoolboy appeared on Educating Yorkshire, which documented how a teacher helped him with his lifelong speech impediment. Asghar\u2019s tale is now the subject of a new British musical, co-produced by Rifco theatre company and Watford Palace theatre and staged last year. It\u2019s online and free to view for the entire isolation period. Read the full review. Imitating the Dog The groundbreaking theatre company Imitating the Dog were midway through touring Night of the Living Dead \u2013 Remix when theatres shut down. Now, they are streaming this ambitious show in which a cast of actors remake George Romero\u2019s classic horror film shot by shot in real time. The company have also opened up their archive to stream a selection of creations from the last 20 years. Works will be released every fortnight and are available to watch on a pay-what-you-like basis. The Beast Will Rise Philip Ridley\u2019s new play The Beast of Blue Yonder was due to open at the Southwark Playhouse in London in April.

Further online world premieres from Ridley will follow each week. Read the full review. Belarus Free Theatre The internet has been vital to the success of Belarus Free Theatre, one of Europe\u2019s most essential theatre companies, which is forced to operate underground in its restrictive home country after the government banned it on political grounds. They have long rehearsed and created new productions over Skype. Now, the company \u2013 which turns 15 this year \u2013 is streaming 24 of its shows throughout May and June. English subtitles are available for those productions in Russian and Belarusian and each show will be available online for 24 hours. A cast of actors including Samuel West and Stephen Fry will also be reading excerpts from their favourite fairytales in BFT\u2019s new online series. Now I\u2019m Fine What better time is there to watch a \u201cgrand-scale experimental pop opera about keeping it together\u201d? Ahamefule J Oluo\u2019s innovative show, staged at Seattle\u2019s Moore theatre in 2014, mixes standup-style routines with a mesmerising musical accompaniment and explores his experience of a rare autoimmune disease. It is one of many films, including Americana Kamikaze, that are available to stream from On the Boards. Read the full review. Five Encounters on a Site Called Craigslist With the help of a carrot, a sponge, the Miracles and some game audience members, Sam is going to tell you about five hook-ups he had through the casual encounters section of online classified-ads board Craigslist. Filmed at the Push festival in Home, Manchester, YESYESNONO\u2019s production is an open, affecting and troubling look at searching for intimacy and connection. This hour will leave you reencountering your own life. I, Cinna The outbreak of homeschooling caused by the coronavirus has found many of us playing the role of teacher while still in our dressing gowns. And here\u2019s one unexpected tutor who really commands your attention: Jude Owusu, clad in a dirty bathrobe, with a pen behind his ear and a notepad dangling around his neck. Owusu is Cinna, the poet from Julius Caesar, in this spellbinding film of Tim Crouch\u2019s monologue, part of his series magnifying the experiences of minor characters from Shakespeare. Read the full review. Cyprus Avenue On Friday 27 March, to mark World Theatre Day, the Royal Court released an online version of David Ireland\u2019s blistering play Cyprus Avenue, starring Stephen Rea as a Belfast loyalist who is convinced his baby granddaughter is Gerry Adams. The film mixes the drama shot at the Royal Court with location scenes of Belfast. Alonzo King Lines Ballet A handful of productions by San Francisco-based choreographer Alonzo King and his marvellous company Lines Ballet are available to rent on Marquee.tv. Dust and Light, Triangle of the Squinches and Scheherazade, all filmed in 2012, showcase the elegant nature of his work, which pushes beyond classical ballet. There\u2019s also a short documentary dipping into his background as the son of a prominent civil rights activist. Read the full review. Boys Don\u2019t The Cure\u2019s Robert Smith tried to laugh about it, cover it all up with lies, because \u2013 all together now \u2013 boys don\u2019t cry. A powerful piece of rhyme-packed storytelling for the over-eights, Boys Don\u2019t is delivered by four compelling performers and based on real-life experiences of the expectations placed on \u201clittle men\u201d throughout the generations before they even get to the playground. Presented by Half Moon theatre, it\u2019s a Papertale production in association with Apples and Snakes, staged at Brighton festival in 2018. Funny Girl Showtunes don\u2019t get much more defiant or rousing than Don\u2019t Rain on My Parade. Sheridan Smith wards off the clouds with a gritty rendition as Fanny Bryce in this production of the classic musical at Manchester\u2019s Palace theatre in 2017. It\u2019s one of the many productions available from Digital Theatre, whose offerings also include The Crucible starring Richard Armitage at the Old Vic in London, and Maxine Peake\u2019s Hamlet at the Royal Exchange in Manchester. Fragments (Beckett by Brook) Is there a more fitting playwright for our current moment of isolation, uncertainty and endurance than Beckett? In this production, filmed at the marvellously atmospheric Bouffes du Nord in Paris in 2015, Peter Brook directs five Beckett shorts with a cast of three (Jos Houben, Marcello Magni and Kathryn Hunter). The production comprises Rough for Theatre I, Rockaby, Neither, Come and Go and Act Without Words II. Feel the rising panic and despair in Rockaby as the solitary, wide-eyed Hunter recounts a descent through long, lonely days. Palermo Palermo Even by Pina Bausch\u2019s standards it\u2019s an arresting opening: a huge wall collapses on stage and across the rubble comes Julie Shanahan, in high heels and a floral frock. After desperately commanding hugs from two suitors, she takes a seat and is pelted with rotten tomatoes. And so begins an epic patchwork of masochistic rituals, nightmares and games, blending the quotidian with the phenomenal, all inspired by the choreographer\u2019s trip to Sicily. A rare chance to watch one of Bausch\u2019s creations in full and for free online. Smashed At first sight they could be Pina Bausch\u2019s dancers: a procession of performers wearing smart suits and enigmatic smiles, gliding across a stage filled with apples. Bausch\u2019s company memorably balanced apples on their heads in Palermo Palermo, but as Smashed is created by those juggling supremos Gandini, the fruit is mostly in motion here. Their Bausch homage has the same childlike games, adult fantasy and bruised humour of the German choreographer\u2019s work. Smashed is crisp, fresh and full of flavour. You may never look at an apple in the same way again \u2026 Oscar Wilde season All four productions in Classic Spring\u2019s starry Oscar Wilde season in the West End can be watched on the online service Marquee TV, which is offering a 14-day free trial. Edward and Freddie Fox play father and son in An Ideal Husband; Eve Best is a memorable Mrs Arbuthnot in A Woman of No Importance; Kathy Burke directs Lady Windermere\u2019s Fan; and Sophie Thompson is horrified by theatre\u2019s most famous handbag in The Importance of Being Earnest. Original Theatre Company This touring company had to cut short its productions of Alan Bennett\u2019s The Habit of Art, about WH Auden and Benjamin Britten, and Ali Milles\u2019s The Croft, which intertwines the lives of women over time on a Scottish Highland outpost. Both were filmed on their final performances to empty auditoriums and are available to rent online. Gwen Taylor stars in The Croft and Matthew Kelly is in The Habit of Art. Ghost Quartet If you missed its run at Soho\u2019s new Boulevard theatre, here\u2019s a chance to savour Dave Malloy\u2019s song cycle, filmed in New York in 2015. Alternately rousing and yearning, this is a gorgeous hymn to barflies, precious memories and the joys of being a ghost, told with a dash of Edgar Allan Poe and Thelonious Monk. It\u2019s a glorious get-together of a show, as warming as the whiskey handed out to the audience \u2013 but you\u2019ll have to pour your own. Key Change Open Clasp is a women\u2019s theatre company aiming to \u201cchange the world, one play at a time\u201d. Key Change, now available to stream online, is a fantastic introduction to their consistently impressive work with women who are on the margins of society; in this case, prisoners at HM Prison Low Newton, who devised the 2015 show with the theatre group over several months in order to break down stigma and enlighten audiences. It was filmed in partnership with The Space. Crossings Rural touring company Pentabus are releasing shows from their archive every Friday over a period of three months. Deirdre Kinahan\u2019s play Crossings is, according to our critic Arifa Akbar, \u201can unexpected and touching drama about unlikely friendships, postwar homosexuality and the cost of war for women\u201d. Read the full review. Snow Mouse You have to hunt to find full theatre productions for very young audiences online, so here\u2019s a little treat. To mark World Day of Theatre for Children on 20 March the lovely Egg in Bath released their wintry 40-minute tale for the under-fours. The Show Must Go Online The actor Robert Myles has set up a live-streamed reading group for professional and amateur actors to perform Shakespeare\u2019s complete plays in the order they\u2019re believed to have been written. The Guardian\u2019s very own Stephen Moss took on the role of the Duke of Burgundy in Henry VI Part I. Peeping Tom trilogy The brilliant Belgian dance-theatre company turned 20 this year and are best known in the UK for performing at London international mime festival and for their trilogy comprising Mother, Father and Child. Their brand of domestic terror, hope and ennui will strike a chord at this troubling time. Watch their first trilogy (Le Jardin, Le Salon and Le Sous Sol) online. The School for Wives Travel restrictions needn\u2019t prevent you from enjoying international theatre online. Paris\u2019s esteemed Od\u00e9on has released its 2018 production of Moli\u00e8re\u2019s satirical 1662 comedy of manners and cuckoldry. Claude Duparfait stars as the foolish Arnolphe, and St\u00e9phane Braunschweig directs. English subtitles available, \u00e9videmment. Read the full review. Showstopper! The Improvised Musical After more than 1,000 productions, the Showstoppers improv crew are some of the quickest wits in the biz. So it\u2019s no surprise that when they were faced with a West End closure they live-streamed a performance. Watch their custom-made, never-to-be-repeated impro musical on Facebook. Since U Been Gone Teddy Lamb was due to present a Trans Take Over at London\u2019s Bunker theatre as part of its now suspended Power Share season. So they have uploaded a version of their musical fringe hit about losing loved ones and finding your own voice. 5 Soldiers Rosie Kay\u2019s extraordinary 5 Soldiers: The Body Is the Frontline was staged in army drill halls around the UK, but, since its livestream is still available online, you can watch it from the comfort of your own sofa. Performing in close quarters to a score that mixes punk and opera, Kay\u2019s phenomenal company bring home the horror of combat and disarm audiences. The Wind in the Willows Julian Fellowes, George Stiles and Anthony Drewe teamed up to deliver a merry new version of Kenneth Grahame\u2019s classic, staged at the London Palladium in 2017, with Rufus Hound wearing 50 shades of green as Mr Toad. It\u2019s available to rent online, with the option to donate to help provide financial and emotional support to theatre workers. Girls Like That London\u2019s Unicorn theatre has a world-class reputation for theatre for young audiences and its production of Evan Placey\u2019s Girls Like That gripped the roomful of teenagers I watched it with in 2014. It\u2019s online in full and offers a raw account of adolescent anxiety, slut-shaming and self-belief. In-your-face theatre that stays in your mind. Le Patin Libre Think dance on ice and you\u2019d imagine sequins and staggering TV celebrities, but the Canadian troupe, Le Patin Libre, has taken the art form into a new dimension. In their double bill, Vertical Influences, the skaters turned the rink into a mesmerising stage slowly decorated by the patterns cut by their blades. John Leguizamo\u2019s Latin History for Morons Self-isolation may mean that many of us will use living rooms to both teach children and watch theatre. An opportunity to combine the two can be found courtesy of the super-charismatic John Leguizamo \u2013 an inspirational tutor if ever there was \u2013 whose one-man Broadway show, Latin History for Morons, is on Netflix. Woke LIVR is a subscription service that enables you to catch up on theatre in 360-degree virtual reality. Pop your smartphone into the headset they send you and experience a range of shows including Apphia Campbell\u2019s Fringe First award-winning show Woke, which interweaves the stories of Black Panther Assata Shakur and the 2014 Ferguson riots. Timpson: The Musical Two households, both alike in dignity \u2026 well, sort of. Our narrator, a talking portrait, lays our scene in Victorian London, and this musical comedy imagines the founding of the popular shoe-repair chain as a union between two companies, the Montashoes and the Keypulets. Watch Gigglemug Theatre\u2019s show on YouTube. My Left Nut This is cheating as it\u2019s a TV series, but BBC Three\u2019s superb comedy drama is based on one of the most uproarious and affecting fringe theatre shows of recent years. It\u2019s based on Michael Patrick\u2019s own teenage experience of a medical condition that left his testicle \u201cso big you could play it like a bongo\u201d. Wince. Rosas Danst Rosas Love dance? Need to exercise at home? Then join the queen of Belgian avant-garde performance Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker as she talks you through how to perform her 1983 classic, Rosas Danst Rosas.

      "bodyText": "Health workers in the US may be exposing themselves to dangerous chemicals by disinfecting and reusing their protective equipment, experts have warned. Hospitals and other facilities have dealt with an extreme shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 masks, gloves and gowns, by reusing equipment that would usually be discarded after use. A range of practices to decontaminate equipment have been adopted, from storing equipment in paper bags for days, to using UV light and chemical disinfectants. At Saint Catherine of Siena medical center, a hospital on Long Island, New York, healthcare workers reported spraying their reusable gowns with Virex II 256, a highly potent cleaner marketed for \u201chard, inanimate, nonporous surfaces\u201d such as floors and walls. In Colorado, health workers said they had been wiping down their face shields so frequently with the disinfectant CaviWipes that they became opaque. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers guidance for healthcare practitioners reusing PPE when there is a severe shortage, including potentially reusing cloth isolation gowns without laundering them and cleaning face shields with federally registered hospital disinfectants. But Virex, CaviWipes and most products included on the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s list of disinfectants for use against coronavirus have active ingredients that belong to a class of chemicals known as quaternary ammonium compounds, which release formaldehyde. Studies have shown these compounds can cause asthma, fertility issues and birth defects, and irritate the skin, eyes and lungs.

      "body": "<p>The current crisis has revealed a sobering truth: the global economic shutdown, which has been achieved at a devastating social cost, has barely dented our carbon emissions. The latest analysis, by the International Energy Agency (IEA), expects this year\u2019s annual emissions <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-2020\">to be down by just 6-8%</a>. Such a small drop in emissions would have no measurable effect on the world\u2019s carbon concentration, or its warming potential. Indeed, 2020 is currently on track to be the hottest year ever recorded.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d need about a 10% drop to have a noticeable effect on the rising CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, but even then concentrations would still be rising,\u201d says Richard Betts, head of climate impacts at the Met Office. \u201cThe rate of rise of CO<sub>2</sub> varies from year to year anyway, as the natural carbon sinks get stronger and weaker because of natural processes, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/05/what-is-el-nino\">El Ni\u00f1o</a>.\u201d During an El Ni\u00f1o event, tropical forests don\u2019t take up as much carbon, so the atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> rises a bit faster. And in La Ni\u00f1a, the opposite occurs. \u201cThat effect is probably more important than the small drop in emissions we\u2019re seeing now.\u201d</p> <p>Considering that emissions have to fall by at least <a href=\"https://www.unenvironment.org/interactive/emissions-gap-report/2019/\">7.6% </a><em><a href=\"https://www.unenvironment.org/interactive/emissions-gap-report/2019/\">every year</a></em><a href=\"https://www.unenvironment.org/interactive/emissions-gap-report/2019/\"> to 2050</a> in order to keep global warming below 1.5C (above pre-industrial levels), this internationally agreed target now feels alarmingly unachievable.</p> <p>\u201cIt shows that the challenge of avoiding dangerous climate change and getting to zero emissions is unbelievably hard,\u201d says Simon Evans of climate science website Carbon Brief. \u201cEven something which seems to be having seismic implications for the global economy, at least in the short term, like the current crisis, is something of a drop in the ocean compared to that challenge.\u201d</p> <p>And yet, the cleaner air, burgeoning urban wildlife, and our sudden, dramatic shift to a less carbon-intensive lifestyle reveal the scope of what we can achieve in just days. This is something to cling to as we navigate the twin storms of Covid-19 and climate. We know that the climate crisis will not wait for a more convenient time; we must deal with it and the pandemic crisis concurrently. It is, however, the killer disease that has provoked the strong and urgent response. Governments have been forced to step in and deal with the catastrophe in a way that is unprecedented, including supporting business and industry, and public and private infrastructure.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Individual action \u2013 driving your car less, attending a meeting via Zoom, not taking a flight \u2013 is not going to be enough</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Across the world, government has never been bigger. Many experts argue that this provides us with a huge opportunity to also deal with the other crisis: to make a transformational leap towards a sustainable society that enables us to keep the world below dangerous warming. How we respond to this unique opportunity could set our climate trajectory for thousands of years to come.</p> <p>These behavioural changes we\u2019ve experienced \u2013 some of which may become ingrained permanently, meaning travel and consumption patterns become more responsible \u2013 are helpful in reducing pollution, just as hand-washing helps in the pandemic. But what the expected 8% emissions reduction figure shows us is that individual action \u2013 driving your car less, attending a meeting via Zoom rather than taking a business flight \u2013 is not going to be enough. Equally, it shows that moving to a no-growth economy is not the answer, as some have argued. Instead, systemic transformative action is required at international and state level to get the effective reductions in atmospheric carbon that will bring us to net zero.</p> <p>\u201cIt means we can\u2019t be fiddling around the edges,\u201d says Betts. \u201cIf we are going to have a substantial impact on long-term CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, we need huge, lasting changes in energy systems and other things that rely on fossil fuels.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s worth noting that the IEA analysis was based on the expectation that human activity will return to some approximation of \u201cnormal\u201d within months, so the shutdown period itself is likely to produce a far steeper drop in emissions \u2013<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-pandemic-leading-to-huge-drop-in-air-pollution\"> CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in China fell</a> by an estimated 25% during its February lockdown, for example. India, meanwhile, recorded its <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-indias-co2-emissions-fall-for-first-time-in-four-decades-amid-coronavirus\">first ever annual emissions fall</a> for the year ending March, and is expected to show a 30% drop in emissions for the month of April. \u201cBut what we\u2019re seeing at the moment is, for the most part, very temporary,\u201d Evans says. \u201cWhen we drive again, the car still burns petrol.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"883cee7b3a6af15294c907ea353649da73e41560\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/883cee7b3a6af15294c907ea353649da73e41560/0_178_5322_3192/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Empty motorways near Sydney in April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Empty motorways near Sydney in April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead, structural change could mean people swapping their combustion engines for electric vehicles. More fundamentally, Evans says, \u201cit would involve reimagining the way our cities are built and organised, so that going without a car becomes easier, through how roads are laid out, and how provision for walking and cycling and public transport is changed.\u201d</p> <p>All of those things go far beyond the individual choices we make in our everyday lives. \u201cOur choices are bounded by society,\u201d Evans says, \u201cso a shift towards a low-carbon society can\u2019t happen via individual action alone.\u201d</p> <p>Cities have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/01/city-leaders-aim-to-shape-green-recovery-from-coronavirus-crisis?CMP=share_btn_tw\">leading this transition</a> with innovative buildings and infrastructure projects. Some are already banning cars and trucks as a temporary measure. Others are going further: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/milan-seeks-to-prevent-post-crisis-return-of-traffic-pollution\">Milan is reallocating 35km of street space to cyclists and pedestrians</a>; Brussels is creating 40km of new cycle paths; and France is tempting cyclists out with subsidies. In the UK the government has announced a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/2-billion-package-to-create-new-era-for-cycling-and-walking\">\u00a32bn infrastructure scheme</a> to encourage more walking and cycling and the mayor of London has unveiled measures to create <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/15/transport-for-london-faces-3bn-funding-gap-despite-16bn-bailout-income-journeys-coronavirus\">car free bridges and streets</a>. Many cities are exploring some form of a circular economy, in which waste is minimised with resources kept in use as long as possible through recycling and reuse.</p> <p>The economist Kate Raworth says: \u201cWe live in a world that is complex, deeply interconnected, and human health and planetary health are woven into one. So governments need frameworks and ways of thinking that can hold that complexity \u2013 that can think about climate and health and jobs and financial stability and inequality in one space.\u201d </p> <p>For instance, quite apart from the pleasure of experiencing cleaner air, the coronavirus pandemic has revealed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/07/air-pollution-linked-to-far-higher-covid-19-death-rates-study-finds\">how deadly pollution is</a>. One recent study found that a tiny increase in particulates was associated with a 15% increase in the Covid-19 death rate, almost certainly contributing to the terrible rates seen in cities. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy\">Italy</a>, the high death rates seen in the north of the country correlate with the highest levels of air pollution. Reducing air pollution would lower the general health burden and may also help prevent future pandemics from being so deadly.</p> <p>\u201cWe have created a framework, which invites a place to answer: how can our cities be home to thriving people in this thriving place, while respecting the wellbeing of all people and the health of the planet?\u201d Raworth says. She is working with the city of Amsterdam to apply her \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/amsterdam-doughnut-model-mend-post-coronavirus-economy\">doughnut\u201d model</a> of a socially and environmentally sustainable economy to the Dutch capital\u2019s post-pandemic recovery.</p> <p>The Amsterdam project, like many others, predates Covid-19. Momentum for environmental protection has been building over the past few years, and it may be that this crisis proves a tipping point in public consciousness, leading to a meaningful shift in policy. For one thing, the pandemic has shown us how valuable expertise is, and now we\u2019re all au fait with the role of infectious disease modellers in guiding public health policy, it should help us appreciate the role climate modellers could play in guiding economic policy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a204deca14fd9e271a88c88f9233eb2c2b70819a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a204deca14fd9e271a88c88f9233eb2c2b70819a/0_450_6720_4030/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A stray cat has Taksim metro station, Istanbul, to itself.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A stray cat has Taksim metro station, Istanbul, to itself.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cJust as we have seen that early action to deter the spread of the virus was far more effective than trying to contain the damage after the virus already spread, transforming our energy system now to prevent the spread of excessive heat over our planet will be far more effective than trying to adapt to the consequences of this excessive heat later,\u201d says Ken Caldeira at the Carnegie Institution for Science, which is based in Washington DC.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Government is not there just to fix the same system, but to shape the kind of economy and society we want to live in</p> <footer> <cite>Mariana Mazzucato</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>City initiatives can only go so far. Ultimately, this is the time for governments to forge a new relationship with the private sector, to produce a sustainable economy. As industry, businesses and individuals plead for state aid, government has never been in a stronger position to push a sustainable agenda, and it\u2019s vital this is not squandered on kneejerk bailouts. We\u2019ve already seen the US and UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/16/bank-of-england-failing-climate-with-covid-19-stimulus-programme-oil-firms-debt-bond-governor\">bailing out oil giants</a>, and the UK giving supermarket giant Tesco a business rates holiday, only for it to pay a dividend to shareholders. \u201cWhat the government should be doing is thinking about the interest of the public that it represents, that it was elected for, and not simply giving out money that benefits private interest,\u201d says economist Mariana Mazzucato at University College London. \u201cThis is not about helping business make money. It\u2019s about giving them that cashflow to survive, but also helping them transform themselves to be a more functioning part of society,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThe government will never have the negotiating hand it has now. There\u2019s trillions being poured into the economy, given the tragedy. So, this can be used as a way to make sure that the \u201cpublic private partnerships\u201d actually become a symbiotic mutualistic partnership, not a parasitic one, as we\u2019ve had in the health sector for a long time,\u201d Mazzucato says.</p> <p>Governments, she says, must take the long view and use stimulus packages to actively mould a cleaner economy, something that South Korea has pledged, for instance. \u201cGovernment on its own cannot solve climate change, or create an equitable production system. It needs the private sector, and the private sector needs the public sector.\u201d</p> <p>Mazzucato and others argue that there\u2019s a danger otherwise that we will repeat the mistakes that were made in the aftermath of the 2008/9 financial crisis (during which emissions also fell), by not attaching conditions to the bailouts. \u201cGoldman Sachs was back making record profits after it was given a $10bn bailout,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bd89f84a842349320f2b180f51ea888580716421\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd89f84a842349320f2b180f51ea888580716421/0_2_6595_3955/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grounded planes at Schiphol airport, the Netherlands.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grounded planes at Schiphol airport, the Netherlands.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robin Utrecht/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe need to learn that government is not there just to do bailouts to fix the same system, but to really co-create \u2013 to shape the kind of economy and society we want to live in. We know that\u2019s not a fossil fuel-driven economy; we know it\u2019s not a financialised one; we know it\u2019s not an unequal one. But that\u2019s not going to happen on its own. It needs to be embedded inside the policies,\u201d Mazzucato says. \u201cGovernments need to put strong conditions into bailout contracts, which require investment, innovation, transformation of industry, but also in society more broadly, to help us achieve these longer-term objectives.\u201d</p> <p>Ending state subsidies to fossil-fuel companies would be an easy win. The plunge in oil prices, rather than spurring a rush in fossil-fuel investment, as has happened in the past, now makes oil a volatile, uncertain commodity to invest in, especially when nations are worried about foreign dependency. The dip in oil prices may <a href=\"https://eciu.net/blog/2020/low-oil-price-could-be-a-boon-for-net-zero\">actually hasten the end</a> of domestic extraction of all fossil fuels. So it now makes sense to shore up local renewable infrastructure, especially as costs are getting cheaper and there\u2019s long-term certainty in the market. The scope for public sector jobs and growth in this decentralised industry could prove transformative as we stare down the tunnel of a long recession.</p> <p>The IEA believes that renewable investment could power recovery with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/20/green-energy-could-drive-covid-19-recovery-international-renewable-energy-agency\">global GDP gains of almost $100 trillion (\u00a380tn)</a> between now and 2050. Meanwhile, the economic risks of not meeting the globally agreed greenhouse gas emissions targets could be severe, according to research published in <em>Nature</em>.</p> <p>There is a risk, though, that while we are so preoccupied with the pandemic, the environmental movement, which made significant progress over the past year through the activities of striking schoolchildren, Extinction Rebellion and the leadership of Greta Thunberg, falls off the agenda. The much-anticipated 2020 UN climate change conference, which sets out how nations will meet the UN climate emissions targets agreed in Paris in 2015, has been postponed from November to early 2021. In the meantime, we might forget the deadly wildfires that ravaged Australia mere months ago, or the extreme weather that displaced some 7 million people last year, or the near-record Arctic melting.</p> <p>Environmental campaigners are sanguine, though, preferring to wait until the world is less distracted by the pandemic. With the US presidential elections due this year, next year\u2019s climate talks could now get the chance to benefit from an enlightened leader ready to engage with the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cAs environmentalists we have a role even during the lockdown, for instance in opposing the aviation bailout,\u201d says Alice Bell from Possible, an organisation campaigning for a zero-carbon society. \u201cFor now, we\u2019ve shifted to community action, people have made new relationships within their communities, and we\u2019ve been looking at, say, the debate around park closures. This pandemic is going to profoundly change the way we live and how we work.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4bbab8916099c1db3ca7610596ac9d057896bb31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4bbab8916099c1db3ca7610596ac9d057896bb31/0_389_5870_3524/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Goats roam the streets of Llandudno.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Goats roam the streets of Llandudno.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Global problems require global collaboration, and despite the nationalistic responses of some states, the pandemic has revealed that its solutions are international: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/world/europe/coronavirus-science-research-cooperation.html\">scientists and medics have been sharing</a> data, resources and equipment, and have been advising and supporting each other as never before, united in the quest for effective treatments, tests and vaccines. This same spirit of international cooperation is essential in producing solutions for our energy and economic transitions, and the technology and pace of information sharing make it possible. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if wealthy nations collaborated with resource-rich (poor) nations in an inclusive global economic programme? Sustainable production of crops and minerals in the global south could help fuel the rich world\u2019s low-carbon transition. Instead of unsustainable industrial expansion, the post-pandemic economy could be steered in a way that protects people and the planet from the kind of <a href=\"http://nautil.us/issue/83/intelligence/the-superorganism-that-created-the-pandemic\">ecological destruction that produces new diseases</a>, and the climate disaster that threatens us all.</p> <p>In the Netherlands, for instance, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonhickel/status/1251146508709195780?s=20\">170 Dutch academics</a> have put together a radical five-point manifesto for economic change, which includes investment in critical public sector areas, clean energy, education and health, and radically scaling back the oil, gas, mining and advertising sectors; debt cancellation, especially for workers and small business owners and for countries in the global south; and redistribution, with universal basic income, reduced working hours and the recognition of care work.</p> <p>Perhaps because we\u2019ve experienced a cleaner, quieter and kinder alternative, most people don\u2019t actually want to get back to normal (<a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-only-9-of-britons-want-life-to-return-to-normal-once-lockdown-is-over-11974459\">one poll found only 9% of Britons wanted to return to pre-pandemic </a>conditions). We should perhaps recognise this as a mandate for change, and look at the alternative to normal, taking lessons from this catastrophe to create a better world from its broken parts.</p> <p>Gaia Vince is the author of <em>Transcendence: How Humans Evolved Through Fire, Language, Beauty and Time</em> (Allen Lane \u00a320)</p>",

Governments have been forced to step in and deal with the catastrophe in a way that is unprecedented, including supporting business and industry, and public and private infrastructure. Across the world, government has never been bigger. Many experts argue that this provides us with a huge opportunity to also deal with the other crisis: to make a transformational leap towards a sustainable society that enables us to keep the world below dangerous warming. How we respond to this unique opportunity could set our climate trajectory for thousands of years to come. These behavioural changes we\u2019ve experienced \u2013 some of which may become ingrained permanently, meaning travel and consumption patterns become more responsible \u2013 are helpful in reducing pollution, just as hand-washing helps in the pandemic. But what the expected 8% emissions reduction figure shows us is that individual action \u2013 driving your car less, attending a meeting via Zoom rather than taking a business flight \u2013 is not going to be enough. Equally, it shows that moving to a no-growth economy is not the answer, as some have argued. Instead, systemic transformative action is required at international and state level to get the effective reductions in atmospheric carbon that will bring us to net zero. \u201cIt means we can\u2019t be fiddling around the edges,\u201d says Betts. \u201cIf we are going to have a substantial impact on long-term CO2 concentrations, we need huge, lasting changes in energy systems and other things that rely on fossil fuels.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that the IEA analysis was based on the expectation that human activity will return to some approximation of \u201cnormal\u201d within months, so the shutdown period itself is likely to produce a far steeper drop in emissions \u2013 CO2 emissions in China fell by an estimated 25% during its February lockdown, for example. India, meanwhile, recorded its first ever annual emissions fall for the year ending March, and is expected to show a 30% drop in emissions for the month of April. \u201cBut what we\u2019re seeing at the moment is, for the most part, very temporary,\u201d Evans says. \u201cWhen we drive again, the car still burns petrol.\u201d Instead, structural change could mean people swapping their combustion engines for electric vehicles. More fundamentally, Evans says, \u201cit would involve reimagining the way our cities are built and organised, so that going without a car becomes easier, through how roads are laid out, and how provision for walking and cycling and public transport is changed.\u201d All of those things go far beyond the individual choices we make in our everyday lives. \u201cOur choices are bounded by society,\u201d Evans says, \u201cso a shift towards a low-carbon society can\u2019t happen via individual action alone.\u201d Cities have been leading this transition with innovative buildings and infrastructure projects. Some are already banning cars and trucks as a temporary measure. Others are going further: Milan is reallocating 35km of street space to cyclists and pedestrians; Brussels is creating 40km of new cycle paths; and France is tempting cyclists out with subsidies. In the UK the government has announced a \u00a32bn infrastructure scheme to encourage more walking and cycling and the mayor of London has unveiled measures to create car free bridges and streets. Many cities are exploring some form of a circular economy, in which waste is minimised with resources kept in use as long as possible through recycling and reuse. The economist Kate Raworth says: \u201cWe live in a world that is complex, deeply interconnected, and human health and planetary health are woven into one. So governments need frameworks and ways of thinking that can hold that complexity \u2013 that can think about climate and health and jobs and financial stability and inequality in one space.\u201d For instance, quite apart from the pleasure of experiencing cleaner air, the coronavirus pandemic has revealed how deadly pollution is. One recent study found that a tiny increase in particulates was associated with a 15% increase in the Covid-19 death rate, almost certainly contributing to the terrible rates seen in cities. In Italy, the high death rates seen in the north of the country correlate with the highest levels of air pollution. Reducing air pollution would lower the general health burden and may also help prevent future pandemics from being so deadly. \u201cWe have created a framework, which invites a place to answer: how can our cities be home to thriving people in this thriving place, while respecting the wellbeing of all people and the health of the planet?\u201d Raworth says. She is working with the city of Amsterdam to apply her \u201cdoughnut\u201d model of a socially and environmentally sustainable economy to the Dutch capital\u2019s post-pandemic recovery. The Amsterdam project, like many others, predates Covid-19. Momentum for environmental protection has been building over the past few years, and it may be that this crisis proves a tipping point in public consciousness, leading to a meaningful shift in policy. For one thing, the pandemic has shown us how valuable expertise is, and now we\u2019re all au fait with the role of infectious disease modellers in guiding public health policy, it should help us appreciate the role climate modellers could play in guiding economic policy. \u201cJust as we have seen that early action to deter the spread of the virus was far more effective than trying to contain the damage after the virus already spread, transforming our energy system now to prevent the spread of excessive heat over our planet will be far more effective than trying to adapt to the consequences of this excessive heat later,\u201d says Ken Caldeira at the Carnegie Institution for Science, which is based in Washington DC. City initiatives can only go so far. Ultimately, this is the time for governments to forge a new relationship with the private sector, to produce a sustainable economy. As industry, businesses and individuals plead for state aid, government has never been in a stronger position to push a sustainable agenda, and it\u2019s vital this is not squandered on kneejerk bailouts. We\u2019ve already seen the US and UK bailing out oil giants, and the UK giving supermarket giant Tesco a business rates holiday, only for it to pay a dividend to shareholders. \u201cWhat the government should be doing is thinking about the interest of the public that it represents, that it was elected for, and not simply giving out money that benefits private interest,\u201d says economist Mariana Mazzucato at University College London. \u201cThis is not about helping business make money. It\u2019s about giving them that cashflow to survive, but also helping them transform themselves to be a more functioning part of society,\u201d she says. \u201cThe government will never have the negotiating hand it has now. There\u2019s trillions being poured into the economy, given the tragedy. So, this can be used as a way to make sure that the \u201cpublic private partnerships\u201d actually become a symbiotic mutualistic partnership, not a parasitic one, as we\u2019ve had in the health sector for a long time,\u201d Mazzucato says. Governments, she says, must take the long view and use stimulus packages to actively mould a cleaner economy, something that South Korea has pledged, for instance. \u201cGovernment on its own cannot solve climate change, or create an equitable production system. It needs the private sector, and the private sector needs the public sector.\u201d Mazzucato and others argue that there\u2019s a danger otherwise that we will repeat the mistakes that were made in the aftermath of the 2008/9 financial crisis (during which emissions also fell), by not attaching conditions to the bailouts. \u201cGoldman Sachs was back making record profits after it was given a $10bn bailout,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to learn that government is not there just to do bailouts to fix the same system, but to really co-create \u2013 to shape the kind of economy and society we want to live in. We know that\u2019s not a fossil fuel-driven economy; we know it\u2019s not a financialised one; we know it\u2019s not an unequal one. But that\u2019s not going to happen on its own. It needs to be embedded inside the policies,\u201d Mazzucato says. \u201cGovernments need to put strong conditions into bailout contracts, which require investment, innovation, transformation of industry, but also in society more broadly, to help us achieve these longer-term objectives.\u201d Ending state subsidies to fossil-fuel companies would be an easy win. The plunge in oil prices, rather than spurring a rush in fossil-fuel investment, as has happened in the past, now makes oil a volatile, uncertain commodity to invest in, especially when nations are worried about foreign dependency. The dip in oil prices may actually hasten the end of domestic extraction of all fossil fuels. So it now makes sense to shore up local renewable infrastructure, especially as costs are getting cheaper and there\u2019s long-term certainty in the market. The scope for public sector jobs and growth in this decentralised industry could prove transformative as we stare down the tunnel of a long recession. The IEA believes that renewable investment could power recovery with global GDP gains of almost $100 trillion (\u00a380tn) between now and 2050. Meanwhile, the economic risks of not meeting the globally agreed greenhouse gas emissions targets could be severe, according to research published in Nature. There is a risk, though, that while we are so preoccupied with the pandemic, the environmental movement, which made significant progress over the past year through the activities of striking schoolchildren, Extinction Rebellion and the leadership of Greta Thunberg, falls off the agenda. The much-anticipated 2020 UN climate change conference, which sets out how nations will meet the UN climate emissions targets agreed in Paris in 2015, has been postponed from November to early 2021. In the meantime, we might forget the deadly wildfires that ravaged Australia mere months ago, or the extreme weather that displaced some 7 million people last year, or the near-record Arctic melting. Environmental campaigners are sanguine, though, preferring to wait until the world is less distracted by the pandemic. With the US presidential elections due this year, next year\u2019s climate talks could now get the chance to benefit from an enlightened leader ready to engage with the crisis. \u201cAs environmentalists we have a role even during the lockdown, for instance in opposing the aviation bailout,\u201d says Alice Bell from Possible, an organisation campaigning for a zero-carbon society. \u201cFor now, we\u2019ve shifted to community action, people have made new relationships within their communities, and we\u2019ve been looking at, say, the debate around park closures. This pandemic is going to profoundly change the way we live and how we work.\u201d Global problems require global collaboration, and despite the nationalistic responses of some states, the pandemic has revealed that its solutions are international: scientists and medics have been sharing data, resources and equipment, and have been advising and supporting each other as never before, united in the quest for effective treatments, tests and vaccines. This same spirit of international cooperation is essential in producing solutions for our energy and economic transitions, and the technology and pace of information sharing make it possible. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if wealthy nations collaborated with resource-rich (poor) nations in an inclusive global economic programme? Sustainable production of crops and minerals in the global south could help fuel the rich world\u2019s low-carbon transition. Instead of unsustainable industrial expansion, the post-pandemic economy could be steered in a way that protects people and the planet from the kind of ecological destruction that produces new diseases, and the climate disaster that threatens us all. In the Netherlands, for instance, 170 Dutch academics have put together a radical five-point manifesto for economic change, which includes investment in critical public sector areas, clean energy, education and health, and radically scaling back the oil, gas, mining and advertising sectors; debt cancellation, especially for workers and small business owners and for countries in the global south; and redistribution, with universal basic income, reduced working hours and the recognition of care work. Perhaps because we\u2019ve experienced a cleaner, quieter and kinder alternative, most people don\u2019t actually want to get back to normal (one poll found only 9% of Britons wanted to return to pre-pandemic conditions). We should perhaps recognise this as a mandate for change, and look at the alternative to normal, taking lessons from this catastrophe to create a better world from its broken parts.

      "body": "<p>Stay alert! On Twitter, Tom Tugendhat, The Conservative MP for Tonbridge and Malling, is talking. There! He is thanking the prime minister for his \u201cvery clear message\u201d. Tom Tugendhat! On Twitter! Now! He is enjoying the sheer coral sea clarity of the prime minister\u2019s Sunday statement, like sunlight shining through spring water in Waterford crystal! Tom Tugendhat! He says: \u201cThank you prime minister. That\u2019s leadership!\u201d</p> <p>Stay alert! Many names \u2013 Fisher, Cook, Smith \u2013 derive from ancient trades. But \u201cTugendhat\u201d is just different words put together, like Waspcupfinger, or Appendixhospitalwool, or Abortionmaqaquesymptom. This former intelligence officer is the nephew of a real man called Baron Tugendhat. Baron Tugendhat is not a character from a 19th-century German children\u2019s book about a baron with a weird hat, the end of which gets tugged. But what did Tom Tugendhat want? Why was he bothering us?</p> <p>Stay alert! Peasants! Get back to work! Over the top, boys! Gas! Gas! For God\u2019s sake, gas! Writing in the 2012 book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\">Britannia Unchained</a></em>, The secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs, Dominic Skeletor Raab, said of British workers, they \u201cprefer a lie-in to hard work\u201d, \u201care among the worst idlers in the world\u201d, and expect to see laziness rewarded. If British workers were also serial liars, then our workforce would have been made in the image of our prime minister. Ha! I\u2019m here all week! Maybe all year! Try the fish! Don\u2019t forget to tip your healthcare worker!</p> <p>Stay alert! Here at home, my family nag me to mend the gate, fix the dimmer switch, hoe the avocado trench. But I am a lazy British worker for whom the pandemic is an excuse to skive off and home-school the year four syllabus. Precipitation, Shinto and Cnut. My family won\u2019t relent, so I have presented them with a simple graph. It shows that at some point I would do the things they wanted me to do, but it was impossible for me to say when that would be, or whether the things would be done well enough to remain done, or whether they would then have to be done again later at an unspecified date. And that seemed to satisfy them. The twats!</p> <p>Stay alert! On Sunday night the prime minister appeared on television and presented his own graph, explaining his immediately discredited and internationally ridiculed New Vision of Lockdown Britain \u2122 \u00ae. My 12-year-old, whose strongest subject is not maths, laughed openly at the graph, and said she would not have handed it in at school as neither the X or the Y axis contained any actual information, so it had no meaning. We are being guided by a graph that a schoolgirl would be ashamed to submit. All the prime minister\u2019s shoddy homework suggested was that if some time passed, eventually some things would happen. Some of them might involve stick men jumping about or riding bikes. And although a blue line is going downwards, there was at least twice as much shading-in in the area showing The Future as there was in the area showing The Past. This suggests Covid-19 deaths will triple to around 90,000. Beat that Belgium! But the tear-jerking stupidity of the prime minister\u2019s death-inducing graph did not deter the usual suspects from coming out in its defence, not least of all Tom Tugendhat, his fellow Tory MP Alan Abortionmaqaquesymptom being unavailable due to self-isolation. Because for loyal Tom Tugendhat, the prime minister\u2019s offensively stupid night soil bucket of obfuscation was \u201ca very clear message from @Borisjohnson and a welcome explanation of the situation. By explaining the uncertainty and complexity @10Downingstreet is allowing us all to think through the situation.\u201d Nonsense, Tugendhat, and youknowsit, clart!</p> <p>Stay alert! Something about the strange collision of unrelated words that form Tom Tugendhat\u2019s surname means that whenever Tom Tugendhat appears in my visionary satire-dreams it is as a territorial army lieutenant colonel forcibly pulling at an end, presumably his own, that has become trapped in a hat, or in an intelligence officer\u2019s wig of disguise. It\u2019s past midnight, and now Baron Tugendhat is in my drunken nightmares, working undercover for James Bond\u2019s great-grandfather, attending a lavish ceremonial dinner<strong> </strong>at Neuschwanstein castle. The future of Anglo-Bavarian trade relations depends on Baron Tugendhat also tugging his end free of a hat, on this occasion a Tyrolean Alpine bonnet, common to the region, a vagina dentata of felt and chamois leather.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Middle-class workers: text each other photographs of your Ocado deliveries and dream of Center Parcs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Stay alert! (Readers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own slogan.) You may meet one parent at a distance of two metres while the other parent waits in the car. Or you could employ them both at your small business and see them as much as you want. Stay alert! Don\u2019t see your children. But if you are a teacher, see dozens of other people\u2019s children in narrow corridors. Stay alert! Don\u2019t drive. Unless you are driving to take exercise, in which case drive hundreds of miles.

      "bodyText": "Stay alert! On Twitter, Tom Tugendhat, The Conservative MP for Tonbridge and Malling, is talking. There! He is thanking the prime minister for his \u201cvery clear message\u201d. Tom Tugendhat! On Twitter! Now! He is enjoying the sheer coral sea clarity of the prime minister\u2019s Sunday statement, like sunlight shining through spring water in Waterford crystal! Tom Tugendhat! He says: \u201cThank you prime minister. That\u2019s leadership!\u201d Stay alert! Many names \u2013 Fisher, Cook, Smith \u2013 derive from ancient trades. But \u201cTugendhat\u201d is just different words put together, like Waspcupfinger, or Appendixhospitalwool, or Abortionmaqaquesymptom. This former intelligence officer is the nephew of a real man called Baron Tugendhat. Baron Tugendhat is not a character from a 19th-century German children\u2019s book about a baron with a weird hat, the end of which gets tugged. But what did Tom Tugendhat want? Why was he bothering us? Stay alert! Peasants! Get back to work! Over the top, boys! Gas! Gas! For God\u2019s sake, gas! Writing in the 2012 book Britannia Unchained, The secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs, Dominic Skeletor Raab, said of British workers, they \u201cprefer a lie-in to hard work\u201d, \u201care among the worst idlers in the world\u201d, and expect to see laziness rewarded. If British workers were also serial liars, then our workforce would have been made in the image of our prime minister. Ha! I\u2019m here all week! Maybe all year! Try the fish! Don\u2019t forget to tip your healthcare worker! Stay alert! Here at home, my family nag me to mend the gate, fix the dimmer switch, hoe the avocado trench. But I am a lazy British worker for whom the pandemic is an excuse to skive off and home-school the year four syllabus. Precipitation, Shinto and Cnut. My family won\u2019t relent, so I have presented them with a simple graph. It shows that at some point I would do the things they wanted me to do, but it was impossible for me to say when that would be, or whether the things would be done well enough to remain done, or whether they would then have to be done again later at an unspecified date. And that seemed to satisfy them. The twats! Stay alert! On Sunday night the prime minister appeared on television and presented his own graph, explaining his immediately discredited and internationally ridiculed New Vision of Lockdown Britain \u2122 \u00ae. My 12-year-old, whose strongest subject is not maths, laughed openly at the graph, and said she would not have handed it in at school as neither the X or the Y axis contained any actual information, so it had no meaning. We are being guided by a graph that a schoolgirl would be ashamed to submit. All the prime minister\u2019s shoddy homework suggested was that if some time passed, eventually some things would happen. Some of them might involve stick men jumping about or riding bikes. And although a blue line is going downwards, there was at least twice as much shading-in in the area showing The Future as there was in the area showing The Past. This suggests Covid-19 deaths will triple to around 90,000. Beat that Belgium! But the tear-jerking stupidity of the prime minister\u2019s death-inducing graph did not deter the usual suspects from coming out in its defence, not least of all Tom Tugendhat, his fellow Tory MP Alan Abortionmaqaquesymptom being unavailable due to self-isolation. Because for loyal Tom Tugendhat, the prime minister\u2019s offensively stupid night soil bucket of obfuscation was \u201ca very clear message from @Borisjohnson and a welcome explanation of the situation. By explaining the uncertainty and complexity @10Downingstreet is allowing us all to think through the situation.\u201d Nonsense, Tugendhat, and youknowsit, clart! Stay alert! Something about the strange collision of unrelated words that form Tom Tugendhat\u2019s surname means that whenever Tom Tugendhat appears in my visionary satire-dreams it is as a territorial army lieutenant colonel forcibly pulling at an end, presumably his own, that has become trapped in a hat, or in an intelligence officer\u2019s wig of disguise. It\u2019s past midnight, and now Baron Tugendhat is in my drunken nightmares, working undercover for James Bond\u2019s great-grandfather, attending a lavish ceremonial dinner at Neuschwanstein castle. The future of Anglo-Bavarian trade relations depends on Baron Tugendhat also tugging his end free of a hat, on this occasion a Tyrolean Alpine bonnet, common to the region, a vagina dentata of felt and chamois leather. Stay alert! (Readers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own slogan.) You may meet one parent at a distance of two metres while the other parent waits in the car. Or you could employ them both at your small business and see them as much as you want. Stay alert! Don\u2019t see your children. But if you are a teacher, see dozens of other people\u2019s children in narrow corridors. Stay alert! Don\u2019t drive. Unless you are driving to take exercise, in which case drive hundreds of miles. But don\u2019t drive into Wales, for there be dragons. Like Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s paradoxical cat, the prime minister\u2019s New Vision of Lockdown Britain \u2122 \u00ae is both stupid and stinks of cats\u2019 piss, and now it has been shooed back out into the lane by Nicola Sturgeon.

Former environment secretary and Brexiter Owen Paterson will be rushing back to work, as his consultancy client Randox Laboratories has just been awarded the government\u2019s \u00a3133m virus testing contract, unopposed.

      "body": "<p>The darkness was all-consuming as we reached the midpoint of our journey, blackness and confusion all around. It had already taken us two days to make it to the forest. At a certain point, we looked up and realised our child was no longer with us, lost amid the shimmering foliage. \u201cTeddy, where are you?\u201d my wife called. \u201cForget him, he was only slowing us down,\u201d I murmured, perceiving the dim shape of a branch through the leaves.</p> <p>But there is always a way through \u2013 if not the colour, then the shape will guide you. Backs aching, eyes narrowing, language stripped to pure function, we began to piece together the blackest sections of the puzzle. \u201cThis is a waste of life,\u201d my wife eventually concluded and returned to her novel. The glory would be mine alone. By midnight on the eighth day, the 500-piece Super-3D holographic jigsaw of the Hogwarts Express was complete.</p> <p>Yes, this was technically a sixth birthday present for our Harry Potter-mad son. Yes, we did most of it while he watched Netflix. Yes, I\u2019m aware 500 pieces is not that many. Yes, this was a decadent amount of time to work on something so pointless. But sometimes, pointlessness is precisely the point.</p> <p>At any rate, we are far from being the only household that has turned to jigsaws in lockdown. Decent 1,000- piecers are harder to find than yeast these days. Gibsons, one of the UK\u2019s leading jigsaw companies, reports a year-on-year sales increase of 132%. \u201cWe\u2019re doing Christmas-level sales,\u201d says marketing manager Samantha Goodburn. \u201cWe\u2019re doing our best to print out as many as we can and get them out to people who need them.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e62f6a6a59ea0a885fe517e48a703a729c962ed7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e62f6a6a59ea0a885fe517e48a703a729c962ed7/0_0_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Cats are popular.

Among its best sellers are The World of Frida Kahlo by Laurence King and Rainbow Hand by Galison. The satirical montage artist Cold War Steve has one, too, inspired by <em>The </em><em>Festival of Brexit</em> \u2013 but this too has sold out. <a href=\"https://www.wentworthpuzzles.com/\" title=\"\">Wentworth</a>, the Wiltshire-based company whose wooden fine art puzzles are highly prized by collectors, has nothing over 250 pieces.</p> <p>But puzzle junkies no longer care where they score their hit. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d buy one of those super-twee ones of a country cottage or anything,\u201d says Liz Vater, director of the <a href=\"http://www.stokenewingtonliteraryfestival.com/\" title=\"\">Stoke Newington Literary Festival</a>, who has completed four puzzles since lockdown, including a David Bowie-themed moon scene. \u201cBut if someone gave me one like that, I don\u2019t think it would matter.\u201d The experience is common. Jigsaws are a gateway drug to twee. You start out on a nice <em>New Yorker</em> cover. Soon, it\u2019s Teddy Bears &amp; Tricycles.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want<em><strong> </strong></em>masses of sky or sand,\u201d says my Granny Rose, 90, and a lifelong puzzler. \u201cYou want it to be interesting.\u201d She grew up on jigsaws \u2013 her father only let her and her sister look at the picture once \u2013 and usually has one on the go. She likes doing them with friends or family, but in lockdown, she is on her own, working on an image of Blackpool beach that a friend dropped round. \u201cIt\u2019s ghastly!\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut my other jigsaws are in a high cupboard and I don\u2019t want to risk climbing up on a chair.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not too hard to see why we\u2019re reaching for jigsaws. Margaret Drabble wrote a memoir inspired by puzzles, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/dec/20/family-christmas-jigsaw-puzzle-history\" title=\"\">The Pattern </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/dec/20/family-christmas-jigsaw-puzzle-history\" title=\"\">in </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/dec/20/family-christmas-jigsaw-puzzle-history\" title=\"\">the Carpet: A Personal History With Jigsaws</a></em>. \u201cThey provide hours of painless social intercourse or moments of peaceful, solitary retreat,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey give you an illusion of order and progress when all around is chaos.\u201d There is such a thing as competitive puzzling, but this is not the point, Drabble argued. Here is a \u201charmonious, constructive, co-operative activity, free of the rivalry that makes so many games contentious and so many children so cross.\u201d And if you want to do it on your own, while listening to a podcast or the birds singing, that\u2019s fine, too.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d5d8595b07eade9b09902c9a282c1b89d315fd6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d5d8595b07eade9b09902c9a282c1b89d315fd6/0_97_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some kittens explore a child\u2019s toy cupboard.

Soon, it\u2019s teddy bears.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Read</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There have been studies into the cognitive effects of jigsaws. One concluded that the activity \u201crecruits multiple visuospatial cognitive abilities and is a protective factor for visuospatial cognitive aging\u201d. But it\u2019s possible to overthink this. <a href=\"http://drabigaelsan.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Dr Abigael San</a> of the British Psychological Society sees it as a classic mindful activity. \u201cFocusing on detail, taking the time to relax, having an aim without pressure \u2013 all of those things are beneficial and a counter to the wider anxiety that people are feeling at the moment. It gives you a sense of control in a chaotic situation. The world is unpredictable, whereas a jigsaw puzzle is certain.\u201d As long as no one has lost a piece.</p> <p>The jigsaw is thought to have been invented in 1766 by John Spilsbury, an engraver and mapmaker whose \u201cdissected maps\u201d were used to teach. Jane Austen included a jigsaw in <em>Mansfield Park</em> (1814). The Bertram children laugh at poor cousin Fanny as she is not familiar with these fashionable toys. Adult puzzles emerged in the 20th century. At first all the pieces had straight edges. My granny remembers the \u201ctwo spinsters\u201d who lived next door to her had one like this \u2013 finally completed by the evacuee who came to stay during the war. She also remembers dedicated jigsaw libraries \u2013 of which I can find only one in England, based in a Baptist church in Exeter. Social distancing has forced it to close during lockdown. \u201cOur clientele is usually quite elderly \u2013 people with time on their hands,\u201d says its chairperson, Susan Hazemore. \u201cIt\u2019s good for their eye-hand co-ordination. We have a few people who suffer from dementia and also insomnia, too. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be open until at least September now, but I am hoping that when I can go out and about a bit, I can do some delivering to people who are on our books.\u201d</p> <p>For many, lockdown has been a foretaste of retirement. \u201cLife doesn\u2019t usually warrant a 1,000-piece jigsaw,\u201d says Liz Vater \u2013 who realised she would have to cancel her literary festival early on and so found herself with time on her hands. \u201cAt the beginning, I had so many plans,\u201d she says. \u201cI was going to read all the books I have around the house.

There is a jigsaw emoji. Jigsaws were also added to the Consumer Price Index used to measure inflation in 2017 (alongside gin and almond milk). \u201cIt pre-dates coronavirus,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the trend of looking after yourself, being more mindful, taking a digital detox.\u201d Nostalgia is popular across age groups \u2013 one of their bestsellers is called 1980s Sweet Memories, a montage of Marathons, Opal Fruits and Jelly Tots \u2013 but they have also commissioned a new range of design-led jigsaws with a hipper audience in mind. \u201cWe have one called Avocado Park.

I ask the <em>Observer</em>\u2019s art critic Laura Cumming for her verdict on The Airshow, which shows gleeful picnickers beneath a sky heavy with warplanes. She professes herself a little baffled. \u201cThe vintage planes would scalp the day-trippers, the photo-real detail seems bizarrely mismatched with the graphic kitsch and it is very strange that the hardest part of a jigsaw \u2013 long stretches of barely differentiated colour, such as sand, sea or sky \u2013 are eliminated as if the artist wanted the experience to be quick and easy. Is the idea to get through them as fast as possible and buy the next?\u201d She reckons Pieter Bruegel the Elder is a good jigsaw artist as \u201cyou enter so intimately into his mind, piece by piece; but I think Seurat is the most beautiful to do, half a dot, a whole dot, etc, as you get a deep sense of his colour alchemies. The worst I\u2019ve ever had to do, in company with my aunt, was Renoir\u2019s<em> Bal du Moulin de la Galette</em>, where every stroke melted into another.\u201d</p> <p>I turn to <a href=\"https://www.theyorkshirejigsawstore.co.uk/steve-crisp-178-c.asp\" title=\"\">Steve Crisp</a>, one of the UK\u2019s most in-demand jigsaw illustrators. \u201cI\u2019ll sort of do half a painting before moving on to computer, where it\u2019s easier to move things around,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe brief is basically, make every area of the puzzle interesting.

      "bodyText": "The darkness was all-consuming as we reached the midpoint of our journey, blackness and confusion all around. It had already taken us two days to make it to the forest. At a certain point, we looked up and realised our child was no longer with us, lost amid the shimmering foliage. \u201cTeddy, where are you?\u201d my wife called. \u201cForget him, he was only slowing us down,\u201d I murmured, perceiving the dim shape of a branch through the leaves. But there is always a way through \u2013 if not the colour, then the shape will guide you. Backs aching, eyes narrowing, language stripped to pure function, we began to piece together the blackest sections of the puzzle. \u201cThis is a waste of life,\u201d my wife eventually concluded and returned to her novel. The glory would be mine alone. By midnight on the eighth day, the 500-piece Super-3D holographic jigsaw of the Hogwarts Express was complete. Yes, this was technically a sixth birthday present for our Harry Potter-mad son. Yes, we did most of it while he watched Netflix. Yes, I\u2019m aware 500 pieces is not that many. Yes, this was a decadent amount of time to work on something so pointless. But sometimes, pointlessness is precisely the point. At any rate, we are far from being the only household that has turned to jigsaws in lockdown. Decent 1,000- piecers are harder to find than yeast these days. Gibsons, one of the UK\u2019s leading jigsaw companies, reports a year-on-year sales increase of 132%. \u201cWe\u2019re doing Christmas-level sales,\u201d says marketing manager Samantha Goodburn. \u201cWe\u2019re doing our best to print out as many as we can and get them out to people who need them.\u201d John Lewis is almost puzzled dry. Among its best sellers are The World of Frida Kahlo by Laurence King and Rainbow Hand by Galison. The satirical montage artist Cold War Steve has one, too, inspired by The Festival of Brexit \u2013 but this too has sold out. Wentworth, the Wiltshire-based company whose wooden fine art puzzles are highly prized by collectors, has nothing over 250 pieces. But puzzle junkies no longer care where they score their hit. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d buy one of those super-twee ones of a country cottage or anything,\u201d says Liz Vater, director of the Stoke Newington Literary Festival, who has completed four puzzles since lockdown, including a David Bowie-themed moon scene. \u201cBut if someone gave me one like that, I don\u2019t think it would matter.\u201d The experience is common. Jigsaws are a gateway drug to twee. You start out on a nice New Yorker cover. Soon, it\u2019s Teddy Bears &amp; Tricycles. \u201cYou don\u2019t want masses of sky or sand,\u201d says my Granny Rose, 90, and a lifelong puzzler. \u201cYou want it to be interesting.\u201d She grew up on jigsaws \u2013 her father only let her and her sister look at the picture once \u2013 and usually has one on the go. She likes doing them with friends or family, but in lockdown, she is on her own, working on an image of Blackpool beach that a friend dropped round. \u201cIt\u2019s ghastly!\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut my other jigsaws are in a high cupboard and I don\u2019t want to risk climbing up on a chair.\u201d It\u2019s not too hard to see why we\u2019re reaching for jigsaws. Margaret Drabble wrote a memoir inspired by puzzles, The Pattern in the Carpet: A Personal History With Jigsaws. \u201cThey provide hours of painless social intercourse or moments of peaceful, solitary retreat,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey give you an illusion of order and progress when all around is chaos.\u201d There is such a thing as competitive puzzling, but this is not the point, Drabble argued. Here is a \u201charmonious, constructive, co-operative activity, free of the rivalry that makes so many games contentious and so many children so cross.\u201d And if you want to do it on your own, while listening to a podcast or the birds singing, that\u2019s fine, too. There have been studies into the cognitive effects of jigsaws. One concluded that the activity \u201crecruits multiple visuospatial cognitive abilities and is a protective factor for visuospatial cognitive aging\u201d. But it\u2019s possible to overthink this. Dr Abigael San of the British Psychological Society sees it as a classic mindful activity. \u201cFocusing on detail, taking the time to relax, having an aim without pressure \u2013 all of those things are beneficial and a counter to the wider anxiety that people are feeling at the moment. It gives you a sense of control in a chaotic situation. The world is unpredictable, whereas a jigsaw puzzle is certain.\u201d As long as no one has lost a piece. The jigsaw is thought to have been invented in 1766 by John Spilsbury, an engraver and mapmaker whose \u201cdissected maps\u201d were used to teach. Jane Austen included a jigsaw in Mansfield Park (1814). The Bertram children laugh at poor cousin Fanny as she is not familiar with these fashionable toys. Adult puzzles emerged in the 20th century. At first all the pieces had straight edges. My granny remembers the \u201ctwo spinsters\u201d who lived next door to her had one like this \u2013 finally completed by the evacuee who came to stay during the war. She also remembers dedicated jigsaw libraries \u2013 of which I can find only one in England, based in a Baptist church in Exeter. Social distancing has forced it to close during lockdown. \u201cOur clientele is usually quite elderly \u2013 people with time on their hands,\u201d says its chairperson, Susan Hazemore. \u201cIt\u2019s good for their eye-hand co-ordination. We have a few people who suffer from dementia and also insomnia, too. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be open until at least September now, but I am hoping that when I can go out and about a bit, I can do some delivering to people who are on our books.\u201d For many, lockdown has been a foretaste of retirement. \u201cLife doesn\u2019t usually warrant a 1,000-piece jigsaw,\u201d says Liz Vater \u2013 who realised she would have to cancel her literary festival early on and so found herself with time on her hands. \u201cAt the beginning, I had so many plans,\u201d she says. \u201cI was going to read all the books I have around the house. And I just wasn\u2019t able to read. It was horrible. I always have a book on the go. But then I started a jigsaw. It does a similar thing. I was focusing in. It was quite meditative. I was processing as I was going. I\u2019ve loved the endless hours just focusing on one task, searching for pieces defined by colour, perspective or shape.\u201d One thing we have learned is that global catastrophes don\u2019t introduce brand new ideas, what they do is accelerate ones that were already floating around the ether: universal basic income; modern monetary theory; jigsaw puzzles.

How can it be treated with medication? When is it safe for the public to go back to \u201cnormal\u201d? Often, they have unsatisfying answers, and purveyors of misinformation have stepped in. In the United States, misinformation can come straight from the White House.

Here are some of the most commonly repeated claims. Claim: Stay-at-home orders don\u2019t work Reality check: False Stay-at-home orders are difficult, isolating, economically costly and are considered absolutely necessary to slow the spread of the disease, public health officials have repeatedly said.

California doctors Daniel Erickson and Artin Massihi gained notoriety after a widely publicized press conference, in which they used very limited data from their own clinics to argue Covid-19 was not very deadly, and stay-at-home orders should be lifted.

Around 90 million people, the majority from Britain and Germany, visited last year.

But around 95% of hotels have been shut since March.

      "bodyText": "As the UK prepares for a glut of bookings if the government allows staycations this summer, other European countries are also moving to save their tourism industries, which represent around 10% of GDP France As the most popular country in the world for tourists, France has been hit harder than most by a drop in holidaymakers. Around 90 million people, the majority from Britain and Germany, visited last year. Almost half of them visited Paris, and 15 million headed to Disneyland \u2013 the most popular tourist attraction in Europe. Last week, France\u2019s prime minister Edouard Philippe, announced an \u20ac18bn (\u00a316bn) rescue package for the country\u2019s tourism sector to combat the collapse in visitor numbers. \u201cWhat is good for the tourism industry, is often good for the whole of France,\u201d he said. People staying in g\u00eetes, hotels and campsites normally bring in around \u20ac56bn in tourism receipts, helping sustain more than two million jobs. But around 95% of hotels have been shut since March. In an attempt to gradually reopen them, Philippe said France\u2019s residents would be allowed to go on holiday from July, but only within the country. Richard Partington Italy Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has said several times that Italians will be going on holiday this summer. Yesterday , the government approved a decree which will allow travel to and from abroad from June 3. Free travel within the country\u2019s borders will also be permitted from the same day. Some regions had pushed for a swifter rollback, but Conte has insisted on a gradual return to normal to prevent a second wave of infections. Shops are due to open tomorrow and all movement within individual regions will be allowed, meaning people can visit friends. The government is hoping to salvage the holiday season, when Italians traditionally escape the cities for their annual summer breaks. Shops and restaurants across the country are preparing to reopen under strict social distancing and hygiene rules. National health authorities will monitor the situation to make sure infections are kept in check, the decree said. Angela Giuffrida Spain Spain\u2019s foreign minister, Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez Laya, warned at the end of April that the country would re-open to tourists only \u201cwhen it\u2019s in a position to guarantee tourists\u2019 safety\u201d. Everyone arriving in Spain from abroad since 15 May must undertake a two-week quarantine, with new arrivals allowed out only to buy food or medicine, seek medical attention, or on emergency grounds. The quarantine will remain in force while the state of emergency, declared on 14 March, endures \u2013 possibly until the end of June. The regions are emerging from lockdown at different rates . Hotels in some areas have been given permission to re-open \u2013 barring communal areas \u2013 but few have resumed business for lack of customers.

This is Luke Henriques-Gomes and it is Sunday 17 May.</p> \n<h2>Pubs to open in Victoria \u2026 soon</h2> \n<p>The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/may/17/coronavirus-news-australia-covid-19-restrictions-health-pubs-economy-scott-morrison-queensland-nsw-victoria-live-updates?page=with:block-5ec0794b8f08a1782fa7c22f#block-5ec0794b8f08a1782fa7c22f\"> announced cafes, restaurants and the dining areas of pubs and clubs could serve to up 20 patrons from 1 June</a>. That will increase to 50 patrons from 22 June, and 100 people by mid-July. However, Andrews also said patrons would be required to give their names and other details to venues upon entry for tracing purposes.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/17/was-australia-right-to-shut-down-to-slow-coronavirus-the-economists-verdict\">Was Australia right to shut down to slow coronavirus?

Victorians and NSW residents have been able to cross the border during the crisis, but Queensland has been steadfast in its resolve. Berejiklian said the borders should be opened as soon as possible, citing the impact on business.

      "bodyText": "Good evening, here are the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Luke Henriques-Gomes and it is Sunday 17 May. Pubs to open in Victoria \u2026 soon The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, announced cafes, restaurants and the dining areas of pubs and clubs could serve to up 20 patrons from 1 June. That will increase to 50 patrons from 22 June, and 100 people by mid-July. However, Andrews also said patrons would be required to give their names and other details to venues upon entry for tracing purposes. NSW and Queensland at loggerheads over border closures The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, sought to pressure the Queensland government to open the state\u2019s borders. Victorians and NSW residents have been able to cross the border during the crisis, but Queensland has been steadfast in its resolve. Berejiklian said the borders should be opened as soon as possible, citing the impact on business. But the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the borders would remain closed while there was still community transmission in the southern states. Probe over aged care employee who worked while waiting for test Queensland authorities said they would investigate the circumstances that saw an aged care employee continue working while she was waiting for a Covid-19 test. The receptionist went on to test positive, sending the North Rockhampton Nursing Centre into lockdown. Nearly 200 people have so far tested negative, while 35 low-risk residents have been moved from the home.

Over the course of the last decade we\u2019ve made significant strides in closing the gap between the richest and the poorest in our schools. This lockdown has put that backwards.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you really care about children, you\u2019ll want them to be in schools. You will want them to be learning.

      "bodyText": "Michael Gove has told local authorities refusing to reopen their schools on 1 June to \u201clook to their responsibilities\u201d, saying: \u201cIf you really care about children, you\u2019ll want them in schools.\u201d Appearing on the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, the Cabinet Office minister said: \u201cWe are confident that children and teachers will be safe.\u201d He said schools could implement staggered lunch breaks and arrival times, seat children at individual desks and teach them in classes of 15 at most, supervised by one adult. Asked what he would say to councils, including Liverpool\u2019s and Greater Manchester\u2019s, which have questioned the plan, he said: \u201cI respectfully ask them to think again. \u201cThe clear scientific and clinical advice is that it is safe to have schools reopen, accompanied with social distancing.\u201d He added: \u201cChildren only have one chance at education. Over the course of the last decade we\u2019ve made significant strides in closing the gap between the richest and the poorest in our schools. This lockdown has put that backwards. \u201cIf you really care about children, you\u2019ll want them to be in schools. You will want them to be learning. You will want them to have new opportunities. So look to your responsibilities.\u201d The government has asked schools to prepare to open their doors to children from reception, year 1 and year 6 from next month. But some councils, including Liverpool, Hartlepool and Greater Manchester, have said they will not be implementing the plan. In a letter to parents, Liverpool\u2019s director of children\u2019s services, Steve Reddy, said: \u201cOur guiding principle is that schools can only reopen to other pupils when it is safe to do so and not a moment before.\u201d In the clearest explanation yet of the government\u2019s rationale for its \u201cstay alert\u201d approach to the next phase of the crisis, Gove said it was impossible to eliminate completely the risk of catching Covid-19, unless people were kept \u201cperpetually imprisoned in their homes\u201d. \u201cThe whole point about life is that you need to manage risk,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot have a situation where we keep our economy and our schools and our public services continually closed down, because the health consequences of doing so would be malign as well.\u201d In a separate interview on Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Gove announced that the government had recruited 17,000 coronavirus contact tracers, and would be ready to roll out the system nationwide by the end of this month. Building up the ability to find and control new local outbreaks is a central part of the government\u2019s approach to progressively reopening schools, and the wider economy. The outsourcing giant Serco was given the contract to recruit the call-centre workers needed to run the new system. The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, suggested last week that just 1,500 had been hired, but when Gove was asked for a number on Sunday, he said, \u201cjust over 17,000\u201d. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, had suggested 18,000 contact tracers would be in place by the middle of this month. Gove heaped praise on Hancock, amid reports of a testy relationship between the health secretary and No 10. \u201cWe\u2019re on course to meet that target. It\u2019s more evidence that we have, in Matt, an energetic and determined health secretary who is throwing everything into the fight against this virus,\u201d he said. The government gave up trying to track every case of Covid-19 in March, when the virus began circulating in the community, with the deputy chief medical officer for England Jenny Harries saying at the time: \u201cThere comes a point in a pandemic where that is not an appropriate intervention.\u201d But the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, and Hancock\u2019s predecessor Jeremy Hunt have consistently called for community tracing. The government also announced this weekend a third large-scale study to track the progress of the virus, and try to establish how many people may have built up some immunity to it. Teaching unions have said the implementation of a testing and tracking system should be a precondition for schools reopening \u2013 so that individual outbreaks can be controlled. The deputy Labour leader, Angela Rayner, backed their stance on the BBC Marr show, saying: \u201cWe urge the government to publish the science, and to ensure the test, track and isolate is in place.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2>United States</h2> <p>Foreign policy does not usually draw much attention in US election campaigns. It was given a few token minutes in the Democratic primary debates. But that was before coronavirus.</p> <p>Anti-China sentiment is now the primary fuel of Donald Trump\u2019s re-election effort, in the absence of a workable alternative. It will be increasingly hard to run on the economy, as the president had hoped, or on the administration\u2019s pandemic response, as the human cost of the debacle becomes clear. Sinophobia has proven all the more attractive an option as it claims to explain both failures.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, this is sometimes the tunnelling logic of democratic systems,\u201d Jude Blanchette, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said. \u201cEven if it comes with pretty significant national collateral damage, when it comes down to political survival the bad drives out the good.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday, Trump supporters in the <a href=\"https://www.a1apac.org/news/new-ad-toast-of-china/\">America First Action</a> committee launched a new wave of attack ads in the swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, framing the Democratic challenger as \u201cBeijing Biden\u201d, using selective edits of the former vice-president\u2019s past remarks and Chinese-language commentary praising the \u201cToast of China\u201d.</p> <p>The Biden camp has aired some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1251582266251243525?s=20\">similar ads</a> of its own, drawing on Trump\u2019s sometimes unctuous admiration for Xi Jinping, and his initially warm praise for China for its pandemic response.</p> <p>The record of the two candidates offers deep reservoirs of material. They have both been complimentary towards a powerful trading partner with an appalling human rights record \u2013 though Trump\u2019s fawning over Xi is in a different league \u2013 and both have children in business, Hunter Biden and Ivanka Trump, who have used their fathers\u2019 coat-tails to acquire preferential treatment from Beijing.</p> <p>The assumption \u2013 shared by both campaigns \u2013 that any association with China is electoral poison is supported by the figures. A <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/04/21/u-s-views-of-china-increasingly-negative-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/\">Pew Research poll</a> published last month found that two-thirds of Americans had a negative view of China; that distrust is likely to have deepened since then, as the Trump administration has insisted on Chinese responsibility for the pandemic.</p> <p>Against that backdrop, the campaign has become a bidding war for the most hawkish China policies, with the president instinctively heading last week straight for the extreme end of the argument.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The US-China relationship is probably the most interconnected relationship on the planet, in terms of investment and manufacturing</p> <footer> <cite>Kurt Campbell, the Asia Group</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/may/15/trump-we-could-cut-off-the-whole-relationship-with-china-video\">We could cut off the whole relationship</a>,\u201d Trump told Fox News, claiming \u2013 without any hint of an explanation \u2013 that such a drastic decoupling would save the US $500bn.</p> <p>As the incumbent, he will be expected to match his rhetoric with actions, so the heated battle of a bitter election is likely to have significant effects on US-China relations, which could in turn have a devastating impact on the global economy and on hopes for multilateral cooperation, while boosting the small but growing risks of conflict.</p> <p>\u201cAll the signs suggest that the administration will be willing to go quite a bit further than it already has to try to shift blame on China for the pandemic, and to pursue policies that will portray it as hard-edged on China. And the central reason for that is that the alternative is that the president accepts blame on himself for his own domestic and international governance failings,\u201d said Mira Rapp-Hooper, an expert on security in the Asia-Pacific region at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not clear to me how this ends up,\u201d Kurt Campbell, former assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs, said. \u201cI actually think right now that both the American and Chinese standing have been hurt on the global stage. And it feels like we\u2019re fighting while Rome burns.\u201d</p> <p>Several analysts have talked about a new \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/05/15/is-us-china-cold-war-already-under-way/\">cold war</a>\u201d between the world\u2019s two biggest economies, but Campbell \u2013 who now runs a business consultancy and capital management firm called the Asia Group \u2013 argued that this great power rivalry will be even messier because they have become so integrated over the past three decades.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the framework of the cold war, because it suggests going back to something in the past. And the peculiarities of the US-Soviet relationship were such that we had very little connection, very little understanding with one another, very little travel, very little trade,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe US-China relationship is probably the most interconnected relationship on the planet, in terms of investment and manufacturing. So to do surgery on these conjoined twins would be incredibly difficult.\u201d</p> <p>That has not stopped the Trump administration from picking up a scalpel and making a start on \u201cdecoupling\u201d.</p> <p>The \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jan/15/us-china-trade-deal-trump-tariffs-global-risks-uk-inflation-business-live\">phase one</a>\u201d trade deal signed in January was a vague document that did little to resolve the trade tensions between the two countries. Now, its optimistic spirit, and the idea that there might be a \u201cphase two\u201d, is a fading memory.</p> <p>The Trump administration is contemplating a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/donald-trump-bank-of-china-debt-report\">series of punitive measures</a> against China in retaliation for its failure to contain the pandemic.

      "bodyText": "United States Foreign policy does not usually draw much attention in US election campaigns. It was given a few token minutes in the Democratic primary debates. But that was before coronavirus. Anti-China sentiment is now the primary fuel of Donald Trump\u2019s re-election effort, in the absence of a workable alternative. It will be increasingly hard to run on the economy, as the president had hoped, or on the administration\u2019s pandemic response, as the human cost of the debacle becomes clear. Sinophobia has proven all the more attractive an option as it claims to explain both failures. \u201cUnfortunately, this is sometimes the tunnelling logic of democratic systems,\u201d Jude Blanchette, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said. \u201cEven if it comes with pretty significant national collateral damage, when it comes down to political survival the bad drives out the good.\u201d On Friday, Trump supporters in the America First Action committee launched a new wave of attack ads in the swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, framing the Democratic challenger as \u201cBeijing Biden\u201d, using selective edits of the former vice-president\u2019s past remarks and Chinese-language commentary praising the \u201cToast of China\u201d. The Biden camp has aired some similar ads of its own, drawing on Trump\u2019s sometimes unctuous admiration for Xi Jinping, and his initially warm praise for China for its pandemic response. The record of the two candidates offers deep reservoirs of material. They have both been complimentary towards a powerful trading partner with an appalling human rights record \u2013 though Trump\u2019s fawning over Xi is in a different league \u2013 and both have children in business, Hunter Biden and Ivanka Trump, who have used their fathers\u2019 coat-tails to acquire preferential treatment from Beijing. The assumption \u2013 shared by both campaigns \u2013 that any association with China is electoral poison is supported by the figures. A Pew Research poll published last month found that two-thirds of Americans had a negative view of China; that distrust is likely to have deepened since then, as the Trump administration has insisted on Chinese responsibility for the pandemic. Against that backdrop, the campaign has become a bidding war for the most hawkish China policies, with the president instinctively heading last week straight for the extreme end of the argument. \u201cWe could cut off the whole relationship,\u201d Trump told Fox News, claiming \u2013 without any hint of an explanation \u2013 that such a drastic decoupling would save the US $500bn. As the incumbent, he will be expected to match his rhetoric with actions, so the heated battle of a bitter election is likely to have significant effects on US-China relations, which could in turn have a devastating impact on the global economy and on hopes for multilateral cooperation, while boosting the small but growing risks of conflict. \u201cAll the signs suggest that the administration will be willing to go quite a bit further than it already has to try to shift blame on China for the pandemic, and to pursue policies that will portray it as hard-edged on China. And the central reason for that is that the alternative is that the president accepts blame on himself for his own domestic and international governance failings,\u201d said Mira Rapp-Hooper, an expert on security in the Asia-Pacific region at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear to me how this ends up,\u201d Kurt Campbell, former assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs, said. \u201cI actually think right now that both the American and Chinese standing have been hurt on the global stage. And it feels like we\u2019re fighting while Rome burns.\u201d Several analysts have talked about a new \u201ccold war\u201d between the world\u2019s two biggest economies, but Campbell \u2013 who now runs a business consultancy and capital management firm called the Asia Group \u2013 argued that this great power rivalry will be even messier because they have become so integrated over the past three decades. \u201cI don\u2019t like the framework of the cold war, because it suggests going back to something in the past. And the peculiarities of the US-Soviet relationship were such that we had very little connection, very little understanding with one another, very little travel, very little trade,\u201d he said. \u201cThe US-China relationship is probably the most interconnected relationship on the planet, in terms of investment and manufacturing. So to do surgery on these conjoined twins would be incredibly difficult.\u201d That has not stopped the Trump administration from picking up a scalpel and making a start on \u201cdecoupling\u201d. The \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal signed in January was a vague document that did little to resolve the trade tensions between the two countries. Now, its optimistic spirit, and the idea that there might be a \u201cphase two\u201d, is a fading memory. The Trump administration is contemplating a series of punitive measures against China in retaliation for its failure to contain the pandemic. Options reportedly range from suing Chinese officials to skipping some repayment obligations on the $1tn the US owes China. Among the likely US measures are more sanctions, particularly on the hi-tech sector, more determined efforts to lock the Chinese communications giant Huawei out of western markets, and pressure on US companies to move their supply chain out of China. Hawks in the administration and in Congress are even talking about a US withdrawal from the embattled World Trade Organization. They see China\u2019s entry into the WTO in 2001 as the original sin underlying America\u2019s industrial decline. Most regional experts believe that the danger of a military confrontation remains remote, but both the US and China are building up arsenals. And the heat of nationalist sentiment will make it all the harder to control any incident in regions where their armed forces converge, such as the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea. Julian Borger China This week, President Xi Jinping will preside over the delayed opening of China\u2019s annual brief session of its \u201cparliament\u201d, the National People\u2019s Congress, a gathering of high pomp, long stretches of stifling boredom, but great political significance. The legislature itself is just a rubber stamp, but the government uses the two weeks it is in session to unveil economic and defence targets, shuffle top officials and publish new policies. For decades, it had met in March, until Covid-19 upended life in China. Its reconvening is the latest official signal that the country is back on track, a celebration of Beijing\u2019s \u2013 and by extension Xi\u2019s \u2013 victory over the virus. But alongside celebration of Chinese success, the ceremonies and speeches are likely to draw pointed contrasts with the deadly failures of western democracies, particularly China\u2019s biggest trading partner and rival, the United States of America. The communist leadership has been cultivating nationalism for many years: it was a convenient ideology to unify an officially atheist country as economic growth started to slow.

The lockdown meant he was forced to stop his daily visits.</p> <p>\u201cI used to wonder about what she\u2019d think of me not coming to see her,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought she might think we didn\u2019t want her any more, and that\u2019s why we put her in a home.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to keep doing this for much longer, I won\u2019t be able to stand it,\u201d said Mary Fletcher, 81, who is in her ninth week of lockdown in her flat in London. \u201cI\u2019m starting to feel that having Covid-19 might be preferable to isolation. Next week I think I\u2019m going to break it and see my family. I\u2019m now prepared to take that risk.\u201d Many older people in the UK are in lockdown alone. Being apart from family and friends, and often unable to leave the house because they are shielding, has left many struggling with isolation. \u201cEverything you\u2019re doing is on your own, and you start to realise how important it is to have human contact,\u201d Fletcher said. \u201cTo just have a hug, or give a hug, that sort of thing is important to human beings and if you\u2019re deprived of that, it does affect your wellbeing.\u201d Fletcher\u2019s granddaughter does her shopping for her but has to leave it on the doorstep and remain two metres away. Her 14-month-old great-grandson has learned to walk during the lockdown, and is just starting to form words. Mary is worried about missing out on his key milestones. For Thomas Allen, who lives in York, the pain of being separated from his family has been exacerbated by the loss of his wife, Elsie, who died a fortnight ago. They were married for nearly 59 years. The couple had never spent time apart since they met 60 years ago, except for three weeks he spent away each year while serving with the Territorial Army from the 1960s to the 1980s. Elsie had dementia and was living in a care home. The lockdown meant he was forced to stop his daily visits. \u201cI used to wonder about what she\u2019d think of me not coming to see her,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought she might think we didn\u2019t want her any more, and that\u2019s why we put her in a home. She couldn\u2019t understand what was going on in lockdown, that\u2019s why she gave up. She stopped eating and wouldn\u2019t take her medicine. I think the lockdown took her away from us.\u201d While Allen is in touch with his family every day, he is feeling \u201clow\u201d without them. \u201cI know they love me, but they can\u2019t come to give me a hug,\u201d he said. \u201cThey call and text every day, that\u2019s what keeps me going.\u201d For others, the withdrawal from the fresh air and green space tantalisingly offered by the outside world is taking its toll. Many older people have been instructed to shield because underlying health conditions put them at high risk of suffering from serious symptoms should they contract the virus. This group have been instructed to stay at home. \u201cI got quite upset when I was driving back from my last visit to the hospital, because the world looks so lovely at the moment,\u201d said Janet Boyd, 69. \u201cThe roadsides were full of cow parsley and wild flowers, I\u2019m missing the spring and the summer. I\u2019m very lucky because I have a garden, but it\u2019s not the same as being able to go out.\u201d Boyd has incurable cancer, and the lockdown is making her feel she is wasting valuable time. \u201cI\u2019m not yet 70, but I know my time might be limited,\u201d she said. \u201cTo not be able to enjoy the things I do enjoy, and see my family, that\u2019s hard. I\u2019m worried I might have less time with them than I would have.\u201d \u201cMy fear is that I\u2019ll get this virus, and I could die without ever seeing them,\u201d she added.

      "bodyText": "Less than a year after passing a secularism law forcing certain members of religious minorities to uncover their heads and faces, Quebec is now debating whether to force everybody to put masks on. As the province at the centre of Canada\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, Quebec is currently \u201cstrongly recommending\u201d that citizens wear masks \u2013 but the measure will not be mandatory. Asked why not, Horacio Arruda, the province\u2019s public health director, told reporters: \u201cYou need to have a good argument for infringing on individual rights for the sake of a collective right.\u201d But such arguments ring hollow to Nour Farhat, a Montreal lawyer whose dreams of being a Crown prosecutor were dashed after the Quebec government passed legislation last year barring certain public sector workers from wearing religious symbols at work. The law \u2013 known as Bill 21 \u2013 mainly affects Muslim women working in education, law and other public sectors. \u201cBill 21 violates the rights of religious minorities without a real or urgent situation. And now that we\u2019re in a real and urgent situation, the premier cares about violating people\u2019s rights,\u201d Farhat said. \u201cFor them, it was always OK to violate the rights of religious minorities.\u201d Bill 21 has always permitted masks for medical reasons, and government media representatives say their hesitancy on masks is not related to that law. But head and face coverings carry a certain political weight in Quebec. Recent years have seen multiple instances of people trying to snatch hijabs from women\u2019s heads in the province. And only last year did Montreal reverse a seven-year ban on people wearing masks at protests. The contradictions have inspired wry commentary: the Canadian satire website the Beaverton recently published a story headlined \u201cQuebec suddenly fine with people covering their faces\u201d. There is precedent for making masks mandatory, said the prominent civil rights lawyer Julius Grey, who said that the ban on smoking indoors was upheld despite suggestions that it infringed on aspects of the country\u2019s charter of rights. \u201cThe charter says \u2018life, liberty and security of the person\u2019. You can\u2019t just put the stress on liberty and forget life and security,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it would be lawful to require a mask reasonably [in enclosed spaces], as long as it\u2019s not done in a discriminatory manner.\u201d He added that physical distancing measures currently enacted may already violate some charter rights, such as freedom of association \u2013 albeit for good reason. Quebec has seen more cases of coronavirus and more deaths than any other region of Canada, but the provincial government has delivered mixed messages on whether masks help limit the spread of Covid-19. On 18 March, Arruda said in a minute-long video public service announcement: \u201cMasks don\u2019t prevent community transmission \u2026 If you want to protect yourself, it\u2019s not the mask that matters. Just wash your hands.\u201d A string of conflicting statements from provincial and federal officials followed, until Canada\u2019s chief public health officer, Dr Theresa Tam, said in early April that wearing masks in public would help limit the spread of Covid-19. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization have made similar statements. Globally, examples abound of communities that implemented mandatory masks. Jena, a German city of about 110,000, did so in late March and saw a swift slowdown in Covid-19 infection rates. Its approach has been so successful that it was able to reopen bars and restaurants this past week. A spokesperson for the Quebec government said there were no plans to make masks mandatory until scientific evidence is published showing that they reduce community transmission of Covid-19 and enough can be provided to supply the entire province. Meanwhile, Quebec\u2019s own public health institute has published reports strongly recommending everyone wear masks in public. Farhat said she found the bureaucratic back-and-forth frustrating and hypocritical. \u201cThis is life and death. This is the best example we can have for the government to infringe on human rights for a good reason \u2013 and the government won\u2019t make the call. This is really irresponsible,\u201d she said.",

A hard-fought battle over Aids drugs 20 years ago led to the World Trade Organization\u2019s Doha declaration on trade-related intellectual property (Trips) in favour of access to medicines for all, but the US, which has some of the world\u2019s biggest drug companies, has strongly opposed wording that would encourage the use of Trips.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/the-hunt-for-a-coronavirus-vaccine-a-perilous-and-uncertain-path\">The hunt for a coronavirus vaccine \u2013 a perilous and uncertain path</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Campaigners say the resolution expected to be passed by the world health assembly\u2019s 198 member states is along the right lines, but too weakly worded.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn general, it is a disappointment, appalling really.

It\u2019s one thing for a country to use its economic clout to buy preferential access to drugs or vaccines.

We continue to support public-private partnerships for product development, and approaches such as non-exclusive voluntary licensing which promote affordable access for all while also providing incentives to create life-changing vaccines.\u201d</p> \n<p>Costa Rica will launch a voluntary patent pool later this month. Its president, Carlos Alvarado Quesada, said at the WHO last week: \u201cThe pandemic attacks the same in each country regardless of whether you have the resources or not. It attacks people around the world in the same way,.</p> \n<p>\u201cOnly together with multilateralism, with that sort of leadership, can we defeat coronavirus, not with nationalism and being selfish.

Even more fraught have been attempts to reinforce countries\u2019 existing rights to break drug and vaccine company patent monopolies if they need to for the sake of public health. A hard-fought battle over Aids drugs 20 years ago led to the World Trade Organization\u2019s Doha declaration on trade-related intellectual property (Trips) in favour of access to medicines for all, but the US, which has some of the world\u2019s biggest drug companies, has strongly opposed wording that would encourage the use of Trips. Campaigners say the resolution expected to be passed by the world health assembly\u2019s 198 member states is along the right lines, but too weakly worded. \u201cIn general, it is a disappointment, appalling really. There was better text that was rejected,\u201d said Jamie Love, the director of the NGO Knowledge Ecology International. \u201cThe US, UK, Swiss and some others pushed against the WHO taking the lead in pushing for open licensing of patents and know-how for drugs and vaccines. \u201cIn a global crisis like this, that has such a massive impact on everyone, you would expect the WHO governing body to have the backbone to say no monopolies in this pandemic. It\u2019s one thing for a country to use its economic clout to buy preferential access to drugs or vaccines. It\u2019s another to prevent others from manufacturing and expanding global supply.\u201d Oxfam\u2019s health policy manager, Anna Marriott, said: \u201cThis week\u2019s letter calling for a people\u2019s vaccine, which was signed by more than 140 world leaders and experts, sets the bar for the scale of ambition we need to meet the challenge before us. \u201cAs we approach the final stages of this resolution, we need to see health ministers raise their game to match this ambition. Any government that tries to block or dilute this resolution is risking lives and standing on the wrong side of history.\u201d A UK government spokesman said: \u201cThe UK has long supported affordable and equitable access to essential medicines, including in low and middle-income countries. We continue to support public-private partnerships for product development, and approaches such as non-exclusive voluntary licensing which promote affordable access for all while also providing incentives to create life-changing vaccines.\u201d Costa Rica will launch a voluntary patent pool later this month. Its president, Carlos Alvarado Quesada, said at the WHO last week: \u201cThe pandemic attacks the same in each country regardless of whether you have the resources or not. It attacks people around the world in the same way,. \u201cOnly together with multilateralism, with that sort of leadership, can we defeat coronavirus, not with nationalism and being selfish. It is the time for solidarity. It is the time to work together to show humanity the best that we are made of, the opportunity to show our brotherhood as a whole.\u201d Wellcome published a poll on Sunday of 2,000 people in the UK which found 96% supported the idea that national governments should work together to ensure that treatments and vaccines can be manufactured in as many countries as possible and distributed globally to everyone who needs them. \u201cWe need vaccines and treatments that will work for the world, and any advances must be available to all countries equally, without exception,\u201d said Alex Harris, the head of global policy at Wellcome. \u201cNo country should consider reserving possible future vaccines and treatments for their use only.\u201d The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) trade body says companies already share their intellectual property with low-income countries. \u201cWe have not been included in these discussions and have limited understanding of what exactly is being proposed, and how it is different from the various institutions already facilitating sharing of data, know-how\u201d and intellectual property, it said in a statement. \u201cVoluntary patent pools already exist and many companies are already exploring collaborations and voluntary licences.\u201d The IFPMA also pointed out that it was already a founding partner in the ACT Accelerator, a global partnership designed to speed up research and development of promising and affordable interventions. \u201cThe creation of yet another new platform appears unneeded and would direct resources and energy away from key objectives. We have never needed innovation so much as now and this is probably the worst possible time to weaken intellectual property,\u201d it said. The invitation of Taiwan to the assembly, which has been blocked in recent years by China, has also triggered a dispute. Taiwan has a lot of support from countries including the US that say its handling of Covid-19 has been exemplary and it could teach the world a lot. Beijing, however, is pressuring other countries to block Taiwan, arguing it can only be represented if it accepts it is part of China.",

      "body": "<p>The writer and activist Elie Wiesel once remarked that the opposite of love is not hate, but indifference. Superficially at least, we seem to have taken his admonition to heart \u2013 particularly now, as the Covid-19 pandemic forces us to find new ways of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/mar/26/clap-for-carers-applauding-the-nhs-during-coronavirus-in-pictures\">balancing isolation with solidarity</a>. For perhaps the only time in our lives, we can mobilise and participate simply by remaining at home. The contribution of individual behavioural changes to the management of a global crisis \u2013 which ordinarily feels dispiritingly small \u2013 can now be graphed practically in real time. To isolate is, in a very real sense, to care.</p> <p>The problem, though, is that we\u2019ve been conditioned into publicly expressing our care. Coaxed through social media into a perpetual state of display, we seem<strong> </strong>to fear that silence and indifference are synonymous. The act of caring about something \u2013 a cause, a tragedy, a crisis \u2013 is intimately bound up with how we communicate that care. In isolation, no one can see our concern, and we can\u2019t gauge the commitment of others. As a result, our faith in each other becomes fragile.</p> <p>This fear that private concern might be read as indifference explains our growing taste for public performances of commitment: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/welsh-farmer-doing-91-laps-of-bungalow-on-91st-birthday-for-nhs-coronavirus\">fundraising laps</a> in restricted spaces; a weekly clap for the NHS. Even as these moments of shared sentiment are ritualised, they inflame an underlying discomfort: lockdown feels very much like captivity. What if, rather than choosing to stay home in the interests of the greater good, we have in fact been <em>kept</em> at home? When escape is a dangerous proposition, we take the easier route, flipping the role of prisoner by casting ourselves as its opposite: the cop.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/what-are-your-new-rights-during-englands-lockdown\">What are your new rights during England's lockdown?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Playing cop solves all of our problems at once. Not only do we shake off captivity by assuming the authority of a guard, we also conveniently communicate to everyone around us just how much we care \u2013 about health workers, pensioners, the finer points of social distancing.</p> <p>A hierarchy of virtue and significance emerges. There are those who simply stay home; there are those who stay home but also join in with organised displays of support and solidarity; and there are those who care so much they post aggressive signs in parks and pap <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/13/grant-shapps-would-not-get-on-crowed-bus-tube-coronavirus-lockdown-eased\">commuters on their way to work</a>. By being one of these latter people, we might think, we are surely among the least indifferent members of society. If we are the least indifferent then we must also be, by definition, the most loving.</p> <p>This is the tricky thing about love: it often manifests as fear. When we love someone, we fear their indifference. When we love a community, even a country, we fear that its decay or development will leave no place for us. With love, there is always a border, a place where what we love meets what is excluded. We soothe our fear by hardening our borders. We harden our borders by policing them. Compassion blurs with control. Soon, anything that addresses our fear \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-suspects-may-be-detained-under-uk-emergency-powers\">expanded police powers</a>, tougher punishments \u2013 sounds uncannily like the language of love.</p> <p>As we slowly begin to leave lockdown, our feelings about this period of our lives will change. We will emerge, those of us lucky enough to be safe where we were, into an altered and unstable world. What felt like confinement will feel, quite suddenly, like an embrace \u2013 a time when urgency and productivity were suspended; when there was little or no need to encounter strangers, with all their unpredictable, unmanageable behaviours. We were held in place, and it felt like being protected. As the familiar spaces of our world \u2013 our hair salons and train platforms, our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/gardening-helps-me-to-deal-with-things-englands-garden-centres-reopen-lockdown-coronavirus\">garden centres</a> and dreary offices \u2013 gradually repopulate, we will be forced once again to co-exist.</p> <p>Because we will be out of the habit, our contact with each other will feel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/lockdown-restrictions-solidarity-coronavirus-social-distancing\">messy, unpredictable, dangerous</a>. Far from rejoicing in our new-found freedoms, we may very well be terrified. Desperate for authority to reassure us with firm management, we find only conflicting messages, indecipherable infographics, empty exhortations to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/14/stay-alert-coronavirus-blame\">\u201c</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/14/stay-alert-coronavirus-blame\">stay alert\u201d</a>. If the government can\u2019t control the virus, what are we to do but control each other?</p> <p>The success of post-lockdown life, then, will depend not so much on negotiating the baffling minutiae of social distancing than as on balancing and pacifying our own most troubling instinct. Otherwise, at the very moment a better world becomes possible, we risk creating a worse one: a world of petty resentments and roiling suspicions, where we not only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/coronavirus-app-has-changed-the-way-the-isle-of-wight-sees-itself\">log into an app</a> to report our symptoms and movements, but to alert the authorities to the unmasked excursions and menacing coughs of our neighbours; where our social media feeds are just a rogue\u2019s gallery of strangers\u2019 transgressions; where we not only keep our distance, but demand, violently, that distance is kept from us.</p> <p>This narrowly interpersonal emphasis is a convenient distortion of reality. Our current state of failure hasn\u2019t sprung solely from minor infractions. We\u2019re not faced with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-rises-above-32000-to-highest-in-europe\">worst death toll in Europe</a> because your neighbour went twice to the park instead of once, or because someone two doors down flouted the rules to pursue an affair. We\u2019re mired in catastrophe as a direct result of the very thing our twee public merriment and furious finger-wagging hopes to obscure: the decades-long shadow of our structural indifference.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/11/boris-johnson-coronavirus-roadmap-sow-confusion\">Boris Johnson's coronavirus 'roadmap' will only sow confusion | Zoe Williams</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What we\u2019re experiencing at the hands of Covid-19 is nothing less than the exposure of our compassion\u2019s limits. Every fissure of inequality has become a vector of contagion. Those who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/02/lack-of-ppe-care-home-nurse-coronavirus-suzanne-loverseed-ian-oneal\">most need protection</a> have been left unprotected. Those most in need of shelter have been denied it. Those already on the precipice of precarity have tipped, unaided, into crisis. Generations of health inequalities, divided along <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/equality-watchdog-urged-investigate-impact-on-bame-people-london-mayor\">strata of race</a>, income and class have culminated in a grossly uneven distribution of suffering and mortality. Even the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/24/coronavirus-detected-particles-air-pollution\">unchecked pollution in the air</a> we breathe may have served as a vehicle for the virus. Our most cruelly policed borders \u2013 between who is cared for and who is excluded; who is counted and who is forgotten \u2013 are now gaping wounds.</p> <p>As we reckon with grief on an unimaginable scale, tragedy must serve as revelation. It will be no good directing our fear and need for order towards our neighbours and colleagues. Punishment will not bring healing. We will need, instead, to confront the yawning irony at the heart of our modern lives: the fact that, though each of us cares, though each of us is at pains to <em>show</em> that we care, we have nonetheless shaped a society that doesn\u2019t care at all. What we have made together has failed us. We must mourn its failure, and then channel our grief into rage, not at each other, but at the callously indifferent systems whose power we mistook for love.</p> <p>\u2022 Sam Byers is the author of Come Join our Disease, Perfidious Albion and Idiopathy</p>",

      "bodyText": "The writer and activist Elie Wiesel once remarked that the opposite of love is not hate, but indifference. Superficially at least, we seem to have taken his admonition to heart \u2013 particularly now, as the Covid-19 pandemic forces us to find new ways of balancing isolation with solidarity. For perhaps the only time in our lives, we can mobilise and participate simply by remaining at home. The contribution of individual behavioural changes to the management of a global crisis \u2013 which ordinarily feels dispiritingly small \u2013 can now be graphed practically in real time. To isolate is, in a very real sense, to care. The problem, though, is that we\u2019ve been conditioned into publicly expressing our care. Coaxed through social media into a perpetual state of display, we seem to fear that silence and indifference are synonymous. The act of caring about something \u2013 a cause, a tragedy, a crisis \u2013 is intimately bound up with how we communicate that care. In isolation, no one can see our concern, and we can\u2019t gauge the commitment of others. As a result, our faith in each other becomes fragile. This fear that private concern might be read as indifference explains our growing taste for public performances of commitment: fundraising laps in restricted spaces; a weekly clap for the NHS. Even as these moments of shared sentiment are ritualised, they inflame an underlying discomfort: lockdown feels very much like captivity. What if, rather than choosing to stay home in the interests of the greater good, we have in fact been kept at home? When escape is a dangerous proposition, we take the easier route, flipping the role of prisoner by casting ourselves as its opposite: the cop. Playing cop solves all of our problems at once. Not only do we shake off captivity by assuming the authority of a guard, we also conveniently communicate to everyone around us just how much we care \u2013 about health workers, pensioners, the finer points of social distancing. A hierarchy of virtue and significance emerges. There are those who simply stay home; there are those who stay home but also join in with organised displays of support and solidarity; and there are those who care so much they post aggressive signs in parks and pap commuters on their way to work. By being one of these latter people, we might think, we are surely among the least indifferent members of society. If we are the least indifferent then we must also be, by definition, the most loving. This is the tricky thing about love: it often manifests as fear. When we love someone, we fear their indifference. When we love a community, even a country, we fear that its decay or development will leave no place for us. With love, there is always a border, a place where what we love meets what is excluded. We soothe our fear by hardening our borders. We harden our borders by policing them. Compassion blurs with control. Soon, anything that addresses our fear \u2013 expanded police powers, tougher punishments \u2013 sounds uncannily like the language of love. As we slowly begin to leave lockdown, our feelings about this period of our lives will change. We will emerge, those of us lucky enough to be safe where we were, into an altered and unstable world. What felt like confinement will feel, quite suddenly, like an embrace \u2013 a time when urgency and productivity were suspended; when there was little or no need to encounter strangers, with all their unpredictable, unmanageable behaviours. We were held in place, and it felt like being protected. As the familiar spaces of our world \u2013 our hair salons and train platforms, our garden centres and dreary offices \u2013 gradually repopulate, we will be forced once again to co-exist. Because we will be out of the habit, our contact with each other will feel messy, unpredictable, dangerous. Far from rejoicing in our new-found freedoms, we may very well be terrified. Desperate for authority to reassure us with firm management, we find only conflicting messages, indecipherable infographics, empty exhortations to \u201cstay alert\u201d. If the government can\u2019t control the virus, what are we to do but control each other? The success of post-lockdown life, then, will depend not so much on negotiating the baffling minutiae of social distancing than as on balancing and pacifying our own most troubling instinct. Otherwise, at the very moment a better world becomes possible, we risk creating a worse one: a world of petty resentments and roiling suspicions, where we not only log into an app to report our symptoms and movements, but to alert the authorities to the unmasked excursions and menacing coughs of our neighbours; where our social media feeds are just a rogue\u2019s gallery of strangers\u2019 transgressions; where we not only keep our distance, but demand, violently, that distance is kept from us. This narrowly interpersonal emphasis is a convenient distortion of reality. Our current state of failure hasn\u2019t sprung solely from minor infractions. We\u2019re not faced with the worst death toll in Europe because your neighbour went twice to the park instead of once, or because someone two doors down flouted the rules to pursue an affair. We\u2019re mired in catastrophe as a direct result of the very thing our twee public merriment and furious finger-wagging hopes to obscure: the decades-long shadow of our structural indifference. What we\u2019re experiencing at the hands of Covid-19 is nothing less than the exposure of our compassion\u2019s limits. Every fissure of inequality has become a vector of contagion. Those who most need protection have been left unprotected. Those most in need of shelter have been denied it. Those already on the precipice of precarity have tipped, unaided, into crisis. Generations of health inequalities, divided along strata of race, income and class have culminated in a grossly uneven distribution of suffering and mortality. Even the unchecked pollution in the air we breathe may have served as a vehicle for the virus. Our most cruelly policed borders \u2013 between who is cared for and who is excluded; who is counted and who is forgotten \u2013 are now gaping wounds. As we reckon with grief on an unimaginable scale, tragedy must serve as revelation. It will be no good directing our fear and need for order towards our neighbours and colleagues. Punishment will not bring healing. We will need, instead, to confront the yawning irony at the heart of our modern lives: the fact that, though each of us cares, though each of us is at pains to show that we care, we have nonetheless shaped a society that doesn\u2019t care at all. What we have made together has failed us. We must mourn its failure, and then channel our grief into rage, not at each other, but at the callously indifferent systems whose power we mistook for love. \u2022 Sam Byers is the author of Come Join our Disease, Perfidious Albion and Idiopathy",

There is also the release of a chunky, eponymous monograph that traces her idiosyncratic creative output, with commentary from the likes of Spike Jonze, Carrie Brownstein and David Byrne. She lives in Los Angeles with the director Mike Mills and their son, Hopper.</p> <p><strong>How are you coping with lockdown in LA?<br></strong>You know, holding up. I\u2019m healthy, as is my family. And now we\u2019re a bit more used to this new schedule, wherein I teach my child school instead of that child going to school.</p> <p><strong>How\u2019s home-schooling going?<br></strong>It\u2019s a little worrisome.

      "bodyText": "Pubs and restaurants in England could be given permission to sell food and drink from street stalls outside their premises in the coming weeks, as the government tries to reopen some sectors of the economy. The communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, is preparing to grant a \u201cblanket permission\u201d, allowing food and drink outlets that already have a licence to set out tables and chairs on the pavement to sell from outdoor stalls. Government sources confirmed a report in the Sunday Telegraph that said ministers hope the change will allow for a \u201cmore vibrant style of continental town centres in the summer\u201d. A week after unveiling his \u201cstay alert\u201d slogan, and a series of minor changes to the rules about outdoor exercise and meeting up with friends, Boris Johnson has acknowledged the difficulties in communicating the new approach. \u201cI understand that people will feel frustrated with some of the new rules,\u201d the prime minister wrote in the Mail on Sunday. \u201cWe are trying to do something that has never had to be done before \u2013 moving the country out of a full lockdown, in a way which is safe and does not risk sacrificing all of your hard work. \u201cI recognise what we are now asking is more complex than simply staying at home \u2013 but this is a complex problem and we need to trust in the good sense of the British people.\u201d With scientific advice suggesting transmission of the disease is much lower outdoors, the government is keen to restart aspects of the economy that can function in the open air. Garden centres, tennis courts and golf courses have already been allowed to reopen in England, provided the public continue to maintain a two-metre distance from those outside their household. Street markets selling food and drink are already allowed to trade, and restaurants and cafes have been permitted to offer takeaways throughout the lockdown. But pubs and restaurants are set to remain closed to the public until at least 4 July, when the third step in the government\u2019s lockdown easing plan is due to take place, if progress in tackling the infection allows. Official figures published last week showed a 2% fall in GDP in the first three months of the year, despite the fact the shutdown only came into force in late March \u2013 and ministers have been discussing with unions and business groups the safest way of reopening businesses where possible. Employees from some industries, including manufacturing and food, are now being \u201cactively encouraged\u201d to return to the workplace in England, where new safety procedures have been put in place. The government announced last week that it had set up five taskforces to discuss how the various types of business slated to reopen from July will need to adapt to work safely. The five sectors covered are: Pubs and restaurants. Nonessential shops. Recreation and leisure. Places of worship. International air travel. The government view is that such businesses and areas should reopen as soon as possible \u201cwhen the scientific advice provided allows us to\u201d, but that their settings provide particular difficulties with distancing and hygiene.",

Controversially, the deal makes the former vice-president, Abdul Rashid Dostum, who is accused of ordering the torture and rape of a political rival, marshal of the Afghan armed forces and a senior government official. The deal comes after heavy pressure from the US to resolve the eight-month standoff at the top of Afghan politics, to smooth the way for a new administration to start US-brokered peace talks with the Taliban. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, withdrew $1bn in aid after the two long-term rivals refused to compromise and held parallel presidential inaugurations a few hundred metres apart earlier this year. Ghani is to stay on as president, but give Abdullah control of half the cabinet posts and leadership of the office managing a US-brokered peace process, where he will have five deputies. Abdullah on Sunday said the deal was not a \u201cprivilege handout\u201d and came at a very difficult time when the nation faces serious threats. Afghanistan is experiencing a rapid spread of coronavirus and dozens were killed in attacks by militants last week, including on a maternity ward. \u201cWe now need to come together as a nation, strive to seek solutions that are practical,\u201d Abdullah said.

      "body": "<p>About a month ago, many people I know on the political left were brimming with the belief that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19 crisis</a> opened the way for a watershed conversation about deep social change. Now, as the full horror of the UK\u2019s coronavirus experience becomes clearer and we begin to understand an all-enveloping crisis whose effects will be felt for years, that mood seems to have been supplanted by a pained mixture of anxiety and fatalism. On a bad day, our national nightmare now appears so deep and complex as to feel not just depressing, but insurmountable.</p> <p>But from a somewhat unlikely source, there was recently a note of hope. Around the time of the recent VE Day celebrations, the journalist and historian Max Hastings \u2013 something of a freethinker, but also someone with a classic establishment background \u2013 wrote a piece for <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-joy-of-ve-day-masked-a-hunger-for-change-xhkxvlrpx\">the Times</a>. His jumping-off point was the social revolution that began in 1945, but he quickly moved his focus to 2020. \u201cThe present crisis seems destined again to change the face of Britain, unleashing demands for social, political and economic reform unprecedented in our memories,\u201d said this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/24/boris-johnson-prime-minister-tory-party-britain\">one-time editor</a> of the Daily Telegraph. To him, the immediate future was clear: \u201cThe polo season, figuratively speaking, is over.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The dysfunctional centralisation of power in England, a blind spot for both the left and right, needs to be reversed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But is it? Last week brought the awful symbolism of golf and tennis clubs reopening for business and the employers of nannies being given the green light to bring them back into their homes, just as many of the people told to return to work were grimly crowding on to public transport. On Wednesday, the Telegraph <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/13/treasury-tax-hikes-pay-freezes-covid-19-costs-budget-deficit-spending\">published</a> details of internal Treasury documents proposing a two-year public sector pay freeze; the next day, the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/14/councils-in-england-fear-they-will-have-to-make-cuts-of-20\">highlighted</a> the huge shortfalls now facing English councils. Boris Johnson may <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8HC5sOHzus\">have recently</a> held out the prospect of a post-crisis Britain that would be \u201cmore generous and sharing\u201d, but these auguries are hardly promising.</p> <p>And so, as always, attention turns to the Labour party. Judged by the criteria of the weekly political cycle and the ritual of prime minister\u2019s questions, Keir Starmer is so far doing very well indeed. For what such things are worth, his recent net approval rating <a href=\"https://www.indy100.com/article/keir-starmer-approval-rating-boris-johnson-opinion-poll-labour-yougov-9511586\">exceeded Boris Johnson\u2019s</a>, which has seemingly encouraged the age-old Labour belief that the first prerequisite of serious politics is the appearance of measured statesmanship.</p> <p>That is true, as far as it goes. But Labour\u2019s history suggests that a fixation on respectability often blurs into a reluctance to embrace any thinking deemed too adventurous.

      "bodyText": "About a month ago, many people I know on the political left were brimming with the belief that the Covid-19 crisis opened the way for a watershed conversation about deep social change. Now, as the full horror of the UK\u2019s coronavirus experience becomes clearer and we begin to understand an all-enveloping crisis whose effects will be felt for years, that mood seems to have been supplanted by a pained mixture of anxiety and fatalism. On a bad day, our national nightmare now appears so deep and complex as to feel not just depressing, but insurmountable. But from a somewhat unlikely source, there was recently a note of hope. Around the time of the recent VE Day celebrations, the journalist and historian Max Hastings \u2013 something of a freethinker, but also someone with a classic establishment background \u2013 wrote a piece for the Times. His jumping-off point was the social revolution that began in 1945, but he quickly moved his focus to 2020. \u201cThe present crisis seems destined again to change the face of Britain, unleashing demands for social, political and economic reform unprecedented in our memories,\u201d said this one-time editor of the Daily Telegraph. To him, the immediate future was clear: \u201cThe polo season, figuratively speaking, is over.\u201d But is it? Last week brought the awful symbolism of golf and tennis clubs reopening for business and the employers of nannies being given the green light to bring them back into their homes, just as many of the people told to return to work were grimly crowding on to public transport. On Wednesday, the Telegraph published details of internal Treasury documents proposing a two-year public sector pay freeze; the next day, the Guardian highlighted the huge shortfalls now facing English councils. Boris Johnson may have recently held out the prospect of a post-crisis Britain that would be \u201cmore generous and sharing\u201d, but these auguries are hardly promising. And so, as always, attention turns to the Labour party. Judged by the criteria of the weekly political cycle and the ritual of prime minister\u2019s questions, Keir Starmer is so far doing very well indeed. For what such things are worth, his recent net approval rating exceeded Boris Johnson\u2019s, which has seemingly encouraged the age-old Labour belief that the first prerequisite of serious politics is the appearance of measured statesmanship. That is true, as far as it goes. But Labour\u2019s history suggests that a fixation on respectability often blurs into a reluctance to embrace any thinking deemed too adventurous. This instinct may have returned in the wake of a historic election defeat centred on a campaign that presented political ambition as an incoherent splurge, and the kind of radicalism that blurred into the obnoxious fringes of the ultra-left. It is still too early to tell, but the result may yet be a leadership clinging to safety, when the moment will sooner or later demand something much more thoroughgoing. The basics hardly involve a huge leap of imagination: to some extent, they mix what might be salvaged from recent Labour politics with ideas that have long been in circulation way beyond the traditional left. The lives of people at the bottom of most socio-economic hierarchies will soon need to be lastingly improved, perhaps via an initial minimum income guarantee of the kind embraced by the coalition government in Spain. Given that we are unlikely to be able to revive a featherweight labour market based around retail and services, the time ought to be ripe for the economy to be pushed at last towards a green new deal, and the revival of manufacturing. The dysfunctional centralisation of power in England, a blind spot for both the left and right, needs to be reversed; austerity needs to be conclusively nailed as the dogma of self-harm it always is; and we need to deal, at last, with the deep structural racism towards the people most severely affected by the virus. As crucial as all those issues focused on hospitals and care homes remain, the fundamentals of public health are always about much more: the way that institutions often reflect deep-seated prejudice, and basic matters of what some people call political economy.

      "body": "<p>Labour is drawing up ambitious proposals to rescue the post-coronavirus economy with a radical green recovery plan focused on helping young people who lose their jobs by retraining them in green industries.</p> <p>Seeking to seize the initiative on the country\u2019s future direction once the pandemic abates, Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, has called for the plans to include creating a \u201czero-carbon army of young people\u201d doing work such as planting trees, insulating buildings and working on green technologies.</p> <p>Miliband told the Guardian that the combination of the economic damage caused by the virus and the imperative to tackle issues such as the climate emergency and pollution required ambition on the scale of Clement Attlee\u2019s postwar Labour government.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a contemporary equivalent of what happened after 1945,\u201d Miliband said. \u201cIt\u2019s never too early to start thinking about the future, to think about what kind of world we want to build as we emerge from this crisis. I think we owe it to have a sort of reassessment of what really matters in our society, and how we build something better for the future.\u201d</p> <p>Under a timetable coordinated by Miliband and the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, Labour will this week start a rapid consultation with businesses, workers, unions and others on how a green recovery could happen. Proposals will then be put to the government.</p> <p>\u201cI think we should be aiming for the most ambitious climate recovery plan in the world,\u201d Miliband said. \u201cThat should be nothing less than the government\u2019s ambition.

      "bodyText": "Labour is drawing up ambitious proposals to rescue the post-coronavirus economy with a radical green recovery plan focused on helping young people who lose their jobs by retraining them in green industries. Seeking to seize the initiative on the country\u2019s future direction once the pandemic abates, Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, has called for the plans to include creating a \u201czero-carbon army of young people\u201d doing work such as planting trees, insulating buildings and working on green technologies. Miliband told the Guardian that the combination of the economic damage caused by the virus and the imperative to tackle issues such as the climate emergency and pollution required ambition on the scale of Clement Attlee\u2019s postwar Labour government. \u201cIt\u2019s a contemporary equivalent of what happened after 1945,\u201d Miliband said. \u201cIt\u2019s never too early to start thinking about the future, to think about what kind of world we want to build as we emerge from this crisis. I think we owe it to have a sort of reassessment of what really matters in our society, and how we build something better for the future.\u201d Under a timetable coordinated by Miliband and the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, Labour will this week start a rapid consultation with businesses, workers, unions and others on how a green recovery could happen. Proposals will then be put to the government. \u201cI think we should be aiming for the most ambitious climate recovery plan in the world,\u201d Miliband said. \u201cThat should be nothing less than the government\u2019s ambition. The old argument that you can have economic success or environmental care is just completely wrong.\u201d Miliband predicted that such an approach would be welcomed by a population already living through a period of significant change, and where many people had welcomed side-effects of the lockdown such as better air quality. The fact that people had grown used to seeing ministers defer to scientists on coronavirus meant they might now expect the same approach on the climate emergency, Miliband argued. \u201cI do think that there\u2019s a public mood about this,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, people want to get out of lockdown as soon as it is safe to do so, but also, having been through what they\u2019ve been through, they want something better. \u201cWe need a new deal for our healthcare workers and essential workers, obviously. But we also need a new deal around the quality of people\u2019s lives. That\u2019s what this is about.\u201d The plans would build on elements of Labour\u2019s \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d plan, put together under Jeremy Corbyn, which calls for a zero-carbon economy by 2030, but with an urgency and focus reflecting the post-Covid-19 economic situation. Citing forecasts from the Resolution Foundation that more than 600,000 more young people could become unemployed this year because of coronavirus, Miliband said one policy should be a scheme in which the government would pay the wages of young workers in green industries for a period. This could also involve retraining older people, Miliband said, saying that there should be an ambition to \u201cleave no worker behind\u201d in any transition towards a different economy. He added: \u201cBut we know that the longer young people stay out of work, the more it blights their future prospects. We need a sort of zero-carbon army of young people doing the things that we know we need to do anyway. \u201cMy first priority would be to say to young people, \u2018We\u2019re going to find you fulfilling, decently paid work which is going to make a contribution to this absolutely vital cause that we face.\u2019 I think that\u2019s step one in the emergency.\u201d A lot of the plans could be adapted by particular regions, for example if there were areas such as the south-west of England where significant numbers of people had lost jobs in tourism and hospitality and needed retraining. There had been concern among some parts of the party that the shadow cabinet had failed to highlight the benefits of a radical green recovery \u2013 and its job-creating capacity \u2013 in the initial stages of the coronavirus crisis. However, Miliband said the initial focus had been on \u201cthe rescue phase\u201d of coronavirus on the economy, such as scrutinising the furlough scheme, with planning for a subsequent \u201crecovery and renewal phrase\u201d starting now. The Labour for a Green New Deal group welcomed Miliband\u2019s announcement, but said a just green transition must be at the heart of the party\u2019s economic policies. It called on Labour to push for public ownership of failing carbon-intensive industries. \u201cWith the oil and aviation industries in freefall, Labour should be pushing now for climate bailouts, using public ownership to wind down air routes and fossil fuel extraction,\u201d said the group\u2019s Lauren Townsend. \u201cKeir Starmer pledged to \u2018hardwire the Green New Deal into everything we do\u2019 \u2013 that has to mean taking on the big polluters.\u201d",

It is as if someone has emptied an enormous bag of confetti across the landscape, the white specks clustering in the folds of the valleys, extending outwards for miles in long, snaking tendrils.</p> <p>These dots \u2013 separated in their own plot and sometimes accompanied by the orange rectangle of a tin-roofed shack, visible when you zoom in close \u2013 are yurts (or <em><a href=\"http://www.mongoliagercamps.net/home/pages/about_mongolia_ger\">gers</a></em> in Mongolian). For thousands of years, these transportable tents, made of wooden latticework wrapped with insulating felt and canvas, have been the house type of choice for the Mongolian herders on the plains. But the nomadic tent-based mindset is not something easily given up when herders move to the city \u2013 with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/05/mongolian-herders-moving-to-city-climate-change\">problematic results</a>.</p> <p>\u201cMongolia is the least densely populated country in the world,\u201d says Badruun Gardi, who grew up in Ulaanbaatar and in <a href=\"https://gerhub.org/\">2016 founded Ger</a><a href=\"https://gerhub.org/\">Hub</a>, a nonprofit social enterprise that helps people adjust to the challenges of urban life. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a herder, you can go for miles and miles without reaching another family.

The 13th-century conqueror Genghis Khan ruled his vast empire from a nine-metre-wide yurt, while Ulaanbaatar itself used to be a nomadic settlement, formed by thousands of tents gathering around a movable monastery, following wherever the herds of livestock decided to travel. The Soviets attempted to formalise the capital in the 1920s, changing its name from Urga (Ulaanbaatar means \u201cRed Hero\u201d), building concrete blocks of flats and setting out an urban grid, which was consolidated in the postwar era. But, as thousands have flocked to the city in recent years, driven by the loss of livestock and promises of better education, healthcare and job prospects,<strong> </strong>the capital has expanded outwards in all directions as a sprawling ger-opolis. The adjustment from life on the open steppe to the hustle of the big city<strong> </strong>clearly takes some getting used to.</p> <p>For starters, the world outside the ger is no longer rolling grassland, but a small private plot, encircled by a two-metre-high fence. City residents must pay for water and fuel, rely on transportation and manage their waste. Their individual actions have an impact on others, sometimes for the first time in their lives; they encounter common problems that become the responsibility of a collective body of people.

      "bodyText": "Visit Ulaanbaatar on Google Earth \u2013 the only way most of us are likely to get there for some time \u2013 and you will find that the Mongolian capital looks like no other city. Scattered around the Soviet-era urban centre are hundreds of thousands of tiny white dots. It is as if someone has emptied an enormous bag of confetti across the landscape, the white specks clustering in the folds of the valleys, extending outwards for miles in long, snaking tendrils. These dots \u2013 separated in their own plot and sometimes accompanied by the orange rectangle of a tin-roofed shack, visible when you zoom in close \u2013 are yurts (or gers in Mongolian). For thousands of years, these transportable tents, made of wooden latticework wrapped with insulating felt and canvas, have been the house type of choice for the Mongolian herders on the plains. But the nomadic tent-based mindset is not something easily given up when herders move to the city \u2013 with problematic results. \u201cMongolia is the least densely populated country in the world,\u201d says Badruun Gardi, who grew up in Ulaanbaatar and in 2016 founded GerHub, a nonprofit social enterprise that helps people adjust to the challenges of urban life. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a herder, you can go for miles and miles without reaching another family. You don\u2019t have to think about what living in a confined space with hundreds or thousands of people means. It\u2019s the biggest challenge we face as a country.\u201d The idea of a fixed capital has always been a strange concept for this nation of nomadic herders. The 13th-century conqueror Genghis Khan ruled his vast empire from a nine-metre-wide yurt, while Ulaanbaatar itself used to be a nomadic settlement, formed by thousands of tents gathering around a movable monastery, following wherever the herds of livestock decided to travel. The Soviets attempted to formalise the capital in the 1920s, changing its name from Urga (Ulaanbaatar means \u201cRed Hero\u201d), building concrete blocks of flats and setting out an urban grid, which was consolidated in the postwar era. But, as thousands have flocked to the city in recent years, driven by the loss of livestock and promises of better education, healthcare and job prospects, the capital has expanded outwards in all directions as a sprawling ger-opolis. The adjustment from life on the open steppe to the hustle of the big city clearly takes some getting used to. For starters, the world outside the ger is no longer rolling grassland, but a small private plot, encircled by a two-metre-high fence. City residents must pay for water and fuel, rely on transportation and manage their waste. Their individual actions have an impact on others, sometimes for the first time in their lives; they encounter common problems that become the responsibility of a collective body of people. These social challenges are exacerbated by a host of practical issues: there is no running water in the ger districts, sewerage or central heating. In winter, when temperatures can plummet to -40C, each household burns around three to five tonnes of coal, making Ulaanbaatar one of the most polluted cities in the world. And the scale of the challenge is only increasing. \u201cPeople tend to think of the ger districts as these fringe slum areas,\u201d says Gardi. \u201cBut they represent over 60% of the entire population of the city, and they\u2019re growing by 30,000 people every year.\u201d Gardi founded GerHub to help bring a sense of pride back to the ger districts. After a few years of working in whatever spaces it could find, the organisation\u2019s educational and social outreach programme has a new home, in the form of a contemporary take on the traditional ger, designed by the Hong Kong architecture studio Rural Urban Framework (RUF).

      "body": "<p>I\u2019m sitting down to write this having just cleaned fox poo out of the tiny grooves in the soles<strong> </strong>of my four-year-old\u2019s sandals. She also, somehow, smeared it all over her legs, her dress, my legs, my shorts. The only plus I can take from it is that, for once in our crowded corner of south London, social distancing was not an issue.</p> <p>Of course, even in non-coronavirus times, 98% of anecdotes about young children end in someone being covered in something or other. But for many parents \u2013 at which point I insert an enormous caveat to make it clear that I\u2019m talking about those who haven\u2019t been infected, or made redundant, and aren\u2019t frontline workers, and are extremely lucky enough to still be operating in a strange bubble of \u201cnormal\u201d<strong> </strong>\u2013<strong> </strong>I\u2019d suspect that the greatest challenges of the past few weeks, and moments of profoundest despair, have come in the kitchen.</p> <p>Cooking for your children can be a dispiriting experience. There\u2019s often a magical window when they are around two, where they eat all sorts of exotic things: green vegetables, non-white food generally, Italian dishes that don\u2019t begin with \u201cp\u201d. But gradually, imperceptibly, I have found my kids becoming entrenched in their tastes, suspicious of the unfamiliar. I\u2019m not talking about olives and kimchi; just getting them to eat some courgette involves agreeing to a Peppa Pig all-nighter in return.</p> <p>Not long ago, but BC (before coronavirus), I was moaning to a colleague about it, a serious home cook, a tweezers-and-soda-siphon guy. Also, his children are older, teenagers. I wanted to know if it got any easier. \u201cYou have to think of it like being a line cook,\u201d he replied, years of pain in his voice. Your job is not to be showy. It\u2019s to do your bit and get the job done: to make peace with cooking the same meal again and again. Innovation or experimentation were neither expected nor required from your customers (that is, your offspring).</p> <p>I have<strong> </strong>thought about this conversation from time to time after coronavirus took hold, and especially since the schools closed in March, when two major changes became apparent. First, demand: I went from having to supply my children not with two meals a day, but three, plus morning and afternoon snacks (though they helpfully remind me of snack-time by growing fangs and clawing at the fridge, without fail, at 11am and 3pm). The other disruption was supply. Just before we realised how serious the pandemic was, my girlfriend and I raised our eyebrows at friends who went to Asda at 7am on a Sunday morning to stock up. Within days, we were flooded with images of whole aisles of supermarkets cleared out. Toilet roll went first, then pasta, rice, flour, tinned tomatoes. You know all this.</p> <p>The experience of seeing this unfold did, I understand looking back, send me a bit mad. It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 (most things about parenthood are) but when you have children it\u2019s hard not to become convinced that your main responsibility now \u2013 perhaps the only thing that really matters \u2013 is to keep them alive and well. Coronavirus may have made this more real and present than usual for me, but in truth it\u2019s hardwired. I\u2019m happier when my kids have eaten well, secure in the knowledge that whatever else I\u2019m getting wrong, that part I\u2019m not screwing up.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t stockpile or panic buy \u2013 not particularly for moral reasons but, in part, because we\u2019ve only got a small freezer and limited shelf space. But I did find myself checking the websites of online shopping companies obsessively: first thing in the morning, my last act before bed, and some days a dozen times in between. I should add here that the online food suppliers and their delivery drivers have done an incredible job of reorganising their systems and keeping things as smooth as they could. My children will never know, or appreciate, how close they came to <em>two days in a row</em> without bananas.</p> <p>Many days, cooking and clearing up after the kids has<strong> </strong>felt like a full-time job (actually worse: it starts at 7am, goes on till past 10pm, and you don\u2019t get half an hour to mull over the perfect phrasing of an email). It is<strong> </strong>exhausting, relentless and relentlessly thankless, as any parent without additional childcare in the normal run of things already knows well. I\u2019ve been, frankly, astonished at my kids\u2019 inability to sit at a table for longer than 4.5 seconds without breaking out into song, or wrestling each other, or nipping to their bedroom to get something \u201cvery important\u201d like a small piece of string, or a plastic fish, or a Sylvanian Families Halloween slide set (don\u2019t ask). In order to speed up the four-year-old\u2019s eating, my girlfriend has invented a game in which she pretends to be a toothbrush (from Texas, I think) who wants nothing more than to \u201cstop\u201d our daughter having any more dinner (full rules available on request), which is ultimately very effective but also makes me want to jump out of the window.</p> <p>But as time goes on, I\u2019ve started to make my peace with the situation.<strong> </strong>Accepting my role as, in Bill Buford\u2019s words, a kitchen slave, I listen more to what my kids want to eat, rather than bending them to my will. Feeling consulted, they seem to become more open to trying things. Some dinners have been disasters \u2013 an attempt to pitch aubergine parmigiana as \u201cpizza without the crust\u201d didn\u2019t fly \u2013<strong> </strong>but the next morning they just eat a double breakfast. And it\u2019s made me more resourceful: we found a huge patch of wild garlic in a nearby wood, and the kids just about tolerated the pesto we made with it. I dug out various packets of dried pulses from the back of the cupboard, one of which had a best-before date of 2015 and I could only cook by putting instructions through Google Translate, but which were, nonetheless, delicious.</p> <p>On the radio, I heard someone compare life during coronavirus to being on a cruise ship: the three meals provided a structure to a day that otherwise might be disconcertingly free and unhinged.

Sunday night is dress-up dinner night: we do it not to be la-di-da so much as to ensure that our tracksuit bottoms don\u2019t wear out from overuse. Baking kills time and we do some of that: banana bread, soda bread, lots of biscuits. The kids are<strong> </strong>interested for around a minute and a half, drift off, and return to lick the spoons. I haven\u2019t<strong> </strong>made sourdough, unlike everyone else on social media apparently, mainly because it\u2019s too much of a faff, but also because I haven\u2019t got over my Electra complex of killing my \u201cmother\u201d back in 2017.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15a7806a369a7f9cdb128ef8b072ce0dc40d9c79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15a7806a369a7f9cdb128ef8b072ce0dc40d9c79/8_0_1495_1494/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coronavirus family cooking feature illustrations OFM Observer Food Monthly\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If there\u2019s been a focal point so far, it was my eldest daughter\u2019s seventh birthday.

      "bodyText": "I\u2019m sitting down to write this having just cleaned fox poo out of the tiny grooves in the soles of my four-year-old\u2019s sandals. She also, somehow, smeared it all over her legs, her dress, my legs, my shorts. The only plus I can take from it is that, for once in our crowded corner of south London, social distancing was not an issue. Of course, even in non-coronavirus times, 98% of anecdotes about young children end in someone being covered in something or other. But for many parents \u2013 at which point I insert an enormous caveat to make it clear that I\u2019m talking about those who haven\u2019t been infected, or made redundant, and aren\u2019t frontline workers, and are extremely lucky enough to still be operating in a strange bubble of \u201cnormal\u201d \u2013 I\u2019d suspect that the greatest challenges of the past few weeks, and moments of profoundest despair, have come in the kitchen. Cooking for your children can be a dispiriting experience. There\u2019s often a magical window when they are around two, where they eat all sorts of exotic things: green vegetables, non-white food generally, Italian dishes that don\u2019t begin with \u201cp\u201d. But gradually, imperceptibly, I have found my kids becoming entrenched in their tastes, suspicious of the unfamiliar. I\u2019m not talking about olives and kimchi; just getting them to eat some courgette involves agreeing to a Peppa Pig all-nighter in return. Not long ago, but BC (before coronavirus), I was moaning to a colleague about it, a serious home cook, a tweezers-and-soda-siphon guy. Also, his children are older, teenagers. I wanted to know if it got any easier. \u201cYou have to think of it like being a line cook,\u201d he replied, years of pain in his voice. Your job is not to be showy. It\u2019s to do your bit and get the job done: to make peace with cooking the same meal again and again. Innovation or experimentation were neither expected nor required from your customers (that is, your offspring). I have thought about this conversation from time to time after coronavirus took hold, and especially since the schools closed in March, when two major changes became apparent. First, demand: I went from having to supply my children not with two meals a day, but three, plus morning and afternoon snacks (though they helpfully remind me of snack-time by growing fangs and clawing at the fridge, without fail, at 11am and 3pm). The other disruption was supply. Just before we realised how serious the pandemic was, my girlfriend and I raised our eyebrows at friends who went to Asda at 7am on a Sunday morning to stock up. Within days, we were flooded with images of whole aisles of supermarkets cleared out. Toilet roll went first, then pasta, rice, flour, tinned tomatoes. You know all this. The experience of seeing this unfold did, I understand looking back, send me a bit mad. It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 (most things about parenthood are) but when you have children it\u2019s hard not to become convinced that your main responsibility now \u2013 perhaps the only thing that really matters \u2013 is to keep them alive and well. Coronavirus may have made this more real and present than usual for me, but in truth it\u2019s hardwired. I\u2019m happier when my kids have eaten well, secure in the knowledge that whatever else I\u2019m getting wrong, that part I\u2019m not screwing up. I didn\u2019t stockpile or panic buy \u2013 not particularly for moral reasons but, in part, because we\u2019ve only got a small freezer and limited shelf space. But I did find myself checking the websites of online shopping companies obsessively: first thing in the morning, my last act before bed, and some days a dozen times in between. I should add here that the online food suppliers and their delivery drivers have done an incredible job of reorganising their systems and keeping things as smooth as they could. My children will never know, or appreciate, how close they came to two days in a row without bananas. Many days, cooking and clearing up after the kids has felt like a full-time job (actually worse: it starts at 7am, goes on till past 10pm, and you don\u2019t get half an hour to mull over the perfect phrasing of an email). It is exhausting, relentless and relentlessly thankless, as any parent without additional childcare in the normal run of things already knows well. I\u2019ve been, frankly, astonished at my kids\u2019 inability to sit at a table for longer than 4.5 seconds without breaking out into song, or wrestling each other, or nipping to their bedroom to get something \u201cvery important\u201d like a small piece of string, or a plastic fish, or a Sylvanian Families Halloween slide set (don\u2019t ask). In order to speed up the four-year-old\u2019s eating, my girlfriend has invented a game in which she pretends to be a toothbrush (from Texas, I think) who wants nothing more than to \u201cstop\u201d our daughter having any more dinner (full rules available on request), which is ultimately very effective but also makes me want to jump out of the window. But as time goes on, I\u2019ve started to make my peace with the situation. Accepting my role as, in Bill Buford\u2019s words, a kitchen slave, I listen more to what my kids want to eat, rather than bending them to my will. Feeling consulted, they seem to become more open to trying things. Some dinners have been disasters \u2013 an attempt to pitch aubergine parmigiana as \u201cpizza without the crust\u201d didn\u2019t fly \u2013 but the next morning they just eat a double breakfast. And it\u2019s made me more resourceful: we found a huge patch of wild garlic in a nearby wood, and the kids just about tolerated the pesto we made with it. I dug out various packets of dried pulses from the back of the cupboard, one of which had a best-before date of 2015 and I could only cook by putting instructions through Google Translate, but which were, nonetheless, delicious. On the radio, I heard someone compare life during coronavirus to being on a cruise ship: the three meals provided a structure to a day that otherwise might be disconcertingly free and unhinged.

      "bodyText": "Future historians will pinpoint the past few days as the moment global rugby union came face to face with stark reality. Like an iceberg few imagined would ever melt, huge cracks and fissures are threatening to widen and cause a ripple effect even in places where the sport is theoretically supposed to be strongest. It is not so much the inevitable postponement of all of July\u2019s Tests, with the severe financial pain that entails, that is the giveaway. Nor is it the sight of players still jogging around in small groups, uncertain when the government will permit a return to full training. No, the really sobering stuff is to be found unfolding in the southern hemisphere, with every prospect that similar issues will soon drift north. On Friday, for example, it was announced that World Rugby has had to dole out A$14.2m (\u00a37.5m) in funding to Rugby Australia to keep the governing body afloat following the postponement of the July Test window. Good judges are already predicting the game in Australia will have little realistic option other than to go semi-professional or amateur, threatening the competitive foundations of the Rugby Championship and beyond. Pressure is also building in South Africa, home of the world champions. With the Covid-19 situation worsening and the rand weakening, pay cuts and other savings have had to be made to reduce the sport\u2019s overall budget by R1.2bn (\u00a353m) before the end of this year. The country\u2019s leading players have had a three-week window in which to decide whether to cancel their existing contracts or stay put. For a good number, it is set to involve a one-way trip to the airport. The outstanding Springboks hooker Malcolm Marx is off to Japan while the future of the world player of the year, Pieter-Steph du Toit, remains uncertain. No big deal, you might think. But what if South African domestic rugby loses even more of its biggest names? Where is the irresistible attraction in their teams heading north to play in European tournaments? How much might it undermine the competitiveness of the midweek fixtures on next year\u2019s British &amp; Irish Lions tour, assuming it runs to the proposed schedule? What is the point, with USA Rugby also bankrupt, in spending big to conquer the game\u2019s distant frontiers while backyard debts are piling up at home? Those close to the discussions about the potential shape of the 2020-21 season genuinely fear we are glimpsing just the tip of the aforementioned iceberg.

      "body": "<p>A single mother has launched a legal challenge to overturn \u201cperverse\u201d benefit rules that have cancelled out the chancellor\u2019s \u00a390-a-month coronavirus living costs boost for thousands of low-income families on universal credit and left her \u00a3123 a month worse off than she was before the crisis.</p> <p>The full-time carer for her four young children, who does not wish to be named, was told that the chancellor\u2019s pandemic funds would increase her income by \u00a320 a week to help pay for the higher costs of food and energy during lockdown. However, the money pushed her over government benefit cap limits, wiping out the increase.</p> <p>Her plight was compounded when benefits officials insisted the chancellor\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-announces-workers-support-package\">March handout</a> meant she could now afford higher repayments on her universal credit advance loan, and so increased monthly deductions from her benefits by almost 30% \u2013 even though the benefit cap meant she was no better off.</p> <p>As a result, the woman, who lives in the north-west of England, is now \u00a3123 a month worse off. She said that after rent and bills were paid she now had just \u00a3100 a month to live on and she had been forced to borrow from her mum and sister to make ends meet.</p> <p>\u201cI have only one meal a day, and it\u2019s been like this for ages. I live off toast. I\u2019d rather they [my kids] eat than me. I can\u2019t even remember when I last bought clothes for myself. I\u2019ve been stressed. It\u2019s been horrendous,\u201d she told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cThe changes to benefits in the pandemic have left me worse off when in fact they were supposed to help me during this difficult time. How can that be right?\u201d</p> <p>The woman was not previously benefit-capped, but her income had already been diminished when her youngest child was born after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/26/two-child-benefit-limit-pushes-families-further-into-poverty-study\">introduction of the two-child benefit limit</a> in 2017, meaning her universal credit claim restricted financial support to only three of her four children.</p> <p>The woman\u2019s solicitors, Leigh Day, who have filed pre-action papers with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), argue that the retention of both the benefit cap and benefit deductions in the current environment is perverse, irrational, discriminatory and unlawfully breaches the woman\u2019s human rights.</p> <p>The case will increase pressure on ministers to review the benefit cap, a notorious seven year-old policy intended to \u201cincentivise\u201d unemployed claimants to get a job by severely limiting their benefit payments. In effect it has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/aug/06/benefits-cap-hits-single-parents-with-children-under-five-figures-show\">mainly hit single parents</a> not expected to work because they are full-time carers for young children.</p> <p>House of Commons library <a href=\"https://doc-0o-2s-apps-viewer.googleusercontent.com/viewer/secure/pdf/cnskkpradnunkeltm2n216uco9606bf9/qba46aqpf8hr1e3ndar93aau58bi4l88/1589715825000/gmail/10718478291334072593/ACFrOgC0S3oFl4J3gLkI6n9nZDS25CiRk_YS2LrDvX9YYR053ZvIfbyA5ILTpZ5jOyM9doAcfXhFSnVvLzvmtGkI9uN0EVfcDZ9FcaFsmstM_1pMEUEcBeeCyUbPjbQ=?print=true&amp;nonce=a8b7oodr0812k&amp;user=10718478291334072593&amp;hash=kqbh8gd97rs1dkad4agpjj3mkb211pbl\">estimates</a> conservatively suggest around 108,000 families \u2013 including 90,000 families already capped \u2013 will be denied the chancellor\u2019s universal credit cash boost because the benefit cap enables the DWP to claw the money back.</p> <p>Labour called for the benefit cap to be scrapped. \u201cWhy raise universal credit with one hand only to take it away with the other? Unless the cap is ended, we risk seeing many more people losing critical funds at a time when they need them most,\u201d said the shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds.</p> <p>Carolin Ott, a Leigh Day solicitor, said: \u201cThe benefit cap is a measure intended to encourage benefit claimants into work but it is absurd for it to deprive individuals of much-needed support during a time when it is entirely unrealistic for them to enter into employment.\u201d</p> <p>Moving into work is the main way to escape the benefit cap, a task made harder during lockdown when job vacancies are scarce. Even before the crisis this was a challenge for many capped claimants: a 2016 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jun/05/docking-welfare-payments-is-not-incentive-to-work-report-claims\">DWP-backed study</a> found limiting an unemployed person\u2019s benefits made it less likely they would get a job.</p> <p>The benefit cap limits total household benefits to \u00a323,000 a year (\u00a3442 a week) in London and \u00a320,000 a year (\u00a3385 a week) outside the capital.</p> <p>A DWP spokesperson said: \u201cUniversal credit adapts to your personal circumstances and the vast majority of claimants are better off on it. We estimate that 2.5 million households receiving universal credit will benefit straight away from the increase in the standard allowance.\u201d</p> <p>In March the work and pensions secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/chancellor-announces-workers-support-package\">welcomed </a>the \u00a320-a-week boost to universal credit, saying the DWP was \u201cstanding by those who rely on the welfare safety net\u201c and would do \u201cwhatever it takes to protect the most vulnerable and get them through these unprecedented times\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A single mother has launched a legal challenge to overturn \u201cperverse\u201d benefit rules that have cancelled out the chancellor\u2019s \u00a390-a-month coronavirus living costs boost for thousands of low-income families on universal credit and left her \u00a3123 a month worse off than she was before the crisis. The full-time carer for her four young children, who does not wish to be named, was told that the chancellor\u2019s pandemic funds would increase her income by \u00a320 a week to help pay for the higher costs of food and energy during lockdown. However, the money pushed her over government benefit cap limits, wiping out the increase. Her plight was compounded when benefits officials insisted the chancellor\u2019s March handout meant she could now afford higher repayments on her universal credit advance loan, and so increased monthly deductions from her benefits by almost 30% \u2013 even though the benefit cap meant she was no better off. As a result, the woman, who lives in the north-west of England, is now \u00a3123 a month worse off. She said that after rent and bills were paid she now had just \u00a3100 a month to live on and she had been forced to borrow from her mum and sister to make ends meet. \u201cI have only one meal a day, and it\u2019s been like this for ages. I live off toast. I\u2019d rather they [my kids] eat than me. I can\u2019t even remember when I last bought clothes for myself. I\u2019ve been stressed. It\u2019s been horrendous,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cThe changes to benefits in the pandemic have left me worse off when in fact they were supposed to help me during this difficult time. How can that be right?\u201d The woman was not previously benefit-capped, but her income had already been diminished when her youngest child was born after the introduction of the two-child benefit limit in 2017, meaning her universal credit claim restricted financial support to only three of her four children. The woman\u2019s solicitors, Leigh Day, who have filed pre-action papers with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), argue that the retention of both the benefit cap and benefit deductions in the current environment is perverse, irrational, discriminatory and unlawfully breaches the woman\u2019s human rights. The case will increase pressure on ministers to review the benefit cap, a notorious seven year-old policy intended to \u201cincentivise\u201d unemployed claimants to get a job by severely limiting their benefit payments. In effect it has mainly hit single parents not expected to work because they are full-time carers for young children. House of Commons library estimates conservatively suggest around 108,000 families \u2013 including 90,000 families already capped \u2013 will be denied the chancellor\u2019s universal credit cash boost because the benefit cap enables the DWP to claw the money back. Labour called for the benefit cap to be scrapped. \u201cWhy raise universal credit with one hand only to take it away with the other? Unless the cap is ended, we risk seeing many more people losing critical funds at a time when they need them most,\u201d said the shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds. Carolin Ott, a Leigh Day solicitor, said: \u201cThe benefit cap is a measure intended to encourage benefit claimants into work but it is absurd for it to deprive individuals of much-needed support during a time when it is entirely unrealistic for them to enter into employment.\u201d Moving into work is the main way to escape the benefit cap, a task made harder during lockdown when job vacancies are scarce. Even before the crisis this was a challenge for many capped claimants: a 2016 DWP-backed study found limiting an unemployed person\u2019s benefits made it less likely they would get a job. The benefit cap limits total household benefits to \u00a323,000 a year (\u00a3442 a week) in London and \u00a320,000 a year (\u00a3385 a week) outside the capital. A DWP spokesperson said: \u201cUniversal credit adapts to your personal circumstances and the vast majority of claimants are better off on it. We estimate that 2.5 million households receiving universal credit will benefit straight away from the increase in the standard allowance.\u201d In March the work and pensions secretary, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, welcomed the \u00a320-a-week boost to universal credit, saying the DWP was \u201cstanding by those who rely on the welfare safety net\u201c and would do \u201cwhatever it takes to protect the most vulnerable and get them through these unprecedented times\u201d.",

It\u2019s conceivable that asymptomatic staff may unintentionally infect some patients and that could be a mode of transmisison and help explain the rise in intra-hospital infection.\u201d Pittard said there had been cases of patients being who had been kept alive on a ventilator because of Covid-19 who were then diagnosed with a secondary infection called ventilator-associated pneumonia that they had acquired during their stay. It is understood that the NHS has no reliable figures for the extent of hospital-acquired Covid-19 but would be issuing guidance to hospitals to help them prevent such spread. An NHS spokesperson said: \u201cThis new global health pandemic meant the NHS has faced an unprecedented health challenge, but hospitals have very established and highly effective mechanisms for infection prevention and control, that clinicians are well trained in to care for desperately unwell patients. \u201cPHE is conducting a survey to estimate the proportion of asymptomatic healthcare workers that have detectable SARSars-CoVv-2 virus in their nose and throat to inform development of relevant guidance.\u201d A senior consultant said hospital-acquired Covid-19 could mean that it might not be safe for the growing number of patients who would be coming into hospital for a planned operation, as the NHS attempts to return to normal, pre-pandemic functioning. They said: \u201cWe know from the significant fall in hospital A&amp;E attendances and admissions, many for serious medical conditions, that many people are worried about coming into hospital and catching the virus. \u201cThis shows they are right to be worried; there is real risk. It mirrors the known risk for NHS frontline staff. NHS leadership now have early data to prove this hypothesis.\u201d",

Gaming the data is hard, because the total number of deaths cannot be hidden. Michel Coleman, a professor of epidemiology at LSHTM, who has analysed the data with colleagues Veronica Di Carlo,<sup> </sup>Melissa Matz and Claudia Allemani, said many of the extra deaths remained unaccounted for.</p> \n<p>\u201cEven if all the persons whose death certificate mentioned Covid-19 are counted, a quarter of the excess mortality in England and Wales is not explained,\u201d said Coleman.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis occurs because some deaths caused by coronavirus occur among people who were not tested. Other deaths occur among people with pre-existing cardiac or respiratory conditions that were made worse by coronavirus, and some deaths from unrelated conditions may occur because the health system was overwhelmed. All these deaths form part of the overall public health impact of the epidemic, but they will not be revealed by restricting reports to deaths among people who were tested for Covid-19.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo, in a fast-moving pandemic, the cause of death on the death certificate is not a good way to assess the overall public health impact of the disease.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fbb96cc0-be99-47f0-8544-bb0a39f4fbe1\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Guardian is investigating how the UK government prepared for \u2013 and is responding to \u2013 the coronavirus pandemic.

The epidemic in Italy was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-italy-lombardy-province-at-centre-of-outbreak-offers-glimmer-of-hope\">disproportionately lethal in Lombardy</a> in the north, where excess mortality hit 300% by 27 March, four times what would be expected. But this hides extremely high excess deaths in three cities: Bergamo (754%), Lodi (489%) and Brescia (344%). In Milan, it reached 143%.</p> \n<p>Similarly in the US, the total excess mortality hides grim figures in some cities. On 11 April, total excess mortality for 15 states and New York City, where the data from the National Center for Health Statistics was at least 90% complete, was below 10% in the five weeks to 20 March, but it then rose rapidly to 60% in the three weeks to 11 April. The area includes 138 million people, representing 42% of the US population.</p> \n<p>But excess mortality reached 68% by 11 April in Massachusetts and 209% in New Jersey, more than three times the expected number of deaths. In New York City alone, with 11.8 million people, excess mortality rose steeply to reach 580% by 11 April, almost seven times the expected mortality.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/excess_deaths_new_york/giv-3902K5W2fyhlOxUo/\" data-alt=\"New York City\u2019s mortality rate - graph\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/excess_deaths_new_york/giv-3902K5W2fyhlOxUo/\">New York City\u2019s mortality rate - graph</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Coleman is well versed in international data comparisons.

It was only when the figures for all deaths in care homes were released by the Office for National Statistics that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/coronavirus-real-care-home-death-toll-double-official-figure-study-says\">the real impact</a> in England and Wales was understood. But the excess death toll is more than hospitals and care home excess deaths combined, suggesting some people are dying at home who would in previous years have gone to hospital \u2013 and possibly recovered.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>David Spiegelhalter, the Winton professor of the public understanding of risk at the University of Cambridge, told <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/covid-deaths/\">the independent organisation Full Fact</a> that all-cause mortality was the best measure.</p> \n<p>\u201cI feel the only unbiased comparison you could make between different countries is by looking at all-cause mortality,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many questions about the rise we have seen in deaths that have not got Covid on the death certificate, yet we feel are inevitably linked in some way to this epidemic. Those are the figures that I would prefer to look at.\u201d</p> \n<p>The deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, has also suggested all-cause mortality would be \u201cprobably the most useful statistic\u201d for comparisons between countries.</p>",

Their data shows Italy\u2019s peak came on 27 March, with just under 15,000 total deaths that week, which was 103% higher than average mortality compared with the same week in previous years. England hit the peak on 10 April, when there were nearly 20,000 deaths in a week, which was 109% higher than previous years. All countries collect total mortality data. Gaming the data is hard, because the total number of deaths cannot be hidden. Michel Coleman, a professor of epidemiology at LSHTM, who has analysed the data with colleagues Veronica Di Carlo, Melissa Matz and Claudia Allemani, said many of the extra deaths remained unaccounted for. \u201cEven if all the persons whose death certificate mentioned Covid-19 are counted, a quarter of the excess mortality in England and Wales is not explained,\u201d said Coleman. \u201cThis occurs because some deaths caused by coronavirus occur among people who were not tested. Other deaths occur among people with pre-existing cardiac or respiratory conditions that were made worse by coronavirus, and some deaths from unrelated conditions may occur because the health system was overwhelmed. All these deaths form part of the overall public health impact of the epidemic, but they will not be revealed by restricting reports to deaths among people who were tested for Covid-19. \u201cSo, in a fast-moving pandemic, the cause of death on the death certificate is not a good way to assess the overall public health impact of the disease.\u201d The team\u2019s data also shows how hard-hit certain areas and cities have been. The epidemic in Italy was disproportionately lethal in Lombardy in the north, where excess mortality hit 300% by 27 March, four times what would be expected. But this hides extremely high excess deaths in three cities: Bergamo (754%), Lodi (489%) and Brescia (344%). In Milan, it reached 143%. Similarly in the US, the total excess mortality hides grim figures in some cities. On 11 April, total excess mortality for 15 states and New York City, where the data from the National Center for Health Statistics was at least 90% complete, was below 10% in the five weeks to 20 March, but it then rose rapidly to 60% in the three weeks to 11 April. The area includes 138 million people, representing 42% of the US population. But excess mortality reached 68% by 11 April in Massachusetts and 209% in New Jersey, more than three times the expected number of deaths. In New York City alone, with 11.8 million people, excess mortality rose steeply to reach 580% by 11 April, almost seven times the expected mortality. Coleman is well versed in international data comparisons. He and his team were responsible for the cancer survival statistics that tracked the UK lagging behind much of Europe and persuaded the government to invest in cancer strategies to improve the NHS\u2019s performance. The importance of excess mortality data rather than registered Covid-19 deaths has become increasingly recognised as the pandemic has unfolded. It was only when the figures for all deaths in care homes were released by the Office for National Statistics that the real impact in England and Wales was understood. But the excess death toll is more than hospitals and care home excess deaths combined, suggesting some people are dying at home who would in previous years have gone to hospital \u2013 and possibly recovered. David Spiegelhalter, the Winton professor of the public understanding of risk at the University of Cambridge, told the independent organisation Full Fact that all-cause mortality was the best measure. \u201cI feel the only unbiased comparison you could make between different countries is by looking at all-cause mortality,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many questions about the rise we have seen in deaths that have not got Covid on the death certificate, yet we feel are inevitably linked in some way to this epidemic. Those are the figures that I would prefer to look at.\u201d The deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, has also suggested all-cause mortality would be \u201cprobably the most useful statistic\u201d for comparisons between countries.",

The US approved $25bn (\u00a320.6bn) support for the industry in April.</p> <p>If public funds are used to save companies, there is a growing argument that society should get something in return in terms of environmental improvements.</p> <p>Hopes were raised when the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said Air France would have to become \u201cthe greenest airline in the world\u201d in return for a \u20ac7bn bailout. This meant reducing the carbon intensity of their overall operations by 50% by 2030, cutting absolute emissions within France by half by 2030, using 2% renewable jet fuel by 2024 and drastically reducing the number of flights of less than 2hr 30mins duration that compete with rail services.</p> <p>Although these conditions are currently non-binding, campaigners said they were hopeful they will be supported by new laws in the coming years.</p> <p>Andrew Murphy, an aviation policy officer at the NGO Transport &amp; Environment, said this could be a turning point after decades of inaction.</p> <p>\u201cBefore the Covid crisis, aviation emissions were going in the wrong direction. This is a moment that has shaken up the industry and raised questions about subsidies, tax breaks, and frequent flying. It is an opportunity for governments to think how they support the airline industry.\u201d</p> <p>He said he was also encouraged the UK has not yet committed public funds to bail out airlines, which would gives them the incentive to put planes back in the sky too soon. A more important step, he said, would be for government to include aviation emissions in their climate targets. \u201cIt\u2019s not sexy, but it\u2019s very important,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout this, nations\u2019 climate calculations are based on dodgy accounting, as Greta [Thunberg] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/25/uks-creative-carbon-accounting-breaches-climate-deal-say-critics\">pointed out</a> when she was in the UK last year.\u201d</p> <p>Some environmentalists such as George Monbiot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/airlines-oil-giants-government-economy\">argue</a> airlines should not be rescued. This is echoed by Extinction Rebellion. \u201cWith 90% of UK planes grounded, and knowing we need to halt polluting industries, there can be no justification for the government to financially support restarting flights. Let\u2019s embed this change rather than bail out this destructive industry and its tax-avoiding owners,\u201d the group\u2019s UK spokesperson, Sarah Lunnon, said.</p> <p>Other climate campaign organisations, including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, say bailouts are only acceptable if they come with green conditions. They say airline companies should pay a fair share of taxes and not rely on offsets to reduce emissions, as they are currently doing.</p> <p>Among the measures they propose are fuel taxes on domestic flights (which are currently tax free) and the introduction of a frequent flier levy. In the UK, 15% of people take 70% of flights. Globally, only 3% of the world\u2019s 7.6bn population flies frequently.</p> <p>\u201cIf governments want to address the twin challenges of Covid and climate change, the political moment is now,\u201d says Dan Rutherford, aviation director at the International Council on Clean Transportation. \u201cPolicies to curb frequent flying could benefit both public health and the global environment.\u201d</p> <p>He said passengers should also be given information about the carbon costs of their flights, which would allow them to support more efficient airlines. The difference between companies can be as much as 80% on the same city-to-city flight depending on the type of aircraft, load factors and routes.</p> <p>Even before the pandemic, the airline industry was feeling public pressure from \u201cthe Greta effect\u201d, direct action by Extinction Rebellion and the high court decision to block Heathrow expansion because it posed unacceptable climate risks.</p> <p>The Heathrow chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said the UK should build back better after the Covid-19 crisis. \u201cThe government can accelerate the decarbonisation of aviation, by helping to scale up new energy sources, such as sustainable aviation fuels, just as they did successfully for solar and wind. Any company that is bailed out by the government should commit to net-zero emissions well before 2050.\u201d</p> <p>Passenger numbers at the UK\u2019s largest airport fell by 97% in April, prompting hundreds of job losses and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/may/01/heathrow-boss-ba-redundancies-john-holland-kaye-safety-air-travel\">fears of many more to follow</a>. British Airways and its parent company AIG did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for a comment about their willingness to accept tighter controls on emissions.</p> <p>The UK chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rishi-sunak\">Rishi Sunak</a>, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/24/uk-airlines-and-airports-told-not-to-expect-industry-wide-covid-19-bailout\">said</a> he will not treat the aviation industry as a special case, but might consider bailouts on a case-by-case basis.</p> <p>Green party politicians say a clearer position is necessary to help workers in the sector to transition to other jobs.</p> <p>\u201cWhilst a reduction in flying will have a tremendously positive impact on the environment, we need to ensure jobs are created elsewhere for those currently working in the aviation industry,\u201d the Brighton mayor, Alex Phillips, said. \u201cThis could mean, for example, that workers are either offered the opportunity to retire in dignity or to retrain in new sectors \u2013 whether they be in zero-emission transport or low carbon jobs that we are in need of both now and in the future.\u201d</p> <p>The issue is likely to linger long after the lockdown. The International Air Transport Association says <a href=\"https://www.flightglobal.com/airlines/iata-passenger-demand-may-not-recover-until-2024/138357.article\">demand for air travel will not recover until 2023</a> at the earliest.</p> <h2>Eight steps towards a cleaner aviation sector</h2> <ul> <li><p>Reduce flights. Demand is unlikely to recover for at least three years so the simplest way to reduce aviation emissions is to have fewer planes in the air.</p></li> <li><p>Tax aviation fuel. Initially just for domestic flights so they do not have an unfair advantage against low-emission rail services. Air France has been told it cannot have a bailout unless it phases out flights that compete with train journeys of 2hr 30mins or less. This should later be widened to international flights, which are <a href=\"https://www.transportenvironment.org/state-aviation-ets\">responsible for 90%</a> of airline emissions in Europe..</p></li> <li><p>Introduce a <a href=\"http://afreeride.org/\">frequent flyer levy</a>. In the UK, 15% of people take 70% of flights. Globally, only 3% of the world\u2019s 7.8bn population flies frequently. Increasing costs for them would make a bigger difference than asking people to end their annual overseas holiday.</p></li> <li><p>Provide transparent data on carbon emissions of flights so customers can avoid less efficient airlines. Few people are currently aware of the data, but the difference can be as much as 80% on the same city-to-city flight depending on the type of aircraft, load factors and routes.</p></li> <li><p>Incorporate the aviation sector into national climate targets. Currently the UK\u2019s Climate Change Act only mentions airlines rather than making them part of the country\u2019s emissions calculations, which Thunberg described last year as \u201cextremely creative accounting\u201d.</p></li> <li><p>Reduce fleet sizes by scrapping old, gas-guzzling planes. This would also reduce the risk that low petrol prices will prompt budget airlines to rent cheap planes and run them almost empty, which would keep them in business but increase emissions per passenger.</p></li> <li><p>Halt airport expansion. Campaigners won an important victory in February when the high court ruled against Heathrow expansion due to the climate risks. But many other airports plan to open new terminals and runways in the UK and elsewhere in the world.</p></li> <li><p>Invest in green fuel and tech. The French government has said Air France must use alternatives to fossil fuels for at least 2% of flights by 2024. Norway is pioneering <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180814-norways-plan-for-a-fleet-of-electric-planes\">electric planes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-norway-airplane-biofuels/airlines-get-ready-for-jet-biofuel-take-off-in-norway-idUSKBN1XV1TQ\">biofuel from waste products</a>. Heathrow says the UK government should also promote cleaner fuel.</p></li> </ul>",

If public funds are used to save companies, there is a growing argument that society should get something in return in terms of environmental improvements. Hopes were raised when the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said Air France would have to become \u201cthe greenest airline in the world\u201d in return for a \u20ac7bn bailout. This meant reducing the carbon intensity of their overall operations by 50% by 2030, cutting absolute emissions within France by half by 2030, using 2% renewable jet fuel by 2024 and drastically reducing the number of flights of less than 2hr 30mins duration that compete with rail services. Although these conditions are currently non-binding, campaigners said they were hopeful they will be supported by new laws in the coming years. Andrew Murphy, an aviation policy officer at the NGO Transport &amp; Environment, said this could be a turning point after decades of inaction. \u201cBefore the Covid crisis, aviation emissions were going in the wrong direction. This is a moment that has shaken up the industry and raised questions about subsidies, tax breaks, and frequent flying. It is an opportunity for governments to think how they support the airline industry.\u201d He said he was also encouraged the UK has not yet committed public funds to bail out airlines, which would gives them the incentive to put planes back in the sky too soon. A more important step, he said, would be for government to include aviation emissions in their climate targets. \u201cIt\u2019s not sexy, but it\u2019s very important,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout this, nations\u2019 climate calculations are based on dodgy accounting, as Greta [Thunberg] pointed out when she was in the UK last year.\u201d Some environmentalists such as George Monbiot argue airlines should not be rescued. This is echoed by Extinction Rebellion. \u201cWith 90% of UK planes grounded, and knowing we need to halt polluting industries, there can be no justification for the government to financially support restarting flights. Let\u2019s embed this change rather than bail out this destructive industry and its tax-avoiding owners,\u201d the group\u2019s UK spokesperson, Sarah Lunnon, said. Other climate campaign organisations, including Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, say bailouts are only acceptable if they come with green conditions. They say airline companies should pay a fair share of taxes and not rely on offsets to reduce emissions, as they are currently doing. Among the measures they propose are fuel taxes on domestic flights (which are currently tax free) and the introduction of a frequent flier levy. In the UK, 15% of people take 70% of flights. Globally, only 3% of the world\u2019s 7.6bn population flies frequently. \u201cIf governments want to address the twin challenges of Covid and climate change, the political moment is now,\u201d says Dan Rutherford, aviation director at the International Council on Clean Transportation. \u201cPolicies to curb frequent flying could benefit both public health and the global environment.\u201d He said passengers should also be given information about the carbon costs of their flights, which would allow them to support more efficient airlines. The difference between companies can be as much as 80% on the same city-to-city flight depending on the type of aircraft, load factors and routes. Even before the pandemic, the airline industry was feeling public pressure from \u201cthe Greta effect\u201d, direct action by Extinction Rebellion and the high court decision to block Heathrow expansion because it posed unacceptable climate risks. The Heathrow chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said the UK should build back better after the Covid-19 crisis. \u201cThe government can accelerate the decarbonisation of aviation, by helping to scale up new energy sources, such as sustainable aviation fuels, just as they did successfully for solar and wind. Any company that is bailed out by the government should commit to net-zero emissions well before 2050.\u201d Passenger numbers at the UK\u2019s largest airport fell by 97% in April, prompting hundreds of job losses and fears of many more to follow. British Airways and its parent company AIG did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for a comment about their willingness to accept tighter controls on emissions. The UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has said he will not treat the aviation industry as a special case, but might consider bailouts on a case-by-case basis. Green party politicians say a clearer position is necessary to help workers in the sector to transition to other jobs. \u201cWhilst a reduction in flying will have a tremendously positive impact on the environment, we need to ensure jobs are created elsewhere for those currently working in the aviation industry,\u201d the Brighton mayor, Alex Phillips, said. \u201cThis could mean, for example, that workers are either offered the opportunity to retire in dignity or to retrain in new sectors \u2013 whether they be in zero-emission transport or low carbon jobs that we are in need of both now and in the future.\u201d The issue is likely to linger long after the lockdown. The International Air Transport Association says demand for air travel will not recover until 2023 at the earliest. Eight steps towards a cleaner aviation sector Reduce flights. Demand is unlikely to recover for at least three years so the simplest way to reduce aviation emissions is to have fewer planes in the air. Tax aviation fuel. Initially just for domestic flights so they do not have an unfair advantage against low-emission rail services. Air France has been told it cannot have a bailout unless it phases out flights that compete with train journeys of 2hr 30mins or less. This should later be widened to international flights, which are responsible for 90% of airline emissions in Europe.. Introduce a frequent flyer levy. In the UK, 15% of people take 70% of flights. Globally, only 3% of the world\u2019s 7.8bn population flies frequently. Increasing costs for them would make a bigger difference than asking people to end their annual overseas holiday. Provide transparent data on carbon emissions of flights so customers can avoid less efficient airlines. Few people are currently aware of the data, but the difference can be as much as 80% on the same city-to-city flight depending on the type of aircraft, load factors and routes. Incorporate the aviation sector into national climate targets. Currently the UK\u2019s Climate Change Act only mentions airlines rather than making them part of the country\u2019s emissions calculations, which Thunberg described last year as \u201cextremely creative accounting\u201d. Reduce fleet sizes by scrapping old, gas-guzzling planes. This would also reduce the risk that low petrol prices will prompt budget airlines to rent cheap planes and run them almost empty, which would keep them in business but increase emissions per passenger. Halt airport expansion. Campaigners won an important victory in February when the high court ruled against Heathrow expansion due to the climate risks. But many other airports plan to open new terminals and runways in the UK and elsewhere in the world. Invest in green fuel and tech. The French government has said Air France must use alternatives to fossil fuels for at least 2% of flights by 2024. Norway is pioneering electric planes and biofuel from waste products. Heathrow says the UK government should also promote cleaner fuel.",

Changes in routines, living situations and care plans have the potential to trigger eating disorders. It\u2019s more important now than ever that those who are unwell feel supported.\u201d</p> <p>Dave\u2019s eating disorders started to return after his father died from Covid-19 six weeks ago. \u201cAt first I was in a state of constant denial,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I just feel really horrible in my body, like I\u2019m losing control. Being sat around the house, surrounded by food, unable to exercise, worrying about calories \u2026 It\u2019s been really hard to cope, to be honest.\u201d</p> <p>The 31-year-old has been in recovery for four years after fast-track treatment for anorexia.

It\u2019s easy to go back to focusing on things that feel safe, somehow. I missed feeling I was winning at it, seeing the scales going down.</p> <p>\u201cI really feel this will give people an insight into what a restrictive eating disorder, binge eating, and even overeating, are really like. It\u2019s this constant thinking and talking about food - it\u2019s our only enjoyment and occupation at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>Katie also feels that the pressures of lockdown have affected her recovery. In late March, after the closure of the treatment centre she attended five days a week, she returned home to isolate with her mother and younger brother.</p> <p>\u201cIt was really sudden,\u201d says the 22-year-old. \u201cThere was no time to gradually reduce support. Before, I had all my meals made for me, so all the food decisions had been taken away. But now I have to make all the decisions myself, even if I don\u2019t feel 100% ready for that.\u201d</p> <p>While Katie\u2019s treatment has moved to online video sessions, with individual appointments and a group timetable throughout the day, she is finding the disruption to her routine unsettling.</p> <p>\u201cMy initial thought was: \u2018What\u2019s the point? Everything\u2019s ruined. I may as well give up now.\u2019 I thought it was a sign, like I was going to go back to square one. I suppose it\u2019s easy to have that snap reaction, but it does feel like an obstacle has been put in the way.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Steve Clarke is a psychotherapist at Arthur House, an eating disorder service based in south-west London which is part of the Priory Group. He says that while online support has its advantages, it also has limitations.</p> <p>\u201cOnline therapy doesn\u2019t support someone with an eating disorder at critical times, such as mealtimes. The challenge isolation presents to patients is not having that hands-on, physical presence.\u201d</p> <p>Medics say that mealtimes can be particularly ritualistic for those with an eating disorder, requiring a clear plan and set times. For those without a support network, maintaining structure can be difficult.</p> <p>Dr Joanna Silver, an eating disorder specialist for the Nightingale hospital in north London, says: \u201cEnforced isolation has meant that many people feel disconnected from their support systems and that in turn their eating disorder is stronger. Such feelings have caused people to turn to behaviours such as bingeing, purging and restricting as a way of managing these feelings and maintaining an illusion of control.\u201d</p> <p>Relapsing into unhealthy habits is more of a risk now than at any time Anna*can remember. \u201cLiving alone, I could disappear for a week and nobody would notice,\u201d says the 28-year-old, who has been in recovery from an atypical form of bulimia for three years. \u201cYou\u2019re only shopping for yourself; you can control how much exercise you do; and you can exclude food groups. You can be very prescriptive and it could just go unnoticed.</p> <p>\u201cI know people are there if I need to talk, but I also know people are dealing with their own stuff. I find it really hard to talk about it at the best of times. It\u2019s inexplicable outside my own head.\u201d</p> <p>There are fears that food shopping and stockpiling may also add to the temptation to relapse.

      "bodyText": "There has been a sharp rise in the number of people making contact with eating disorder charities since the start of the coronavirus lockdown almost eight weeks ago. The charity BEAT says calls to its helpline have increased by 50% and that there has been a 78% rise in contact via social media compared with February. Charities are concerned that a reduction in hospital services and a move to online sessions could result in an increase in new cases and setbacks for those with an active eating disorder or those in early recovery. Caroline Price, BEAT\u2019s director of services, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising we\u2019ve seen such a large increase in contact. Changes in routines, living situations and care plans have the potential to trigger eating disorders. It\u2019s more important now than ever that those who are unwell feel supported.\u201d Dave\u2019s eating disorders started to return after his father died from Covid-19 six weeks ago. \u201cAt first I was in a state of constant denial,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I just feel really horrible in my body, like I\u2019m losing control. Being sat around the house, surrounded by food, unable to exercise, worrying about calories \u2026 It\u2019s been really hard to cope, to be honest.\u201d The 31-year-old has been in recovery for four years after fast-track treatment for anorexia. He says processing the grief after his father\u2019s death, while struggling with an eating disorder has led to a deterioration in his mental health. \u201cI realised quite early on in lockdown that I was at risk of this all affecting my wellbeing. It\u2019s easy to go back to focusing on things that feel safe, somehow. I missed feeling I was winning at it, seeing the scales going down. \u201cI really feel this will give people an insight into what a restrictive eating disorder, binge eating, and even overeating, are really like. It\u2019s this constant thinking and talking about food - it\u2019s our only enjoyment and occupation at the moment.\u201d Katie also feels that the pressures of lockdown have affected her recovery. In late March, after the closure of the treatment centre she attended five days a week, she returned home to isolate with her mother and younger brother. \u201cIt was really sudden,\u201d says the 22-year-old. \u201cThere was no time to gradually reduce support. Before, I had all my meals made for me, so all the food decisions had been taken away. But now I have to make all the decisions myself, even if I don\u2019t feel 100% ready for that.\u201d While Katie\u2019s treatment has moved to online video sessions, with individual appointments and a group timetable throughout the day, she is finding the disruption to her routine unsettling. \u201cMy initial thought was: \u2018What\u2019s the point? Everything\u2019s ruined. I may as well give up now.\u2019 I thought it was a sign, like I was going to go back to square one. I suppose it\u2019s easy to have that snap reaction, but it does feel like an obstacle has been put in the way.\u201d Steve Clarke is a psychotherapist at Arthur House, an eating disorder service based in south-west London which is part of the Priory Group. He says that while online support has its advantages, it also has limitations. \u201cOnline therapy doesn\u2019t support someone with an eating disorder at critical times, such as mealtimes. The challenge isolation presents to patients is not having that hands-on, physical presence.\u201d Medics say that mealtimes can be particularly ritualistic for those with an eating disorder, requiring a clear plan and set times. For those without a support network, maintaining structure can be difficult. Dr Joanna Silver, an eating disorder specialist for the Nightingale hospital in north London, says: \u201cEnforced isolation has meant that many people feel disconnected from their support systems and that in turn their eating disorder is stronger. Such feelings have caused people to turn to behaviours such as bingeing, purging and restricting as a way of managing these feelings and maintaining an illusion of control.\u201d Relapsing into unhealthy habits is more of a risk now than at any time Anna*can remember. \u201cLiving alone, I could disappear for a week and nobody would notice,\u201d says the 28-year-old, who has been in recovery from an atypical form of bulimia for three years. \u201cYou\u2019re only shopping for yourself; you can control how much exercise you do; and you can exclude food groups. You can be very prescriptive and it could just go unnoticed. \u201cI know people are there if I need to talk, but I also know people are dealing with their own stuff. I find it really hard to talk about it at the best of times. It\u2019s inexplicable outside my own head.\u201d There are fears that food shopping and stockpiling may also add to the temptation to relapse. Without the usual selection, many feel forced to eat alternative foods. A perceived scarcity of food can, Silver says, add to the risk that some may restrict their food intake or reinforce feelings of guilt. Frequent exposure to advertisements, articles and social media posts encouraging people to get fit and lose weight are also inducing strong urges among some people with eating disorders to exercise intensely. \u201cWhen I\u2019m out walking the dog, I keep seeing loads of people running,\u201d Katie says. \u201cThen I go on my phone and I see all these people posting about how much exercise they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s everywhere.\u201d Anna also finds the pressure surrounding exercise difficult to avoid. \u201cI keep thinking: \u2018What should I be trying to achieve?

      "body": "<p>In the midst of their first heatwave of the year, thousands of Greeks were released on to the Athenian Riviera this weekend to do what beachgoers love to do: swim, lounge and soak up the rays. They were not disappointed. </p> <p>\u201cLife! Freedom! A breath of fresh air,\u201d enthused Maria, a retired bank worker, relishing the scene with her friend Danae. \u201cRelief,\u201d said Danae, sitting up and raising her arms to the sky. \u201cAt long last, a big psychological relief.\u201d</p> <p>But that freedom is now measured in metres, even if Greece has kept Covid-19 infection and mortality rates unusually low. Maria and Danae lounged on sunbeds at a 10-metre distance from their fellow bathers. Behind them Zissimos Zissos, a town hall employee, guided a drone over the beach on a mission to detect congested danger zones, broadcasting the robotic message \u201cwe keep our distance, we respect public health\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt shocks people but they do look up and move away,\u201d Zissos smiled, as municipal police and guards wended their way through reed umbrellas, urging beachgoers to respect the rules or risk being fined.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a venture into the unknown, a different world,\u201d said Giorgos Papanicolaou, the mayor of Glyfada, whose municipality runs the long stretch of public beach south of Athens\u2019 city centre. \u201cBut it\u2019s gone better than expected. Children are a bit more difficult to control but so far there haven\u2019t been any penalties.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Greece\" data-alt=\"Coronavirus deaths in Greece - graph\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Greece\">Coronavirus deaths in Greece - graph</a> </figure>  <p>With unseasonably high temperatures prompting fears of uncontrollable numbers descending on the riviera, Papanicolaou led calls by locals mayors last week for the government to open up \u201corganised\u201d fee-paying beaches along the Attica coast. On Friday, in what was seen as a crucial test for tourism, the centre-right administration agreed that 515 beaches could resume business on condition that strict rules were adhered to.</p> <p>At 8am on Saturday beach clubs duly opened, without music, alcohol or sports facilities that might encourage social interaction. With each changeover, sunbeds \u2013 some chained to canopies to ensure social distancing \u2013 were disinfected. In the same spirit, umbrella poles had to be four metres apart \u2013 a distance many, including Papanicolaou, deemed too close for comfort and more than doubled.</p> <p>Only 40 people per 1,000 sq metres were permitted on any of the beaches at any one time.</p> <p>Across southern Europe, tourism\u2019s salvation is crucial.

      "bodyText": "In the midst of their first heatwave of the year, thousands of Greeks were released on to the Athenian Riviera this weekend to do what beachgoers love to do: swim, lounge and soak up the rays. They were not disappointed. \u201cLife! Freedom! A breath of fresh air,\u201d enthused Maria, a retired bank worker, relishing the scene with her friend Danae. \u201cRelief,\u201d said Danae, sitting up and raising her arms to the sky. \u201cAt long last, a big psychological relief.\u201d But that freedom is now measured in metres, even if Greece has kept Covid-19 infection and mortality rates unusually low. Maria and Danae lounged on sunbeds at a 10-metre distance from their fellow bathers. Behind them Zissimos Zissos, a town hall employee, guided a drone over the beach on a mission to detect congested danger zones, broadcasting the robotic message \u201cwe keep our distance, we respect public health\u201d. \u201cIt shocks people but they do look up and move away,\u201d Zissos smiled, as municipal police and guards wended their way through reed umbrellas, urging beachgoers to respect the rules or risk being fined. \u201cIt\u2019s a venture into the unknown, a different world,\u201d said Giorgos Papanicolaou, the mayor of Glyfada, whose municipality runs the long stretch of public beach south of Athens\u2019 city centre. \u201cBut it\u2019s gone better than expected. Children are a bit more difficult to control but so far there haven\u2019t been any penalties.\u201d With unseasonably high temperatures prompting fears of uncontrollable numbers descending on the riviera, Papanicolaou led calls by locals mayors last week for the government to open up \u201corganised\u201d fee-paying beaches along the Attica coast. On Friday, in what was seen as a crucial test for tourism, the centre-right administration agreed that 515 beaches could resume business on condition that strict rules were adhered to. At 8am on Saturday beach clubs duly opened, without music, alcohol or sports facilities that might encourage social interaction. With each changeover, sunbeds \u2013 some chained to canopies to ensure social distancing \u2013 were disinfected. In the same spirit, umbrella poles had to be four metres apart \u2013 a distance many, including Papanicolaou, deemed too close for comfort and more than doubled. Only 40 people per 1,000 sq metres were permitted on any of the beaches at any one time. Across southern Europe, tourism\u2019s salvation is crucial. A fifth of the Greek workforce \u2013 more than a million people \u2013 are employed in the industry. Across the Ionian Sea in Italy, where tourism represents 15% of jobs, reinvigorating the sector is important for kickstarting the economy and ensuring the financial chasm between northern and southern states in the eurozone is not further exacerbated. With this in mind, the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has promised Italians they will be allowed to go on holiday this summer. Italy has about 5,000 miles of coastline \u2013 almost half that of Greece \u2013 to which thousands of people flock each summer, many renting loungers and umbrellas for the entire season. Private beach establishments, or stabilimenti, are an essential part of the economies of beach towns, and they too are now readying themselves for opening after the officials outlined new guidelines late on Friday. Under the rules, beachgoers must pre-book their loungers (which will need to be disinfected between each user) and possibly undergo a temperature test, at the discretion of the beach manager, who can bar anyone with a temperature of more than 37.5C from entering. People must also maintain a two-metre distance when in bathroom or shower areas. Swimming pools will be closed and it has been advised that sporting activity should be avoided. Local authorities will have to apply similar rules for free beaches. There have even been rumours of people being asked to wear electronic tags to track their movements, and obtaining tickets and waiting their turn before taking a dip in the sea. \u201cWe\u2019re feeling a bit lost in the sense that we still don\u2019t fully understand what we need to do,\u201d said Loredana, who manages Romeo beach resort in Santa Severa, close to Rome. \u201cOf course there will be social distancing and we will follow all the safety guidelines as the virus is still circulating, we just need to properly understand them.

Gantz\u2019s former running mate, now the head of the opposition, Yair Lapid, said the new government was the \u201clargest, most bloated, most wasteful\u201d in Israeli history. The unity deal was largely seen as a career-saver for Netanyahu. Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader is a deeply divisive figure in Israel and faces three damning criminal corruption cases, with hearings scheduled to begin later this month. Under the coalition agreement, Netanyahu will have extra legal protections, meaning he will not have to resign as a public official despite the charges against him, which he denies. Allies in his Likud party retain significant power. Yariv Levin, one of Netanyahu\u2019s closest supporters, will be the new parliament speaker. Gideon Saar, who failed to replace Netanyahu in a December as Likud leader, was not given a ministerial post. Following an EU foreign ministers\u2019 meeting on Friday, Josep Borrell, the EU foreign policy chief, said the bloc would use \u201call our diplomatic capacities\u201d to block Israel from unilaterally annexing land. Some EU countries have pushed for either economic sanctions or the recognition of a Palestinian state, but the body is divided. In the Middle East, the response has been less muted. The king of Jordan, a country that has a peace treaty with Israel, warned his neighbour on Friday. \u201cIf Israel really annexed the West Bank in July, it would lead to a massive conflict with the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,\u201d King Abdullah II said in an interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make threats and create an atmosphere of loggerheads, but we are considering all options,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>The boss of Heathrow has urged the government to develop plans to restart travel between \u201clow-risk countries\u201d as global lockdown measures are eased.</p> <p>John Holland-Kaye, chief executive of the busiest airport in Britain, said the UK should adopt a risk-based approach to flights and warned that the UK economy will suffer if blanket travel restrictions continue. He also backed the idea of \u201cimmunity passports\u201d to allow people who have already had Covid-19 to travel more freely.</p> <p>Heathrow\u2019s passenger numbers plunged 97% in April, from an average of 250,000 a day to between 5,000 and 6,000 since lockdown. Holland-Kaye told Sky News: \u201cThis is a very minimal level of traffic, and I think that as long as the quarantine [travel ban] is in place, that will continue at those low levels.</p> <p>\u201cThe quarantine cannot be in place for more than a relatively short amount of time if we are going to get the economy moving again. This is where we are urging the government to have a common international standard, working with other countries so that traffic can start to flow in a normal way between low-risk countries.\u201d </p> <p>UK nationals are now banned from all but essential travel and borders are closed between many countries. The few flights that have landed have mainly been repatriation services to bring home Britons trapped abroad.</p> <p>Ministers are planning to tell entrants to the UK to quarantine for two weeks and download the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/nhs-preparing-to-roll-out-covid-19-contract-tracing-app-by-end-of-may\">new tracing app</a> being trialled on the Isle of Wight and soon to be rolled out across the country.</p> <p>Holland-Kaye suggested there should be a \u201cfree flow\u201d of passengers between the UK and countries that have low risks of transmission.

      "bodyText": "The boss of Heathrow has urged the government to develop plans to restart travel between \u201clow-risk countries\u201d as global lockdown measures are eased. John Holland-Kaye, chief executive of the busiest airport in Britain, said the UK should adopt a risk-based approach to flights and warned that the UK economy will suffer if blanket travel restrictions continue. He also backed the idea of \u201cimmunity passports\u201d to allow people who have already had Covid-19 to travel more freely. Heathrow\u2019s passenger numbers plunged 97% in April, from an average of 250,000 a day to between 5,000 and 6,000 since lockdown. Holland-Kaye told Sky News: \u201cThis is a very minimal level of traffic, and I think that as long as the quarantine [travel ban] is in place, that will continue at those low levels. \u201cThe quarantine cannot be in place for more than a relatively short amount of time if we are going to get the economy moving again. This is where we are urging the government to have a common international standard, working with other countries so that traffic can start to flow in a normal way between low-risk countries.\u201d UK nationals are now banned from all but essential travel and borders are closed between many countries. The few flights that have landed have mainly been repatriation services to bring home Britons trapped abroad. Ministers are planning to tell entrants to the UK to quarantine for two weeks and download the new tracing app being trialled on the Isle of Wight and soon to be rolled out across the country. Holland-Kaye suggested there should be a \u201cfree flow\u201d of passengers between the UK and countries that have low risks of transmission. He said: \u201cI think that if the UK government, with one of the biggest aviation sectors in the world, were to get together with the European Union and the United States, between them they have the heft and the global, diplomatic and economic power to set that international standard. \u201cI think the approach to take is the risk-based approach as we do with security, where if two countries are very low-risk or free of transmission, there should be a free flow of passengers between those countries.\u201d Holland-Kaye made the appeal as the airport prepared to screen passengers arriving at Heathrow\u2019s terminal 2 for high temperatures from the end of the week in a bid to identify travellers infected with coronavirus. Thermal imaging cameras will automatically scan everyone who touches down at the terminal, aiming to spot those who have signs of fever. This will allow it to capture data that will be forwarded to the government. The cameras form part of previously announced trials to combat the spread of coronavirus, which include procedures to reduce person-to-person contact, UV sanitation, and the efficient cleaning of trays at security. Rory Boland, the editor of Which? Travel, said: \u201cIf flights are to restart, passengers need the confidence that if travel restrictions disrupt their trip, the airline will refund them within a reasonable timeframe or rebook their journey for free.\u201d A Department for Transport spokesperson said: \u201cThe aviation sector is important to the UK economy and ministers are in regular contact with its senior representatives to discuss the challenges they are facing and ways we can support. \u201cWe continue to look at the best ways to restart all forms of transport, while also ensuring we limit the risk of creating a second wave of cases.\u201d",

      "body": "<p> With hospitals across the country struggling to get enough visors for their frontline staff, one has come up with a clever solution \u2013 make your own.</p> \n<p>New Cross hospital in Wolverhampton has turned its library into a mini-factory and has called in its specialists who usually help with facial reconstruction for patients after surgery.</p> \n<p>The Royal Wolverhampton NHS trust, which runs New Cross and two other hospitals in the Black Country, is believed to be the first to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/10/coronavirus-doctors-call-for-inquiry-into-ppe-shortages-for-nhs-staff\">tackle the NHS-wide shortage</a> of visors by resorting to in-house production.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe large numbers of patients with Covid-19 we have been dealing with during the pandemic meant we had unprecedented demand for visors and other forms of personal protective equipment (PPE),\u201d said Prof Steve Field, the chair of the trust\u2019s board.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe couldn\u2019t source visors in the volumes and to the specification we needed, so we decided to start making them in-house. Our clinical staff say they\u2019re the best visors they\u2019ve ever used.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"77142d5a-0bf3-4a80-b538-c47a11b57f6a\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak\">guidance on face masks</a> has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A team of staff from the three sites have made more than 100,000 visors since starting production on 10 April. Visors are an essential part of the PPE which staff should wear when at the highest risk of contracting coronavirus from droplets expelled by infected patients, for example when they are intubating them to go on a ventilator.</p> \n<p>The factory is churning out about 5,000 every day. About 3,000 go to staff at New Cross, which has 850 beds, and the other 2,000 are shared between the trust\u2019s much smaller Cannock Chase and West Park hospitals, community health services and GP practices it runs, and local care homes.</p> \n<p>Dave Ellis designed the visor. His usual job, the laboratory manager in New Cross\u2019s maxillofacial department, involves the manufacture of prosthetic ears, eyes and noses for patients who have had those body parts removed, usually as a result of cancer surgery.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>But the 34-strong team producing the visors also includes a nurse, healthcare assistant, a porter, medical students and a cardiac scientist. Some of them got involved after being removed from frontline duties because health problems put them at greater risk from Covid-19. Mel Riley, who is managing the team, normally tests and treats patients with eye problems such as squints or double vision but this is temporarily suspended as a result of the pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe real bonus of the whole process is that we\u2019ve taken a team from a really diverse set of backgrounds and put them together and come up with a really useful product that is fit for purpose. The visors have helped frontline staff feel more secure in their work,\u201d said Ellis.</p> \n<p>Field added: \u201cIt\u2019s marvellous to see the ingenuity inherent in prosthetics being used to create vital PPE. Staff are really enjoying the work and they know that it could help save the lives of their colleagues on the frontline.\u201d</p> \n<p>Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, said: \u201cThe fact that staff at this trust are now producing visors as part of its PPE kit for staff is one of a host of examples from the NHS trusts we represent rising to the vast array of challenges that this pandemic has thrown at them.</p> \n<p>\u201cRather than be completely reliant on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/uk-doctors-finding-it-harder-to-get-ppe-kit-to-treat-covid-19-patients-research-reveals\">external supplies of visors</a> the trust has taken the initiative, innovated and found solutions within its own organisation.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "With hospitals across the country struggling to get enough visors for their frontline staff, one has come up with a clever solution \u2013 make your own. New Cross hospital in Wolverhampton has turned its library into a mini-factory and has called in its specialists who usually help with facial reconstruction for patients after surgery. The Royal Wolverhampton NHS trust, which runs New Cross and two other hospitals in the Black Country, is believed to be the first to tackle the NHS-wide shortage of visors by resorting to in-house production. \u201cThe large numbers of patients with Covid-19 we have been dealing with during the pandemic meant we had unprecedented demand for visors and other forms of personal protective equipment (PPE),\u201d said Prof Steve Field, the chair of the trust\u2019s board. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t source visors in the volumes and to the specification we needed, so we decided to start making them in-house. Our clinical staff say they\u2019re the best visors they\u2019ve ever used.\u201d A team of staff from the three sites have made more than 100,000 visors since starting production on 10 April. Visors are an essential part of the PPE which staff should wear when at the highest risk of contracting coronavirus from droplets expelled by infected patients, for example when they are intubating them to go on a ventilator. The factory is churning out about 5,000 every day. About 3,000 go to staff at New Cross, which has 850 beds, and the other 2,000 are shared between the trust\u2019s much smaller Cannock Chase and West Park hospitals, community health services and GP practices it runs, and local care homes. Dave Ellis designed the visor. His usual job, the laboratory manager in New Cross\u2019s maxillofacial department, involves the manufacture of prosthetic ears, eyes and noses for patients who have had those body parts removed, usually as a result of cancer surgery. But the 34-strong team producing the visors also includes a nurse, healthcare assistant, a porter, medical students and a cardiac scientist. Some of them got involved after being removed from frontline duties because health problems put them at greater risk from Covid-19. Mel Riley, who is managing the team, normally tests and treats patients with eye problems such as squints or double vision but this is temporarily suspended as a result of the pandemic. \u201cThe real bonus of the whole process is that we\u2019ve taken a team from a really diverse set of backgrounds and put them together and come up with a really useful product that is fit for purpose. The visors have helped frontline staff feel more secure in their work,\u201d said Ellis. Field added: \u201cIt\u2019s marvellous to see the ingenuity inherent in prosthetics being used to create vital PPE. Staff are really enjoying the work and they know that it could help save the lives of their colleagues on the frontline.\u201d Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, said: \u201cThe fact that staff at this trust are now producing visors as part of its PPE kit for staff is one of a host of examples from the NHS trusts we represent rising to the vast array of challenges that this pandemic has thrown at them. \u201cRather than be completely reliant on external supplies of visors the trust has taken the initiative, innovated and found solutions within its own organisation.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for the UK blog today. As always thanks for reading along, and my colleague Clea Skopeliti is continuing our coronavirus coverage over on the global blog, as Spain records its lowest death toll in two months. Up to 20% of hospital patients in England got coronavirus while in for another illness. Up to a fifth of patients with Covid-19 in several hospitals contracted the disease while already being treated there for another illness. Some of the infections were passed on by hospital staff who were unaware they had the virus, while patients with coronavirus were responsible for the others. UK daily coronavirus death toll lowest since lockdown began. A further 170 people died after contracting the virus, although due to hospital reporting delays, the numbers reported on Sundays and Mondays are typically lower than other days. Government pledges \u00a384m to mass produce Oxford vaccine if trials successful. Oxford University has confirmed a global licensing agreement with AstraZeneca, which will make 30m vaccine doses available to the UK by September if the trials are successful, as part of an agreement for 100m doses in total. UK wrong to rule out global coronavirus comparisons, experts say. Academics\u2019 data on excess deaths shows the peak in England was higher than Italy\u2019s. Ministers have said comparisons are not accurate because countries collect their data in different ways. Data on reopening schools reassuring, says WHO scientist. Dr Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist at the World Health Organisation (WHO), said evidence from countries where schools have remained open suggests this has not led to large outbreaks of Covid-19. Police quiz man over death of rail worker spat at by \u2018Covid carrier\u2019. Belly Mujinga, 47, died after a man who claimed to have the virus spat at and coughed over her at Victoria station. British Transport Police said detectives had now identified a 57-year-old man in connection with the incident. Doctors believe blood-thinning drugs could help save lives in Covid-19 fight. Medical researchers have discovered a link between the virus and blood clots in the lungs. Specialists at Royal Brompton Hospital\u2019s severe respiratory failure service used hi-tech CT scans to take images of lung function in critically-ill patients. All of those tested suffered a lack of blood flow, suggesting clotting within the small vessels in the lung. Labour to plan green economic rescue from coronavirus crisis. Ed Miliband has called for the creation of a \u2018zero-carbon army\u2019 for eco-friendly industries, as part of Labour\u2019s proposals to rescue the post-coronavirus economy with a radical green recovery plan, focused on helping young people who lose their jobs by retraining them in green industries. Sharma wraps up the briefing by thanking the public for the action they are taking to reduce the R rate. Q: One of the government\u2019s five tests for lifting lockdown is that any supply issues with PPE and tests are solved, and the NHS can meet future demand. Are we there yet and if not, what is your best estimate for when we will be there? Powis responds that the government is leading on procurement of PPE and securing tests. The situation has improved with PPE over the past few weeks but continues to be a challenge, he said, with many countries across the world seeking supplies. I\u2019m confident that the government is addressing [PPE supply], yet I don\u2019t underestimate the challenges going forward. Testing capacity has increased, he said, and all patients who present to hospital in an emergency are tested whether they show symptoms or not. NHS staff are tested if they show symptoms, but hospitals are now being encouraged to test asymptomatic staff as well, he added. The next question asks about regional differences to the easing of lockdown measures across the country. Sharma is evasive in his answer, simply saying the government wants children to go back to school because \u201cearly learning is vital\u201d, and this will happen at the earliest from 1 June. He said academy chains across the country have said they will bring pupils back to school when the government says it is safe to do so. BBC political correspondent Vicky Young asked: Q: Is the government guaranteeing that the test, track and tracing system will be in place by 1 June, when many primary school pupils are due to return to classrooms in England? \u201cI want to thank teachers as they have managed to keep schools open for the children of essential workers,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cSafety is absolutely paramount,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve set out measures ensuring smaller class sizes... regular cleaning of surfaces, children washing their hands... that\u2019s how we\u2019ll ensure children and teachers are safe.\u201d Q: Why are visitors from France to the UK to be exempt from quarantine rules? \u201cI think there\u2019s a trade-off between the health of the nation and the health of the economy,\u201d Sharma said. He added that discussions have taken place with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, which will be made available in due course. There are no journalists live on screen today due to issues with Zoom, so Sharma will be reading questions out. However, the first question is from a member of the public, Peter, from County Durham. Q: The R rate in the North East and Yorkshire is now the highest in England. Does the government acknowledge that a phased geographically-based lifting of the lockdown would have been a better option? Sharma responded that when national monitoring becomes more precise the government can look at different approaches for regions, but it is too soon for this right now. Powis added that when we know the direct R rate - rather than discerning the R rate from modelling - the spread in different regions will become clearer. The number of daily confirmed cases is stable, said Powis, showing the rate of infection is slowing, but this is reliant on people continuing to abide by the social distancing measures. The number of Covid-19 patients in hospitals throughout all parts of the UK continues to fall, he added. The reduction has been greatest in London, but the fall has also been occurring in other parts of the country, although slower in some areas. The number of people attending A&amp;E has risen, said Professor Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England. A&amp;E figures have show a record low number visits, as people avoided hospitals during the coronavirus outbreak. Powis said the number of people seeking help for things such as heart attacks \u201chas now gone back to normal\u201d. He said people are listening to the message that they should be using the NHS as normal when they need it. Sharma also announced the government is investing a further \u00a393m in the Vaccines Manufacturing Innovation Centre at Harwell in Oxfordshire, ensuring it opens in summer 2021, ahead of schedule. He added that six drugs for treating the virus have now entered clinical trials. Sharma also confirmed that Oxford University has confirmed a global licensing agreement with AstraZeneca, which will make 30 million vaccine doses available to the UK by September if the trials are successful, as part of an agreement for 100 million doses in total. The UK will be the first to get access, he said. Sharma said the government has already invested \u00a347m in the Oxford University and Imperial College London vaccine trials, but is today announcing a further \u00a384m funding to help accelerate their work. He said this money will be used to start mass producing the Oxford vaccine is the trials prove successful, so it can be distributed to the UK population straight away. The funding will also allow Imperial to launch phase three of its vaccine trial later in the year. An update on the vaccine taskforce that Sharma announced last month, to coordinate government, academia and industry in the effort to find a Covid-19 vaccine. I\u2019m very proud of how quickly our scientists and researchers have come together. Their work has meant two of the world\u2019s front runners to develop a vaccine are right here in the UK, at the University of Oxford and Imperial College London. The first clinical trial of the Oxford vaccine is progressing well, with all phase one participants receiving their vaccine dose on schedule earlier this week. Imperial College is also making good progress, and is looking to move into clinical trials in mid-June, Sharma added. Sharma offers a reminder that the government has implemented a coronavirus alert level system, based on the R level (rate of infection across the country) saying we are on our way to level three, having been in level four since the start of lockdown. A week on from when Boris Johnson announced the easing of lockdown restrictions in England, he reminds people that they should be going back to work if they are unable to work at home, and that people can meet one other person at the park while maintaining two metre distance. He said people should wear face coverings in shops and on public transport and work at home where possible. The latest coronavirus figures: 91,206 tests were carried out yesterday There have been 3,142 new recorded cases 10,035 people are in hospital with Covid-19, down 15%, from 11,817, this time last week 34,636 have died after contracting Covid-19, an increase of 170 fatalties since yesterday Due to a technical issue, today\u2019s numbers do not include Northern Ireland cases, Sharma said. The government\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing is being led by the business secretary, Alok Sharma, today. He\u2019ll be talking about the latest developments in the country\u2019s search for a vaccine Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has tweeted the regional R numbers - that is, the rate at which people are passing on infections to others in different parts of the country. The data shows that the rate of infection is current highest in the North East and Yorkshire, and lowest in London. \u201cI hope the Government will agree at some point to publish the regional R numbers at the Downing Street briefing,\u201d Burnham said. \u201cBut, until that happens, I will highlight them myself on a regular basis. Here\u2019s the latest numbers that I have seen.\u201d He didn\u2019t specify exactly which date the numbers refer to. An R value above 1 means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which would result in a new surge of cases. Concern has been raised in recent days about the implications of lifting lockdown measures across England, when the rate of infection is higher in some areas. There has been a sharp rise in the number of people making contact with eating disorder charities since the start of the coronavirus lockdown almost eight weeks ago. The charity BEAT says calls to its helpline have increased by 50% and that there had been a 78% rise in contact made via social media compared with February. Charities are concerned that a reduction in hospital services and a move to online sessions could result in an increase in new cases and setbacks for those with an active eating disorder or those in early recovery. Caroline Price, BEAT\u2019s director of services, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising we\u2019ve seen such a large increase in contact. Changes in routines, living situations and care plans have the potential to trigger eating disorders. It\u2019s more important now than ever that those who are unwell feel supported.\u201d Dave\u2019s eating disorders started to return after his father died from Covid-19 six weeks ago. He says: At first I was in a state of constant denial. Now I just feel really horrible in my body, like I\u2019m losing control. Being sat around the house, surrounded by food, unable to exercise, worrying about calories \u2026 It\u2019s been really hard to cope, to be honest. The 31-year-old has been in recovery for four years after fast-track treatment for severe anorexia. He says processing the grief after his father\u2019s death, while struggling with an eating disorder has led to a deterioration in his mental health. I realised quite early on in lockdown that I was at risk of this all affecting my wellbeing. It\u2019s easy to go back to focusing on things that feel safe, somehow. I missed feeling I was winning at it, seeing the scales going down. I really feel this will give people an insight into what a restrictive eating disorder, binge eating, and even overeating, are really like. It\u2019s this constant thinking and talking about food - it\u2019s our only enjoyment and occupation at the moment. Hello everyone, this is Jessica Murray, I\u2019m taking over the blog ahead of the government\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing which is taking place at 4.30pm today. Tobias Altsch\u00e4ffl has written this on what it\u2019s like to be at a Bundesliga game as Germany kickstarts football\u2019s post Covid-19 era. The teams come out one after the other, first home, then away. Pleasantly there are less theatrics and arguments: on the pitch \u2013 a purer football than before. The atmosphere, on the other hand, is very, very strange. When Augsburg equalised to make it 1-1, the goal jingle is played. But where 25,000 fans would normally sing along, there is now silence. At this afternoon\u2019s Scottish government briefing, which was delayed and beset by technical difficulties, health secretary Jeane Freeman announced a two week pilot across three health boards to test out the software which contact tracers will use to collect the information that they need digitally. There are 600 staff ready to start work from tomorrow \u2013 there were earlier reports that no tracers had been recruited, but this appears to be because the initial recruitment came from within NHS Scotland. Freeman was questioned about claims this morning that the Scottish government had not conducted adequate contact tracing following an early outbreak of coronavirus at a Nike conference in Edinburgh in late February. Last week, BBC Scotland\u2019s Disclosure programme revealed that there were multiple transmissions of coronavirus in Edinburgh on 26 and 27 February, well before the first confirmed case in the country on 1 March, but that this was not disclosed to the public. Today the Scottish Mail on Sunday has reported that staff at a kilt shop in Edinburgh city centre that fitted conference delegates, and staff at a digital marketing business that shares an office building with Nike in Glasgow, fell ill shortly after. Workers at the two companies have claimed they were not told about the February outbreak. Scottish Labour MP Ian Murray described the lack of information to the public or those in contact with delegates as a \u201cnational scandal\u201d. Freeman insisted that \u201call the proper clinically-led standard protocols were followed\u201d, including the standard contact tracing. She pointed out that the success of tracing depends on the quality of information given by the \u2018trigger case\u2019. The number of people who have died after testing positive for coronavirus in Northern Ireland has risen to 476 after three more deaths were reported by the Department of Health. A further 12 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in Wales, taking the total number of deaths there to 1,203. Public Health Wales said 162 more people had tested positive for coronavirus, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 12,304. A further nine people have died after testing positive for coronavirus, the Scottish government has said, taking the country\u2019s total number of fatalities to 2,103. Best-selling author Neil Gaiman has caused outrage after admitting on his personal blog that he travelled 11,000 miles from New Zealand to his holiday home on Skye to isolate, after finding lockdown with his wife and son \u201crough\u201d. After weeks of entreaties from Scotland\u2019s politicians that people should not travel to Highland or island boltholes, as they underlined the risks this causes to local communities, local MP and the SNP\u2019s Westminster leader Ian Blackford said: \u201cTo come from the other end of the planet is gobsmacking. We will welcome all to the Highlands when it is safe to do so. For now stay away.\u201d Gaiman wrote: \u201cI needed to be somewhere I could talk to people in the UK while they and I were awake, not just before breakfast and after dinner. And I needed to be somewhere I could continue to isolate easily.\u201d He went on to describe being \u201cmasked and gloved\u201d on empty flights to London, and then the \u201csurreal\u201d drive north. It\u2019s fair to say that locals have found his arrival similarly surreal, with much online criticism of the author\u2019s selfishness, and pleas that there should be no exemptions from lockdown guidance, while Gaiman insists that he has not put anyone at risk. The Sunday Times has published its annual \u2018rich list\u2019, which finds that British billionaires have lost more than \u00a354bn in the past two months amid the coronavirus pandemic. The combined wealth of the UK\u2019s 1,000 richest people has plummeted for the first time since the financial crash, the research finds, with some billionaires counting losses of up to \u00a36bn since last year. Inventor Sir James Dyson is ranked as the richest person in the UK for the first time. The Brexit-backing business man saw his wealth grow by \u00a33.6bn over the past year, climbing to \u00a316.2bn. According to the paper\u2019s calculations, the richest people in the UK are: Sir James Dyson and family, household goods and technology, \u00a316.2bn. Sri and Gopi Hinduja and family, industry and finance, \u00a316bn. David and Simon Reuben, property and internet, \u00a316bn. Sir Leonard Blavatnik, investment, music and media, \u00a315.78bn. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, Ineos chemical giant, \u00a312.15bn. Kirsten and Jorn Rausing, inheritance and investment, \u00a312.1bn. Alisher Usmanov, mining and investment, \u00a311.68bn. Guy, George and Galen Jr Weston and family, retail, \u00a310.53bn. Charlene de Carvalho-Heineken and Michel de Carvalho, inheritance, brewing and banking, \u00a310.3bn. The Duke of Westminster and the Grosvenor family, property, \u00a310.29bn. NHS England has announced that a further 90 people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in England, a sharp drop from yesterday\u2019s figure of 181. However, they said: \u201cThe Covid Patient Notification System did not operate for a period of time on Saturday 16 May. The consequences of this situation may therefore be reflected in the number of deaths reported today by NHS England and NHS Improvement.\u201d It brings the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 24,617. The patients whose deaths were reported on Saturday were aged between 45 and 100 years old, and one had no known underlying health condition. While the vast majority of people appear to have heeded the pleas to stay away from beauty spots this weekend, it seems a few were tempted to breach the lockdown. Police in Telford, Shropshire, broke up a group of about 70 people who had gathered in a park for a rave \u2013 complete with their own DJ set \u2013 on Saturday night. In Wales, a family from Birmingham were fined and sent home after they were caught by police climbing Pen y Fan in the Brecon Beacons on Sunday morning. Officers from the Brecon Roads Policing Unit said the saw the family walking down the mountain on a closed footpath in the national park, presumably after making the 100-mile cross-border journey from the Midlands. A force spokesman said: \u201cWales is still closed. Our national parks are still closed.\u201d Michael Gove has told local authorities refusing to reopen their schools on 1 June to \u201clook to their responsibilities\u201d, saying: \u201cIf you really care about children, you\u2019ll want them in schools.\u201d Appearing on the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, the Cabinet Office minister said: \u201cWe are confident that children and teachers will be safe.\u201d Gove also said the government had now recruited 17,000 contact tracers for its coronavirus test, track and trace programme \u2013 bringing it close to its target. Health secretary Matt Hancock said on 23 April that the government wanted to recruit 18,000 contact tracers by mid-May. But speaking on Friday, northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis said only 1,500 had been recruited. The latest Opinium poll for the Observer shows that approval for the government over its handling of the pandemic has plummeted by nine points in the last week. Whereas net approval of its performance \u2013 the figure reached when the percentage who disapprove is subtracted from percentage who approve \u2013 stood at +42% on 26 March, it has now fallen to -3%. Overall data from the few countries that have reopened schools has been \u201cvery reassuring\u201d but governments need to consider what checks are needed to avoid a spread of Covid-19, the chief scientist at the World Health Organisation (WHO) has said. Dr Soumya Swaminathan said she believes that \u201csociety has to restart\u201d but that there will be a new normal. Boris Johnson has acknowledged \u201cfrustration\u201d over the new lockdown rules, which have been criticised for being complicated and unclear, and admitted that there may never be a vaccine for coronavirus. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, the prime minister announced a \u00a393m investment to open the new Vaccine Manufacturing And Innovation Centre, 12 months ahead of schedule. He said: There remains a very long way to go, and I must be frank that a vaccine might not come to fruition. But we are leading the global effort. Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw has described as \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d media reports on Sunday morning that the Scottish government has yet to recruit a single Covid-19 contact tracer, despite the fact that almost 8500 people have applied online for the 2000 roles as call handlers, data analysts and health protection nurses. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Sunday Politics Scotland, Carlaw said that the key to giving people the confidence to return to workplaces was the ability to properly test and identify outbreaks, and that until then \u201cwe are not going to be able to give people the reassurance they need\u201d. This week Nicola Sturgeon is expected to set out plans for further relaxing of lockdown restrictions, with outdoor activities such as golf, tennis and angling expected to be included. But it is also anticipated that she will continue to exercise more caution around mixing of different households, which of course has implications for a return to workplaces as well as social life. Dr Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist at the World Health Organisation (WHO), spoke to the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show earlier. The PA news agency has her comments. Asked about the reopening of schools, and evidence from countries that have done so, Dr Swaminathan said: Overall, the data has been very reassuring, though of course it\u2019s only a few countries that have done that. The guidance that has been put out by WHO clearly lays out the criteria you would use when you consider whether to reopen a school or not... It\u2019s really important that all the stakeholders, that is the teachers, the children themselves and the parents or caregivers, have had a chance to have a dialogue and ask questions, and be informed of what is being done to minimise the risks and what they need to do. Dr Swaminathan said evidence from countries where schools have remained open suggests this has not led to large outbreaks of Covid-19. What we have seen in countries where schools have remained open is that there have not been big outbreaks in schools, and where there have been it\u2019s been associated with events - where a lot of people gather, not in regular classrooms, and it\u2019s often been associated with an adult whose had the infection and has spread it. Four crown court jury trials are scheduled to start on Monday using socially distanced courtrooms in Bristol, Manchester, Cardiff and at the Old Bailey in London. New jury trials were suspended on March 23rd due to the coronavirus crisis. A judiciary-led working group, under Mr Justice Edis, has been devising methods since then to ensure a safe resumption of criminal justice once lockdown is eased. Juries will be spread out using seats normally occupied by barristers. The proceedings will be live-streamed to an adjacent courtroom where journalists will have space allocated to allow them to sit two metres apart. Normally around 1,000 jury trials are heard every month in England and Wales. The next three crown courts expected to restart fresh jury trials are Reading, Warwick and Winchester. Most of the initial cases are expected to be relatively short, lasting less than two weeks. Public Health England and Public Health Wales have been involved in the jury trials working group. The recommendations are detailed in a public information leaflet. Jurors are instructed to: \u201cBring your own refreshments as cafes and canteens will not be open in our court buildings. Please provide your own drinking vessel, but do not bring metal cutlery.\u201d Two trials, which had been suspended in March, resumed with social distancing at the Old Bailey last week with the same jurors. The chief executive of Heathrow Airport John Holland-Kaye has warned the government that quarantine measures should not extend beyond \u201ca relatively short amount of time\u201d to save the economy. The government announced plans last Sunday for a two-week quarantine for travellers arriving in the UK from abroad, though the exact details haven\u2019t yet been announced. Holland-Kaye told Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme that Heathrow\u2019s passenger numbers had dropped by 97% \u2013 from an average of 250,000 passengers a day to between 5,000 and 6,000. He said most of these passengers were either repatriating to the UK or going home to other countries. The quarantine cannot be in place for more than a relatively short amount of time if we are going to get the economy moving again. There needs to be a plan for what comes next. This is where we are urging the Government to have a common international standard, working with other countries so that traffic can start to flow in a normal way between low risk countries. Speaking to the same programme, Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, said she\u2019d heard from businesses in aerospace and manufacturing who were very worried about the government\u2019s quarantine plans. \u201cWe would like to see an international standard,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the moment you\u2019ve got different countries doing different things and that is very bad for global trade.\u201d The Scottish government is seeking the power to take over the running of private care homes, after the tenth death was confirmed yesterday at Home Farm on Skye, which is being stripped of its licence to operate after serious shortcomings in its management was found by the Care Inspectorate. On Wednesday, Holyrood is expected to pass emergency powers that will allow care homes to be taken into public sector control in the event of similar failings. NHS Highland has stepped in to help run the facility in Portree, Skye, where 30 residents and 29 staff have tested positive for coronavirus. Last week, the Sunday Times revealed that some workers had been moved hundreds of miles to help plug staff shortages at the home, which has had long-running recruitment problems amid concerns about low pay. Gove also defended the government\u2019s plans to begin reopening primary schools in England from next month. He told Sky News: Other countries have succeeded in ensuring children can return to school safely. The nature of what happens in the classroom has changed. Instead of children working around the table they are sitting at desks separate from each other and, as a result, they are able to learn, they are able to benefit from being in school. Gove told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show that the government were confident that teachers and students would be safe if they returned to school. He said that pupils may have to sit at separate desks, that class sizes should be capped at 15 and arrival times should be staggered. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove has told Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme that the government has now recruited 17,000 contact tracers for its coronavirus test, track and trace programme \u2013 bringing it close to its target. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said on 23 April that the government wanted to recruit 18,000 contact tracers by mid-May. But speaking on Friday, northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis said only 1,500 had been recruited. The prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said later that day that Lewis did not have the most up-to-date figures. \u201cIt is now the case that more than 17,000 people have been recruited for contact tracing, so we are on course to meet that target,\u201d said Gove on Sunday morning. \u201cI have to praise the work of the health secretary Matt Hancock. In the past people have seen Matt and the government set ambitious targets and said on testing \u2018that won\u2019t be met\u2019 - Matt met that target,\u201d Gove said of the 100,000-a-day testing target. He said the test, track and trace programme \u2013 seen as key to further lifting of lockdown restrictions \u2013 would be up and running by the end of May. A story in today\u2019s Mail on Sunday reports that the Labour leader Keir Starmer owns land \u201cworth up to \u00a310m\u201d. The piece of land in question is a field behind his parents house in Surrey, which he bought in 1996. It currently doesn\u2019t have planning permission, but \u2013 if it did \u2013 it could be worth a lot of money, the paper reports. Starmer has no plans to sell the land. Starmer\u2019s response to the story has been getting as much attention as the story itself. A spokesperson for the Labour leader told the paper: Keir purchased the field for his late disabled mother. The field was used to house donkeys that Keir\u2019s parents rescued and cared for. After his mother lost the ability to walk, the field allowed her to still watch the donkeys from her home. The field is not for sale and no one, developer or otherwise, has been shown around it. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show, Labour\u2019s deputy leader Angela Rayner has said that if the test, track and trace strategy were in place before reopening schools, that would reassure parents and teachers \u2013 a point also made by Rachel Reeves earlier this morning. She repeated calls for the government to publish the scientific advice that informed their decision to send some pupils back to school as early as 1 June. Labour wants as many pupils as possible to go back to school as quickly as possible, she said. The Sun on Sunday reports today that Boris Johnson told a virtual meeting of backbench Tory MPs that he wanted the country back to \u201cclose to normality again before the end of July\u201d. The paper\u2019s political editor, David Wooding, writes that the prime minister told a video call with 100 of his MPs that full Commons sittings would resume on 2 June. He quotes an MP as saying: Boris told us he is determined that the country should be as close to normality again before the end of July. But he was clear that is all depends on the country meeting the conditions that have been set for tackling the virus. Most importantly that means bringing down the infection rate \u2013 and that can only be achieved if the continues to obey the rules on social distancing to help stop it spreading. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves has been speaking to Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme. She said the reopening of schools was a \u201cdifficult balancing act\u201d as social distancing, particularly for young children, is \u201creally, really tough\u201d along with the wearing of face masks. She said teachers and parents would be less anxious about the return to school if there was a test, trace and isolate strategy in place. Government need to put in place some of the measures to improve confidence and that includes the test, trace and isolate strategy. The government abandoned that back in the middle of March, that was a mistake because the countries that have most successfully tackled the virus have had extensive systems of test, trace and isolate and the government now says they want to bring that back by mid-May \u2026 the anxiety that teachers and parents face, I think would be a lot less if we had that test, trace and isolate strategy in place. Her comments come following an announcement by education secretary Gavin Williamson at yesterday\u2019s Downing Street press conference that schoolchildren and their families would be tested for coronavirus if they develop symptoms. Teaching unions have pushed back against government proposals for some pupils to return to school as soon as 1 June. The British Medical Association, the UK\u2019s largest doctors\u2019 union \u2013 also said in a letter to the National Education Union on Friday that the number of coronavirus infections remained too high to allow them to run safely. Damian Hinds, former Conservative education secretary, told BBC Breakfast this morning that it was \u201ctotally understandable\u201d that people had concerns about their children returning to school and that he would expect teaching unions to be thinking about their members, adding this is \u201cabsolutely right\u201d. He added that he thinks \u201cthe time is right now\u201d for pupils to begin to return, saying \u201cthere is a lot scientific advice and analysis gone into this\u201d. Here are today\u2019s front pages, tweeted by the BBC\u2019s Neil Henderson. More from the Observer \u2013 The latest Opinium poll for the paper shows that approval for the government over its handling of the pandemic has plummeted by nine points in the last week. Whereas net approval of its performance \u2013 the figure reached when the percentage who disapprove is subtracted from percentage who approve \u2013 stood at +42% on 26 March, it has now fallen to -3%. For the first time since Opinium began tracking views on the pandemic in March, more people disapprove of the government\u2019s handling than approve. Only 44% think the new \u201cstay alert\u201d message is clear. Some 56% say they are not clear who they can meet outside their household. Andy Burnham has written in the Observer that no one thought to tell the leaders of the biggest towns and cities outside London in advance of the prime minister\u2019s decision to encourage people to go back to work last Monday. In Greater Manchester, we had no real notice of the measures. On the eve of a new working week, the PM was on TV \u2018actively encouraging\u2019 a return to work. Even though that would clearly put more cars on roads and people on trams, no one in government thought it important to tell the cities who\u2019d have to cope with that. Far from a planned, safety-led approach, this looked like another exercise in Cummings chaos theory. But it wasn\u2019t just the lack of notice that was the problem. The surprisingly permissive package might well be right for the southeast, given the fall in cases there. But my gut feeling told me it was too soon for the north. Certainly, the abrupt dropping of the clear \u201cstay at home\u201d message felt premature. You can read the full piece here and the Observer\u2019s news story here. I\u2019ll be bringing you the highlights from this morning\u2019s political shows, Sophy Ridge on Sunday (today hosted by Niall Paterson) is on Sky News at 8.30am. Guests will include the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, and Rachel Reeves, his Labour opposite number. Liam Fox, former international trade secretary will make an appearance, as will Heathrow Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye and CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn. Gove will also be on the Andrew Marr show on BBC 1, which starts at 9am. Other guests include Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, WHO Chief Scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan and Office for Budget Responsibility chair Robert Chote. Good morning and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s UK coronavirus live blog. Boris Johnson has acknowledged \u201cfrustration\u201d over the new lockdown rules, which have been criticised for being complicated and unclear, and acknowledged that there may never be a vaccine for coronavirus. Writing in the Mail on Sunday, the prime minister said: I understand people will feel frustrated with some of the new rules. We are trying to do something that has never had to be done before \u2013 moving the country out of a full lockdown, in a way which is safe and does not risk sacrificing all of your hard work. I recognise what we are now asking is more complex than simply staying at home, but this is a complex problem and we need to trust in the good sense of the British people. If we all stick at it, then we\u2019ll be able, gradually, to get rid of the complexities and the restrictions and make it easier and simpler for families to meet again. But we must move slowly, and at the right time. He thanked the public for being patient, saying: \u201cI want to reassure you that there is a route out of this.\u201d Johnson added the government would throw everything they could at finding a vaccine, and announced a \u00a393m investment to open the new Vaccine Manufacturing And Innovation Centre, 12 months ahead of schedule. (You can read more about that here.) There remains a very long way to go, and I must be frank that a vaccine might not come to fruition. But we are leading the global effort. I\u2019m Frances Perraudin and I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest developments in the pandemic in the UK today.

Perhaps just as sales of Albert Camus\u2019s The Plague increased as we entered the crisis, News from Nowhere will be the novel that we read as we emerge into the new normal and strive to build a better world.

It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The platform\u2019s technical issues affected Downing Street\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing.

It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Hospitals around the world have since reported <a href=\"https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/paediatric-inflammatory-multisystem-syndrome-and-sars-cov-2-rapid-risk-assessment\">hundreds of similar cases</a> that many doctors believe are caused by the immune system overreacting to the virus sometimes weeks after infection.</p> \n<p>About 100 children in Britain have been treated for the disease.

      "body": "<p>It was only a month and a half ago that the private equity specialist Peter Wiggs was hailed as the saviour of Australian rugby, whose financial fragility had been exposed by the coronavirus pandemic. The chairman of Supercars was seen as the ideal candidate to repair relations with the broadcaster Fox Sports and organise a resumption of play.</p> <p>But Wiggs only lasted 37 days as a Rugby Australia (RA) director. The day he was to be appointed as chairman, 6 May, he resigned after the board rebuffed his choice of a new chief executive, the Australian Olympic Committee CEO Matt Carroll.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/15/rugby-australia-appoints-hamish-mclennan-as-new-chairman\">Rugby Australia appoints Hamish McLennan as new chairman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wiggs\u2019s departure would have been more damaging if not for the fact RA had another possible saviour ready to fill his shoes \u2013 the former Network Ten chief executive and News Corp executive Hamish McLennan, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/15/rugby-australia-appoints-hamish-mclennan-as-new-chairman\">appointed to the board as chairman on Friday</a>, just nine days after Wiggs left.</p> <p>Rumours had circulated for months McLennan would join RA\u2019s board. Ironically, Wiggs and McLennan were meant to join together as part of the first wave of RA\u2019s process of renewal, but for whatever reason that did not happen. Having that pair together would have given the board extra energy and expertise, but at least McLennan will finally get there when his appointment officially starts on 15 June.</p> <p>On the same day RA announced McLennan\u2019s appointment it confirmed it received $14.2m in \u201cfunding\u201d from World Rugby as part of the global governing body\u2019s coronavirus relief strategy. In truth it is a low-interest loan and will need to be repaid. RA\u2019s interim chief-executive, Rob Clarke, said the sum would see the game through the next 12 months, but what about after that? That is where McLennan comes in.</p> <p>We know he can count to a billion. A quick glance at McLennan\u2019s impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 indicates he possesses the financial expertise to help steer Australian rugby through troubled waters. He is the chairman of several ASX-listed companies, including REA Group, and deputy chair of Magellan Financial Group, a global equity fund. It is all multi-billion dollar stuff.</p> <p>Running Australian rugby should be a walk in the park by comparison, but it is not. It is a difficult, complicated, frustrating exercise, which has seen numerous saviours come and go. As McLennan himself says: \u201cFortune favours the brave.\u201d He will need to be brave to take on this Herculean task.</p> <p>McLennan has stated he wants to \u201crebuild trust\u201d across the rugby community. We have heard that before, too many times. If there is one thing that there is just too little of in Australian rugby it is trust, particularly between RA, the state unions and the premier clubs.</p> <p>Eight years after implementing a so-called independent governance structure, RA is seeking to transform its governance model once again \u201cto ensure all parts of the rugby community can thrive\u201d.

      "bodyText": "It was only a month and a half ago that the private equity specialist Peter Wiggs was hailed as the saviour of Australian rugby, whose financial fragility had been exposed by the coronavirus pandemic. The chairman of Supercars was seen as the ideal candidate to repair relations with the broadcaster Fox Sports and organise a resumption of play. But Wiggs only lasted 37 days as a Rugby Australia (RA) director. The day he was to be appointed as chairman, 6 May, he resigned after the board rebuffed his choice of a new chief executive, the Australian Olympic Committee CEO Matt Carroll. Wiggs\u2019s departure would have been more damaging if not for the fact RA had another possible saviour ready to fill his shoes \u2013 the former Network Ten chief executive and News Corp executive Hamish McLennan, who was appointed to the board as chairman on Friday, just nine days after Wiggs left. Rumours had circulated for months McLennan would join RA\u2019s board. Ironically, Wiggs and McLennan were meant to join together as part of the first wave of RA\u2019s process of renewal, but for whatever reason that did not happen. Having that pair together would have given the board extra energy and expertise, but at least McLennan will finally get there when his appointment officially starts on 15 June. On the same day RA announced McLennan\u2019s appointment it confirmed it received $14.2m in \u201cfunding\u201d from World Rugby as part of the global governing body\u2019s coronavirus relief strategy. In truth it is a low-interest loan and will need to be repaid. RA\u2019s interim chief-executive, Rob Clarke, said the sum would see the game through the next 12 months, but what about after that? That is where McLennan comes in. We know he can count to a billion. A quick glance at McLennan\u2019s impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 indicates he possesses the financial expertise to help steer Australian rugby through troubled waters. He is the chairman of several ASX-listed companies, including REA Group, and deputy chair of Magellan Financial Group, a global equity fund. It is all multi-billion dollar stuff. Running Australian rugby should be a walk in the park by comparison, but it is not. It is a difficult, complicated, frustrating exercise, which has seen numerous saviours come and go. As McLennan himself says: \u201cFortune favours the brave.\u201d He will need to be brave to take on this Herculean task. McLennan has stated he wants to \u201crebuild trust\u201d across the rugby community. We have heard that before, too many times. If there is one thing that there is just too little of in Australian rugby it is trust, particularly between RA, the state unions and the premier clubs. Eight years after implementing a so-called independent governance structure, RA is seeking to transform its governance model once again \u201cto ensure all parts of the rugby community can thrive\u201d. Creating the right governance model that is mutually beneficial for all of Australian rugby\u2019s stakeholders is the key. It is a bit like a coronavirus vaccine. It is elusive, but once found a lot of problems will disappear. In the meantime, the best way for McLennan to rebuild trust with the stakeholders will be to help RA re-negotiate its broadcast deal to put the game back on a secure financial footing, giving it some degree of certainty in uncertain times. Fox Sports is playing hard ball after a falling-out with RA\u2019s previous leadership, but it is unlikely someone with McLennan\u2019s broadcast experience would have accepted the chairmanship if he did not think a deal could be done with Fox or someone else. There have been reports Fox Sports is now only willing to pay $10m-15m a year for the broadcast rights, way down on its current $57m-a-year deal, while other reports say the pay-TV network has walked away from rugby. This is where McLennan\u2019s experience in negotiating the Big Bash League TV rights will come in handy, but it is his time as a Mahogany Row insider at News Corp that will be potentially invaluable to Australian rugby. Fox Sports survives on subscriptions. McLennan will have a fair idea of rugby\u2019s intrinsic value to it as a driver of subscriptions. What is the magic number? Is it closer to what Fox is paying now or only $10m-15m, or even lower? Without a lucrative broadcast deal Australian rugby cannot continue in its current form, and it needs some kind of TV agreement to exist at all as a professional sport. RA and McLennan will get a chance to test the waters when they re-negotiate with Fox Sports \u2013 or another mystery bidder \u2013 about a resumption of play this year. There are various plans for a domestic Super Rugby competition with Australia\u2019s four franchises plus the Western Force and the Japanese Sunwolves, with a starting date of early July, but this remains problematic while state borders are closed. If RA can get some kind of competition up and running with support from a broadcaster it will keep Australian rugby going, but it is the next broadcast deal that will determine the future shape of the game in this country. McLennan will have to succeed in this field, or RA will be left again waiting for its next messiah.",

The Invest to Recover plan, released on Monday, sets up the Greens\u2019 economic argument leading into the next election as a battle against Coalition austerity and Labor, which it says is \u201cafraid of sensible borrowing to invest in our future\u201d. The biggest ticket items include a jobs guarantee, free tertiary education for under 30s, $24bn over 10 years for public education, a $12bn manufacturing fund, 500,000 new public and community homes, $25bn on public transport, $6bn to modernise the electricity grid, a $6bn nature fund and $2.3bn for the arts. The Greens also propose retaining key features of the coronavirus support packages including free childcare and the doubling of unemployment benefits to $1,100 a fortnight. While the minor party holds just one lower house seat and can only govern in partnership with other parties, its policies from a banking royal commission, lifting Newstart and preventing cuts to penalty rates have proved influential, especially over Labor. Labor has already proposed the government should provide more support for the arts sector and spend its way out of the Covid-19 contraction with a housing construction package and a nation-building infrastructure program. But Anthony Albanese has warned the shadow front bench that, if elected, Labor would face a \u201cconstrained fiscal situation\u201d and the shadow finance minister, Katy Gallagher, has called for an audit into government debt, in a bid to shame the Coalition for doubling gross debt since it took office in 2013. The Greens estimate Australia\u2019s net debt would rise from 30% of GDP to 44% under its plan \u2013 an increase of $300bn over 10 years \u2013 which it argues is \u201cstill less than half of the advanced economies\u2019 average of 95% during the pandemic and well below those countries\u2019 debt levels even before Covid-19 (which was 76%)\u201d.

Businesses are being allowed to gradually go back to work as long they can enforce tight protocols and keep people at least 1 metre apart. Economic recovery is expected to be difficult, particularly without tourists.</p> <h2>Lebanon to gradually reopen economy on Monday</h2> <p>Lebanon will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/17/coronavirus-live-news-barack-obama-attacks-trump-virus-response?page=with:block-5ec155398f0864e579f12931#block-5ec155398f0864e579f12931\">gradually reopen its economy beginning on Monday</a> following a four-day shutdown imposed after a rise in coronavirus cases threatened a second wave of the outbreak. The country\u2019s plan to ease restrictions on business was paused last week after a rise in new cases. The country of about 6 million people has recorded 911 infections and 26 deaths.</p> <h2><strong>UK daily coronavirus death toll lowest since lockdown began</strong></h2> <p>A further 170 people have died after contracting the virus, the lowest figure since the the UK\u2019s lockdown began. However, because of hospital reporting delays, the numbers reported on Sundays and Mondays tend to be lower than other days.</p> <h2><strong>India extends lockdown by two weeks</strong></h2> <p>India has extended a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/17/coronavirus-live-news-barack-obama-attacks-trump-virus-response?page=with:block-5ec146888f0886ce4f5d52ff#block-5ec146888f0886ce4f5d52ff\">nearly two-month-old lockdown by another two weeks</a> with Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai and other key regions still fighting to control the rising curve of coronavirus infections. The health ministry on Sunday reported a record rise of nearly 5,000 cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, raising the number of confirmed cases to 90,927, with 2,872 deaths.</p> <h2>Benin conducts local elections amid coronavirus</h2> <p>Benin is staging local elections, minus key opposition parties, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/17/coronavirus-live-news-barack-obama-attacks-trump-virus-response?page=with:block-5ec13bc78f0886ce4f5d52c3#block-5ec13bc78f0886ce4f5d52c3\">authorities pushing ahead despite the coronavirus</a>. The west African nation of 11 million people this week lifted a series of restrictions aimed at halting the spread of the virus, which has caused 339 confirmed infections and two deaths in the country.</p> <h2>Cases in Brazil surpass total in Italy</h2> <p>Confirmed Covid-19 cases in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/17/coronavirus-live-news-barack-obama-attacks-trump-virus-response?page=with:block-5ec132ec8f0864e579f1285b#block-5ec132ec8f0864e579f1285b\">Brazil have surpassed the total in Italy</a>, with the country announcing nearly 15,000 new infections on Saturday. This takes Brazil\u2019s total to more than 230,000, the fourth-largest confirmed caseload after the US, Russia and the UK.</p> <h2>Wuhan almost doubles coronavirus testing</h2> <p>The city of Wuhan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/17/coronavirus-live-news-barack-obama-attacks-trump-virus-response?page=with:block-5ec12e328f0886ce4f5d5264#block-5ec12e328f0886ce4f5d5264\">conducted 222,675 </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/17/coronavirus-live-news-barack-obama-attacks-trump-virus-response?page=with:block-5ec12e328f0886ce4f5d5264#block-5ec12e328f0886ce4f5d5264\">tests on 16 May,</a> the local health authority said, nearly doubling from a day earlier.

      "bodyText": "Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Italy prepares to further ease lockdown Italy\u2019s shops, restaurants and hair salons have been preparing to reopen on Monday, as the government further eases the lockdown. Businesses are being allowed to gradually go back to work as long they can enforce tight protocols and keep people at least 1 metre apart. Economic recovery is expected to be difficult, particularly without tourists. Lebanon to gradually reopen economy on Monday Lebanon will gradually reopen its economy beginning on Monday following a four-day shutdown imposed after a rise in coronavirus cases threatened a second wave of the outbreak. The country\u2019s plan to ease restrictions on business was paused last week after a rise in new cases. The country of about 6 million people has recorded 911 infections and 26 deaths. UK daily coronavirus death toll lowest since lockdown began A further 170 people have died after contracting the virus, the lowest figure since the the UK\u2019s lockdown began. However, because of hospital reporting delays, the numbers reported on Sundays and Mondays tend to be lower than other days. India extends lockdown by two weeks India has extended a nearly two-month-old lockdown by another two weeks with Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai and other key regions still fighting to control the rising curve of coronavirus infections. The health ministry on Sunday reported a record rise of nearly 5,000 cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, raising the number of confirmed cases to 90,927, with 2,872 deaths. Benin conducts local elections amid coronavirus Benin is staging local elections, minus key opposition parties, with authorities pushing ahead despite the coronavirus. The west African nation of 11 million people this week lifted a series of restrictions aimed at halting the spread of the virus, which has caused 339 confirmed infections and two deaths in the country. Cases in Brazil surpass total in Italy Confirmed Covid-19 cases in Brazil have surpassed the total in Italy, with the country announcing nearly 15,000 new infections on Saturday. This takes Brazil\u2019s total to more than 230,000, the fourth-largest confirmed caseload after the US, Russia and the UK. Wuhan almost doubles coronavirus testing The city of Wuhan conducted 222,675 tests on 16 May, the local health authority said, nearly doubling from a day earlier. Wuhan kicked off a campaign on 14 May to look for asymptomatic carriers after confirming last weekend its first cluster of Covid-19 infections since its release from lockdown on 8 April. Quebec considers making masks mandatory, after banning the veil The Canadian province at the centre of the country\u2019s outbreak is is currently \u201cstrongly recommending\u201d that citizens wear masks, but has not made the measure mandatory. Quebec\u2019s public health director said: \u201cYou need to have a good argument for infringing on individual rights for the sake of a collective right.\u201d It is less than a year since the passing of a secularism law forcing certain members of religious minorities to uncover their heads and faces. Russia\u2019s virus spread stabilising, health official says The growth of new coronavirus cases in Russia is stabilising, a top health official has said, as the daily tally fell under 10,000 for the third time this week. The country has the world\u2019s second highest number of infections at 281,752, topped only by the United States. Madagascar reports first coronavirus death Madagascar has reported the first death of a patient suffering from coronavirus, nearly two months after the virus was first detected in the country.

It\u2019s all a bit strange, but in the next few weeks Bayern Munich hope to give the football world a glimpse of the old normal: Manuel Neuer lifting the Meisterschale. Bayern are aiming to win their eighth consecutive championship, an endeavour that resumes with today\u2019s trip to mid-table Union Berlin.</p> \n  <p>Bayern were in storming form before spring break. They won 14 and drew one of the last 15 games in all competitions, scoring 49 goals in that time. That burst of form lifted them from seventh place \u2013 oh, the humanity \u2013 to their familiar position at the top of the table. </p> \n  <p>They\u2019re currently a point ahead of Dortmund with today\u2019s game in hand. The two sides will meet a week on Tuesday, all being well, in a humdinger at the Westfalenstadion. There\u2019ll be some atmosphere for that g- oh I can\u2019t be bothered. Yellow Wall or no, Bayern will want to go to Dortmund with at least a four-point lead. Better win today then, hadn\u2019t they?</p> \n  <p><strong>Kick off</strong> 5pm BST, 6pm in Berlin.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-17T16:02:01.366Z\">at 5.02pm BST</time></p> \n</div>",

Thanks for your company on emails. Bye! \u201cAchtung Dortmund\u201d is the subject of Peter Oh\u2019s email. \u201cLike David Bowie, Lou Reed, U2, and others (though not the Ramones, as far as I know), Bayern are finding Berlin to be an inspirational place to get a good result.\u201d Menswe@r recorded their debut album at the Hansa Studios as well. Peep peep! Elbowbumps all round for Bayern, who return to action with a comfortable win, achieved in second gear. Robert Lewandowski scored a first-half penalty, his 40th goal in 34 games this season, and Benjamin Pavard\u2019s precise header finished the job with 10 minutes remaining. 90 min A late chance for Union. Lenz slips a good through pass towards Mees in the area. The ball is taken off him by Kroos, who rakes a left-footed shot that is beaten away at the near post by Neuer. 89 min Mickael Cuisance replaces Thomas Muller for Bayern. 88 min Gikiewicz charges from his area to beat Lewandowski to a long ball. 85 min More substitutions: Perisic for Gnabry (Bayern), plus Kroos and Ryerson for Promel and Bulter. 84 min This win puts Bayern four points clear of Borussia Dortmund and six ahead of Gladbach. It looks ominous, let\u2019s be honest. Their next game is Eintracht Frankfurt at home on Saturday. Union\u2019s next game is a beauty: Hertha Berlin away on Friday. I bloody love the Bundesliga, me. 82 min Schlotterbeck is down after wearing the stiff left arm of Thomas Muller. It wasn\u2019t intentional, and he\u2019s fine to resume. 81 min Another Union change: Joshua Mees replaces Ingvartsen. That\u2019ll do. Kimmich\u2019s dipping corner from the right is met by Pavard, who gets above Hubner and plants a header into the bottom corner. Good goal. 80 min The quality of Davies\u2019s decision-making in the final third, especially for a teenager, is quite something. He plays with his head up all the time. 79 min: Good save! After another superb Bayern counter-attack, this time involving Davies on the left, Gnabry\u2019s close-range shot is blocked by the outrushing keeper Gikiewicz. 78 min Gentner plays an unwitting one-two with Thiago before thrashing a half-volley well wide from the edge of the box. It was enterprising play, though. He tried to feed a ball into the area, Thiago blocked it, and Gentner was first to the loose ball before shooting wide. 77 min Coman misses a great chance! Gnabry led a counter-attack with a thrilling run at a backpedalling defence. Then he played in Coman, who screwed his cross-shot well wide of the far post. 76 min For all Bayern\u2019s dominance, it\u2019s still only 1-0. Bayern will be filthy if they don\u2019t win this. 75 min The substitute Gentner runs onto a loose ball 20 yards from goal but slices his shot horribly. It would have gone out for a throw-in had it not been intercepted. 74 min Coman wins a corner for Bayern. Nowt comes of it. 72 min Another dangerous low cross from the impressive Davies just evades the lunging Muller at the near post. 71 min Bayern also make a change, with Kingsley Coman replacing Goretzka. 71 min A double change for Union: Christian Gentner and the top scorer Sebastian Andersson replace Ujah and Andrich. 70 min Muller, who has had an excellent game, pulls into space on the right before whacking a good cross that goes right across the face of goal. 68 min Trimmel\u2019s inswinging corner is patted down by Neuer and grabbed at the second attempt. 67 min Lenz wins a corner for Union, a chance for a breather and maybe even an equaliser. 65 min Still no substitutions, which is slightly surprising. Union Berlin are holding on grimly to their one-goal deficit. 63 min At the other end, Gnabry\u2019s shot is blocked by Hubner. 62 min Bulter runs Kimmich and floats a good cross that is flapped away from trouble by the stretching Neuer. 61 min Nothing has happened in the last few minutes. Bayern are in control, as much as you can be at 1-0. 56 min At the other end a clearance comes to Trippel, 20 yards from goal, and he drags a snap volley a few yards wide of the far post. 56 min Goretzka\u2019s fast, inswinging corner hits Pavard in the face and bounces just wide of the near post. Pavard was wrestling with Hubner, which is why he was unable to meet the cross with an orthodox header. 55 min Lovely play from Muller. He scarpers down the right, chops back on his left foot and flights a cross to Lewandowski beyond the far post. He heads it back across goal and Andrich (I think) heads it behind for a corner. 53 min Boateng, trying to intercept Trimmel\u2019s cross, unwittingly slides it towards his own goal. Happily for him it\u2019s straight at Neuer, who has plenty of time to pick the ball up. 52 min \u201cRob,\u201d says Kevin Porter. \u201cAny chance that coronavirus could be used as an excuse to ban the needless, disgusting and insanitary act of spitting from the game?\u201d I can see both sides! 51 min Schlotterbeck is booked for a foul on Goretzka. 49 min I\u2019m not sure this will stay at 1-0 for long. Goretzka plays a slick one-two with Pavard and rifles a low shot that deflects just wide of the far post. 48 min Union left their top scorer Sebastian Andersson on the bench, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be on if this stays at 1-0. I wonder if we\u2019ll see more imaginative use of substitutes in the next few months, with the lesser teams in particular trying to stay in games and then win them in the last 20 minutes. 47 min Gnabry dances across the line of the penalty area, eventually hitting a shot that is excellently blocked by the stretching Subotic. I think it was him, anyway. 46 min Union begin the second half. Half-time listening That was a pretty comfortable 45 minutes for Bayern, who lead through Robert Lewandowski\u2019s penalty. See you soon for more Bundesliga action! 45+4 min Pavard, teed up by Lewandowski, hits a fine shot with the outside of the boot that swerves into the side netting at the near post. I think Gikiewicz had it covered but it was a lovely strike. 45+2 min Trimmel crosses from the right towards Ujah, who grapples for the ball with Pavard and wins a corner. Trimmel\u2019s outswingers is half cleared to the edge of the area, where Promel shoots over the bar. 45 min Four minutes of added time. In the first of those, Muller pulls Davies\u2019s deep cross down on his chest and hits a shot that is well blocked by Lenz. 43 min Goretzka wins a corner for Bayern. Union look in urgent need of a few Gatorade chasers. 42 min Lewandowski has now scored 40 goals in all competitions for the fifth consecutive season. Lewandowski dances round the ball, stops... and then slides a low shot to Gikiewicz\u2019s left. That\u2019s his 479th goal of the season. 39 min: Penalty to Bayern! Subotic tries to belt the ball clear, Goretzka comes on his blind side and Subotic boots him straight up in the air. A clear penalty. 36 min Davies is booked for a foul on Promel. 33 min Union Berlin will be happy with how the game has gone so far. They are being outplayed, there\u2019s no escaping that, but they\u2019ve kept Bayern at arms length for the most part. The worry for Union is that they are already starting to look like they have shot their bolt. It could be a long second half, even with unlimited subs or however many you\u2019re allowed these days. 31 min \u201cHope you\u2019re doing well,\u201d says Eason. \u201cI\u2019m holding out for a Union Berlin win! Thank God for VAR, huh?\u201d If this pandemic has taught us one thing, it\u2019s surely that life is too short for moaning about silly stuff like VAR. I\u2019m absolutely certain that I\u2019ll maintain this attitude until the exact moment my team are first stitched up by VAR, at which point all bets are off and to hell with the epiphany. 30 min Ah, we\u2019ve now seen a replay - with added squiggles - that confirms Bayern\u2019s goal was correctly disallowed. Muller was slightly offside in the second phase of play, when Gnabry headed the ball across goal. The boy VAR done good. 27 min \u201cHappy Sunday,\u201d says James Jensen. \u201cSharing the surreal experience of FC Union at home v Bayern \u2014 via Radio Belo Horizonte (translated by you, the Rt Hon Rob Smyth).\u201d Postmodernism really has changed in the last few months. 26 min Free-kick to Union on the left wing, 25 yards from goal. It\u2019s swung in by a man with a beard and deflects behind for a corner. That comes to nothing. 23 min Here\u2019s Jonathan Seyghal. \u201cYAY! FOOTBALL\u2019S BACK! Oh yeah... VAR. Pfff. Like missing your family, then.. spending time with your family.\u201d 22 min A Bayern goal is coming. Alaba plays a fine pass down the inside-left channel to Davies, whose dangerous low cross is pushed away desperately by the diving Gikiewicz. Lewandowski was waiting behind him to score. 20 min Muller was definitely offside during the first phase, when Goretzka headed the ball down. But I thought he was behind Gnabry, and therefore onside, when Gnabry headed the ball past Gikiewicz. No matter: it was disallowed for one reason or another. Kimmich\u2019s outswinging corner was headed down by Goretzka near the penalty spot. Gnabry, who was onside, headed it past the keeper Gikiewicz from close range - but Muller couldn\u2019t help himself from putting it over the line. He was deemed offside by VAR and so the goal is disallowed. Had Gnabry\u2019s header gone in without a touch from Muller, it would have counted. This may be disallowed for offside. 16 min \u201cGreetings from rainy Northern California,\u201d says Peter Oh. \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019m a huge fan of Union Berlin or the Ramones, but the song \u2018I Just Want to Have Something to Do\u2019 seems pretty apt for football fans these days. I\u2019d even have chicken vindaloo for breakfast.\u201d 15 min Thiago has been the brightest Bayern player so far, with a few nice passes. He plays another down the left to find Davies, who cuts the ball back to Gnabry just outside the area. His shot is blocked. 12 min Lenz is booked for a late tackle on Pavard. 11 min Bayern look rusty, which is fair enough in the circumstances. Union have made a fast, aggressive start. Alas, Opta stats can\u2019t tell us how much of their bolt they have already shot. 7 min: Chance for Ujah! Union have made a vibrant start and could be ahead. Hubner clips a fine pass over a sleeping Bayern defence to put Ujah through on goal. But his first touch isn\u2019t great and his second - a hearty spank over the bar - isn\u2019t exactly one for the books either. 5 min A half chance for Union. Promel does very well on the byline, wriggling past two players before pulling the ball back to Bulter. His first-time shot is straight at Neuer, who pats it down and grabs it at the second attempt. 4 min \u201cHi Rob,\u201d says Jonathan Seyghal. \u201cFingers crossed for the underdogs today (if only for the league) but with no raucous radical leftwing radical support and now no manager, I fear the worst.\u201d Ah yes, I forgot to say that Union\u2019s manager Urs Fischer is not at the game today. He left quarantine to be with his family after the death of his father-in-law. 3 min Lewandowski\u2019s long-range shot takes a deflection and loops onto the roof of the net. Gikiewicz had it covered. 1 min Peep peep! You heard: peeeeeeeeeeeeeeep peeeeeeeeeeeeeeep! Bayern, in their white away strip, kick off from right to left. Union are in red. \u201cGuten Nachmittag Rob,\u201d says Justin Kavanagh. \u201cIs it fair to say that we\u2019ve officially entered football\u2019s Lunar Age? The pluses apparently involve considerably less going to ground; the negatives include that old canard about the Irish pub that opened on the moon and closed due to lack of atmosphere.\u201d I\u2019m loath to pass judgement until we see the return of the Premier League. International comparisons are difficult. Anyone out there? It\u2019s safe to email, you know, as long as you sing three happy birthdays immediately afterwards. The early game has finished Cologne 2-2 Mainz. Cologne seemed to be cruising to victory when they led 2-0 after an hour, but relegation-threatened Mainz fought back really impressively and could have won the match. Pierre Kunde Malong scored their equaliser with a storming solo goal. Pre-match reading Pleasantly there are fewer theatrics and arguments: on the pitch \u2013 a purer football than before. The atmosphere, on the other hand, is very, very strange. You\u2019ll have noticed the surprising team news, with Union preferring Grischa Promel to Christian Gentner in the centre of midfield. We\u2019re all Bundesliga experts now. (NB: Clip contains adult language) Union Berlin (3-4-2-1) Gikiewicz; Hubner, Schlotterbeck, Subotic; Trimmel, Andrich, Promel, Lenz; Ingvartsen, Bulter; Ujah. Substitutes: Polter, Parensen, Mees, Gentner, Reichel, Kroos, Nicolas, Ryerson, Andersson. Bayern Munich (4-2-3-1) Neuer; Pavard, Boateng, Alaba, Davies; Kimmich, Thiago; Goretzka, Muller, Gnabry; Lewandowski. Substitutes: Perisic, Cuisance, Coman, Hernandez, Mai, Ulreich, Zirkzee, Odriozola. Referee Bastian Dankert. Hello and welcome to day two of Football Unplugged, as my colleague Paul Doyle describes this new Bundesliga experience. It\u2019s all a bit strange, but in the next few weeks Bayern Munich hope to give the football world a glimpse of the old normal: Manuel Neuer lifting the Meisterschale. Bayern are aiming to win their eighth consecutive championship, an endeavour that resumes with today\u2019s trip to mid-table Union Berlin. Bayern were in storming form before spring break. They won 14 and drew one of the last 15 games in all competitions, scoring 49 goals in that time. That burst of form lifted them from seventh place \u2013 oh, the humanity \u2013 to their familiar position at the top of the table. They\u2019re currently a point ahead of Dortmund with today\u2019s game in hand. The two sides will meet a week on Tuesday, all being well, in a humdinger at the Westfalenstadion. There\u2019ll be some atmosphere for that g- oh I can\u2019t be bothered. Yellow Wall or no, Bayern will want to go to Dortmund with at least a four-point lead. Better win today then, hadn\u2019t they? Kick off 5pm BST, 6pm in Berlin.",

Health and safety organisations including the British Standards Institute (BSI) have seen an increase in PPE being sold with documentation that is either inaccurate or has been falsified. Items such as face masks and goggles require a CE mark, which verifies they have been tested by a standards body and meet the correct requirements.

Pink called for the establishment of an early warning system to flag up potentially inappropriate PPE to employers. The BSI said employers should check PPE certificates through its VerifEye directory. Concern that employers have been duped into buying substandard face masks and other protective equipment comes as broader fears increase about a lack of recourse for staff who are concerned that their workplace is unsafe. The business minister, Alok Sharma, last week announced sector-specific guidelines for employers, as well as \u00a314m in extra funding for the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). But MPs said the sum was not nearly enough to make up for a decade-long slide in HSE\u2019s government funding, from \u00a3239m in 2009 to \u00a3129m for 2019-20.

The Guardian understands the HSE only found out about the new funding when Sharma announced it, meaning it had not started planning for how to use the money. An HSE spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019ve just been given the encouraging news of access to additional funding to support our advice and regulatory activity as businesses implement the new guidance on working safely during coronavirus. \u201cAs businesses start getting back to work, we can see scope for making proactive enquiries of employers. \u201cWe\u2019ll need our approach to be adaptable and regularly reviewed as workplaces get to grips with managing this unprecedented health risk.

      "bodyText": "House speaker Nancy Pelosi warned on Sunday that Donald Trump might have broken the law by firing the inspector general of the state department. Trump said in a letter to Pelosi on Friday night that he had lost confidence in Steve Linick, a seasoned government lawyer who had held the state department role since his appointment by Barack Obama in 2013. Pelosi was asked on CBS\u2019 Face the Nation to comment on reports that Linick was dismissed after he opened an investigation into accusations that secretary of state Mike Pompeo and his wife had used government staff for private errands. Pompeo has denied wrongdoing. \u201cThe president has the right to fire any federal employee, but the fact is if it looks like it\u2019s in retaliation for something that the IG, the inspector general, is doing, that could be unlawful,\u201d said Pelosi. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to show cause,\u201d she said. Democrats in Congress have opened an investigation of the dismissal, with the ostensible power to subpoena documents and call witnesses to testify. The inquiry could be frustrated, however, by stonewalling by Pompeo, who blocked the testimony of state department officials during the impeachment inquiry last year. Linick became the fourth inspector general to be ousted by Trump. Each major government agency has an inspector general, whom watchdogs regard as playing an essential role in combatting corruption.

White House economic adviser Peter Navarro defended Linick\u2019s ouster along those lines on television on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019ve had tremendous problems with, some people call it the \u2018Deep State\u2019,\u201d Navarro said on ABC News\u2019 This Week program, without offering any evidence to back the claim. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s apt.

He also notified Congress that he was firing the inspector general of the US intelligence community, Michael Atkinson, who was involved in triggering the impeachment investigation. After Atkinson\u2019s firing, a bipartisan group of senators, including Republicans Charles Grassley, Susan Collins and Romney, called on Trump to provide a detailed written explanation for his decision. Then earlier this month, Trump ousted Christi Grimm, who led the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General, after accusing her of having produced a \u201cfake dossier\u201d on American hospitals suffering shortages on the frontlines of the coronavirus outbreak. Experts say the pattern threatens the independent oversight function that inspectors general provide, particularly if watchdogs feel pressure to do the president\u2019s political bidding or risk being fired.

      "bodyText": "British negotiators fear Michel Barnier has been unable to get EU leaders to focus on Brexit trade and security talks as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, as Downing Street prepares to publish a draft treaty this week in an effort to reboot the process. David Frost, the UK\u2019s chief negotiator, believes his EU counterpart recognises the need to budge on key issues, including fisheries, over which France, the Netherlands and Spain have imposed a tough line. Barnier said on Friday that he expected both sides to shift from their \u201cmaximalist\u201d stance on access to British waters by June. It is hoped in Whitehall that laying out legal text will prompt EU states to become more engaged with discussions over all aspects of the future relationship. The UK document in treaty form will lay bare the stark differences between the two sides on key areas after what both agreed had been another disappointing round of talks last week. Downing Street believes the British position has so far been mischaracterised, and a UK source close to the negotiations described the EU\u2019s attitude to date as bewildering. Senior government figures are convinced that part of the problem lies in European governments being distracted by the pandemic. On Friday, Barnier accused the British negotiators of again seeking to cherrypick membership of the bloc by seeking minimal obligations on standards in the trade in goods and maximum rights. \u201cWe have been clear that we are not looking for that,\u201d said one UK source close to the negotiation. \u201cAnyone who thinks this government has got nostalgia for 2018 or Chequers has an imperfect understanding of UK political developments in the last couple of years. \u201cThe only explanation I can find is that their arguments on the merits are not working and they are reaching for some of the old script. But it doesn\u2019t fit the actual situation we are now trying to negotiate.\u201d Boris Johnson resigned from his post as foreign secretary in Theresa May\u2019s government in July 2018 following publication of a vision of a trade deal agreed by the cabinet at the prime minister\u2019s Chequers retreat. It outlined a close trading relationship based on alignment between EU and UK laws. UK sources said the requests Barnier cited as evidence for his claims, including freedom of movement for short visits and recognition of professional qualifications to enable British lawyers, accountants and auditors to work in the EU, were all included in previous free trade deals. With British negotiators determined to energise the talks, the forthcoming legal text will highlight a series of areas where there are mutual interests, including the maintenance of the British car industry and its supply chains. For vehicles exported to the EU from the UK to receive preferential tariff rates it would have to be shown that at least 50% of their components were British-manufactured. The UK government wants to include EU-derived components in that 50% through so called \u201cthird-country cumulation\u201d, a proposal that Barnier had not embraced in full, Whitehall sources said. Barnier\u2019s team has also rejected the UK\u2019s proposals to reduce the administrative burden of sanitary and phytosanitary checks at borders to protect human, animal and plant life, it is claimed. The UK is seeking equivalence between EU and British rules and the legal text is expected to detail how that might work.

The pressure is on both sides to find common ground as the point by which any extension to the transition period would have to be agreed looms. Under the withdrawal agreement, an extension of \u201cup to one or two years\u201d must be agreed by 1 July. The two teams will restart talks in the first week of June. EU officials said there was no other legal avenue to an extension. \u201cWe have seen in the last days several articles and reflections [asking] is this the only way,\u201d the official said. \u201cThis is the last moment to ask this question of the transition period.\u201d A UK spokesman said: \u201cWe intend to make public all the UK draft legal texts during next week so that the EU\u2019s member states and interested observers can see our approach in detail.\u201d One UK source close to the negotiation said Barnier was \u201cdoing a good job with the hand he has been given\u201d but added that the mandate handed to him by the EU capitals was \u201cunnegotiable\u201d in key areas.",

      "body": "<p>\u201cLook at this, Lee,\u201d I say as I lower my head towards the screen. Lee Hendrie peers back at me. We have been talking for an hour during a gripping and sometimes distressing interview on Zoom. We have reached a painful segment as Hendrie, the former Premier League footballer who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/nov/10/sport.comment1\" title=\"\">played once for England</a>, has opened up like never before. After detailing the \u201cfive or six times\u201d he has tried to kill himself, Hendrie has spoken about his feelings of shame.</p> <p>\u201cYou see how white my hair is?\u201d I ask Hendrie.</p> <p>\u201cYeah,\u201d he replies, wondering if I\u2019ve lost my mind.</p> <p>\u201cWell, Lee, it doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m wise. It\u2019s just tells you that I\u2019m a very old fucker.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43b49f7aab555a72bc428c2851427deec1ecec22\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43b49f7aab555a72bc428c2851427deec1ecec22/0_14_1878_1128/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Hendrie celebrates after scoring for Aston Villa against West Ham United in November 2002.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Hendrie celebrates after scoring for Aston Villa against West Ham United in November 2002.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ross Kinnaird/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The industrial language is meant to make Hendrie laugh and it does. His laughter makes a lovely and uproarious sound. I lift my head and look straight at him. The real point, I say, is that I\u2019ve done hundreds of interviews over the years and this one has touched me more than most. He should not feel ashamed. I feel certain that people are not going to see him as the \u201closer\u201d he sometimes fears he has become. I am hopeful they will respect his courage and honesty. They will understand that, despite his vulnerability, he is trying hard to step out of the darkness that has trailed him for so long.</p> <p>Hendrie is anxious as he awaits publication of this interview and his appearance on ITV\u2019s three-part series <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/presscentre/ep1week21/harrys-heroes-euro-having-laugh\" title=\"\">Harry\u2019s Heroes</a>, which is being screened from Monday to Wednesday. He turns 43 on Monday, on the same day his wife, Emma, turns 36, but he has not been thinking much about joint birthdays. He has been consumed, instead, by worry and shame.</p> <p>The usual knockabout stuff of Harry Redknapp managing a group of middle-aged former footballers, as they prepare to play Germany in a search for \u201credemption\u201d, has a moving segment in the second episode. Hendrie sits down with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/05/vinnie-jones-footballer-this-much-i-know\" title=\"\">Vinnie Jones</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/04/paul-merson-opens-up-mental-health-depression-gambling-addiction\" title=\"\">Paul Merson</a>. He finds it hard but, slowly, he talks to them about two occasions when he tried to kill himself. It is a big step.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6deb48a5b0695a97ea17ef1a4f3e9c9574a75efa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6deb48a5b0695a97ea17ef1a4f3e9c9574a75efa/0_0_2367_1420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Hendrie talking to Vinnie Jones during the filming of Harry\u2019s Heroes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Hendrie talking to Vinnie Jones during the filming of Harry\u2019s Heroes, which is on ITV this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Ward/Talback Thames/ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had sleepless nights,\u201d Hendrie says now, \u201cthinking how it\u2019s going to come across, how are people going to discern me, how are they going to judge me. Lots of memories will wash over me and it\u2019s going to be difficult to watch.\u201d</p> <p>Those memories remain raw and searing. His most recent attempt was only 18 months ago and there are days when it\u2019s hard for Hendrie to get out of bed. \u201cI end up drinking,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing worse than taking alcohol and getting to the extreme levels where you don\u2019t care at all. When that happens I\u2019m at my most vulnerable and think it may be time to do something. The last time was a year and a half ago. The good thing is that now, when I\u2019m low, it\u2019s nowhere near the extremes of what I did when times were very, very dark.\u201d</p> <p>Hendrie has made considerable progress since then. Can he admit this to himself? \u201cI can. But I don\u2019t like to praise myself too much and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s around the corner. That\u2019s my fear. Things can be fantastic one day or one week and then it can turn. I can sit in bed for three days and not want to get up.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m my own worst enemy. I don\u2019t feel I deserve any plaudits. But I\u2019m proud I\u2019ve become someone different. I\u2019ve ended up getting myself into a great job working for Sky Sports. I\u2019ve got to thank lots of people that have taken a punt on me and realised I\u2019m not that person I\u2019m painted out to be. For all the bad press, I\u2019m still a human being. I\u2019m striving to do this new job well but I always have that fear things could go wrong again.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>To see my family absolutely distraught was a picture I can\u2019t ever get out of my head</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Before Hendrie explains his concerns as a freelance pundit in the depths of a global pandemic, he takes me back to the blackest days. In August 2010 his property portfolio, once worth \u00a310m, had been swamped by huge debt. Hendrie knew his home and the house he had bought for his mum would both be repossessed. \u201cThe football was almost over and my head was gone. I\u2019d been trying to sell property but the housing market crashed. I got to the stage where I just wanted to end it all. I\u2019d hit rock bottom.\u201d</p> <p>After he tried to kill himself the first time, Hendrie says: \u201cI vaguely remember bits of the ambulance ride. It was very blurred. But one thing that really stood out was waking up. It was horrible. I didn\u2019t like the fact I was still alive. There were lots of worries. \u2018Am I going to a psychiatric ward because I\u2019ve done this?\u2019 But, most of all, I was thinking: \u2018I\u2019m going to do this again. I want to be free of everything.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cMy wife went through an awful lot. She\u2019s seen me on life-support machines. She\u2019s seen me in distress and pain. But it\u2019s hard to explain when you can\u2019t reach out to someone. I was a closed book. I still am to a certain extent. But if I\u2019d had that confidence to reach out to someone, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d be telling you a different story.\u201d</p> <p>Nine months later, in July 2011, Hendrie tried to end his life again. \u201cI was adamant I was going to do it. It felt like everything had been taken away. My divorce [to his first wife] was prolonged. Bankruptcy was in the wings. So this time I was going to finish it off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"730825b438db16833bf57df9b663d355ab06b667\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/730825b438db16833bf57df9b663d355ab06b667/0_280_8036_4821/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Hendrie in May 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Monday is a treble bash because my wife\u2019s got the same birthday as me and we\u2019ve got Harry\u2019s Heroes in the evening.

I didn\u2019t realise I\u2019d been on a life-support machine. To see my family absolutely distraught was a picture I can\u2019t ever get out of my head. I still use that to this day when I feel very low. I can\u2019t do that to them again. My mum says: \u2018You\u2019ve got to stop all this. You\u2019re hurting everyone.\u2019 I didn\u2019t think of it like that. I just thought of it selfishly as you do when you\u2019re in them dire straits.</p> <p>\u201cMy wife took a photo of me not long after that second time. But she deleted it because she didn\u2019t want to be reminded of how close it was to me not being around, and not bringing up my children. I\u2019ve always been brought up as a provider. And when you\u2019re a proud man and you can\u2019t provide? That\u2019s when I thought it was the end.\u201d</p> <p>Hendrie mentions only two attempts to kill himself in the ITV documentary. But were there others? He nods. \u201cI could easily name five, six times where I tried to do that in the bad period.\u201d</p> <p>This upsetting news is deepened by the uncertainty of the coronavirus. Hendrie is still on antidepressants and his mental health is being tested again in a precarious working environment. \u201cOne thing that kept me quite close to Sky has been doing some Zoom calls with managers and players,\u201d Hendrie says brightly. \u201cIt\u2019s been really good and really interesting. But the situation\u2019s very difficult. Not getting paid\u2019s one of the big issues a lot of people are going through. I\u2019m self-employed and not contracted so I don\u2019t get furloughed. I\u2019ve had a kind gesture off Sky that\u2019s been magnificent. The last few months have been super as I\u2019ve felt part of a team.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a17db6346d83d7a402ef2548986a750e287acef7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a17db6346d83d7a402ef2548986a750e287acef7/484_420_1517_1667/910.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Hendrie working as a pundit at MK Dons v AFC Wimbledon in September 2019\" width=\"910\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Hendrie working as a pundit at MK Dons v AFC Wimbledon in September 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Brown/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hendrie pauses. He rubs a hand across his face. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019ve had a few days where I haven\u2019t really got up. But the kids have kept me going and kept me sane.\u201d</p> <p>Is he optimistic about getting more work as a pundit? \u201cI am. But it\u2019s hard to escape the lockdown. My job relies on the football industry, and it\u2019s hanging in the balance. I\u2019ve had a lot of sleepless nights because it could be months before I\u2019m getting back into work. You\u2019ve always got that doubt of people coming in and taking your job. The sport industry\u2019s ruthless at times. But hopefully football can resume and I get back into it.\u201d</p> <p>In episode two of the ITV series, which captures Hendrie talking to Jones and Merson, we see him score a hat-trick against San Marino. He and Merson are the best players on the pitch and Hendrie tells me that, in the final game against Germany, he plays a key role. \u201cThat bit appealed to me.

      "bodyText": "\u201cLook at this, Lee,\u201d I say as I lower my head towards the screen. Lee Hendrie peers back at me. We have been talking for an hour during a gripping and sometimes distressing interview on Zoom. We have reached a painful segment as Hendrie, the former Premier League footballer who played once for England, has opened up like never before. After detailing the \u201cfive or six times\u201d he has tried to kill himself, Hendrie has spoken about his feelings of shame. \u201cYou see how white my hair is?\u201d I ask Hendrie. \u201cYeah,\u201d he replies, wondering if I\u2019ve lost my mind. \u201cWell, Lee, it doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m wise. It\u2019s just tells you that I\u2019m a very old fucker.\u201d The industrial language is meant to make Hendrie laugh and it does. His laughter makes a lovely and uproarious sound. I lift my head and look straight at him. The real point, I say, is that I\u2019ve done hundreds of interviews over the years and this one has touched me more than most. He should not feel ashamed. I feel certain that people are not going to see him as the \u201closer\u201d he sometimes fears he has become. I am hopeful they will respect his courage and honesty. They will understand that, despite his vulnerability, he is trying hard to step out of the darkness that has trailed him for so long. Hendrie is anxious as he awaits publication of this interview and his appearance on ITV\u2019s three-part series Harry\u2019s Heroes, which is being screened from Monday to Wednesday. He turns 43 on Monday, on the same day his wife, Emma, turns 36, but he has not been thinking much about joint birthdays. He has been consumed, instead, by worry and shame. The usual knockabout stuff of Harry Redknapp managing a group of middle-aged former footballers, as they prepare to play Germany in a search for \u201credemption\u201d, has a moving segment in the second episode. Hendrie sits down with Vinnie Jones and Paul Merson. He finds it hard but, slowly, he talks to them about two occasions when he tried to kill himself. It is a big step. \u201cI\u2019ve had sleepless nights,\u201d Hendrie says now, \u201cthinking how it\u2019s going to come across, how are people going to discern me, how are they going to judge me. Lots of memories will wash over me and it\u2019s going to be difficult to watch.\u201d Those memories remain raw and searing. His most recent attempt was only 18 months ago and there are days when it\u2019s hard for Hendrie to get out of bed. \u201cI end up drinking,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there\u2019s nothing worse than taking alcohol and getting to the extreme levels where you don\u2019t care at all. When that happens I\u2019m at my most vulnerable and think it may be time to do something. The last time was a year and a half ago. The good thing is that now, when I\u2019m low, it\u2019s nowhere near the extremes of what I did when times were very, very dark.\u201d Hendrie has made considerable progress since then. Can he admit this to himself? \u201cI can. But I don\u2019t like to praise myself too much and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s around the corner. That\u2019s my fear. Things can be fantastic one day or one week and then it can turn. I can sit in bed for three days and not want to get up. \u201cI\u2019m my own worst enemy. I don\u2019t feel I deserve any plaudits. But I\u2019m proud I\u2019ve become someone different. I\u2019ve ended up getting myself into a great job working for Sky Sports. I\u2019ve got to thank lots of people that have taken a punt on me and realised I\u2019m not that person I\u2019m painted out to be. For all the bad press, I\u2019m still a human being. I\u2019m striving to do this new job well but I always have that fear things could go wrong again.\u201d Before Hendrie explains his concerns as a freelance pundit in the depths of a global pandemic, he takes me back to the blackest days. In August 2010 his property portfolio, once worth \u00a310m, had been swamped by huge debt. Hendrie knew his home and the house he had bought for his mum would both be repossessed. \u201cThe football was almost over and my head was gone. I\u2019d been trying to sell property but the housing market crashed. I got to the stage where I just wanted to end it all. I\u2019d hit rock bottom.\u201d After he tried to kill himself the first time, Hendrie says: \u201cI vaguely remember bits of the ambulance ride. It was very blurred. But one thing that really stood out was waking up. It was horrible. I didn\u2019t like the fact I was still alive. There were lots of worries. \u2018Am I going to a psychiatric ward because I\u2019ve done this?\u2019 But, most of all, I was thinking: \u2018I\u2019m going to do this again. I want to be free of everything.\u2019 \u201cMy wife went through an awful lot. She\u2019s seen me on life-support machines. She\u2019s seen me in distress and pain. But it\u2019s hard to explain when you can\u2019t reach out to someone. I was a closed book. I still am to a certain extent. But if I\u2019d had that confidence to reach out to someone, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d be telling you a different story.\u201d Nine months later, in July 2011, Hendrie tried to end his life again. \u201cI was adamant I was going to do it. It felt like everything had been taken away. My divorce [to his first wife] was prolonged. Bankruptcy was in the wings. So this time I was going to finish it off. \u201cI woke up in completely different circumstances. I didn\u2019t realise I\u2019d been on a life-support machine. To see my family absolutely distraught was a picture I can\u2019t ever get out of my head. I still use that to this day when I feel very low. I can\u2019t do that to them again. My mum says: \u2018You\u2019ve got to stop all this. You\u2019re hurting everyone.\u2019 I didn\u2019t think of it like that. I just thought of it selfishly as you do when you\u2019re in them dire straits. \u201cMy wife took a photo of me not long after that second time. But she deleted it because she didn\u2019t want to be reminded of how close it was to me not being around, and not bringing up my children. I\u2019ve always been brought up as a provider. And when you\u2019re a proud man and you can\u2019t provide? That\u2019s when I thought it was the end.\u201d Hendrie mentions only two attempts to kill himself in the ITV documentary. But were there others? He nods. \u201cI could easily name five, six times where I tried to do that in the bad period.\u201d This upsetting news is deepened by the uncertainty of the coronavirus. Hendrie is still on antidepressants and his mental health is being tested again in a precarious working environment. \u201cOne thing that kept me quite close to Sky has been doing some Zoom calls with managers and players,\u201d Hendrie says brightly. \u201cIt\u2019s been really good and really interesting. But the situation\u2019s very difficult. Not getting paid\u2019s one of the big issues a lot of people are going through. I\u2019m self-employed and not contracted so I don\u2019t get furloughed. I\u2019ve had a kind gesture off Sky that\u2019s been magnificent. The last few months have been super as I\u2019ve felt part of a team.\u201d Hendrie pauses. He rubs a hand across his face. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019ve had a few days where I haven\u2019t really got up. But the kids have kept me going and kept me sane.\u201d Is he optimistic about getting more work as a pundit? \u201cI am. But it\u2019s hard to escape the lockdown. My job relies on the football industry, and it\u2019s hanging in the balance. I\u2019ve had a lot of sleepless nights because it could be months before I\u2019m getting back into work. You\u2019ve always got that doubt of people coming in and taking your job. The sport industry\u2019s ruthless at times. But hopefully football can resume and I get back into it.\u201d In episode two of the ITV series, which captures Hendrie talking to Jones and Merson, we see him score a hat-trick against San Marino. He and Merson are the best players on the pitch and Hendrie tells me that, in the final game against Germany, he plays a key role. \u201cThat bit appealed to me. I got my football boots on again and it was brilliant to be amongst the lads. It\u2019s obviously light-hearted but the competitive side comes out in the games. You\u2019re on a high again and then, aaargh, you realise how much you miss football.\u201d Hendrie has only seen a few clips of the show and I reassure him that he does well off the field too. \u201cIt was very heartfelt and emotional,\u201d he says of his conversation with Jones and Merson \u2013 a former Aston Villa team-mate. He replaced Merson when he made his only international appearance for England, against the Czech Republic in November 1998. Glenn Hoddle, England\u2019s manager then, said the 21-year-old had been \u201cmagnificent\u201d on his debut. \u201cGlenn gave me lots of praise,\u201d Hendrie recalls. \u201cI should have actually scored and John Gorman [Hoddle\u2019s assistant] said: \u2018We want to bring in you, Frank Lampard, Rio Ferdinand.\u2019 We had a fantastic under-21 side and Glenn was pushing us.\u201d Soon after that game Hoddle lost his job following inappropriate comments about disabled people. Hendrie never got another chance with England during his long career \u2013 the highlights of which came during his 13 years at Villa Park from 1994 to 2007. \u201cI offered lots to Villa,\u201d he says of a club for whom he played 252 league games. \u201cIn football now they talk a lot about assists and I\u2019d have been in the top five [in the Premier League] then.

We\u2019ll make it a lovely day.\u201d His five children range in age from four to 20. Will he watch the programme with them? \u201cYeah. If it wasn\u2019t for the lockdown the whole family was planning to watch it together. I would have found that a little difficult because it\u2019s an emotional rollercoaster and I\u2019m bringing up lots of past things. So it\u2019ll just be me and the missus and the kids that\u2019ll watch it here. No doubt I\u2019ll have lots of family ringing after, and hopefully saying good things.\u201d Hendrie returns to his bleakest days. \u201cIt\u2019s a sore subject and I\u2019m not proud of the times I tried to take my life. But I want to give something back to people who are also struggling. I can still have bad weeks where I do think about doing the same.

Top stories The family of detained Australian academic Kylie Moore-Gilbert have denied reports she has attempted suicide in an Iranian prison or that she has been tortured by the country\u2019s Revolutionary Guards. The Melbourne University lecturer was arrested at Tehran airport in September 2018 and sentenced to 10 years prison on charges of espionage. Moore-Gilbert\u2019s family have not spoken publicly since her arrest, but in a statement on Sunday they rejected recent reports that she was being isolated from other prisoners and cut off from contact with family and consular officials. \u201cWe have had a number of conversations with Kylie in recent weeks. She has strongly denied reports that she has attempted suicide or that she is being tortured,\u201d they said. \u201cShe seems to be in good health considering her situation. We love her and miss her.\u201d Self-employed Australians have suffered a higher loss of income during the coronavirus crisis than employees and some fear their businesses will collapse, an ANU study reveals. Four-in-five reported a hit to profits and almost one third worried their businesses will not be viable in two months without improved conditions. The study, by the ANU Centre for Social Research and Methods, is based on a survey of a representative sample of 3,155 Australians in mid-April. Confirmed Covid-19 cases in Brazil have surpassed the total in Italy and are surging in Mexico and Peru, as Latin America struggles to contain its fast-growing coronavirus outbreak. Spain announced its lowest 24-hour death toll in more than two months \u2013 a sign the virus is being contained in western Europe. Brazil announced nearly 15,000 new infections on Saturday, taking its total to more than 230,000 \u2013 the fourth largest confirmed caseload after the US, Russia and the UK. Ministers and officials from every nation will meet via video link for the annual world health assembly, which is expected to be dominated by efforts to stop rich countries monopolising drugs and future vaccines against Covid-19. Australia Hundreds of thousands of Australians affected by the federal government\u2019s robodebt scheme will receive notices from Centrelink about an upcoming class action under orders from the federal court. Last month Guardian Australia revealed secret government advice showing the government hopes to settle the case. The carer of an Adelaide woman who had cerebral palsy and died in \u201cdisgusting and degrading\u201d conditions has been sacked. Disability care provider Integrity Care SA said it was shocked and appalled by the death of Ann-Marie Smith. The Greens have proposed increasing government debt by $300bn in a bid to kickstart the economy. The Invest to Recover plan, released today, sets up the Greens\u2019 economic argument leading into the next election and sees the minor party trying to outflank Labor on recovery spending.

Donald Trump has hit back at Barack Obama\u2019s criticism of his administration\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis, accusing the former US president of being \u201cgrossly incompetent\u201d during his time in office. Bill de Blasio says residents gathering without masks puts \u2018lives in danger\u2019. New York City\u2019s mayor has criticized residents who were seen gathering without masks outside bars at the weekend despite the city\u2019s ongoing stay at home guidelines, saying they were putting \u201clives in danger\u201d. Pelosi: Trump firing of Steve Linick could be \u2018unlawful if it\u2019s retaliation\u2019. House speaker Nancy Pelosi warned on Sunday that Trump might have broken the law by firing the inspector general of the state department on Friday night. Sanders says his supporters will vote for Biden but he needs to court them. Former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has said he thinks his supporters will vote for Joe Biden in November\u2019s US election, despite a former aide\u2019s warning that Biden was not consolidating Sanders supporters. US senator Ben Sasse\u2019s attempts at humor during a speech for a Nebraska high school\u2019s online graduation ceremony have drawn criticism from one of the school\u2019s board members and his Democratic opponent in the November election. The AP reports: Sasse said during the speech \u201c95% of all gainfully employed psychologists and I\u2019m serious there are dozens of them that are gainfully employed - their job is really just to help people forget high school ... If you\u2019re headed to college, do not do not major in psychology. That part\u2019s not a joke.\u201d Sasse, who was unshaven and wore a loosened red tie and white dress shirt, also said that in life, the graduates would at times be asked to climb giant ropes. \u201cIf you don\u2019t get that joke, talk to your mom and dad. Back in the day when we were a lot fitter than you people are, we used to have to climb ropes all the way up to the ceiling of the gym all the time.\u201d Sasse suggested that the graduates would remember their senior years at their future reunions as \u201cthat time when China started a big global pandemic that created the worst public health crisis in over a century and brought the economy to its knees and we had to stay home and everybody was hoarding toilet paper.\u201d Near the end of the speech, Sasse mixed in some serious encouragement for students with another shot at China. \u201cNobody knows exactly how we\u2019re going to beat this thing, but you know what, we\u2019re Americans, we\u2019re Nebraskans, we\u2019ve got grit and we\u2019re going to beat this thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will bring the economy back. We are going to beat the virus ... We\u2019re going to have to have a serious reckoning with the thugs in China who let this mess spiral out of control by lying about it.\u201d he said. Donald Trump joined NBC\u2019s broadcast of the made-for-TV skins game involving Rory McIlroy and Dustin Johnson against Rickie Fowler and Matthew Wolff, saying he hopes golf can get \u201cback to normal\u201d as soon as next month. \u201cWe really want to see it back to normal so when we have all these thousands, tens of thousands of people going to your majors and going to golf tournaments, we want them to be having that same experience,\u201d Trump said in an interview with NBC\u2019s Mike Tirico. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them having to wear masks and be doing what we\u2019ve been doing for the last number of months. Because that\u2019s not getting back to normal.\u201d He added: \u201cWe want to be back to normal where you have the big crowds, and they\u2019re practically standing on top of each other and they\u2019re enjoying themselves, not where they\u2019re worried. ... But in the meantime, they do the social distancing, and they practice that. And they\u2019ve been doing really well. The country is ready to start moving forward.\u201d McIlroy, the world No 1, made headlines earlier this week when he criticized Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis, saying: \u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of something that\u2019s pretty serious right now and the fact that he\u2019s trying to politicize it and make it a campaign rally and say we\u2019re administering the most tests in world like it is a contest \u2013 there\u2019s something that just is terrible.\u201d On Sunday, Trump didn\u2019t take the bait when Tirico raised McIlroy\u2019s name as being among those he\u2019s played golf with and what they discuss on the course. \u201cA lot of them are very political, actually,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSome like my politics very much, and probably some don\u2019t. I guess the ones that don\u2019t, I don\u2019t get to see as much.\u201d A Roman Catholic priest in the Detroit area is making headlines after using a squirt gun to shoot holy water in a bid to maintain social distancing. Photos posted on social media by the St Ambrose Church show the Rev Tim Pelc shooting water into a car window as it stopped by the steps of the church on Easter. He wore a mask, face shield and rubber gloves as further precautions against spreading the coronavirus. The photos of the priest at the church in Grosse Pointe Park have inspired memes online. One shows the 70-year-old priest amid the fires of hell directing the squirt gun at devil-like figures. Pelc told BuzzFeed News for an article over the weekend that he was a little concerned about how the Vatican might react when the photos of him squirting holy water began circulating widely on the internet. But, he said, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything yet.\u201d The photos received attention when they were first posted by St Ambrose Parish on Facebook last month, but have since gone viral on Twitter and Reddit. Joe Biden\u2019s campaign has released a statement criticizing Eric Trump for \u2018reckless\u2019 comments that the coronavirus will \u201cmagically\u201d disappear after Election Day. The president\u2019s son framed the coronavirus as a \u201cvery cognizant strategy\u201d to undermine his father\u2019s reelection prospects on Saturday in an appearance on Jeanine Pirro\u2019s Fox News program. \u201cThey will milk it every single day between now and November 3rd and, guess what, after November 3rd, coronavirus will magically all of a sudden go away and disappear and everybody will be able to reopen,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to deprive him of his greatest asset, which is the fact that the American people love him, that fact that he is relatable, the fact that he can get out there and draw massive crowds.\u201d The Biden campaign issued a response on Sunday afternoon attributed to Kate Bedingfield, the deputy campaign manager and communications director: We\u2019re in the middle of the biggest public health emergency in a century, with almost 90,000 Americans dead, 1.5 million infected, and 36 million workers newly jobless, so for Eric Trump to claim that the coronavirus is a political hoax that will \u2018magically\u2019 disappear is absolutely stunning and unbelievably reckless. The simple fact is that President Trump ignored the threat of the coronavirus for months and has mishandled the response at every step since \u2014 destroying the strong economy he inherited from the Obama-Biden administrations and leading to countless unnecessary deaths. Trump\u2019s campaign knows he can\u2019t run on that dismal record so they\u2019re desperate to do whatever they can to throw up a smokescreen to try to conceal his historic mismanagement of this crisis. Nancy Pelosi warned Sunday that Donald Trump might have broken the law by firing the inspector general of the state department on Friday night. The house speaker made the remarks on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation on Sunday morning, according to my colleague Tom McCarthy. \u201cThe president has the right to fire any federal employee, but the fact is if it looks like it\u2019s in retaliation for something that the IG, the inspector general is doing, that could be unlawful,\u201d said Pelosi. \u201cThey\u2019re supposed to show cause,\u201d she said. Democrats in Congress have opened an investigation of the dismissal, with the ostensible power to subpoena documents and call witnesses to testify. The inquiry could be frustrated, however, by stonewalling by Pompeo, who blocked the testimony of state department officials during the impeachment inquiry last year. Linick became the fourth inspector general to be ousted by Trump. Each major government agency has an inspector general, whom watchdogs regard as playing an essential role in combatting corruption. US district judge Kiyo Matsumoto has rejected the request of convicted pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli to be let out of prison to research a coronavirus treatment. Shkreli, the so-called \u2018Pharma Bro\u2019 who became a national figure of scorn after acquiring the rights to a life-saving Aids drug while CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals and hiking the price 5000%, is serving a seven-year prison sentence in a low-security Pennsylvania prison for lying to investors about the performance of two hedge funds he ran, withdrawing more money from those funds than he was entitled to get and defrauding investors. Shkreli\u2019s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, had filed papers in April asking authorities to release him for three months so he could do laboratory work under supervision at his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s New York City apartment. \u201cDisappointed but not unexpected,\u201d Brafman told the Associated Press. Shkreli called the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s response to the pandemic \u2018inadequate\u2019 and claimed that his background as a successful two-time biopharma entrepreneur would make him a valuable asset in the Covid-19 fight. Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi was rather more measured than Barack Obama when she gave a commencement speech at Smith College on Saturday, although she did reference the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cDuring this crisis and in the days, weeks and years that will follow, the world needs your leadership,\u201d she said. \u201cOur goal as leaders is to shorten the distance between what is inconceivable to some but inevitable to us. Because Smithies are relentless and persistent, I am confident in your ability to do so.\u201d Pelosi\u2019s speech was given online due to the pandemic. Reports of child abuse in the US are down during the pandemic, although that\u2019s not necessarily a good thing according to CNN. Reports of abuse have seen drops of more than 20% in many states over the last few weeks, but CNN says experts are concerned that is because teachers, sports coaches and other adults are less able to see signs of abuse when children are at home during the lockdown. \u201cWhen children are no longer visible to the vast majority of people who are trained and required to report, and then you see this kind of decline, we get super concerned,\u201d said Melissa Jonson-Reid, a professor of social work research at Washington University in St Louis, told CNN. New York mayor Bill de Blasio has criticized residents who were seen gathering without masks outside city bars at the weekend. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to tolerate people starting to congregate. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cIf we have to shut places down, we will.\u201d After a cold start to May, the weather was fine and sunny on Friday and Saturday. But the mayor said that was no excuse to break social distancing guidelines. \u201cIf you start to form groups of people and then two, three, five and then it becomes six, it becomes 10, it becomes 15 that violates what we\u2019re saying about social distancing and that puts lives in danger,\u201d de Blasio said. More than 15,000 people in New York City have died from Covid-19 so far during the pandemic. Donald Trump has given his first public response to Barack Obama\u2019s criticism of the current administration\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. It is rare for a former president to rebuke a successor, but Obama did so during an online speech to graduates yesterday, although he did not name Trump. \u201cMore than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain that so many of the folks in charge know what they\u2019re doing. A lot of them aren\u2019t even pretending to be in charge,\u201d Obama said during Saturday\u2019s speech. On Sunday, Trump was asked by reporters about Obama\u2019s comments as he entered the White House. \u201cLook, he was an incompetent president, that\u2019s all I can say. Grossly incompetent,\u201d said Trump. The president also said he believes the US, which has recorded the most deaths from Covid-19 of any country in the world, is making progress against the virus. \u201cSo I think we had a great weekend. We did a lot of terrific meetings. Tremendous progress is being made on many fronts, including coming up with a cure for this horrible plague that has beset our country,\u201d said Trump. \u201cIt was a working weekend, it was a good weekend. A lot of very good things have happened.\u201d Bernie Sanders said he thinks his supporters will vote for Joe Biden in the November\u2019s election despite a former aide\u2019s warning that Biden was not consolidating Sanders supporters. The former Democratic presidential candidate made the remarks on ABC\u2019s This Week With George Stephanopoulos: In a memo released last week, former Sanders adviser Jeff Weaver said Sanders supporters were \u201ccurrently unsupportive and unenthusiastic\u201d about Biden and \u201cthere is a real and urgent need to help Biden consolidate Sanders supporters\u201d. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, said on ABC News\u2019 This Week program on Sunday that Biden was \u201cbeginning\u201d to make overtures to his supporters \u201cAnd I think at the end of the day they will be voting for Joe Biden.\u201d \u201cI think, at the end of the day, the vast majority of the people who voted for me who supported me will understand and do understand that Donald Trump is the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country, he is a pathological liar, he\u2019s a racist and a sexist, a homophobe, etcetera,\u201d said Sanders. \u201cBut I think what Joe is gonna have to do \u2013 and he\u2019s beginning to move in that direction \u2013 is to say to those working class people, say to those young people, say to those minorities, \u2018Listen, I understand your situation\u2019.\u201d Sanders said Biden\u2019s message should focus on student debt relief, health insurance coverage, a living wage, climate change policy and racism in the criminal justice and immigration systems. Biden, who has run on his record as Barack Obama\u2019s vice-president, is regarded as a moderate who appeals to more centrist Democrats, and his policy platform has been criticized by some progressive groups who see it as overly cautious and lacking ambition. Cuomo says the more than 700 drive-through and walk-in coronavirus testing sites throughout New York state can handle around 15,000 people per day but are currently testing about 5,000 per day. The state is launching a new website to help New Yorkers find locations near them. To demonstrate the process is as easy and painless as he says, Cuomo then is given a nasal swab test. The inspired bit of stagecraft takes less than a minute. \u201cI\u2019m not in pain, I\u2019m not in discomfort,\u201d he says. \u201cClosing my eyes was a moment of relaxation. There is no reason why you should not get the test.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo says total hospitalizations, net change in intubations and new coronavirus cases all remain down in his Sunday briefing from Albany. The number of deaths is down to 139 in the past 24-hour period \u2013 106 in hospitals, 33 in nursing homes \u2013 which is down from 799 at the peak. \u201cWe\u2019re right about where we were when we started,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just want to make sure we never go back to where we were.\u201d Cuomo says western New York and the Albany region are close to meeting the final metrics for reopening, but need more contact tracers to meet the prerequisite: \u201cThat\u2019s the only function that has to be performed for those regions to reopen.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s global environment editor, Jonathan Watts, has written about the possible effect of the coronavirus crisis on the world\u2019s airlines: \u201cThe political moment is now\u201d to address the climate risks posed by the aviation industry, analysts, insiders and campaigners say, as governments across the world weigh up bailouts for airlines grounded by the coronavirus pandemic. Rescue packages need to come with green strings, such as reduced carbon footprints and frequent flyer levies, they warn, or the sector will return to the path that has made it the fastest rising source of climate-wrecking carbon emissions over the past decade. Peter Navarro, a top economic adviser to Donald Trump, has criticized Barack Obama after the former president said the country was suffering from a vacuum of leadership on the coronavirus crisis. \u201cI\u2019m glad Mr Obama has a new job as Joe Biden\u2019s press secretary,\u201d Navarro said on ABC News\u2019 This Week. Biden, Obama\u2019s former vice president, is running against Trump for president. In a speech billed as an address to graduates on Saturday, Obama said \u201cmore than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain that so many of the folks in charge know what they\u2019re doing. A lot of them aren\u2019t even pretending to be in charge.\u201d Navarro responded that Obama\u2019s administration \u201cwas a kumbaya of incompetence\u201d. He falsely accused the former president, as Trump frequently has, of allowing \u201cmillions of manufacturing jobs\u201d to move to China. In fact the main transfer of manufacturing jobs from the United States to China, such as it was, occurred in the early 2000s, before Obama was president. Separately, in repetition of a reckless Trumpian line with no basis in evidence, Navarro accused China of deliberately \u201cseeding\u201d the world with the novel coronavirus, which Navarro calls \u201cChina virus\u201d. \u201cThe Chinese behind the shield of the World Health Organization \u2013 for two months \u2013 hid the virus from the world and then sent hundreds of thousands of Chinese on aircraft to Milan, New York and around the world to seed that,\u201d Navarro said on ABC. \u201cThey could have kept it in Wuhan. Instead it became a pandemic.\u201d In fact Chinese scientists raised the alarm about Covid-19 in early January and published the genomic structure of Sars-CoV-2 online on 11 January so that scientists worldwide could begin fighting the virus. But the Trump administration failed to stand up widespread testing for the virus and educate the public about the looming threat, with Trump dismissing the virus as a Democratic hoax. An uptick in racist attacks against Asian Americans in the United States has coincided with the Trump administration\u2019s messaging blaming China for Covid-19. Good morning, US live blog readers, we\u2019ll bring you all the US politics and coronavirus news here today and there is a lot going on in America this weekend, so stay tuned. Here\u2019s what is developing so far: Peter Navarro, a top economic adviser to Donald Trump, has criticized Barack Obama after the former president said the country was suffering from a vacuum of leadership on the coronavirus crisis. Obama attacks Trump administration\u2019s response to coronavirus pandemic. The former president broke with the tradition of refraining from criticism of his successor in a pair of commencement addresses on Saturday, while also highlighting the high-profile killing of Ahmaud Arbery. Trump is at the presidential retreat Camp David, where he\u2019s been up tweeting and plugging his pre-recorded interview with Fox News\u2019s Maria Bartiromo.",

      "bodyText": "The shadow home secretary has accused the government of \u201crank hypocrisy\u201d for closing the door to low-skilled immigration while cheering NHS workers. As home secretary Priti Patel prepares to bring the immigration bill to the House of Commons for its second reading on Monday, Nick Thomas-Symonds has written to her urging her to \u201cthink again\u201d. \u201cI believe the government\u2019s plan to rush through this immigration legislation is an insult to our incredible NHS staff and care workers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is, frankly, rank hypocrisy from the government towards EU nationals \u2013 over 180,000 in England and Wales alone \u2013 who are currently working in our NHS and in the care sector, for ministers to stand and clap for them on a Thursday night, and then tell them that they are not welcome in the UK on a Monday.\u201d He suggested the new policy was \u201ca threat to the national interest\u201d. The strongly worded letter is the latest example of a more muscular style of opposition from Keir Starmer\u2019s party, after a period of relative quiescence while the coronavirus pandemic was at its peak. Patel described the immigration bill as historic. It brings to fruition the promise of an \u201cAustralian-style points-based system\u201d first outlined by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove when they were fronting the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 referendum. With a Tory majority of 80, the bill should pass easily. \u201cThis historic piece of legislation gives the UK full control of our immigration system for the first time in decades and the power to determine who comes to this country,\u201d Patel said. \u201cOur new points-based system is firmer, fairer, and simpler. It will attract the people we need to drive our economy forward and lay the foundation for a high wage, high skill, high productivity economy.\u201d And she highlighted the promise of a fast-track NHS visa, saying it would make it easier and quicker for medical professionals to work in the health service. Touted by Johnson during last December\u2019s general election campaign, the NHS visa promises lower fees and rapid processing for qualified applicants such as overseas doctors who have secured an NHS job offer. However, Thomas-Symonds echoed the charge of his predecessor, Diane Abbott, that the government is continuing to write off lower-paid workers. \u201cThe government is labelling workers \u2013 from carers to retail staff, local government workers to refuse collectors \u2013 as \u2018low-skilled\u2019 when they have been on the front line keeping this country running throughout the crisis,\u201d he said. Full details of the new immigration rules, which will see EU and non-EU migrants treated equally, will not be published until later this year, but are expected to include minimum salary thresholds. The new system will come into force in January, when the status quo transition period is due to come to an end.",

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus pandemic is exacerbating the existing vulnerabilities of the world\u2019s refugees and internally displaced people, according to a report. Research from the University of Birmingham has revealed that many undocumented migrants were anxious about seeking medical help \u2013 fearful of being reported to immigration authorities and being deported \u2013 and were therefore suffering in silence. The report, Understanding the Impact of Covid-19 on Forced Migrant Survivors of Sexual and Gender-based Violence, due to be published on Monday, took witness testimonies from more than 90 survivors and organisations in five countries, including the UK. It found that victims were finding themselves locked in with perpetrators, with no access to shelters or advice organisations, and as a result were having to suffer abuse. Jenny Phillimore, the lead author of the research, said: \u201cSome women and their children are going hungry and without medical care \u2013 they are entirely destitute and reliant on the generosity of neighbours, themselves struggling. \u201cSocial isolation is exacerbating multilayered traumas \u2013 no distractions mean women are reliving abuse episodes, increasing anxiety levels, sleep problems and leading to suicide ideation.\u201d Tracy, 26, a Nigerian survivor of trafficking who lives in an International Organization for Migration shelter in Tunisia with her husband, Endurance, described life as becoming \u201cunbearably difficult\u201d since the beginning of the pandemic. The couple, who have irregular immigration status, are struggling to feed themselves, saying they are on the verge of starvation. \u201cThe life here in this pandemic is so hard, especially for us, the migrants. They gave us just 30 dinar [\u00a38] to eat for seven days but that can\u2019t even feed us for two days, so now we only eat once a day. It is very difficult and we have no one,\u201d said Tracy. The report found that in some countries there had been increased targeting by traffickers as well as pressure put on children to enter into marriages. There had also been a knock-on effect due to the cancellation of therapeutic services and self-help groups. Digital poverty confounded this issue, excluding many from participating in online meetings, resulting in many migrants spending long days alone. \u201cWith many women having lack of digital resources to access online/via phone \u2013 women who were moving forward with their lives now feel themselves slipping backwards and are losing hope,\u201d said Phillimore. She added: \u201cIndividuals feared going hungry and struggled to receive support due to pandemic restrictions, which included suspension of some projects.

      "bodyText": "As many as 6 million people in Britain fear losing their job within six months as the coronavirus outbreak causes the biggest economic shock in living memory, a study has warned. With much of business and social life at a standstill despite gradual steps to reopen the economy, the Centre for Labour and Social Studies (Class) said workers feared the coronavirus recession would be worse than the 2008 financial crash. As many as one in five people in a survey of 2,000 workers by Survation for the leftwing thinktank said they were worried about losing their jobs, despite government efforts to cushion the blow using its wage subsidy scheme. Extended by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, until October to avoid spiralling job losses this summer, the government is subsidising about 7.5m jobs at almost 1m companies through the furlough programme. After just two full days of its operation more than a million self-employed workers made claims for over \u00a33bn in emergency support through a similar scheme for people who work for themselves. However, the survey found that 60% of workers are just three months or less away from defaulting on their rent or mortgage, suggesting the scheme has not stopped people feeling that they are perilously close to disaster. The report follows evidence that almost a third of Britain\u2019s lowest-paid workers have lost their job or been furloughed in the past two months, while job losses are starting to rise for those missing out on the government support schemes. Surveys from the Office for National Statistics also indicate more than 80% of the public expect their financial situation to deteriorate or stay the same in the next year, as the pandemic triggers the worst global recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s. Class urged the government to launch a job creation scheme and substantial spending stimulus to refocus the economy, calling for Britain to grow its way out of the slump with well-paid green jobs. Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said the survey highlighted how stressful life was on low wages and with insecure work. \u201cLife has become harder still in the Covid-19 crisis \u2013 especially for those on the frontline. \u201cAlthough the problems these workers face have existed for many years, the Covid-19 crisis has laid them bare for all to see. And it has intensified the injustice.\u201d The trades union-funded thinktank also found widespread public support for giving key workers, including NHS staff, care workers, shop workers and delivery drivers a pay rise. At the same time 69% of those polled supported taxing the wealthy more to help pay for the crisis. Faiza Shaheen, director of Class, said: \u201cProtecting workers now requires us looking past emergency measures to a recovery plan. Coronavirus has put society in an X-ray machine to reveal its structural weakness and is now magnifying existing inequalities. \u201cIt is up to the chancellor to seize this opportunity, to build a bridge from the furlough scheme and unemployment benefits to green jobs and a fairer society.\u201d",

Talon sported a mask when he voted early in Cotonou\u2019s Zongo-Ehuzu area.</p> <p>In the city\u2019s first district Arnold Migan voted early in the morning. \u201cWith the threat from COVID-19 it\u2019s best to vote quickly and go home before a lot of people arrive,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Benin, seen as one of the region\u2019s most stable democracies, has been in political crisis since a disputed parliamentary poll last April sparked protests. Talon, a former business magnate who came to power in 2016, has been accused of a crackdown that drove key rivals into exile.</p> <p>Parties allied to the president won all the seats at the polls last year after opposition groups were effectively banned from standing, but turnout was only 25%.

But Benin disregarded the ruling and severed some ties with the court in protest at the decision.</p> <p>Opponents called on voters to boycott the poll over the political situation and the risks from coronavirus. Many among the electorate appeared set to heed the call to stay home given the result looks certain to go in favour of those backing Talon.

its total to more than 230,000, the fourth-largest confirmed caseload after the <strong>US</strong>, <strong>Russia</strong> and the <strong>UK</strong>. </p> <p>Its true number of infections is feared to be much greater, with the country carrying out fewer than a half a million tests by the start of last week, compared with about 1.9m in Spain and Italy.<br></p> <p>The country\u2019s response has been hamstrung by the resignation of two successive federal health ministers in the past month who have complained of inaction and interference by the president, <strong>Jair Bolsonaro</strong>, a rightwing populist who continues to be critical of the shutdown measures implemented by Brazil\u2019s state governments.</p> <p>\u201cUnemployment, hunger and misery will be the future of those who support the tyranny of total isolation,\u201d Bolsonaro tweeted, a day after <strong>Nelson Teich</strong> <a

href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/coronavirus-montreal-canada-hit-hard\">at the centre of Canada\u2019s coronavirus outbreak</a>, Quebec is currently \u201cstrongly recommending\u201d that citizens wear masks \u2013 but the measure will not be mandatory.</p> <p>Asked why not, <strong>Horacio Arruda</strong>, the province\u2019s public health director, told reporters: \u201cYou need to have a good argument for infringing on individual rights for the sake of a collective right.\u201d</p> <p>But such arguments ring hollow to <strong>Nour Farhat</strong>, a Montreal lawyer whose dreams of being a Crown prosecutor were dashed after the Quebec government passed legislation last year barring certain public sector workers from wearing religious symbols at work.</p> <p>The law \u2013 known as <strong>Bill 21</strong> \u2013 mainly affects Muslim women working in education, law and other public sectors. Farhat said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Bill 21 violates the rights of religious minorities without a real or urgent situation. And now that we\u2019re in a real and urgent situation, the premier cares about violating people\u2019s rights.</p> <p>For them, it was always OK to violate the rights of religious minorities.</p> </blockquote> <p>Bill 21 has always permitted masks for medical reasons, and government media representatives say their hesitancy on masks is not related to that law.</p> <p>But head and face coverings carry a certain political weight in Quebec. Recent years have seen multiple instances of people trying to snatch hijabs from women\u2019s heads in the province. </p> <p>And only last year did Montreal <a href=\"https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montrealers-will-be-allowed-to-protest-wearing-masks-as-bylaw-to-be-scrapped/\">reverse a seven-year ban on people wearing masks at protests</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/quebec-masks-mandatory-veil-ban-coronavirus\">Quebec ponders making masks mandatory after banning the veil</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ec12b5f8f0864e579f12827\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-17T12:22:35.029Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Russia\u2019s virus spread stabilising, health official says</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The growth of new coronavirus cases in <strong>Russia</strong> is stabilising, a top health official has said, as the daily tally fell under 10,000 for the third time this week.<br></p> <p>The country has the world\u2019s second highest number of infections at 281,752, topped only by the <strong>United States</strong>. </p> <p>On Sunday, it announced new cases had dropped below 10,000 for the third day this week at 9,709. </p> <p>The head of Russia\u2019s public health watchdog, <strong>Anna Popova</strong>, said in an interview on Rossiya-1 television: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019ve moved towards the level of stability that we\u2019ve all been waiting for.</p> <p>I would say that of today, we have halted the growth [in the number of cases].</p> <p>For the last 10 or 11 days now, we haven\u2019t seen additional growth or it\u2019s been very small.</p> <p>Stabilisation can be seen over the whole country.

Some research indicates that children are far less likely to become infected compared with adults but other studies suggest that when they do become infected, they carry as much viral load as an adult, and therefore pose a real risk of passing the virus on to others.</p> <p>The situation was summed up by a senior Labour frontbencher last week: \u201cEither you put the education of children at risk by keeping schools closed, or you take a risk with their safety.

With much of business and social life at a standstill despite gradual steps to reopen the economy, the Centre for Labour and Social Studies (Class) said workers feared the coronavirus recession would be worse than the 2008 financial crash. As many as one in five people in a survey of 2,000 workers by Survation for the leftwing thinktank said they were worried about losing their jobs, despite government efforts to cushion the blow using its wage subsidy scheme. That\u2019s it from me - I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Helen Sullivan in Sydney to guide you through the next bit of the day/night. As always, thanks very much to everyone who wrote in with tips and suggestions. Here are some of the key points from over the last few hours. The global number of coronavirus cases has exceeded 4,700,000, standing at 4,702,603, according to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus resource center. There have been 314,476 deaths globally. France\u2019s death toll has passed 28,000, with the total number of coronavirus deaths recorded in hospitals and nursing homes rising to 28,108 from 27,625 on Saturday. The latest daily toll, of 483, is the largest in several weeks, and was made up mainly of deaths in care homes: 429 deaths, compared to 54 in hospital. South Africa has reported its highest daily increase in cases, registering 1,160 new coronavirus infections on Sunday. The health ministry announced that the total number of confirmed cases has reached 15,515, while the numbers of deaths rose by three to 263. At least 121 people in Mexico have died from drinking adulterated liquor as a result of alcohol shortages during the coronavirus pandemic. Since factories producing liquor and beer were shut down, gangs specialising in bootleg booze have been taking advantage of the lack of alternative alcohol sources. Nigeria has seized a British plane for defying a travel ban imposed as part of measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, the aviation minister has announced. Flair Aviation, the airline involved, was authorised to conduct humanitarian flights but was caught operating commercial flights, minister Hadi Sirika said on Twitter. Death tolls have fallen in UK, Spain and Italy. The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded - though due to hospital reporting delays, numbers reported on Sundays and Mondays are typically lower. Italy also recorded its lowest daily toll, 145, since lockdown, while Spain recorded its lowest toll in two months with 87 deaths. Qatar has begun enforcing the world\u2019s toughest penalties of up to three years\u2019 in prison for failing to wear masks in public, in a country with one of the highest coronavirus infection rates. Over 32,000 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in the tiny Gulf country - 1.2 percent of the 2.75 million population - although just 15 people have died. Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro has continued to disregard social distancing measures, posing for photographs with kids at a rally at the presidential palace. Brazil\u2019s confirmed cases of the virus passed Spain and Italy on Saturday, making it the world\u2019s fourth-largest outbreak. New York mayor Bill de Blasio has criticised residents who were seen gathering without masks outside city bars at the weekend. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to tolerate people starting to congregate. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cIf we have to shut places down, we will.\u201d More than 15,000 people in New York City have died from Covid-19. Australia\u2019s death toll has risen to 99, with New South Wales\u2019s chief medical officer reporting the death of a man in his 60s who had underlying health conditions. The man is the 46th person to die with coronavirus in New South Wales. \u201cThe political moment is now\u201d to address the climate risks posed by the aviation industry, analysts, insiders and campaigners say, as governments across the world weigh up bailouts for airlines grounded by the coronavirus pandemic. Rescue packages need to come with green strings, such as reduced carbon footprints and frequent flyer levies, they warn, or the sector will return to the path that has made it the fastest rising source of climate-wrecking carbon emissions over the past decade. Old passenger jets also need to be rapidly retired or cheap oil prices will encourage budget airlines to run services almost empty, which could push up emissions even if passenger numbers stay low, they say. As did banks after the 2008-9 financial crisis, many aviation companies are appealing for government support to escape from a problem they partly caused. The expansion of flight networks, packed seating and a reluctance to accept quarantine measures have contributed to the rapid transmission of the Covid-19 virus across the globe. Have a read of Jonathan Watts\u2019s piece on the possibility of a greener future for airlines. More on the breakdown of France\u2019s daily death toll, which at 483, is the highest in several weeks. The figure was made up chiefly of deaths in care homes - 429, compared to 54 in hospitals. The health directorate was unable to provide more information on the sudden rise in care home deaths, according to AFP. The figures bring the total number of deaths in France to 28,108. Meanwhile, health officials meanwhile have been battling to contain two outbreaks of the virus at abattoirs that are so far known to have infected around a hundred people. One abattoir is in the central Val de Loire region near the city of Orleans, and the other is in the northwestern region of Brittany. Scores of Mexicans are dying from drinking adulterated liquor, a consequence of the shortage of mainstream alcoholic beverages during the coronavirus pandemic, authorities say. AFP reports that the first of at least 121 deaths in recent weeks occurred at the end of April in the western state of Jalisco, almost exactly a month after the government declared a health emergency over the spread of Covid-19. As much of Mexico has run out of beer after factories producing liquor and beer were shut down, gangs specialising in bootleg booze are trying to take advantage of the lack of alternative alcohol sources. Beer stocks were almost depleted within a month, and in some areas the prices of what was left doubled, according to industry sources. Many of the 53 deaths in central Puebla province have been linked to a wake where people drank moonshine containing methanol \u2013 a wood alcohol that in non-lethal doses can cause blindness and liver damage. Twenty-three people died in the hours following the gathering in the town of Chiconcuautla, according to authorities. The town\u2019s mayor said the popular \u201crefino\u201d drink, made from sugarcane, had been adulterated. German Hernandez said his father died after being poisoned by a drink known locally as \u201ctejon\u201d \u2013 a blend of brandy with tejocote fruit (a type of hawthorn) in the Puebla town of Cacaloxuchitl. \u201cThey sell it in the stores, and you can buy it and take it out. My father began trembling and feeling weak. He told us he felt bad, and we took him to the hospital,\u201d Hernandez told AFP. \u201cThis has never happened before.\u201d Deaths have also been recorded in the central state of Morelos and Yucatan and Veracruz in the east. South Africa on Sunday reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March, AFP reports. \u201cAs of today, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa is 15,515, with 1,160 new cases identified in the last 24 hour cycle of testing,\u201d said the health ministry in a statement. The Western Cape province, popular with tourists, accounted for nearly 60% of the national numbers. The numbers of deaths rose by three to 263 from Saturday. Africa\u2019s most industrialised economy has the highest numbers of infections in Africa, followed by Egypt, which has so far recorded 11,719 Covid-19 cases, including 612 deaths. The country has been under lockdown since March 27 and has embarked on an aggressive mass testing strategy with 460,873 tested so far. But some health experts are beginning to see the limits of the country\u2019s lauded mass screening strategy, with results taking up to two weeks to come through. Now for something a little lighter: socially distant blessings delivered with a water pistol. The priest in the photo, Father Tim Pelc, told BuzzFeed News that he was a little concerned about how the Vatican might react when the photos of him squirting holy water began circulating widely on the internet, but hasn\u2019t heard anything about it yet. Egypt will bring forward the start of its curfew by four hours to 5pm and halt public transport from 24 May for six days during the Eid holiday, reports Reuters. The prime minister, Mostafa Madbouly, said on Sunday that shops, restaurants, parks and beaches will be closed for the extended holiday at the end of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan, and restrictions on citizens\u2019 movements will remain in place for at least two weeks afterwards. Egypt has so far reported 12,229 confirmed cases, including 630 deaths. The daily tally of cases has been rising after the government slightly eased a night curfew and other measures. The number of cases rose by 510 on Sunday, the health ministry said. New York mayor Bill de Blasio has criticised residents who were seen gathering without masks outside bars at the weekend despite the city\u2019s ongoing \u201cstay at home\u201d guidelines, saying they were putting lives in danger. Almost 90,000 people have died in the US from Covid-19 so far during the pandemic, far more than any other country, according to Johns Hopkins. More than 15,000 of those deaths were in New York City, which is still subject to stay-at-home measures even as many other US cities begin to open up again. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to tolerate people starting to congregate. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d De Blasio said on Sunday. \u201cIf we have to shut places down, we will.\u201d Just a reminder that you can reach me on Twitter @cleaskopeliti, or by email, if you have any tips, comments or suggestions for coverage. Thanks to everyone who has already been in touch! Nigeria has seized a British plane for defying a travel ban imposed as part of measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, the aviation minister said Sunday. Flair Aviation, the airline involved, was authorised to conduct humanitarian flights but was caught operating commercial flights, Hadi Sirika said on his Twitter account. \u201cThis is callous!\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe craft is impounded, the crew being interrogated. There shall be maximum penalty. Wrong time to try our resolve.\u201d There was no immediate reaction on Sunday from either the company or the British embassy on the matter. Nigeria has shut its airports and airspace since March to contain Covid-19, which has so far infected 5,621 people and claimed 176 lives there. Wearing a face mask, Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro posed for photographs with kids plucked out of a crowd of supporters on Sunday, disregarding public health advice aimed at containing one of the world\u2019s worst coronavirus outbreaks, Reuters reports. Bolsonaro\u2019s latest flouting of social distancing guidelines comes after he lost two health ministers in a month, both of whom resisted his fight against quarantines. Brazil\u2019s confirmed cases of the virus passed Spain and Italy on Saturday, making it the world\u2019s fourth-largest outbreak. In an online video, Bolsonaro said he welcomed the demonstration at the presidential palace in what has become a nearly biweekly affair, with the president and supporters defying quarantines that have the support of most Brazilians. \u201cAbove all (the people) want freedom, they want democracy, they want respect,\u201d he said, adding that Brazilians want to get the economy back up and running as quickly as possible. A poll this week showed two-thirds of Brazilians agree with the need for social distancing to contain the outbreak, which governors and health experts recommend, while Bolsonaro tries to open gyms, hair salons and other businesses. On Friday, former health minister Nelson Teich resigned as he and the president showed themselves increasingly out of step, with Bolsonaro calling for a rollback of state quarantines and widespread use of unproven drugs, such as chloroquine to fight the virus. \u201cChlo-ro-quine! Chlo-ro-quine!\u201d chanted Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters outside the presidential palace in Sunday, as well as \u201cWe want to work!\u201d Nationwide testing in Brazil still lags far behind European nations. Brazil had processed nearly 338,000 novel coronavirus tests in official labs by the beginning of the week, according to the Health Ministry. Another 145,000 tests were under analysis or waiting in line. By contrast, Italy and Spain have each run some 1.9 million official diagnostic tests for the virus. In a possible glimmer of hope, Sunday has seen lower death tolls reported in the UK, Spain and Italy. The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. This should be taken with a pinch of salt: due to hospital reporting delays, the numbers reported on Sundays and Mondays tend to be lower than other days. Meanwhile Spain has recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months. According to the latest figures from the health ministry, 87 people have died from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, down from 102 the day before. Italy on Sunday recorded its lowest daily toll, 145, since lockdown was declared. There were 153 deaths registered during the previous 24 hour period. Doctors have identified a group of blood compounds that may help to reveal which children are most at risk of developing a rare but life-threatening immune reaction to coronavirus. The new syndrome emerged last month after hospitals in London admitted a number of children to intensive care units with symptoms that resembled toxic shock mixed with an inflammatory disorder known as Kawasaki disease. Read Ian Sample\u2019s report here. Qatar has begun enforcing the world\u2019s toughest penalties of up to three years\u2019 in prison for failing to wear masks in public, in a country with one of the highest coronavirus infection rates. More than 32,000 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in the tiny Gulf country - 1.2 percent of the 2.75 million population - although just 15 people have died. Only the micro-states of San Marino and the Vatican have had higher per-capita infection rates, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Violators of Qatar\u2019s new rules will face up to three years in jail and fines of as much as $55,000. Drivers alone in their vehicles are exempt from the requirement, but police erected checkpoints across the capital Doha on Sunday evening to check compliance by motorists. Wearing a mask is currently mandatory in around 50 countries, although scientists are divided on their effectiveness. Authorities in Chad have made it an offence to be unmasked in public, on pain of 15 days in prison. In Morocco, similar rules can see violators jailed for three months and fined up to 1,300 dirhams ($130). France\u2019s total number of coronavirus deaths recorded in hospitals and nursing homes has risen to 28,108 from 27,625 on Saturday. Of the total toll, 17,466 have been in hospitals while 10,642 happened in nursing homes. The number of people in hospitals has fallen to 19,361, compared to 19,432 the previous day. The number of people in ICU is 2,087, compared to 2,132 on Saturday. Italy\u2019s shops, restaurants and hair salons have been preparing to reopen on Monday, as the government further eases the lockdown. Businesses are being allowed to gradually go back to work as long they can enforce tight sanitary protocols and keep people at least one metre apart. Economic recovery is expected to be difficult, particularly without tourists. Lebanon will gradually reopen its economy beginning on Monday following a four-day shutdown imposed after a rise in coronavirus cases threatened a second wave of the outbreak. The country\u2019s plan to ease restrictions on business was paused last week after a rise in new cases. The country of about 6 million people has recorded 911 infections and 26 deaths. UK daily coronavirus death toll is the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. However, due to hospital reporting delays, the numbers reported on Sundays and Mondays tend to be lower than other days. India has extended a nearly two-month-old lockdown by another two weeks with Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai and other key regions still fighting to control the rising curve of coronavirus infections. The health ministry on Sunday reported a record jump of nearly 5,000 cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, raising the number of confirmed cases to 90,927, with 2,872 deaths. Benin is staging local elections, minus key opposition parties, with authorities pushing ahead despite the coronavirus. The West African nation of 11 million this week lifted a series of restrictions aimed at halting the spread of the virus, which has caused 339 confirmed infections and two deaths in the country. Confirmed Covid-19 cases in Brazil have surpassed the total in Italy, with the country announcing nearly 15,000 new infections on Saturday. This takes Brazil\u2019s total to more than 230,000, the fourth-largest confirmed caseload after the US, Russia and the UK. The city of Wuhan conducted 222,675 nucleic acid tests on 16 May, the local health authority said, nearly doubling from a day earlier. Wuhan kicked off a campaign on 14 May to look for asymptomatic carriers after confirming last weekend its first cluster of Covid-19 infections since its release from lockdown on 8 April. Quebec is considering making masks mandatory, after banning the veil. The Canadian province at the centre of the country\u2019s outbreak is is currently \u201cstrongly recommending\u201d that citizens wear masks, but has not made the measure mandatory. Quebec\u2019s public health director stressed \u201cYou need to have a good argument for infringing on individual rights for the sake of a collective right.\u201d The growth of new coronavirus cases in Russia is stabilising, a top health official has said, as the daily tally fell under 10,000 for the third time this week. The country has the world\u2019s second highest number of infections at 281,752, topped only by the United States. Madagascar has reported the first death of a patient suffering from the coronavirus, nearly two months after the virus was first detected in the country. The victim was a 57-year-old man with underlying conditions. Madagascar has reported 304 cases. Helena Smith with the latest from Greece\u2019s beaches: In a move seen as vital for the reinvigoration of tourism across southern Europe, Greek authorities opened more than 500 beaches along the Athenian Riviera this weekend. But in the new normal that is Greece\u2019s gradual emergence into the post -lockdown age, there was little that was recognisable. Along the Athenian Riveriera freedom is now measured in metres - even if Greece has succeeded in keeping Covid-19 infection and mortality rates unusually low. It was a different story, however, on public transport, with pictures emerging of buses crammed with passengers headed to the beach. Greek authorities, announcing a further 15 new cases of coronavirus on Sunday, say the total number of confirmed infections now stands at 2,834. The death toll rose, following an additional fatality, to 162. The country\u2019s churches also opened today on condition that worshippers adapted to strict social distancing rules. The government, which will lift restrictions on inter-regional travel on Monday, has said that ancient archaeological sites, shopping malls and department stores will open tomorrow as the nation gradually eases out of lockdown. Read Helena Smith and Angela Giuffrida\u2019s report on the opening of southern European beaches here: Egyptian security forces arrested the founder of Egypt\u2019s last independent media outlet in a growing crackdown on freedom of expression connected to Covid-19. Lina Attalah, the editor-in-chief of the website Mada Masr, was arrested outside Tora prison in the south of Cairo. Attalah was detained in front of the prison while interviewing Laila Soueif, the mother of jailed activist Alaa Abd El Fattah, who was attempting to bring medication and hand sanitiser to her son. Abd El Fattah has been on hunger strike since mid April in protest at deteriorating prison conditions, including the risk of the spread of COVID-19 inside Tora prison as well as the suspension of prison visits and trial hearings due to the virus. Atallah was taken to a police station and held on unknown charges, and will be presented to prosecutors tomorrow according to her colleagues. Mada Masr reportedthat Attalah\u2019s mobile phone was seized and their lawyer was prevented from accessing Atallah while in detention. The journalist was recognised by Time Magazine as a \u201cNew Generation Leader,\u201d in 2017, when she was branded the \u201cmuckraker of the Arab World.\u201d Mada Masr is internationally recognised as the last bastion of press freedom in Egypt, a lone award-winning independent outlet in a repressive media environment where the majority of newspapers are state-controlled. The staff at Mada Masr, including Attalah, endured a raid by plainclothes security officials on their offices last November where she was detained and later released following international pressure. Attalah\u2019s arrest is part of a pattern of repression connected to Covid-19. Egyptian security forces detained journalist Hassan Mahgoub from his home in early May, after he reported a series of stories about the virus. Editor Atef Hasballah was bundled into the back of a police van and accused of joining a terrorist group in April after questioning the government\u2019s official statistics about Covid-19 on his Facebook page. Egypt is considered one of the world\u2019s leading jailers of journalists, ranked 166 out of 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders. Diaa Rashwan, the head of Egypt\u2019s State Information Service and the head of the journalists\u2019 syndicate did not respond when contacted for comment. \u201cLina\u2019s arrest is yet another example of Egypt\u2019s persistent assault on journalists,\u201d said Timothy E Kaldas of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy and a longtime friend of Attalah\u2019s. \u201cIt\u2019s worrisome that the latest round of crackdowns coincides with the Covid pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cEgyptian authorities may presume this leaves foreign capitals distracted and unprepared to emphasize concerns about political freedoms. A free press that the public can trust for information is all the more vital during a health crisis.\u201d Zoom has said problems with the video conferencing platform have now been resolved. Users of the service reported outages on Sunday, with many unable to host or join meetings. The website DownDetector said thousands of people were having issues with the service, with regions in the US, Middle East and Europe appearing to have been particularly affected. \u201cZoom users impacted by this issue should now be able to host, join &amp; participate in Zoom Meetings &amp; Zoom Video Webinars if they restart their sessions. We continue to assess &amp; monitor. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this might have caused,\u201d the company tweeted. The video conferencing service\u2019s popularity has exploded since lockdowns began worldwide and people have been using it to host business meetings but also social events, including calls with family and friends and, in the UK, pub quizzes. However, issues have been raised with the platform\u2019s lax security, highlighted by \u201cZoombombing\u201d incidents where trolls enter meetings uninvited. Shops, restaurants and hair salons prepared to reopen in Italy on Monday as the government further eased one of the world\u2019s strictest coronavirus lockdowns, saying it was taking a \u201ccalculated risk\u201d to put the country back on its feet. The euro zone\u2019s third biggest economy is slowly emerging from more than two months of hibernation, with businesses allowed to gradually go back to work as long they can enforce tight sanitary protocols and keep people at least one metre apart. Department stores are taking measures such as counting customers using an app, quarantining clothes tried on in changing rooms for 24 hours and spilling perfume on tissues rather than having customers handle testers. Restaurants will only allow family members to sit close together. But there are fears that economic recovery will be difficult, particularly in the absence of tourists. Business association Confcommercio expects consumer spending for clothing, which stood at 60 billion euros in 2019, to shrink by 20% this year and a quarter of the country\u2019s 115,000 fashion retailers to go bust. \u201cI know that for several sectors of the economy, reopening does not mean recovery,\u201d Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said late on Saturday as he announced the lifting of the restrictions. With its economy facing severe recession and public debt expected to spiral to more than 150% of its annual economic output, the government has been desperate to get the country back to work without triggering a second wave of the epidemic. Others prefer to wait until European borders reopen on 3 June. Tourism contributes 13% to the country\u2019s economic output. Downing Street\u2019s daily briefing is about to start \u2013 head over to the UK live blog to follow along. Lebanon will gradually reopen its economy beginning on Monday, prime minister Hassan Diab said, following a four-day shutdown imposed after a rise in coronavirus cases threatened a second wave of the outbreak, Reuters reports. Already in the throes of a deep economic crisis, Lebanon began easing virus-related restrictions on business late last month to try to restore some economic activity. But that plan was paused last week after a rise in new cases. Lebanon has been relatively successful reining in the outbreak since a mid-March lockdown that set an overnight curfew and shut most business and air travel. The country of about 6 million people has recorded 911 infections and 26 deaths. In a televised address on Sunday, Diab said the economy would resume its gradual re-opening, but warned Lebanese to adhere strictly to health and safety guidelines that had been flouted during the initial attempt. \u201cWe do not want this stage to turn into a nightmare, and we will not accept that all Lebanese pay the price for some irresponsible and indifferent behaviours,\u201d said Diab. A five-stage plan for resuming economic activity unveiled last month envisages most economic activity restored after a final period beginning on 8 June. Lebanon has not set a date for the re-opening of its airport for commercial flights. Hello, I\u2019ll be taking over the live blog for the next few hours.

Tobias Altsch\u00e4ffl was at yesterday\u2019s game between Augburg and Wolfsburg, to see elite club football return as Germany\u2019s top division resumed behind closed doors. Here\u2019s his report: The teams come out one after the other, first home, then away. Pleasantly there are fewer theatrics and arguments: on the pitch \u2013 a purer football than before. The atmosphere, on the other hand, is very, very strange. When Augsburg equalise to make it 1-1, the goal jingle is played. But where 25,000 fans would normally sing along, there is now silence. More here: Today is Norwegian Constitution Day, which normally sees, in the words of today\u2019s AFP report, \u201cchildren take to the streets in parades across the country, ice creams and hot dogs are devoured, and the day culminates in a huge parade in \u2018bunad\u2019, a traditional heavy woollen costume, outside the royal palace in Oslo.\u201d Today the royal family waved at empty streets for the TV cameras, while parades were banned and gatherings limited to 50 people. In B\u00e6rum, a residential suburb of Oslo, the Evje school marching band played for the hospital and retirement homes, in front of small crowds respecting strict social distancing rules. \u201cIt was a bit strange, but fun,\u201d said Kaja Wang Andreassen who, aged 10, was making her debut on the flute. \u201cWe had to be even more careful than usual to stay in line and stay far apart from each other, even when the road got narrower.\u201d A steadfast tradition since it was introduced by novelist Bjornstjerne Bjornson in 1870, this was the first time in peacetime that the children\u2019s parades were cancelled. In several coastal towns, the parades were replaced this year by flotillas of hundreds of boats on the water. \u201cWe will remember today as a very special day,\u201d wrote 19-year-old Christine Ronnefeldt in Sunday\u2019s main daily Aftenposten. \u201cWe will remember this as the day we stayed so far away from one another, yet closer than ever.\u201d On a similar theme, here\u2019s Gaia Vince from a little earlier today: The Guardian\u2019s global environment editor, Jonathan Watts, has written about the possible effect of the coronavirus crisis on the world\u2019s airlines: \u201cThe political moment is now\u201d to address the climate risks posed by the aviation industry, analysts, insiders and campaigners say, as governments across the world weigh up bailouts for airlines grounded by the coronavirus pandemic. Rescue packages need to come with green strings, such as reduced carbon footprints and frequent flyer levies, they warn, or the sector will return to the path that has made it the fastest rising source of climate-wrecking carbon emissions over the past decade. More here: India has extended a nearly two-month-old lockdown by another two weeks with Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai and some other key regions still battling to control the rising curve of coronavirus infections, reports the Associated Press. The government-run National Disaster Management authority said in a statement on Sunday that fresh guidelines will be issued that keep in view the need to open up economic activity. Indian media reports said that travel by air, rail and metro will remain shut down until the end of May. Schools, hotels, restaurants, bars, shopping malls, cinemas and places of worship will also be closed nationally. On 4 May the government eased some restrictions, allowing reopening of neighbourhood shops and manufacturing and farming in rural areas. It also resumed running a limited number of trains, mainly to carry workers. The Health Ministry on Sunday reported a record jump of nearly 5,000 cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, raising the number of confirmed cases to 90,927, with 2,872 deaths. India had less than 500 positive cases and nine deaths when the lockdown was first imposed on 25 March. Benin is staging local elections, minus key opposition parties, today with authorities pushing ahead despite the coronavirus, reports AFP. The West African nation of 11 million this week lifted a raft of restrictions aimed at halting the spread of the virus. COVID-19 has caused 339 confirmed infections and two deaths in the country. The autonomous national election commission (CENA) made face masks mandatory for voters and enforced social distancing measures at polling stations. \u201cWe have received a lot of hydro-alcohol gels and masks for all voters,\u201d returning officer Mathieu Daki told AFP at N\u2019dali in the north of the country. In the economic capital Cotonou, where most coronavirus deaths have occurred, election officials ensured voters were more than a metre apart. However, not everyone appeared to have been reassured. In the city\u2019s 5th district election agent Dimitri Assani admitted voters were \u201cfew and far between\u201d. Donatien Sagbo Hounga wore a mask to enter the polling station, but said he was waiting \u201ctill there were no other voters in front of the election agents\u201d to move forward to cast his vote. \u201cIt may seem excessive but it\u2019s necessary,\u201d Hounga said. Campaigning has been limited to posters and media appearances as candidates were forced to call off rallies due to a ban on gatherings of over 50 people. Critics warned the health risks were too high for a vote that opponents of President Patrice Talon insist should not be happening in the first place. Talon sported a mask when he voted early in Cotonou\u2019s Zongo-Ehuzu area. In the city\u2019s first district Arnold Migan voted early in the morning. \u201cWith the threat from COVID-19 it\u2019s best to vote quickly and go home before a lot of people arrive,\u201d he said. Benin, seen as one of the region\u2019s most stable democracies, has been in political crisis since a disputed parliamentary poll last April sparked protests. Talon, a former business magnate who came to power in 2016, has been accused of a crackdown that drove key rivals into exile. Parties allied to the president won all the seats at the polls last year after opposition groups were effectively banned from standing, but turnout was only 25%. Now leading opposition parties again find themselves barred from the vote for control of 77 councils across the country. The exclusion drew a legal challenge from Talon opponent Sebastien Ajavon, a businessman living in exile after he was sentenced to prison on drug charges in Benin. The regional African Court of Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights ruled the vote should be suspended as it was not inclusive. But Benin disregarded the ruling and severed some ties with the court in protest at the decision. Opponents called on voters to boycott the poll over the political situation and the risks from coronavirus. Many among the electorate appeared set to heed the call to stay home given the result looks certain to go in favour of those backing Talon. In Cotonou\u2019s Cadjehoun area only about 30 people had voted by midday out of 400 registered there. Final results from the election are expected within a week. Hello, Simon Burnton here, taking back control for a couple of hours. Here\u2019s some football news, with Uefa still absolutely convinced that completing their major club competitions by August is not just a long shot: BP\u2019s new chief executive said the impact of the coronavirus pandemic has deepened his commitment to shrinking the oil giant\u2019s carbon footprint to zero. Bernard Looney, who took the helm of the oil giant in February, said he is \u201cmore convinced than ever\u201d that BP must embrace the energy transition following the collapse of global oil markets. He told the Guardian that his commitment to steering BP towards its net-zero carbon ambitions, set out earlier this year, is \u201cdeeper\u201d due to the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak. I am more convinced than ever that this is the right thing to do, and we need to crack on with it. The pandemic only adds to the challenge that already exists for oil in the medium to long term. Some energy economists believe demand for oil may never recover to its levels before the pandemic if changes to business travel and commuting remain after the lockdown ends. This raises serious questions over the business model of major oil companies which are already under pressure due to tougher climate action and the rise of renewable energy. \u201cWe\u2019re all living and working differently right now. Not all of that will stick, but some of it will stick for sure. The question I have is whether consumers will consume less, and I think there is a possibility that they will,\u201d Looney said. Confirmed Covid-19 cases in Brazil have surpassed the total in Italy and are surging in Mexico and Peru as Latin America struggles to contain its fast-growing coronavirus outbreak. Brazil announced nearly 15,000 new infections on Saturday, taking its total to more than 230,000, the fourth-largest confirmed caseload after the US, Russia and the UK. Its true number of infections is feared to be much greater, with the country carrying out fewer than a half a million tests by the start of last week, compared with about 1.9m in Spain and Italy. The country\u2019s response has been hamstrung by the resignation of two successive federal health ministers in the past month who have complained of inaction and interference by the president, Jair Bolsonaro, a rightwing populist who continues to be critical of the shutdown measures implemented by Brazil\u2019s state governments. \u201cUnemployment, hunger and misery will be the future of those who support the tyranny of total isolation,\u201d Bolsonaro tweeted, a day after Nelson Teich resigned on Friday after less than a month as health minister. Brazil is expected to post its biggest annual economic contraction this year since records began over a century ago. Egypt will bring forward the start of its curfew by four hours to 5pm and halt public transport during the six-day Eid holiday from 24 May as it seeks to curb the spread of Covid-19. Shops, restaurants and parks will also be closed for the holiday at the end of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan, and restrictions on citizens\u2019 movements will be extended for a further two weeks afterwards, the prime minister, Mostafa Madbouly, said. The city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak originated in China, conducted 222,675 nucleic acid tests on 16 May, the local health authority said, nearly doubling from a day earlier. Wuhan kicked off a campaign on 14 May to look for asymptomatic carriers - people who are infected but show no outward sign of illness - after confirming last weekend its first cluster of Covid-19 infections since its release from lockdown on 8 April. The number of tests carried out on 16 May in the city of 11 million residents was more than the 186,400 tests conducted on 14-15 May, and was also the highest since the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission started publishing the data on 21 February. Wuhan is conducting the testing on a voluntary basis. No confirmed cases with symptoms were identified 14-16 May, though 28 new asymptomatic carriers were found, according to daily reports published by the Wuhan health authority. Less than a year after passing a secularism law forcing certain members of religious minorities to uncover their heads and faces, Quebec is now debating whether to force everybody to put masks on. As the province at the centre of Canada\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, Quebec is currently \u201cstrongly recommending\u201d that citizens wear masks \u2013 but the measure will not be mandatory. Asked why not, Horacio Arruda, the province\u2019s public health director, told reporters: \u201cYou need to have a good argument for infringing on individual rights for the sake of a collective right.\u201d But such arguments ring hollow to Nour Farhat, a Montreal lawyer whose dreams of being a Crown prosecutor were dashed after the Quebec government passed legislation last year barring certain public sector workers from wearing religious symbols at work. The law \u2013 known as Bill 21 \u2013 mainly affects Muslim women working in education, law and other public sectors. Farhat said: Bill 21 violates the rights of religious minorities without a real or urgent situation. And now that we\u2019re in a real and urgent situation, the premier cares about violating people\u2019s rights. For them, it was always OK to violate the rights of religious minorities. Bill 21 has always permitted masks for medical reasons, and government media representatives say their hesitancy on masks is not related to that law. But head and face coverings carry a certain political weight in Quebec. Recent years have seen multiple instances of people trying to snatch hijabs from women\u2019s heads in the province. And only last year did Montreal reverse a seven-year ban on people wearing masks at protests. The growth of new coronavirus cases in Russia is stabilising, a top health official has said, as the daily tally fell under 10,000 for the third time this week. The country has the world\u2019s second highest number of infections at 281,752, topped only by the United States. On Sunday, it announced new cases had dropped below 10,000 for the third day this week at 9,709. The head of Russia\u2019s public health watchdog, Anna Popova, said in an interview on Rossiya-1 television: We\u2019ve moved towards the level of stability that we\u2019ve all been waiting for. I would say that of today, we have halted the growth [in the number of cases]. For the last 10 or 11 days now, we haven\u2019t seen additional growth or it\u2019s been very small. Stabilisation can be seen over the whole country. All the regions have managed to stabilise the situation. The state watchdog Rospotrebnadzor announces daily virus numbers and is working to develop a viable vaccine at its Vector virus research centre in Siberia. Popova said it was too early to say if Russians can make plans for summer travel, saying \u201cwe need to look at the next two or three weeks\u201d. Russia on Saturday announced the highest daily death rate at 119. It has confirmed a total of 2,631 deaths, 10 times fewer than Britain, France, Italy and Spain. Critics have cast doubt on Russia\u2019s low official mortality rate, accusing authorities of under-reporting deaths in order to play down the scale of the crisis. Russian health officials say one of the reasons the count is lower is that only deaths directly caused by the virus are being included. The deputy prime minister, Tatiana Golikova, denied any manipulation of numbers on Sunday, saying hospitals had a financial interest in identifying coronavirus cases since they get allocated more money to treat such patients. \u201cFrom the economic point of view, any hospital should have an interest in diagnosing more Covid cases,\u201d she said. Authorities say that since the virus came later to Russia, the country had more time to prepare hospital beds and launch wide-scale testing to slow its spread. Madagascar has registered its first coronavirus death, of a 57-year-old medical worker who suffered from diabetes and high blood pressure, the national Covid-19 taskforce said. Taskforce spokeswoman Hanta Danielle Vololontiana said in a televised statement that the man had died on Saturday night. \u201cA man died from Covid-19 in Madagascar ... he is 57 years old and a member of the medical staff,\u201d she said. Ministers and officials from every nation will meet via video link on Monday for the annual world health assembly, which is expected to be dominated by efforts to stop rich countries monopolising drugs and future vaccines against Covid-19. As some countries buy up drugs thought to be useful against the coronavirus, causing global shortages, and the Trump administration does deals with vaccine companies to supply America first, there is dismay among public health experts and campaigners who believe it is vital to pull together to end the pandemic. While the US and China face off, the EU has taken the lead. The leaders of Italy, France, Germany and Norway, together with the European commission and council, called earlier this month for any innovative tools, therapeutics or vaccines to be shared equally and fairly. \u201cIf we can develop a vaccine that is produced by the world, for the whole world, this will be a unique global public good of the 21st century,\u201d they said in a statement. The sole resolution before the assembly this year is an EU proposal for a voluntary patent pool. Drug and vaccine companies would then be under pressure to give up the monopoly that patents allow them on their inventions, which means they can charge high prices, so that all countries can make or buy affordable versions. In the weeks of negotiations leading up to the meeting, which is scheduled to last for less than a day, there has been a dispute over the language of the resolution. Countries with major pharmaceutical companies argue they need patents to guarantee sufficiently high prices in wealthy nations to recoup their research and development costs. Even more fraught have been attempts to reinforce countries\u2019 existing rights to break drug and vaccine company patent monopolies if they need to for the sake of public health. A hard-fought battle over Aids drugs 20 years ago led to the World Trade Organization\u2019s Doha declaration on trade-related intellectual property (Trips) in favour of access to medicines for all, but the US, which has some of the world\u2019s biggest drug companies, has strongly opposed wording that would encourage the use of Trips. Campaigners say the resolution expected to be passed by the world health assembly\u2019s 198 member states is along the right lines, but too weakly worded. Jamie Love of Knowledge Ecology International said: In a global crisis like this, that has such a massive impact on everyone, you would expect the WHO governing body to have the backbone to say no monopolies in this pandemic. It\u2019s one thing for a country to use its economic clout to buy preferential access to drugs or vaccines. It\u2019s another to prevent others from manufacturing and expanding global supply. I\u2019m going to step away from the blog for a little while. My colleague Jessica Murray will take the wheel in the meantime. If you would like to get in touch with her, you can do so by email here or on Twitter here. Scientists in Hong Kong have established that face masks do reduce transmission of coronavirus (at least among hamsters). This just in from AFP: Tests on hamsters reveal the widespread use of facemasks reduces transmission of the deadly coronavirus, a team of leading experts in Hong Kong said Sunday. The research by the University of Hong Kong is some of the first to specifically investigate whether masks can stop symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers from infecting others. Led by Professor Yuen Kwok-yung, one of the world\u2019s top coronavirus experts, the team placed hamsters that were artificially infected with the disease next to healthy animals. Surgical masks were placed between the two cages with air flow travelling from the infected animals to the healthy ones. The researchers found non-contact transmission of the virus could be reduced by more than 60 percent when the masks were used. Two thirds of the healthy hamsters were infected within a week if no masks were applied. The infection rate plunged to just over 15 percent when surgical masks were put on the cage of the infected animals and by about 35 percent when placed on the cage with the healthy hamsters. Those that did become infected were also found to have less of the virus within their bodies than those infected without a mask. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that the effect of masking the infected, especially when they are asymptomatic - or symptomatic - it\u2019s much more important than anything else,\u201d Yuen told reporters. Madagascar has reported the first death of a patient suffering from the novel coronavirus, nearly two months after the virus was first detected in the country. The Indian ocean island, which has reported 304 cases, hit the headlines last month over a home-grown herbal concoction, a tonic drink derived from artemisia - a plant with proven efficacy in malaria treatment - and other indigenous herbs, that President Andry Rajoelina claimeds can cure people infected with the virus. The World Health Organisation has warned against \u201cadopting a product that has not been taken through tests to see its efficacy\u201d. Yesterday Kenya\u2019s President Uhuru Kenyatta announced that the country\u2019s coronavirus measures would be extended and its borders with Tanzania and Somalia closed. \u201cAmong the positive cases that have been registered in the country this week, a total of 43 cases have recently crossed the border from neighbouring Somalia and Tanzania,\u201d Kenyatta said in a televised address. Kenyatta also said the national 7pm-5am curfew would be extended until June 6, as would a ban on entering or exiting the cities of Nairobi, Mombasa, Kilifi, Kwale and Mandera. \u201cA brutal and unforgiving enemy is at our wall. He is trying to gain entrance using every door and every window,\u201d Kenyatta said. He also announced that truck drivers would be tested before entering Kenya, saying that border tests had identified 78 infected drivers, all turned back. Today, some nurses have been doing Zumba: Spain has recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months. According to the latest figures from the health ministry, 87 people have died from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, down from 102 the day before. The country has confirmed 231,350 cases of the virus using PCR tests, and reported 27,650 deaths. Brazil\u2019s health ministry announced 14,919 new cases, taking the country\u2019s total to 233,142, ahead of Spain and Italy, making theirs the fourth largest outbreak in the world. Mainland China reported five new confirmed Covid-19 cases for May 16, down from eight the previous day, the National Health Commission has said in a statement. Two of the five confirmed cases were so-called imported infections, while three were locally transmitted in northeastern Chinese city of Jilin. Japan also confirmed five new cases. The Greek government is poised to announce that restaurants and other eateries can now open on 25 May, one week ahead of schedule. Shopping malls and department stores will also be allowed to open tomorrow, two weeks ahead of schedule. By law staff and customers will be obliged to wear face coverings. Shopping malls have reopened in Thailand for the first time since their lockdown. Four out of five merchants at a major fruit market in Peru have tested positive for coronavirus, revealing shocking levels of infection \u2013 and prompting fears that Latin America\u2019s traditional trading centres may have helped spread Covid-19 across the region. Seventy-nine per cent of stall-holders in Lima\u2019s wholesale fruit market tested positive for Covid-19, while spot tests at five other large fresh food markets in the city revealed at least half were carrying the virus. China has asked trading firms and food processors to boost inventories of grains and oilseeds as a possible second wave of coronavirus cases and worsening infection rates elsewhere raise concerns about global supply lines. Both state-run and private grain traders as well as food producers were urged to procure higher volumes of soybeans, soyoil and corn during calls with China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce in recent days, three trade sources told Reuters. Barack Obama attacked the Trump administration\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic during a speech on Saturday. The comments are a rare rebuke of a sitting president from one of his predecessors, and come in the midst of a pandemic that has had devastating and disproportionate effects on communities of color in the United States. The Philippine government has called for vigilance against the coronavirus, a day after hordes of people trooped to shopping malls and ignored safety protocols, as authorities began loosening a two-month lockdown. Photos and videos showing shoppers in some malls in the capital Manila violating physical distancing rules went viral on Saturday, drawing widespread public criticism and alarm, prompting the government to issue fresh health warnings. \u201cWe advise the public not to be complacent and to follow health protocols set by authorities after we received reports of people who trooped to the malls with complete disregard of social/physical distancing measures,\u201d presidential spokesman Harry Roque said. The government warned malls would be closed again if they do not strictly implement physical distancing and crowd control measures. My colleague Jessica Glenza has factchecked some of the most commonly repeated claims that are being made about the coronavirus: My colleague Sam Jones has filed this update from Spain: Spain has recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months. According to the latest figures from the health ministry, 87 people have died from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, down from 102 the day before. The country has confirmed 231,350 cases of the virus using PCR tests, and reported 27,650 deaths. On Saturday the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, announced that his Socialist-led coalition would be seeking a final, month-long extension of the state of emergency that underpins one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe. \u201cThe path that we are taking is the only one possible,\u201d said Sanchez. The government secured the current extension, which expires on 24 May, despite fierce opposition from the conservative People\u2019s party and the far-right Vox party. Both parties claim the state of emergency is excessive and no longer necessary, but the government says Spain\u2019s hard-won gains against the virus must be safeguarded. S\u00e1nchez is likely to face another uphill struggle as he prepares to ask MPs to back the final extension in congress later this week. Around 70% of the country will be in the second phase of de-escalation by Monday, meaning people can shop in small stores without an appointment, meet in groups of up to 10, and eat or drink in cafe and restaurant terraces, which are operating at 50% capacity. Despite some loosening of restrictions, the Madrid region and the Barcelona metropolitan area - two of the hardest-hit parts of Spain - remain in the first phase of the de-escalation. In Thailand shopping centres have been allowed to open today for the first time since their lockdown, and have had plenty of customers. If you\u2019re spending the day at home (again), dreaming of summer, sand and sea, this European post-lockdown holiday update might come in handy: A few updates from around the world: Spain has declared 87 new deaths from coronavirus today, down from 102 yesterday (and the first time in two months that fewer than 100 deaths have been reported), and 652 new confirmed cases. They have now had 231,350 confirmed cases of Covid-19, and 27,650 deaths. Mainland China reported five new confirmed Covid-19 cases for May 16, down from eight the previous day, the National Health Commission has said in a statement. Two of the five confirmed cases were so-called imported infections, while three were locally transmitted in northeastern Chinese city of Jilin. The number of confirmed cases in the mainland now stands at 82,947 and the death toll at 4,634. In Indonesia there have been 489 new confirmed cases and 59 deaths. They have had 17,514 confirmed cases and 1,148 deaths overall. Malaysia\u2019s health ministry reported 22 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, bringing the cumulative total to 6,894. The country reported no new deaths, with total fatalities remaining at 113. Meanwhile in France a drive-in mass has been held in Chalons-en-Champagne, near Reims: As reported by Helena Smith earlier, in Greece church services have been permitted today for the first time since their lockdown started. Here\u2019s a photograph from this morning: Here\u2019s Shaun Walker, the Guardian\u2019s central and eastern Europe correspondent, on the world leaders who are too macho for masks: \u201cAppearing to play it safe contradicts a core principle of masculinity: show no weakness,\u201d according to Peter Glick, a scientist who has co-authored research on how so-called \u201cmasculinity contest culture\u201d poisons work environments. All the leaders have built brands as strongmen offering maverick solutions, and want to be seen as recovery presidents sweeping the illness aside, even if the virus has other ideas. Trump and his vice-president, Mike Pence, have both refused to take what many scientists agree is the simplest precaution, and wear a mask. Even as cases of coronavirus spread inside the White House, the president has balked at the idea: \u201cI think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, I don\u2019t know, somehow I don\u2019t see it for myself. I just don\u2019t. Maybe I\u2019ll change my mind,\u201d he has said. More here: The Philippines\u2019 department of health has reported 208 new cases of coronavirus, and seven more fatalities. They have now had 12,513 confirmed cases, and 824 deaths. Japan has confirmed five new cases today. Robin McKie, the Observer\u2019s science and environment editor, and the Observer\u2019s political editor Toby Helm , have written this report on the potential risks involved in the reopening of schools: The most striking feature about the impact of Covid-19 on children is how little research has been conducted in the field. Only a handful of studies have been carried out across the world, and scientists are divided over their interpretation. As a result, politicians are now being asked to decide if they should open schools in order to protect children\u2019s mental health and education without any clear scientific guidance about the risks of triggering a second wave of Covid-19 and infecting school staff in the process. It is known that children are less likely to become ill if infected with the coronavirus but researchers are still unsure how easily they can infect others. Some research indicates that children are far less likely to become infected compared with adults but other studies suggest that when they do become infected, they carry as much viral load as an adult, and therefore pose a real risk of passing the virus on to others. The situation was summed up by a senior Labour frontbencher last week: \u201cEither you put the education of children at risk by keeping schools closed, or you take a risk with their safety. There is no easy answer.\u201d More here: Here is the latest from Greece, from my colleague Helena Smith. Greece is continuing to make headway in its return to normality with the government poised to announce that restaurants and other eateries can now open on 25 May, one week ahead of schedule. The news has seen the owners of various tavernas in Athens, and especially in the iconic district of Plaka beneath the ancient Acropolis, rush to prepare their premises for the summer. Shopping malls and department stores will also be allowed to open tomorrow, two weeks ahead of schedule. By law staff and customers will be obliged to wear face coverings. With the nation hit by the first heatwave of the year, the committee of experts advising the centre right government also allowed over 500 organised beaches to open this weekend in what is seen as a test run for the tourism industry. Churches were similarly open to worshippers today for the first time in two months. But social distancing rules for faithful will be strict: guidelines permit one person per 10 sq meters of every house of worship. Greek authorities applied drastic measures to contain the spread of coronavirus before the country recorded its first fatality, first closing schools in the western Peloponnese on March 4th. At last count, Friday, there had been 2,810 confirmed infections and 160 fatalities. Russia has reported 9,709 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus today, a rise from 9,200 new cases reported on Saturday. Russia\u2019s coronavirus taskforce said the overall number of cases nationwide stood at 281,752. It added that 94 people had died over the last 24 hours, bringing the official death toll from the virus to 2,631. Move over Captain Tom, there\u2019s a new lap-completing centenarian in town. In Canada 101-year-old John Hillman, a second world war veteran who, like Moore, served in Burma and wears the Burma Star, yesterday completed 101 laps of the courtyard of his retirement home. \u201cI\u2019m going to have a little rest,\u201d he said after ending his quest. \u201cI\u2019ve just had a scotch, which was quite delightful and I\u2019m on top of the world. I have done it, and I\u2019m very proud of having done it. I could do some more.\u201d He had hoped to raise $101,000 (\u00a359,000, or $71,600 US) for Save the Children Canada\u2019s Covid-19 relief fund, but has so far managed $154,521. His fundraising page is here. The solution to the coronavirus may have been staring us in the face this whole time, lazily chewing on a carrot. Surely the finest opening sentence of the day/week/month/whatever. Here\u2019s the rest: An update from Singapore, where 682 new infections of the new coronavirus have been registered, its health ministry said on Sunday, taking the city-state\u2019s total to 28,038 cases. The vast majority of the newly infected people are migrant workers living in dormitories, the ministry said in a statement. Four are permanent residents. Morning/evening/whatever-it-is-where-you-are everyone. This is Simon Burnton taking on the live blog for the next few hours. If you have seen any stories that deserve our attention, or if you have any tips, comments or suggestions for our coverage then please let me know by sending me a message either to @Simon_Burnton on Twitter or via email. Thanks! That\u2019s all from me - I\u2019m now handing over to my colleague Simon Burnton, who will keep you updated over the next few hours. Four out of five merchants at a major fruit market in Peru have tested positive for coronavirus, revealing shocking levels of infection \u2013 and prompting fears that Latin America\u2019s traditional trading centres may have helped spread Covid-19 across the region. Seventy-nine per cent of stall-holders in Lima\u2019s wholesale fruit market tested positive for Covid-19, while spot tests at five other large fresh food markets in the city revealed at least half were carrying the virus. The results came as local authorities from Mexico City to Rio de Janeiro struggle to enforce social distancing and sanitary measures at wholesale and retail markets, which are mainstays of local economies. Read the Guardian\u2019s full report from Dan Collyns in Lima, Joe Parkin Daniels in Bogot\u00e1, Dom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro and David Agren in Mexico City. China has asked trading firms and food processors to boost inventories of grains and oilseeds as a possible second wave of coronavirus cases and worsening infection rates elsewhere raise concerns about global supply lines, Reuters reports. Both state-run and private grain traders as well as food producers were urged to procure higher volumes of soybeans, soyoil and corn during calls with China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce in recent days, three trade sources told Reuters. \u201cThere is a possibility of a breakdown in supply pipelines due to the coronavirus infections. For example, a port of origin or destination might shut down,\u201d said a senior trader at one of China\u2019s leading food processors, which was on a call last week with authorities to discuss purchases. \u201cThey have advised us to increase stocks, keep supplies higher than we usually have. Things are not looking good in Brazil,\u201d he added, referring to China\u2019s main supplier of soybeans and a key meat exporter where the number of coronavirus cases has surpassed those in Spain and Italy. A second source in China who was briefed by a person who attended one of the meetings said China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce met with some state companies on Tuesday to discuss how to guarantee supplies during the pandemic. \u201cOne of the main concerns is how the epidemic in South America might impact supplies (of beans) to China,\u201d the source said. China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce did not respond to a fax seeking comments on plans to increase food stocks. Around the world countries are loosening lockdown measures, while China has reported its highest level of internal travel since February. Here is our global report on the latest developments: China\u2019s commercial hub of Shanghai announced the restart of classes for younger students amid falling virus cases, while New Orleans\u2019 famed restaurants have been allowed to reopen with a limited number of diners. China\u2019s airline regulator also reported numbers of flights had returned to 60% of pre-outbreak levels, exceeding 10,000 per day for the first time since 1 February. No new deaths have been reported in a month in the world\u2019s second-largest economy, where the coronavirus was first detected late last year. China reported just five new cases on Sunday, while South Korea recorded 13, raising hopes that a new outbreak linked to nightclubs in Seoul may be waning. Brazil\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases rose past those of Spain and Italy, making the country\u2019s outbreak the fourth largest in the world. Brazil\u2019s health ministry announced 14,919 new cases on Saturday, taking the total to 233,142, behind the United States, Russia and the United Kingdom. Barack Obama attacked the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, stating that many of the country\u2019s leaders \u201caren\u2019t even pretending to be in charge\u201d. Australia warned China\u2019s \u201cunpredictable\u201d trade interventions may force its producers to sell to other markets. After Australia called for an independent investigation into the origins of Covid-19, the Chinese ambassador in Australia, Cheng Jingye, threatened a consumer boycott against Australian goods. The number of coronavirus cases in Mexico has risen to 47,144, while the country\u2019s death toll has increased to 5,045. The governments plans to reopen parts of the economy from Monday, despite concerns that the country\u2019s outbreak has not yet peaked. Millions of casual labourers and domestic workers remain stranded across India after they abruptly lost their incomes when the country was placed under lockdown. The World Health Organization has warned countries ending lockdown that now should be a \u201ctime for preparation, not celebration\u201d. More countries have begun easing restrictions. This includes Thailand, which has allowed shopping malls to reopen and shortened a nighttime curfew. New Orleans has also allowed malls and retail stores to operate, while New York has allowed horse racing tracks to reopen. Victoria, Australia\u2019s second most-populous state, announced that from 1 June, cafes, restaurants, and the dining areas of pubs and clubs will reopen with up to 20 patrons indoors. The British government will invest up to \u00a393m to bring forward construction of a new vaccine manufacturing centre, PA media reports. The funding will ensure the new centre opens in summer 2021, a year ahead of schedule. The Vaccines Manufacturing and Innovation Centre (VMIC) is a key component of the UK government\u2019s programme to ensure that once a coronavirus vaccine is available, it can be rolled out quickly in mass quantities, according to the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. The not-for-profit facility on the Harwell science and innovation campus in Oxfordshire will have the capacity to produce enough doses for the entire UK population in as little as six months. In Rio de Janeiro state, which has the second highest number of deaths in Brazil, most hospitals accepting Covid-19 patients have run out of intensive care beds, Associated Press reports. According to the states health secretary, as of Thursday, 369 people thought to have the virus were waiting to be transferred to an ICU. AP reports from the Sao Jose facility, which was just inaugurated, on May 4, and where already 90% of its 128 beds are occupied. More than 15,000 Brazilians have died from the disease so far, though many experts say the figure is probably significantly higher, with cases missed because of insufficient testing. In recent days, more than 800 people have been added to the death toll every 24 hours and the crisis peak has yet to hit Latin Americas largest nation, the experts say. President Jair Bolsonaro has consistently downplayed the pandemic, calling the coronavirus a little flu and fiercely criticizing state governors and mayors who have closed businesses, introduced lockdowns and recommended stay-at-home measures. Bolsonaro has instead advocated for everyone who doesnt belong to at-risk groups to return to work so the economy doesnt collapse. Thailand reported three new coronavirus cases on Sunday and no new deaths. All new infections are among Thai students who have recently been repatriated. A total of 3,028 cases and 56 fatalities have now been recorded in the country. Australian trade minister Simon Birmingham has warned China\u2019s \u201cunpredictable\u201d trade interventions may force Australian producers to sell to other markets, my colleague Paul Karp reports: The trade minister told ABC\u2019s Insiders on Sunday that Australia reserves its right to take China to the World Trade Organisation, and revealed he is still yet to hear back from his Chinese counterpart about the growing trade dispute. He said his call \u201cought to be returned\u201d. After Australia called for an independent investigation into the origins of Covid-19, the Chinese ambassador in Australia, Cheng Jingye, threatened a consumer boycott against Australian goods. Since then, China has raised an 18-month-old dispute relating to Australia\u2019s barley exports and imposed a ban on beef from four abattoirs. On Sunday Birmingham said that he can understand why \u2013 given the ambassador\u2019s \u201cvery unhelpful remarks\u201d \u2013 links have been drawn and questions asked about whether the issues are related. But Birmingham said Australia will \u201ctake at face value\u201d China\u2019s claims the trade disputes are genuine and respond in good faith. \u201cOur government has now lodged a comprehensive response in Beijing to the Chinese authorities in relation to their claims of dumping of barley in the Chinese market,\u201d he said. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 583 to 174,355, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Sunday. The reported death toll rose by 33 to 7,914. Germany has begun easing restrictions, and on Friday began to allow restaurants to reopen for the first time in two months, so long as they obey physical distancing. People from two separate households can share a table, but have to keep a distance of 1.5m from each other. Waiting staff are required to wear face coverings, while diners are encouraged to do so. Berlin\u2019s senate has also strongly advised restaurants to record customer details, so that they can be traced if an infection is identified. Germany has also dropped a two-week quarantine requirement imposed in March for passengers arriving from other EU states. Britain, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland are all included in the new arrangement. Quarantine measures will be reimposed if the infection rate rises elsewhere, officials said. Germans with holiday homes in Mallorca are clamouring to return to the sun-soaked island as the coronavirus lockdowns ease, but Spanish authorities are pushing back, Agence France-Presse reports. Several hundred Germans have in recent weeks sent pleading, sometimes angry letters to the regional government of the Balearic Islands asking them to allow foreign property owners to return to their second homes. The protesters have warned that keeping them away from their properties could make them think twice about their investments on the island. Mallorca has long been one of the most popular destinations for Germans abroad, so much so that it is sometimes jokingly referred to as Germany\u2019s \u201c17th state\u201d. Some 4.5 million Germans visited Mallorca last year to enjoy its idyllic beaches and bustling nightlife. But the Spanish government is refusing to budge, wary of moving too quickly as it cautiously relaxes lockdown measures in one of Europe\u2019s worst-affected countries. To limit the risk of a second wave of infections, Madrid has limited air and sea arrivals to Spanish nationals and permanent residents only, as well as people in certain professions. All international arrivals also have to self-quarantine for 14 days. The quarantine measure is expected to stay in place for the duration of Spain\u2019s state of emergency, which Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez aims to extend until late June. Victoria, Australia\u2019s second most-populous state, has announced plans to ease restrictions. From 1 June, cafes, restaurants, and the dining areas of pubs and clubs will reopen with up to 20 patrons indoors, premier Dan Andrews said. Three weeks later, on 22 June, that limit will go up to 50 patrons. In mid-July, it will increase again to 100 patrons. Andrews says that citizens will still need to abide by distancing rules if this is to happen. Restrictions on gyms or outdoor gatherings will remain in place. Andrews added that by mid-July, as hospitality reopens, the government messaging will change from \u201cstay home\u201d to \u201cstay safe\u201d. The policy of \u201cif you can work from home, work from home\u201d will not change, he said. The Indian Express newspaper has reported on the plight of migrant workers who remain stranded across India. Millions of casual labourers and domestic workers abruptly lost their incomes when the country was placed under lockdown on 24 March. Many live hand to mouth and had no choice but to return home when the quarantine measures were introduced, but were unable to do so because transport had been halted. Workers have resorted to walking in the searing heat for hundreds of miles to get home. Others have sought refugee in government shelters. On Saturday, at least 23 laborers died in northern India when a truck they were traveling in smashed into a stationary truck on a highway. Last week, a train crashed into a group of tired workers who fell asleep on the tracks while walking back home in western Maharashtra state, killing 16. In the US, where more than more than 88,000 people have died in the coronavirus outbreak, some leaders have begun to ease quarantine measures. New Orleans took its first steps to loosen restrictions that have been in place for two months, one day after the rest of Louisiana did the same, Associated Press reports. The city is restricting buildings to 25% of capacity, like the rest of the state, but also requires restaurants, nail salons and other businesses to take customers by reservation. The city has capped the number of people allowed in houses of worship and movie theaters at fewer than 100. Malls and retail stores can reopen, but casinos, video poker, live entertainment and bars are still closed. Some restaurateurs decided to try reopening. Others planned to stick to takeout or stay closed all together. Meanwhile, New York governor Andrew Cuomo said horse racing tracks and the Watkins Glen International auto track can reopen with no crowds, no fans. He also said he could envision a return of Major League Baseball in New York, the centre of the US outbreak, also without spectators. On Saturday, Barack Obama attacked the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, stating that many of the country\u2019s leaders \u201caren\u2019t even pretending to be in charge\u201d. Without naming Trump directly, Obama said during an online commencement address to graduates of historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs): Let\u2019s be honest, a disease like this just spotlights the underlying inequalities and extra burdens that black communities have historically had to deal with in this country... We see it in the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on our communities.... More than anything, this pandemic has fully, finally torn back the curtain that so many of the folks in charge know what they\u2019re doing. A lot of them aren\u2019t even pretending to be in charge. Here is the Guardian\u2019s full report on his comments. The number of coronavirus cases in Mexico has risen to 47,144, while the country\u2019s death toll has increased to 5,045, health authorities said. The governments plans to reopen parts of the economy from Monday, despite concerns that the country\u2019s outbreak has not yet peaked and that official figures underestimate the true scale of the outbreak. Mainland China recorded five new confirmed coronavirus cases on Saturday, down from eight the previous day, according to the National Health Commission (NHC). Two of the five confirmed cases are linked to foreign travel, while three are locally transmitted in northeastern Jilin Province. The number of new asymptomatic cases of the coronavirus fell to 12 from 13, the NHC said. The number of confirmed cases in the mainland stands at 82,947 and the death toll at 4,634 In Thailand, shopping malls will reopen today and a nighttime curfew will be shortened by one hour, to 2300 to 0400, from 2200 to 0400. The country is beginning to relax restrictions after reporting single-digit increases of infections from the new coronavirus this month. Parks, hair salons, markets and restaurants have also been allowed to reopen over recent weeks, provided that measures such as temperature scanning and social distancing are in place. On Saturday, the country extended a ban on international passenger flights until the end of June. Thailand has recorded a total of 3,025 cases and 56 deaths. Brazil\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases rose past those of Spain and Italy on Saturday, making the outbreak the fourth largest in the world, Reuters reports. Brazil\u2019s health ministry registered 14,919 new confirmed cases in the prior 24 hours, taking the total to 233,142, behind the United States, Russia and the United Kingdom. Brazil has done just a fraction of the testing seen in those three countries. The global distinction is likely to pile pressure on President Jair Bolsonaro, who lost his second health minister in a month on Friday as he defies public health experts and calls for widespread use of unproven drugs. Bolsonaro has been fiercely critical of the orders by many of Brazil\u2019s state governors for strict social isolation and quarantine to combat the spread of the virus, including the closure of schools, shops and restaurants. Bolsonaro argues that the toll on the economy is becoming unbearable and businesses must be allowed to reopen as soon as possible. The government now expects Brazil will post its biggest annual economic contraction this year since records began over a century ago. Nationwide testing in Brazil still lags far behind European nations. Brazil had processed nearly 338,000 novel coronavirus tests in official labs by the beginning of the week, according to the health ministry. Another 145,000 tests were under analysis or waiting in line. By contrast, Italy and Spain have each run some 1.9 million official diagnostic tests for the virus. Hello this is Rebecca Ratcliffe, bringing you the latest global coronavirus updates. There are now 4,629,575 cases of Covid-19 recorded globally and 311,363 deaths according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. In the US where 1,466,682 infections have been reported, Barack Obama has attacked the Trump administration\u2019s response to the crisis, stating that a lot of the federal leadership \u201caren\u2019t even pretending to be in charge.\u201d He also highlighted the disproportionate effects of the pandemic on communities of colour in the United States. In other recent developments: The World Health Organization has warned countries ending lockdown that now should be a \u201ctime for preparation, not celebration\u201d. Italy announced the easing of a series of restrictions, including the reopening of all shops, bars, restaurants and hairdressers, from 18 May, and free travel to Italy for people coming from EU countries from 3 June without having to undergo quarantine. The Spanish government has said it will seek to extend its state of emergency for the last time until late June, as the country\u2019s daily death toll reached a near eight-week low. The Israeli government approved the resumption of school for all grades in areas that are not considered coronavirus hotspots, starting on Sunday. Beaches will officially open on Wednesday. Dozens of people were detained in the Polish capital, Warsaw, during a protest by business owners against coronavirus restrictions. Nineteen protesters were arrested in London and police dispersed rallies in several German cities. Turkey\u2019s health ministry said 41 more people died from Covid-19 in the 24 hours to Saturday, bringing the death toll to 4,096. The daily death toll was the lowest registered since the end of March. Nepal reported its first coronavirus death late on Saturday, a 29-year-old woman who recently gave birth, as the total number of people infected in the country reached 281. Ireland recorded 92 more cases, the lowest daily number in nine weeks, with the total at 24,048. If you think we have missed a story or want to draw our attention to something please do get in touch.
