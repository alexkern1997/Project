The White House announced on Sunday that it was restricting travel from Brazil to the United States, two days after the South American nation became the world\u2019s No. 2 hotspot for coronavirus cases. In its original announcement, it said the restrictions would come into force on 28 May. UK volunteering soars during coronavirus crisis Ten million UK adults have been volunteering in their community during the coronavirus crisis, and most say they will carry on after the lockdown ends, according to new research. The study also found that Britons have been extending a financial helping hand to local businesses. More than \u00a31bn was spent on services and goods that people knew they would never be able to use during the pandemic, including payments to home cleaners and gardeners. The Irish Times reports that there were no new coronavirus deaths reported on Monday, for the first time since 21 March: The Department of Health reported 59 new confirmed cases of the virus however bringing the total number of known cases of the disease to 24,698. The death toll stands at 1,606. The State\u2019s chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said the declining number of new cases and reported deaths over the past week shows \u2018we have suppressed Covid-19 as a country.\u2019 [The Taoiseach, Leo] Varadkar tweeted: \u2018This is a day of hope. We will prevail.\u2019 Kentucky lockdown protesters condemned for hanging effigy of governor from tree Political leaders in Kentucky have condemned rightwing protesters against the state\u2019s measures to fight the coronavirus, after the demonstrators hanged an effigy of Democratic state governor Andy Beshear from a tree. The incident happened on Sunday during a protest in favor of gun rights and other mostly conservative causes. Several men produced a rope and an effigy and strung it from a tree outside the state capitol building in Frankfort. The state representative Charles Booker, who is African American and the Democratic party challenger for the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s seat in Kentucky in November, described the representation as \u201c vile and traumatic\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the threat on his life, it\u2019s the fact that they demonstrated an act rooted in our history of racism. I\u2019ve had family lynched in Kentucky,\u201d Booker added. There are more than 5.4m cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins university coronavirus tracker, which has counted a total of 5,467,945 confirmed infections. The death toll stands at 344,731. Dominic Cummings, the UK PM\u2019s aide, has said he does not regret breaching lockdown. Dominic Cummings, the chief of staff to Boris Johnson, admitted driving about 250 miles (400km) from his home during the UK\u2019s lockdown, but insisted he acted reasonably. Health authorities in Spain revised downward the country\u2019s death toll from the coronavirus by nearly 2,000, bringing the total number of deaths recorded to 26,834. A new system of gathering data had allowed them to identify cases that were counted twice and exclude deaths wrongly attributed to the virus, said Fernando Simon, the health ministry\u2019s emergencies coordinator. About 15,000 Rohingya refugees are now under coronavirus quarantine in Bangladesh\u2019s vast camps, officials said Monday, as the number of confirmed infections among them rose to 29.Health experts have long warned that the virus could race through the cramped settlements, housing almost a million Muslims who fled violence in Myanmar, and officials had restricted movement to the area in April. The World Health Organization has said it will temporarily drop hydroxychloroquine from its study into coronavirus treatments. Director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the decision was made in light research that showed people taking it were at higher risk of early death. Greece took another step towards normality as it reinstated ferry links with islands and allowed restaurants, cafes and bars to reopen. The moves, designed to kickstart the country\u2019s tourist industry ahead of seasonal hotels reopening on 15 June, following almost three months of enforced closure. Spain will lift its quarantine requirement for people entering the country from 1 July, the government confirmed. At the moment, travellers from overseas are required to undergo a 14-day self-isolation on arrival. On Saturday the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said the country would reopen to tourists from July. Italy reported its fewest number of new coronavirus cases since early March. Authorities confirmed the deaths of 92 more people, bringing the total death toll from the pandemic to 32,877. New infections grew by 300, down from 531 on Sunday, with zero new cases registered in five regions. Sweden\u2019s top epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, defended his country\u2019s outbreak strategy as the number of people to have died after catching the virus passed 4,000. Critics have accused Swedish authorities of gambling with citizens\u2019 lives by not imposing strict stay-at-home measures.

Two of the highest profile fashion houses are planning to cut back on how many collections a year they will launch, the Associated Press reports. Gucci and Saint Laurent will leave the fashion calendar behind, with its relentless four-times-a-year rhythm, which sees the industry shuttle between global capitals for runway shows. The coronavirus lockdown has hit luxury fashion houses on their bottom lines, and has also given pause to rethink the pace of fashion, offering the possibility to return to less hectic, more considered periods of creativity and production \u2014 and perhaps consumption. Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele imagines a twice yearly appointments \u2014 one in the fall and one in the spring \u2014 to present collections. \u201cTwo appointments a year are more than enough to give time to form a creative thought, and to give more time to this system,\u201d Michele said in a video conference on Monday Saint Laurent hasn\u2019t articulated its intentions, but said in a statement last month that it would \u201ctake control\u201d of the fashion schedule \u201cconscious of the current circumstances and its waves of radical change.\u201d Belgian and Polish politicians are claiming that they are far better placed to deal with any second wave of coronavirus, Reuters reports. After nearly two months of clampdowns, pupils are returning to school and non-food shops or restaurants are re-opening, albeit with warnings that this easing could be stopped or even reversed if coronavirus cases start to spike. \u201cWe can rule out that we will have to go back to the tough measures,\u201d Belgian interior minister Pieter De Crem told broadcaster VTM on Sunday. This was echoed by Polish health minister Lukasz Szumowski who told weekly newspaper Sieci that Warsaw was well equipped, after successfully halting the spread of an outbreak in Silesia. \u201cOne can\u2019t do a second lockdown ... We have infrastructure, over 120 laboratories perform tests. There are tools to control this monster,\u201d Szumowski said. The crisis that has engulfed the British government over top political aide Dominic Cummings\u2019 conduct continues to rage despite a press conference in he repeatedly refused to resign or apologise for breaking lockdown rules, writes deputy political editor Rowena Mason. After an outpouring of public anger rattled No 10, Cummings attempted to explain why he drove 264 miles from London to his parents\u2019 estate in Durham despite suspecting that both he and his wife had coronavirus. No 10 had hoped the move would draw a line under fury about Cummings\u2019 behaviour after at least 20 Tory MPs called for him to quit and senior scientists accused him of undermining public health advice. But his appearance in the Rose Garden of No 10 raised yet more questions after Cummings admitted he had suspected both he and his wife had coronavirus when they made the decision to travel across the country with their son. Read the full story here Reuters reports that New South Wales, Australia\u2019s most populous state, has urged locals to continue working from home despite schools reopening as the number of coronavirus cases slows. The country has reported just over 7,100 infections and 102 deaths, well below figures reported by other developed countries, and with fewer than 20 new cases most days, states are pressing ahead with a three-stage plan to remove most social restrictions imposed by July. In New South Wales, which includes the city of Sydney, children returned to full-time face-to-face learning on Monday, allowing many parents to return to offices \u2013 although lawmakers urged those who could to stay home to avoid putting pressure on the transport network. \u201cI am very pleased that the system hasn\u2019t been overwhelmed,\u201d the NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney. \u201cPeople are listening, making informed decisions, and that is the way we would like it to continue.\u201d British prime minister Boris Johnson has said outdoor markets and car showrooms can reopen from 1 June as long as proper measures are put in place. He says the open nature of such places means they represent a lower risk than indoor places. At his daily briefing, Johnson also said that a further wave of reopening could start on 15 June, adding that indoor shops such as department stores would be allowed to open for business from that date as long as proper measures are put in place. It was also announced by Prof Yvonne Doyle of Public Health England that the current R rate is around 0.7. About 15,000 Rohingya refugees are now under coronavirus quarantine in Bangladesh\u2019s vast camps, officials said Monday, as the number of confirmed infections among them rose to 29. Health experts have long warned that the virus could race through the cramped settlements, housing almost a million Muslims who fled violence in Myanmar, and officials had restricted movement to the area in April. On Monday, Bangladesh recorded a fresh high in coronavirus detections, with 1,975 more people reported as testing positive in the past 24 hours, bringing the cumulative total to 35,585. Of those who have tested positive, so far 7,334 have recovered and 501 have died, with 21 deaths reported in the past 24 hours, according to the country\u2019s epidemiology institute. The first cases in the Rohingya camps were detected in mid-May. \u201cNone of the infections are critical,\u201d Toha Bhuiyan, a senior health official in the surrounding Cox\u2019s Bazar area told AFP. \u201cMost hardly show any symptoms. Still we have brought them in isolation centres and quarantined their families.\u201d Mahbubur Rahman, the chief health official of Cox\u2019s Bazar, said authorities hoped this week they would double the number of tests being performed daily from 188. He said further entry restrictions have been imposed on the camp, with a 14-day quarantine in place for anyone visiting from Dhaka. \u201cWe are very worried because the Rohingya camps are very densely populated. We suspect community transmission (of the virus) has already begun,\u201d Rahman told AFP. Health authorities in Spain have revised downward the country\u2019s death toll from the coronavirus by nearly 2,000, bringing the total number of deaths recorded to 26,834, AFP reports. A new system of gathering data had allowed them to identify cases that were counted twice and exclude deaths wrongly attributed to the virus, said Fernando Simon, the health ministry\u2019s emergencies coordinator. \u201cA variation of 1,900, that\u2019s a lot,\u201d he added. \u201cWe are trying to check that it\u2019s correct, but these are the figures that we have at the moment.\u201d The health ministry, which gathers data from regional health authorities, also revised downwards the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus, from the 235,772 announced on Sunday to 235,400. \u201cWe are satisfied with the growing quality of the information that allows us to take decisions,\u201d said Simon. \u201cIt is something that happens in every epidemic, when the evolution of the epidemic leaves us with a bit more time, you have to correct the figures and in certain cases you have to reduce them,\u201d he explained. While the new system cut the number of deaths by 1,918, Spain remains one of the countries worst hit by the virus. The UK PM\u2019s aide has said he does not regret breaching lockdown. Dominic Cummings, the chief of staff to Boris Johnson, admitted driving about 250 miles (400km) from his home during the UK\u2019s lockdown, but insisted he acted reasonably. The World Health Organization has said it will temporarily drop hydroxychloroquine from its study into coronavirus treatments. Director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the decision was made in light research that showed people taking it were at higher risk of early death. Greece took another step towards normality as it reinstated ferry links with islands and allowed restaurants, cafes and bars to reopen. The moves, designed to kickstart the country\u2019s tourist industry ahead of seasonal hotels reopening on 15 June, following almost three months of enforced closure. Spain will lift its quarantine requirement for people entering the country from 1 July, the government confirmed. At the moment, travellers from overseas are required to undergo a 14-day self-isolation on arrival. On Saturday the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said the country would reopen to tourists from July. Italy reported its fewest number of new coronavirus cases since early March. Authorities confirmed the deaths of 92 more people, bringing the total death toll from the pandemic to 32,877. New infections grew by 300, down from 531 on Sunday, with zero new cases registered in five regions. Sweden\u2019s top epidemiologist Anders Tegnell defended his country\u2019s outbreak strategy as the number of people to have died after catching the virus passed 4,000. Critics have accused Swedish authorities of gambling with citizens\u2019 lives by not imposing strict stay-at-home measures. Global cases passed 5.4m, according to the Johns Hopkins university coronavirus tracker, which has counted a total of 5,449,135 confirmed cases worldwide. The death toll stands at 345,721. The World Health Organization has said it will temporarily drop hydroxychloroquine \u2014 the malaria drug Donald Trump said he is taking as a precaution \u2014 from its global study into experimental coronavirus treatments after safety concerns. The WHO\u2019s director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in light of a paper published last week in the Lancet that showed people taking hydroxychloroquine were at higher risk of death and heart problems than those who were not, it would pause the hydroxychloroquine arm of its solidarity global clinical trial. \u201cThe executive group has implemented a temporary pause of the hydroxychloroquine arm within the Solidarity trial while the safety data is reviewed by the data safety monitoring board,\u201d Tedros said on Monday. \u201cThe other arms of the trial are continuing,\u201d He said the concern related only to the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for Covid-19, adding that the drugs were accepted treatments for people with malaria and auto-immune diseases. Africa\u2019s prompt and unified mobilisation to contain the coronavirus pandemic is a surprise to \u201cthose who have always belittled the continent,\u201d the chair of the African Union commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, has said. In a statement marking Africa Day, the anniversary of the founding of the Organisation for African Unity, the forerunner of the modern AU, Faki paid tribute to member states that, he said, \u201cpromptly took appropriate measures, consistent with the continental strategy.\u201d \u201cRight from the onset the pandemic, much to the surprise of those who have always belittled the continent, Africa mobilised itself,\u201d the former prime minister of Chad said. \u201cA continental response strategy was developed and implemented promptly.\u201d More than 14 weeks after the first case of coronavirus was detected in Africa, the continent has registered just over 100,000 cases and about 3,100 deaths \u2013 about 1.5% of the world\u2019s cases and 0.1% of deaths. Faki called on Africa to continue to forge its own path, and not expect help from elsewhere as it prepared for a post Covid-19 world. He went on: We should however redouble efforts, determination and perseverance in strictly implementing the pillars of the strategy. We should go beyond the present situation, by preparing for post-pandemic conditions in the world. There is an urgent need for Africa to develop new forms of resilience. In a world in which multilateralism is sorely tested, Africa must stop expecting solutions from others. Africa should no longer be satisfied with this role of never-ending reservoir for some, and dumping ground for others. There is an urgent need for Africa to chart its own course. Its food dependency and insecurity are unacceptable and intolerable, as is the state of its road, port, health and educational infrastructure. Africa\u2019s land, forests, rich fauna, mines, energy potential, and maritime and inland waterways, hold the necessary resources to provide an adequate response to the needs of its peoples. We should, in full lucidity, boldly opt for an innovative approach that is inward-looking rather than outward-looking. Let us live on what we have, using what we have, in other words let us live within our means! Click here to read the full text of his statement. Russia\u2019s government spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, has been discharged from hospital, just under a fortnight after he was admitted after testing positive for the coronavirus, Tass news agency reports. \u201c[I] was discharged from hospital. For now, I will be in quarantine,\u201d he was quoted as saying by the agency. \u201cI will gradually start working from home.\u201d Peskov, who as spokesman for the Kremlin is a recognisable figure on the world stage, was admitted to hospital on 12 May. Joe Biden, the Democrat candidate in the forthcoming US presidential election, has made his first in-person public appearance in more than two months to lay a wreath for the country\u2019s war dead. The 77-year-old, who has not made a campaign appearance outside his Delaware home since quarantining himself due to the coronavirus pandemic 10 weeks ago, visited a nearby veteran\u2019s memorial to mark the Memorial Day holiday. \u201cIt feels good to be out of my house,\u201d Biden told reporters, his speech slightly muffled by the mask, Reuters reported. Maintaining his distance, he saluted about a dozen veterans and other onlookers standing a few yards away. The southern Africa regional collaborating centre has collated the latest coronavirus figures for the 10 countries in the region. Sweden\u2019s top epidemiologist has defended his country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak strategy, after the number of people dying after catching the virus passed 4,000 on Monday. Critics have accused Swedish authorities of gambling with citizens\u2019 lives by not imposing strict stay-at-home measures. Death rates from the virus have been much higher than in Sweden\u2019s Nordic neighbours, which did introduce coronavirus lockdowns, but still lower than those of countries such as Spain, Italy and the UK. On Monday, Anders Tegnell, the chief epidemiologist of Sweden\u2019s public health agency, stressed countries\u2019 death tolls should be compared with caution and pointed out that not all deaths registered among his country\u2019s Covid-19 statistics would have been as a result of the illness. He told AFP: In Sweden, anybody who has the diagnosis of Covid-19 and dies within 30 days after that is called a Covid-19 case, irrespective of the actual cause of death. And we know that in many other countries there are other ways of counting that are used. Sweden\u2019s board of health and welfare insisted the country\u2019s nursing homes were functioning well in spite of the outbreak. It noted that 11,000 nursing home residents died in January-April this year, compared with 10,000 during the same period a year ago. Tegnell said the overall situation in Sweden was \u201cgetting better\u201d, with a declining number of people being admitted to intensive care units, a drop in the number of cases being reported in nursing homes, and fewer deaths in nursing homes. On Sunday the Observer published an interview with Annika Linde, Tegnell\u2019s predecessor, in which she said she now believed the authorities should have put in place tougher restrictions in the early stages of the pandemic. She said: I think that we needed more time for preparedness. If we had shut down very early ... we would have been able, during that time, to make sure that we had what was necessary to protect the vulnerable. There were 92 new coronavirus deaths in Italy on Monday, the lowest daily rate since early March, bringing the death count to 32,877, writes Angela Giuffrida, the Guardian\u2019s Rome correspondent. New infections grew by 300, down from 531 on Sunday, with zero new cases registered in five regions including Bolzano, Umbria, Calabria, Molise and Basilicata, according to figures from the civil protection authority. There are 55,300 people who are currently suffering from the virus in Italy, 541 of whom are in intensive care. Italy has 230,158 confirmed cases to date, including the deaths and 141,981 survivors. The country is planning to ask 60,000 people to volunteer to help enforce social distancing rules amid concerns infections will rise again following scenes of group gatherings over the weekend. Brazil\u2019s embattled leader, Jair Bolsonaro, has come under further pressure after his political idol, Donald Trump, banned flights from the South American country in response to its soaring number of coronavirus infections, writes Tom Phillips in Rio de Janeiro. The US announced the measure on Sunday as the number of cases in Brazil rose to more than 363,000 and the death toll to nearly 23,000. Only the US now has more confirmed infections than Brazil. Bolsonaro has faced severe criticism for flouting social distancing guidelines and has lost two health ministers in less than a month. The White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the move would \u201chelp ensure foreign nationals who have been in Brazil do not become a source of additional infections in our country\u201d. The indefinite ban, which comes into force on Friday, will apply to all non-US citizens who have been in Brazil within the last 14 days. The news is a blow to Brazil\u2019s far-right leader who touts his supposed closeness to Trump as proof he is steering Brazil in the right direction. Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters frequently wave the Star-Spangled Banner at rallies, and the president himself recently donned a \u201cTrump 2020\u201d hat. \u201cThe US [message] to Brazil: Stay at Your Own Home,\u201d one newspaper, the Estado de Minas, reported on its front page alongside an image of Bolsonaro supporters holding a US flag. Donald Trump has threatened to move the Republican party\u2019s national convention from Charlotte, North Carolina, if the state is not able to commit to \u201cfull attendance\u201d at the gathering despite Covid-19 restrictions, Edward Helmore writes for the Guardian US. In a series of tweets on Monday morning. Trump said the state\u2019s Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, was \u201cstill in Shutdown mood &amp; unable to guarantee\u201d that the party would be able to fill the arena with supporters. Trump\u2019s tweets came two days after North Carolina recorded its largest daily increase in positive cases of the coronavirus. Even as fears grow in Italy about people failing to adhere to social distancing guidelines, a survey shows that the country\u2019s people were strongly supportive of their government-imposed lockdown. Findings published on Monday by national statistics bureau Istat showed that 91% of respondents said the restrictions on movement and work were very useful or quite useful, against just 9% who deemed them not very or not at all useful, Reuters reports. The measures were also well understood and observed by a vast majority of respondents, with 89.5% describing the government\u2019s instructions as \u201cclear\u201d. On average Italians washed their hands 12 times a day and used disinfectant gel five times a day, the survey showed, and on most days they did not leave their home for any reason, according to the poll, conducted from 5-21 April at the height of Italy\u2019s epidemic. Earlier, my colleague Angela Giuffrida, who is based in Rome, reported on a video produced and circulated by the government in the Veneto region warning Italians not to drop their guard against coronavirus as they socialise. The video is mostly targeted at young people, who have been criticised for gathering in groups outside bars since they reopened last Monday. Luca Zaia, the president of Veneto, came under attack for posting it, with one Twitter user describing it as \u201cpure terrorism\u201d. Another wrote: \u201cDear president, this virus is cured (not fought against) in suitable places. Outside, one must live!\u201d Today\u2019s World Health Organization coronavirus briefing is marking Africa day, which is the anniversary of the founding of the Organisation for African Unity, the forerunner of today\u2019s African Union. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director general, began by remarking on the relatively mild impact of the coronavirus outbreak on African countries. He said: So far, although around half of the countries in the World Health Organization Africa region have community transmission, concentrated mainly in major cities, Africa is the least-affected region globally in terms of the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths reported to WHO. Africa has just 1.5% of the world\u2019s reported cases of Covid-19 and less than 0.1% of the world\u2019s deaths. The World Health Organization\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing is now beginning.

Vladimir Putin made a rare recent appearance in the Kremlin on Monday as Russia prepares to ease restrictions imposed over the coronavirus pandemic, Reuters reports. The 67-year-old has worked remotely over the past few weeks from his Novo-Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow, chairing meetings with officials by video conference. But on Monday, Putin held talks with the general director of Russian Railways, Oleg Belozerov, at the Kremlin, his office said. It came as Russia reported fewer than 10,000 new coronavirus infections for the tenth day in a row, recording 8,946 past 24 hours to Monday morning, taking the cumulative total to 353,427. Ninety-two more people died, the country\u2019s coronavirus crisis response centre said, taking Russia\u2019s total death toll from the outbreak to 3,633. Meanwhile, in the country\u2019s east, authorities opened an investigation into a street party that drew hundreds of people, flouting the country\u2019s coronavirus containment measures. The investigative committee in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk said it was looking into the case after photos and videos were posted online of young Russians dancing as music played from loudspeakers in the city\u2019s central Lenin Square from Saturday night to Sunday morning. Russians can face up to seven years in prison for violating anti-virus lockdown rules, though in most cases face only a fine. Somalia has reported 95 new cases of coronavirus, and five more deaths from Covid-19. So far the east African country has reported 1,689 officially confirmed infections, while a total of 66 people have died after catching the virus. The countries of the European Union need to present a united front to shield \u2013 wait for it \u2013 the banks. That is the message from the EU\u2019s banking regulator, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Campa, on Monday. Reuters says his intervention will rekindle a divisive debate about whether rich countries such as Germany should support banks of poorer neighbours, such as Italy. But it will also no doubt evoke memories of the 2008 financial crisis, when governments poured billions into propping up banks even as millions lost their homes and jobs, and income levels fell. Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron have proposed an EU recovery fund to help the bloc\u2019s worst-hit members to rebuild their economies after the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cIt would make sense to have a European approach to support banks,\u201d Campa told Reuters. \u201cThat could be in the form of a Tarp-style precautionary recapitalisation. Here, the EU recovery fund could play a role,\u201d he said, suggesting that assistance could be aimed at banks that were fundamentally robust but hit by the coronavirus crisis. The World Health Organization\u2019s thrice-weekly coronavirus briefing is due to begin shortly. Click on the player at the top of the blog to tune in. Mongolia is to remain under coronavirus lockdown until a vaccine is found, its prime minister said on Monday. The landlocked country, wedged in the heart of Asia between Russia and China, was one of the first to close its borders to protect itself against the pandemic. Other measures to curb the spread of the virus include a ban on children under 12 in malls and restaurants, mandatory face masks in public, and the closure of universities, schools and early years education until September. \u201cThe country will keep the quarantine rules until a vaccine becomes available,\u201d Prime Minister Khurelsukh Ukhnaa told reporters in the country\u2019s parliament, according to AFP. Thousands of Mongolians remain stranded abroad after the country said only vulnerable groups \u2013 including pregnant women, seniors, children with their parents, and people with serious health issues \u2013 could return The reopening of nightclubs in China have given a taster of what ravers around the world can expect when nightlife finally begins again amid the widely touted \u201cnew normal\u201d. Reuters reports from 44KW, a techno club in Shanghai, that customers danced and mingled without much physical distancing over the weekend. But there have been some significant changes. Nightclubbers \u2013 at least those in the UK \u2013 are used to ID checks and stringent drugs searches. But if things proceed as they are in China, they will have to get used to submitting to a temperature check on the door now as well, and register their details. While face masks were not compulsory for the customers at 44KW, the staff, including bouncers, bartenders and waiters, all kept their faces covered. The club has installed hand-sanitiser dispensers throughout. Some changes will be welcomed. The Chinese nightclub has committed to disinfecting toilets every hour, and the entire venue is disinfected every day \u2013 before and after opening. The Czech Republic has lifted its trailblazing rule requiring face masks to be worn in public, a symbolic landmark in the country\u2019s relatively successful battle against Covid-19, writes Robert Tait in Prague. The long-awaited lifting of the regulation \u2013 imposed in March shortly after a state of emergency was declared \u2013 coincided with the final phase of an easing of lockdown restrictions, in which pubs, restaurants, hotels and museums have been fully reopening their doors. Czech officials have pressed ahead with a phased easing of restrictions amid a consistent decline in the number of confirmed cases. The health minister, Adam Vojt\u011bch, declared last week that \u201cthe Covid-19 crisis is behind us\u201d. Health ministry figures reported 8,932 confirmed cases as of 24 May, with nearly 400,000 tests performed. There have been 315 deaths. The Czech Republic was among the first countries in Europe to close its borders against the spread of coronavirus, on 12 March, ordering the closure of most businesses days later. But the mask edict \u2013 in common with neighbouring Slovakia \u2013 quickly became the symbol of the Czech fight against the pandemic, prompting debate in other countries over whether they should follow suit. Poland\u2019s health minister, \u0141ukasz Szumowski, has denied any wrongdoing following accusations of inadequate supervision of the procurement of equipment to help combat the coronavirus pandemic, Reuters reports. The allegations against Szumowski, a highly popular politician of the nationalist government, risk damaging the popularity of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party ahead of a presidential election. PiS needs to win the election in order to retain control during the pandemic \u2013 which has infected 21,440 and killed 996 people in the country \u2013 as the president has the power to veto new legislation and to trigger an early general election. Polish media have accused Szumowski\u2019s ministry of inadequate supervision of the procurement of items such as protective masks. The daily newspapers Gazeta Wyborcza reported that the ministry bought masks with fake certificates from a skiing instructor who is a family friend of Szumowski. \u201cNeither I, nor my brother, nor my wife, have done anything wrong. There is not a single fact that would indicate any irregularities,\u201d Szumowski told the private broadcaster Polsat News. Data released today showed the number of Portuguese young people requesting jobless benefitsrose 52% last month from a year earlier, way above the increase for other age groups, amid the coronavirus lockdown. Overall, nearly 200,000 people received unemployment benefits last month, a 17% jump from the same period last year and a near 14% increase from the previous month, social security service numbers showed. Reuters reports there was also an almost 33% increase among those aged 25 to 34 and a 20.4% rise among people aged between 35 and 44. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned of \u201cunusual or aggressive\u201d behaviour in American rats as a consequence of more than two months of human lockdown for city-dwelling rodents, who now find themselves unable to dine out on restaurant waste, street garbage and other food sources. Edward Helmore reports that last month \u2013 according to the national health body \u2013 dumpster-diving rats were observed resorting to open warfare, cannibalism and eating their young in the wake of urban shutdowns. \u201cCommunity-wide closures have led to a decrease in food available to rodents, especially in dense commercial areas,\u201d the CDC said in recently updated rodent-control guidelines. \u201cSome jurisdictions have reported an increase in rodent activity as rodents search for new sources of food. Environmental health and rodent control programs may see an increase in service requests related to rodents and reports of unusual or aggressive rodent behavior.\u201d Hello, it\u2019s Frances Perraudin here again. I\u2019ll be taking over the live blog while Damien has a break. You can contact me with hints and tips on frances.perraudin@theguardian.com and on twitter @fperraudin. Big crowds turned out for the Memorial Day weekend in the US amid warnings from authorities about people disregarding the coronavirus social distancing rules and risking a resurgence of Covid-19 as the country braces to surpass more than 100,000 deaths. The US is on track to hit the grim milestone in the next few days, while Europe has recorded more than 169,000 dead, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University that almost certainly understates the toll. Worldwide, more than 5.4 million people have been infected and nearly 345,000 have died. Dr Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House coronavirus taskforce, said she was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about scenes of people crowding together over the weekend. \u201cWe really want to be clear all the time that social distancing is absolutely critical. And if you can\u2019t social distance and you\u2019re outside, you must wear a mask,\u201d Birx said on ABC\u2019s This Week. The Spanish arm of the international charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res has ended its coronavirus operations in the country, writes Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent. For the past two months, MSF Spain has been running field hospitals and working to relieve some of the strains on the country\u2019s overstretched health system. On Monday, the NGO said it was winding up its activities as Spain\u2019s hospitals \u201chave passed the most critical point\u201d. But it warned that the hard-won gains against the virus could not be taken for granted and that systemic problems needed to be addressed. David Noguera, the head of MSF Spain, said: Everyone now appreciates what this epidemic means for the most vulnerable sectors of the population, such as older people in care homes. It would be unacceptable for our system not to be more prepared in order to avoid the repetition of the tragic situations and deaths we\u2019ve seen. Noguera pointed out that more than 19,000 people had died in Spanish care homes, adding: \u201cThe dignity of the most vulnerable people in our society need to be our common focus.\u201d The Netherlands reported 209 more confirmed cases of coronavirus on Monday, taking its cumulative total to 45,445, as officials said a second Dutch worker may have been infected by a mink. According to the latest update from the Dutch national institute for public health and the environment, eight more people have died from Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new virus, taking the country\u2019s total death toll from the outbreak to 5,830. It came as the agriculture minister said on Monday that another person had been infected while working on a mink farm. The case follows a reported infection last week on one of two farms near the southern city of Eindhoven, where the disease was discovered in April among mink that are bred for their valuable fur. \u201cA second case has become known where on one of the mink farms SARS-CoV-2 has been passed from a mink to a human,\u201d Carola Schouten said, according to AFP. \u201cThe case is similar to the previous one,\u201d she said in a letter to the Dutch parliament. The infection happened before it was known the mink were carrying the virus, meaning workers did not wear protective clothing at the time. Spain will lift its quarantine requirement for those entering the country from 1 July, the government has just confirmed, writes Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent. At the moment, travellers from overseas are required to undergo a 14-day self-isolation on arrival. On Saturday the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said the country would reopen to tourists from July. The official death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in Sweden has topped 4,000, statistics published by its public health agency showed on Monday. The data published on the agency\u2019s website showed that deaths from Covid-19 had risen to 4,029, from 3,998 a day earlier, while the number of confirmed cases increased by 384 to 33,843. Unlike most other countries, Sweden has taken a soft-touch approach to fighting the virus, leaving most schools, shops and restaurants open and relying on voluntary measures focused on social distancing and good hygiene. Accumulated deaths in the pandemic in Sweden have been many times higher relative to the size of the population than in its Nordic neighbours, but still lower than in some hard-hit countries such as Spain and Britain that implemented strict lockdowns. On Sunday, people gathered in Stockholm to protest against their government\u2019s perceived inaction over the outbreak. Vietnam reported a new case of coronavirus on Monday, its second in a week, bringing its total number of cases to 325, with no deaths so far. The new case is a 20-year-old Vietnamese student who has recently returned to the country from France, the ministry of health was quoted as saying by the Xinhua news agency. She is being treated in Ho Chi Minh City. Vietnam has recorded no local transmission of the coronavirus for 39 consecutive days. The country\u2019s success in tackling the outbreak has been based on a fast, aggressive and comprehensive response. There are currently more than 15,400 people being monitored and quarantined. Newspapers in Brazil continue to rebel against President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s response to Covid-19, writes Tom Phillips, the Guardian\u2019s Latin America correspondent. On Monday, with Brazil\u2019s official death toll at 22,666, Rio de Janeiro\u2019s O Dia newspaper led its coverage with this striking front page: Bolsonaro continues to cause outrage in Brazil by playing down the pandemic and flouting social distancing guidelines. On Saturday he was branded a \u201ckiller\u201d by opponents as he popped out for a Saturday night hotdog on the day a further 965 of his citizens were reported to have died. Foreign newspapers have also joined the criticism of Bolsonaro. On Monday the Telegraph in the UK branded Bolsonaro \u201cthe man who broke Brazil\u201d. Thirty-four more people in Iran have died from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, the health ministry reports. But the lowest daily Covid-19 death toll in the country since March comes amid an apparently rise in new coronavirus cases. In his daily update, Kianoush Jahanpour, the health ministry spokesman, said 2,023 more Iranians had tested positive for the virus since yesterday, taking the total cumulative total number of cases in the country to 137,724. Daily new cases have been rising, on average, since 2 May, when the country recorded 802 new infections, but are still well short of a high of 3,186 reported on 30 March. The Covid-19 death toll in Iran is 7,451, while 107,713 have recovered, Jahanpour said. After months of working remotely while the continent has been frozen by coronavirus lockdowns, European Union leaders may meet face to face in the coming weeks to bargain over the next joint budget and a linked pandemic recovery fund. A senior EU diplomat told Reuters: The budget and recovery fund cannot be agreed without a physical summit. I haven\u2019t yet met anyone who would think it possible on a video conference According to Reuters, technical issues, problems with translation and the less personal nature of video calls have made it hard for EU leaders to replicate the atmosphere of their all-night summits, a hallmark of Brussels where they meet to haggle over joint policies. On Wednesday the European commission, the EU executive, will propose its blueprint for the 27-nation budget, known as the Multiannual Financial Framework and worth around \u20ac1tn, and the accompanying coronavirus recovery fund. France and Germany have joined in support of granting handouts worth \u20ac500bn through the new fund to kickstart economic growth. But the so-called \u201cfrugal four\u201d of Austria, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands are opposed, calling for aid to come in the form of repayable loans rather than free grants. A fortnight after the end of France\u2019s strict eight-week lockdown, parks and gardens in Paris remain closed to city-dwellers, many of whom spent the confinement cooped up in apartments with no outside space, writes Kim Willsher, in the French capital. While the city\u2019s mayor, Anne Hidalgo, continues her battle with the government to have the spaces opened \u2013 so far unsuccessfully \u2013 an unlikely hero has emerged from the night-time shadows. An anonymous lock-picker calling himself Jos\u00e9, who says he has a full-time and perfectly respectable day job, is spending his evenings cracking park padlocks. \u201cI\u2019m not a thief, I steal nothing \u2026,\u201d he said. \u201cBut everything is closed, it\u2019s worse than before the lockdown. I saw some children playing in the road in front of a locked-up park and it seemed so stupid. So I decided to open up a green corridor. I leave the gates open and people can do what they want.\u201d Jos\u00e9 says the smiles on childrens\u2019 faces when they discover their local park is open is worth the risk. If caught he risks five years in prison and a maximum \u20ac75,000 fine. Greece has taken another step towards normality today, reinstating ferry links with islands and allowing restaurants, cafes and bars to reopen, writes Helena Smith in Athens. The moves, designed to kick-start the country\u2019s tourist industry ahead of seasonal hotels reopening on 15 June, follow almost three months of enforced closure thanks to coronavirus. In central Athens cafes began filling up from early morning \u2013 although it wasn\u2019t quite business as usual. Waiters wore face coverings and, though not everywhere, hand sanitisers were visible on tables. Yachting industry activities also kicked off as the Greek government gradually opens up the sector in advance of seasonal hotels accepting guests in mid-June and international flights resuming to popular destinations on 1 July. In a nation so reliant on tourism \u2013 one in five Greeks work in the sector, which accounts for almost 25% of GDP \u2013 officials are desperate to capitalise on the country\u2019s successful handling of the pandemic and salvage what is left of the season. But reopening borders is also replete with risk. With less than 3,000 confirmed coronavirus cases to date and a death toll of 172, questions are mounting over the ability of rudimentary health services on popular islands to deal with any outbreak of the virus. So far Greek isles have remained remarkably coronavirus-free. Civil protection officials and personnel from the national public health organisation have been dispatched to remote isles such as Kimolos, Folegrandos and Sikinos to look at boosting medical infrastructure in advance of tourists arrivals. More than 110,900 people have so far tested positive for the coronavirus across Africa, according to the World Health Organization\u2019s office for the continent. More than 14 weeks after the virus was first detected on the continent, the 54 countries of Africa, which between them account for a population of about 1.4 billion people, have so far counted 44,500 recoveries and 3,300 deaths. On Friday, the WHO said it now seemed apparent that the coronavirus outbreak was \u201ctaking a different pathway\u201d in Africa, which has not seen the kind of catastrophe that had earlier been feared. Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO regional director for Africa, said: For now Covid-19 has made a soft landfall in Africa, and the continent has been spared the high numbers of deaths which have devastated other regions of the world. It is possible our youth dividend is paying off and leading to fewer deaths. But we must not be lulled into complacency as our health systems are fragile and are less able to cope with a sudden increase in cases. To hunker in a medieval castle while a pandemic rages outside sounds like a Black Death chronicle but Laura Jamieson and Michael Smith have rather enjoyed their lockdown, writes Rory Carroll, the Guardian\u2019s Dublin correspondent. The young couple have been the sole occupants of Ashford Castle, a five-star hotel with 83 rooms on the shores of Lough Corrib in county Mayo that is one of Ireland\u2019s premier tourist magnets. Jamieson, from Surrey, and Smith, from Perthshire in Scotland, usually live in the nearby village of Cross and commute to the castle for work but have spent the past two months living there while maintaining the buildings and 350-acre estate until tourists return. \u201cIt\u2019s like being in a TV reality show that\u2019s nobody watching,\u201d Smith told RTE. Duties include flushing 160 toilets, dusting chandeliers and fielding emails and phone calls. The working day often ends with a visit to the school of falconry to check on the owls and hawks. For date night they choose a bottle from the wine cellar to accompany a film at the 32-seat private cinema. The couple consider their quarantine there a once-in-a-lifetime adventure \u2013 a story of happy isolation in a big hotel that could be a Ladybird book reworking of Stephen King\u2019s The Shining. Ashford Castle was built in the 13th century, rebuilt in Victorian times and subsequently refurbished. US presidents, Barbra Streisand and Brad Pitt have stayed there. Jamieson and Smith are due to move back to their more modest digs before the castle reopens on 20 July. Afghanistan\u2019s health ministry has pledged to establish three more medical centres for Covid-19 patients in Kabul, as the capital experienced a record rise in infections and the number of confirmed cases nationwide passed 11,000, Akhtar Mohammad Makoii reports from Herat. Ferozuddin Feroz, the health minister, said in a meeting with his deputies on Monday that three more centres will be established in Kabul for Covid-19 patients. Last week the ministry said it had run out of hospital beds for treating patients with the disease in most parts of the country. \u201cThe hospitals which had empty beds until 10 days ago and we were sending patients to, are packed, with no more beds. We should launch more hospitals immediately,\u201d Wahid Majroh, deputy health minister said last week. The health ministry said it had tested 1,095 more suspected patients, of whom 591 were positive, taking the total number of confirmed infections to 11,173. The official death toll reached 219 after one more patient died overnight. There have been 1,097 recoveries. The ministry has pledged to increase the number of daily tests \u2013 it has tested 31,718 suspected patients since the outbreak began. Most of the new infections were reported in Kabul, where 390 cases came back positive out of 697 tests. Kabul is the country\u2019s worst-affected area in number of transmissions, with 4,141 confirmed cases and 29 deaths. The eastern province of Nangarhar and the western province of Herat, which have both recorded surges in the number of new infections in recent days, recorded 80 new cases combined. Herat is the country\u2019s worst-affected area for deaths, with 36. Sunday was the first day of Eid in Afghanistan and concerns are high as streets are crowded with people, despite the government-mandated lockdown, According to a Guardian tally, Afghanistan recorded 3,920 new cases in the seven days before Eid \u2013 a record high. Meanwhile, after recent violence, the country is experiencing a rare period of calm, with the Taliban and Afghan government announcing a three-day Eid ceasefire. Local media reported there were only two security incidents recorded on the first day of Eid. Ethnic minorities have been the hardest-hit by the coronavirus in the US, and now Latino workers are facing fresh difficulty, as they and their communities suffer discrimination after contracting coronavirus in meat processing plants and warehouses, writes Adam Gabbatt for the Guardian US. More than 10,000 meatpacking workers, many of them Latino, have contracted coronavirus in the US, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers union, and dozens have died. Latino advocates say workers are also experiencing racism due to fears they have contracted the virus in the workplace. \u201cWe\u2019ve received reports that some workers at a plant were turned away from grocery stores and not allowed in, because they were presumed to have the coronavirus because they worked at the local meatpacking plant,\u201d said Domingo Garcia, national president of the League of United Latin American Citizens (Lulac). \u201cWe\u2019ve also heard in Marshalltown [Iowa] people were being refused service because they thought they were positive for Covid-19 \u2013 just because they were Latino,\u201d Garcia added. Global cases pass 5.4m There are currently 5,424,718 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The death toll stands at 345,296. Both figures are likely to be higher, due to differing test rates, definitions and deliberate underreporting. Germany enters recession in first quarter Falling consumer spending, capital investments and exports pushed the German economy into a recession in the first three months of the year, the national statistics office said this morning, as the virus continued to hurt the major economies. Capital investments slumped by 6.9%, private consumption by 3.2% and exports by 3.1% between January and March compared with the last three months of 2019. China says virus pushing US ties to brink of \u2018cold war\u2019 The Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, has said Washington seemed infected by a \u201cpolitical virus\u201d but that Beijing would nevertheless be open to an international effort to find the coronavirus source. \u201cSome political forces in the US are taking China-US relations hostage and pushing our two countries to the brink of a new cold war,\u201d Wang said. Speaking on Sunday, Robert O\u2019Brien, Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser, likened China\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak to the Soviet Union\u2019s cover-up of the meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986. US bars travellers who have been in Brazil in last two weeks The White House has announced it is prohibiting foreigners from traveling to the US if they have been in Brazil in the last two weeks, two days after the South American nation became the world\u2019s second-worst affected country in terms of coronavirus cases. Brazil meanwhile registered 15,813 new cases and 653 new deaths in 24 hours, taking the total number of fatalities to 22,666, and cases to 363,211 confirmed cases, the health ministry said. Japan ends state of emergency The Japanese prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, has lifted the state of emergency imposed due to the coronavirus crisis. He said on Monday that the country had managed to get the spread of the virus under control in under two months. Social distancing curbs were loosened for most of the country on 14 May as new infections fell, but the government has kept Tokyo and four other prefectures under watch. Boris Johnson under pressure to sack senior aide Pressure on Boris Johnson to sack Dominic Cummings has intensified, as at least 18 Conservative MPs publicly called on the adviser to face the consequences of breaking lockdown rules. The UK prime minister backed his senior aide at a defiant press conference on Sunday, saying it had been within the rules for Cummings to drive his family 264 miles to his parents\u2019 estate in Durham while his wife was suffering coronavirus symptoms. Restrictions ease in Madrid and Barcelona Major parks and cafe terraces reopened in Madrid for the first time in more than two months as the capital and the surrounding region moved into the second phase of the loosening of lockdown restrictions. The Barcelona metropolitan area and parts of Castilla y Le\u00f3n also joined Madrid in the same phase, which allows groups of up to 10 people to meet as long as they maintain physical distancing. Small shops can also open without prior appointments and places of worship can reopen at 30% capacity. Chile\u2019s healthcare system \u2018very close to the limit\u2019 The Chilean president, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, said on Sunday that the country\u2019s healthcare system was under strain and \u201cvery close to the limit\u201d, as the number of confirmed novel coronavirus infections approached 70,000, after a rapid increase in recent days. The health ministry reported 3,709 new cases in the last day, bringing the total to 69,102. The death toll is at 718. South Africa announces further easing of lockdown South Africa will further relax coronavirus lockdown restrictions from 1 June, President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced, allowing large areas of the economy to fully reopen. \u201cCabinet has determined that the alert level for the whole country should be lowered from level four to level three,\u201d he said in an address broadcast on television, describing the move as a significant shift in approach to the pandemic. Splits are emerging between federal and state governments in Germany over plans to end coronavirus lockdowns, the Associated Press reports. The overall number of coronavirus cases in the country has been in a steady decline after peaking in late April. but as restrictions, imposed 10 weeks ago, have slowly been eased there have been fresh clusters of cases linked to slaughterhouses, restaurants, religious services, nursing homes and refugee shelters. The governor of Thuringia, Bodo Ramelow, said on Saturday he hoped to lift the remaining statewide lockdown rules on 6 June and tackle outbreaks locally. Saxony, a neighbouring state, said on Monday that it too is aiming for a \u201cparadigm change\u201d on pandemic rules from 6 June if infections remain low. Jens Spahn, the health minister, on Monday cautioned against acting as though the outbreak was over. He told Bild, a German tabloid, that \u201con the one hand we are seeing whole regions where there are no new reported infections for days. And on the other hand local and regional outbreaks in which the virus is spreading quickly again and immediate intervention is required.\u201d Federal and state officials agreed earlier this month that restrictions would be re-imposed if there are more than 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in a city or county within a week. Donald Trump, the US president, recently shared a doctored video of his head superimposed on to actor Bill Pullman\u2019s character in the 1996 film Independence Day\u2019s crowd-rallying scene, likening frontline workers to warriors. But it rang hollow for Denita Jones, a Dallas-area call center worker. For many black, essential workers like her, the message is about reopening the economy, but the real meaning is more subtle. \u201cWe\u2019re not essential, we\u2019re expendable,\u201d she said. African Americans in Texas are dying of Covid-19 at a rate more than one-third higher than their share of the population. Yet across the country, the protesters who became the faces of the race to reopen have been mostly white. Guardian US writer Kenya Evelyn reports on how experts are warning that reopening states could have dire consequences on public health, and black Americans already face greater risk. The cumulative tally of officially confirmed cases of coronavirus in Germany has increased by 289 to 178,570, the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases said on Monday, according to Reuters. The reported death toll rose by 10 to 8,257, the data showed. Meanwhile, the German federal government is recommending that states ease some social distancing regulations from 6 June, the Bild newspaper reported, but continues to urge that limits be placed on the size of social gatherings. According to an official paper seen by the newspaper, Helge Braun, the head of the office of the chancellor, recommended that private gatherings be held in the open air where possible and be limited to 20 people, while indoor meetings should be limited to 10 people. Hi, this is Damien Gayle taking over on the coronavirus live blog now, with thanks to Frances Perraudin for keeping things going for the past few hours.

A chilling video warning Italians not to drop their guard against coronavirus as they socialise has provoked a strong reaction on social media. The video, entitled Happy Hour? and created by leaders of the Veneto region, is mostly targeted at young people who have been criticised for gathering in groups outside bars since they reopened last Monday. The clip shows people drinking, chatting and haphazardly wearing masks, while warning that \u201cit takes little \u2026 a warm greeting, innocent laughter, a handshake \u2026 before it\u2019s all going to stop.\u201d The characters then freeze in action before images of Covid-19 patients in intensive care are shown. Luca Zaia, the president of Veneto, said during a press conference that \u201cHappy hour will be unhappy if you end up in hospital\u201d. He came under attack for the video, with one Twitter user describing it as \u201cpure terrorism\u201d. Another wrote: \u201cDear president, this virus is cured (not fought against) in suitable places. Outside, one must live!\u201d There was support from some quarters, particularly from Vincenzo De Luca, the president of the Campania region, who became somewhat of a star during the lockdown for his comical rants aimed at getting citizens to comply with rules. \u201cWell done Luca,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cSometimes we need to terrorise if they don\u2019t understand.\u201d A town in Veneto was among the first 11 in Italy to be quarantined at the start of the outbreak, but mass testing enabled the region to quickly get the virus under control. As of Sunday, there were 1,869 deaths and 17 new infections. Other Italian leaders have had to reimpose restrictions following scenes of people mixing closely together and without face masks. In Brescia, one of the areas in Lombardy hardest hit by coronavirus, bars will now have to close by 9.30pm, while in Verona in Veneto, bar customers must be seated at a table. Bars will also have to close by 9pm in Perugia, Umbria. Hungary has opened its southern border for citizens of Serbia and Hungary from today, the country\u2019s foreign minister, P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3, has told a news conference. He said Hungary had decided to reciprocate a similar measure taken by Serbia on Friday, Reuters reports, adding that the coronavirus pandemic was under control in both countries, which allowed the easing of restrictions. The move followed a gradual reopening of landlocked Hungary\u2019s other borders, which now allow some movement although restrictions have not been fully lifted. Hungary has recorded 3,756 cases of Covid-19 and 491 deaths. The Japanese prime minister, Shinz\u014d Abe, is to lift the state of emergency imposed due to the coronavirus crisis. He said on Monday that the country had managed to get the spread of the virus under control in under two months. Physical distancing curbs were loosened for most of the country on 14 May as new infections fell, but the government has kept Tokyo and four other prefectures under watch. According to the public broadcaster NHK, the world\u2019s third-largest economy has escaped an explosive outbreak with more than 16,600 infections and 839 deaths so far. A little over a month ago, health experts were saying Japan risked becoming one of the world\u2019s coronavirus \u201cdisaster zones\u201d. This report from the Guardian\u2019s Justin McCurry in Tokyo looks at how the country\u2019s government went on to win plaudits for its response to the crisis. Major parks and cafe terraces reopened in Madrid for the first time in more than two months as the capital and the surrounding region moved into the second phase of the loosening of lockdown restrictions. The Barcelona metropolitan area and parts of Castilla y Le\u00f3n also joined Madrid in the same phase, which allows groups of up to 10 people to meet as long as they maintain physical distancing. Small shops can also open without prior appointments and places of worship can reopen at 30% capacity. Madrid\u2019s mayor, Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida, marked the occasion by tweeting a picture of himself standing by the boating lake in the city\u2019s famous El Retiro park. \u201cOpen,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cGood morning and let\u2019s be responsible.\u201d Almost half of Spain \u2013 47% \u2013 has moved into the third phase of the de-escalation. The penultimate phase allows shops in shopping centres to reopen (but not communal areas) and restaurants to serve customers inside, but while operating at 40% capacity. Cinemas and theatres are also permitted to open, but must operate at 30% capacity. What if it had just fizzled out? What if leading Chinese scientist Zhong Nanshan had gone on state television on 20 January and delivered news that the unusual virus detected in Wuhan was not spreading between people, instead of what he really said that night: that human-to-human transmission was certain? ... What would we be talking about instead? What stories would have defined 2020 so far? Even before the worst pandemic in a century, tectonic shifts were already under way. The news felt exhausting. But the world is still turning, despite the movements of half of humanity being restricted in some way. Even apart from Covid-19, it has been a year of significant developments. The Guardian\u2019s international correspondent Michael Safi looks at the global stories that would have been getting our attention if Covid-19 had never emerged. The Philippines\u2019 health department has reported five additional coronavirus deaths and 284 more infections, the largest daily increase of cases in two weeks. In a bulletin, the government said total deaths had increased to 873, while confirmed cases had risen to 14,319. Seventy-four more patients have recovered, bringing total recoveries to 3,323. From crowded informal settlements to conservation areas teeming with wildlife, cottage industries have popped up around the globe producing and distributing face masks for frontline workers, taxi drivers, market sellers and more, Kate Hodal reports. Usually comprised of two fabric layers with a disposable filter, mask-making enterprises are stoking local economies and helping communities. Read the full story here: Singapore\u2019s health ministry has confirmed 344 more coronavirus cases, taking its tally of infections to 31,960, Reuters reports. The lower number of cases on Monday is partly due to fewer tests being conducted, the ministry said in a statement. It said the vast majority of the newly infected people were migrant workers living in dormitories, adding that four were Singaporeans or permanent residents. The often unsanitary dormitories that house migrant workers in Singapore have become a hotbed of infections in recent weeks. For background, read this report from the end of last month from the Guardian\u2019s south-east Asia correspondent, Rebecca Ratcliffe. Spain\u2019s tourism minister has said this morning that foreigners can book vacations in Spain from July as the two-week self-quarantine for overseas travellers is likely to be suspended by then. Spain \u2013 one of the worst-hit nations in the world from the coronavirus \u2013 has an economy that is heavily dependent on tourism. While it is gradually easing its strict lockdown measures, it has kept a quarantine for foreign visitors to try to prevent a second wave of infections. \u201cIt is perfectly coherent to plan summer vacations to come to Spain in July,\u201d Reyes Maroto said in an interview with the local radio station Onda Cero. The country\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said on Saturday the government would guarantee the safety of visitors and locals when they started to return from July. \u201cSpain needs tourism, and tourism needs safety in both origin and destination,\u201d he said. Hello, I\u2019m Frances Perraudin in London. I\u2019ll be taking over the live blog for the morning. You can contact me with hints and tips on frances.perraudin@theguardian.com and on twitter @fperraudin. Thanks for reading. India has resumed domestic flights despite the country recording its biggest daily number of infections yet. Here\u2019s the full story from Amrit Dhillon. The pressure on Boris Johnson to sanction Dominic Cummings is already being ratcheted up after a member of the government\u2019s advisory group on behavioural science told morning TV that the \u201cdebacle\u201d has \u201cfatally undermined\u201d efforts to fight coronavirus. Prof Stephen Reicher told Good Morning Britain: If you look at the research it shows the reason why people observed lockdown was not for themselves, it wasn\u2019t because they were personally at risk, they did it for the community, they did it because of a sense of \u2018we\u2019re all in this together\u2019. If you give the impression there\u2019s one rule for them and one rule for us you fatally undermine that sense of \u2018we\u2019re all in this together\u2019 and you undermine adherence to the forms of behaviour which have got us through this crisis.\u201d Reicher was reiterating criticism he voiced yesterday when he said Johnson\u2019s defence of his favourite aide had \u201ctrashed\u201d advice on how to build public consensus on following the rules of lockdown. Falling consumer spending, capital investments and exports pushed the German economy into a recession in the first three months of the year, the national statistics office said this morning, as the virus continued to hurt the major economies. Capital investments slumped by 6.9%, private consumption by 3.2% and exports by 3.1% between January and March compared with the last three months of 2019. 100 writers call for an end to anti-Asian hostility More than 100 prominent writers, including several top Asian American authors, have called for an end to a surge in anti-Asian hostility in the US which they say has been \u201cegged on\u201d during the pandemic by the Trump administration\u2019s pandering to racist tropes. The joint statement, co-ordinated by Pen America and the Asian American Writers\u2019 Workshop (AAWW), comes at a time when hate crimes, violence and other attacks against Asians and Asian Americans are on the rise in the US. There have been numerous reports since early in the pandemic of Asian Americans being blamed for \u201cbringing the virus\u201d into the country and being told \u201cgo back to China\u201d. Asian stock markets have given back earlier gains amid concerns about growing US-Sino antagonism over the coronavirus crisis and trade. Hong Kong has slumped 1.4% to a two-month low after sinking 5.5% on Friday. The London stock market is closed today for the spring bank holiday but other European bourses are in business. Here are the opening calls. Lockdown gives asylum seekers reprieve and hope for change in policy Clare Considine reports for the Guardian: As Britain takes its first small steps out of lockdown, there is one group of people quietly wishing that it wouldn\u2019t. For many asylum seekers, the two-month hiatus has meant reprieve. Freed from detention centres, liberated from the threat of imminent deportation and no longer obliged to report to the Home Office, many have welcomed the relief. And all this at a time when the general population have learned something of what it is like to live with severe curbs on civil liberties: That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan, on a chilly and wet Sydney evening. I\u2019m off to gently encourage some rather large insects seeking shelter in my house to rediscover their love of the great outdoors \u2013 and not so gently encourage others. Thank you for for following along, and, as always, to those who got in touch. The parts of Spain already in or entering Phase 1 today, according to El Pais, include: \u201cThe regions of Madrid, Castilla y Le\u00f3n and Valencia, as well as most of Catalonia and the provinces of Ciudad Real, Toledo, Albacete, Granada and M\u00e1laga.\u201d Those entering Phase 2 are: \u201cThe Canary and Balearic Islands, Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, the Basque Country, La Rioja, Navarre, Arag\u00f3n, Extremadura, Guadalajara, Cuenca, Murcia, all of Andalusia apart from M\u00e1laga y Granada, Terres de l\u2019Ebre (Tarragona), Camp de Tarragona (Tarragona), Alt Pirineu-Aran (Lleida), and the Spanish exclave cities of Ceuta and Melilla in North Africa.\u201d Spain is easing lockdown restrictions today, with the country entering Phase 1 of the relaxed restrictions, while some parts will enter Phase 2, which is more relaxed. The El Pais newspaper has detailed the differences between the two phases: Phase 1 Under this stage of the deescalation plan, building work in properties that are being lived in will no longer be prohibited, while the opening of shopping malls will be made more flexible. Stores in malls will be able to open provided that they measure under 400 square meters, or they demarcate an area of that size for customers. They will also require an independent, direct access point from outside of the shopping mall in which they are located. Museums will be able to decide how many people to let in, within a range of 30% to 50% of normal capacity. Phase 2 Local councils will be able to establish access limits and control the number of people on beaches in order to guarantee a two-meter distance can be observed, as well as establishing time limits both on the sand and in car parks. The order specifies that access to beaches must always be free of charge. To calculate the maximum capacity of a beach, each bather is considered to occupy approximately four square meters. Thailand confirmed two new coronavirus cases and one additional death on Monday, a health ministry spokesman said. The new numbers brought the total number of cases in the Southeast Asian country to 3,042 and deaths to 57 since the outbreak began in January, said Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman for the Covid-19 Administration Centre. More than 96% of the patients, or 2,928 people, have recovered, he said. Get in touch via Twitter @helenrsullivan or email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com.

Boris Johnson\u2019s defence of Dominic Cummings has dominated the front pages of the UK\u2019s media landscape, with newspapers taking varied lines on the prime minister\u2019s decision to excuse his senior aide\u2019s lockdown breaches. The Daily Mail \u2013 whose coverage usually backs the prime minister and his government \u2013 has taken a particularly strong line against Johnson, simply asking: \u201cWhat planet are they on?\u201d The Telegraph has stuck closer to its usual pro-Conservative position, quoting Johnson\u2019s defence of his senior aide. Nightclubs in China have mostly come back to life as owners and customers feel increasingly comfortable the novel coronavirus epidemic is under control, but disinfectant, disposable cups and masks have become part of the experience, Reuters reports. At 44KW, a club for electronic music lovers in the financial hub of Shanghai, customers sat, danced and mingled with little sign of social distancing on the weekend. The club re-opened in mid-March after closing for about six weeks, but it took a while for business to get back to normal. \u201cThere really weren\u2019t many clients as most people were quite worried about their safety,\u201d said Charles Guo, founder of 44KW. \u201cOur client flow began to recover quickly towards the end of April\u201d, Guo said, adding that business was back to last year\u2019s average levels by mid-May. But not everything is like the old days: the club checks the temperature of every customer and gets them to register their details. Staff, including bouncers, bartenders and waiters wear masks and gloves all the time. Customers don\u2019t have to wear masks but many do. Some glasses have been replaced with plastic cups and the club has installed hand sanitizer dispensers throughout. Door handles and toilets are disinfected every hour while the entire club is disinfected every day before and after opening, Guo said. President Donald Trump has further limited travel to the US from the world\u2019s coronavirus hotspots by denying entry to foreigners coming from Brazil, which is second to the US in the number of confirmed cases. Trump had already banned certain travellers from China, Europe, the United Kingdom and Ireland and, to a lesser extent, Iran. He has not moved to ban travel from Russia, which has the world\u2019s third-highest caseload, approximately 20,000 fewer than Brazil\u2019s. The worsening situation in Latin America came as other nations started to emerge from coronavirus lockdown. Japan was expected to lift a state of emergency on Monday and India restarted domestic flights. Australia\u2019s most populous state sent children back to school for the first time since the pandemic began. The authorities in New South Wales deployed hundreds of crowd-control staff on Monday to enforce social distancing on public transport amid an expected commuter surge as schools and offices reopened and coronavirus cases fell. The Guardian\u2019s Charlotte Graham-McLay reports: New Zealand will further loosen its coronavirus lockdown restrictions from Friday, allowing gatherings - including funerals, church services and parties - to increase in size from 10 people to 100. Three weeks after a relaxation of the strictest-possible level 4 shutdown rules, prime minister Jacinda Ardern said, it was clear that a fresh wave of infection had been avoided. This was \u201ccounter to what many countries overseas have experienced,\u201d she said, adding that the curb of the virus\u2019 spread was \u201cin large part to New Zealanders sticking to the rules\u201d at levels 3 and 2 over the past few weeks. Under the current level 2 restrictions, schools and most businesses have been permitted to reopen, with strict physical distancing rules in place, but all gatherings are limited to a maximum of 10 people. That has generated criticism from some churches and those holding funeral services, who said they had expected looser rules at level 2. Ardern had earlier promised that the current rules might be relaxed if New Zealand\u2019s record with the virus \u2013 health officials have regularly reporting days of zero or one new case for the country \u2013 continued. On Monday, she said that had happened. The country\u2019s success to date in fighting the virus meant \u201cwe can now make choices others can\u2019t,\u201d Ardern added. \u201cIt\u2019s another step in re-normaisling life as we continue to stamp out the virus.\u201d Cabinet would discuss the lockdown rules again on 8 June, she said, and would consider by 22 June whether the country could safely move to the lightest, level 1 restrictions. New Zealand has recorded fewer than 1,500 confirmed cases and 21 deaths from the virus. One person is in hospital. Global cases pass 5.4m. There are currently 5,407,701 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The death toll stands at 345,036. Both figures are likely to be higher, due to differing test rates, definitions and deliberate underreporting. White House official likens China\u2019s handling of coronavirus to Chernobyl cover-up. A top White House official on Sunday likened China\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak to the Soviet Union\u2019s cover-up of the meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986. National security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien said Beijing knew what was happening with the virus, which originated in Wuhan, from November but lied to the World Health Organization and prevented outside experts from accessing information. China says virus pushing US ties to brink of \u201cCold War\u201d. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Sunday that Washington seemed infected by a \u201cpolitical virus\u201d but that Beijing would nevertheless be open to an international effort to find the coronavirus source.\u201cSome political forces in the US are taking China-US relations hostage and pushing our two countries to the brink of a new Cold War,\u201d Wang said. Dominic Cummings reported to police over lockdown breach. Boris Johnson\u2019s chief advisor is facing a possible police investigation under health laws over a claim that he breached self-isolation rules in north-east England, after a weekend of mounting pressure on the prime minister to sack his chief adviser. Boris Johnson described Cummings as acting \u201cresponsibly, legally and with integrity\u201d. World\u2019s top drug firms turned down proposals for work on pathogens like coronavirus. The world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical companies rejected an EU proposal three years ago to work on fast-tracking vaccines for pathogens like coronavirus to allow them to be developed before an outbreak. US bars travellers who have been in Brazil in last two weeks. The White House has announced it is prohibiting foreigners from traveling to the US if they had been in Brazil in the last two weeks, two days after the South American nation became the world\u2019s second-worst affected country in terms of cases. Brazil registers 15,813 new cases, 653 new deaths, taking the total number of fatalities to 22,666, the Health Ministry said. Brazil has 363,211 confirmed cases. France has lowest daily rise in new coronavirus cases and deaths since lockdown. French authorities reported the smallest daily rise in new coronavirus cases and deaths on Sunday since before a lockdown began on 17 March, raising hopes that the worst of the epidemic is over in France. The French government has discouraged citizens from travelling abroad this summer, recommending they holiday in France, the environment minister Elisabeth Borne has said. This follows Emmanuel Macron saying it was unlikely that French people would be able to undertake major foreign trips this summer. First Spanish beaches to reopen as lockdown eases. Coronavirus lockdown measures will finally be eased for people in Madrid and Barcelona from Monday, while elsewhere in Spain the first beaches are due to reopen, AFP reports. Residents in the two cities can now meet in groups of up to 10 people in their homes or on the terraces of bars and restaurants.The gates of the capital\u2019s parks will also be reopened, and major museums will be able to receive a limited number of visitors. Australian children return to school. Australia\u2019s most populous state, New South Wales, on Monday deployed hundreds of crowd control staff to enforce social distancing on public transport amid an expected commuter surge as schools and offices reopened and coronavirus cases fell. Australia has reported just over 7,100 Covid-19 infections, including 102 deaths, well below figures reported by other developed countries. New Zealand expected to further loosen lockdown restrictions. New Zealand has reported another day of no new cases of Covid-19, with the news from health officials coming hours before Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, is expected to announce further loosening of lockdown restrictions on the country. After a week of \u201czero days\u201d for the coronavirus, peppered with the odd day of one new case \u2013 most recently on Friday \u2013 New Zealand\u2019s total number of confirmed instances of Covid-19 remains under 1,500. Chile\u2019s healthcare system \u201cvery close to the limit\u201d. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said on Sunday that the country\u2019s healthcare system is under strain and \u201cvery close to the limit\u201d, as the number of confirmed novel coronavirus infections approached 70,000, after a rapid increase in recent days. The Ministry of Health reported 3,709 new cases in the last day, bringing the total to 69,102. The death toll is at 718. South Africa announces further easing of lockdown. South Africawill further relax coronavirus lockdown restrictions from 1 June, President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced, allowing large areas of the economy to fully reopen. \u201cCabinet has determined that the alert level for the whole country should be lowered from level four to level three,\u201d he said in an address broadcast on television, describing the move as a significant shift in approach to the pandemic. India resumes domestic flights despite record spike in new cases. Domestic flights will resume across India on Monday, the federal civil aviation minister has said, despite a 24-hour record increase in new cases on Sunday. The announcement follows a day of \u201chard negotiations\u201d, the minister said, after some states sought to limit the number of flights. Thousands of pro-democracy protesters assembled in Hong Kong against a controversial security law proposed by China, defying a coronavirus measure banning gatherings of more than eight people. The planned legislation is expected to ban treason, subversion and sedition, and the clashes between police and demonstrators were the most intense seen in months. Exclusive: The world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical companies rejected an EU proposal three years ago to work on fast-tracking vaccines for pathogens like coronavirus to allow them to be developed before an outbreak, the Guardian can reveal. The plan to speed up the development and approval of vaccines was put forward by European commission representatives sitting on the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) \u2013 a public-private partnership whose function is to back cutting-edge research in Europe \u2013 but it was rejected by industry partners on the body. The commission\u2019s argument had been that the research could \u201cfacilitate the development and regulatory approval of vaccines against priority pathogens, to the extent possible before an actual outbreak occurs\u201d. The pharmaceutical companies on the IMI, however, did not take up the idea. The revelation is contained in a report published by the Corporate Observatory Europe (COE), a Brussels-based research centre, examining decisions made by the IMI, which has a budget of \u20ac5bn (\u00a34.5bn), made up of EU funding and in-kind contributions from private and other bodies. Opposition leaders across Europe walk coronavirus tightrope The Guardian\u2019s Shaun Walker reports from Budapest with Kate Connolly in Berlin: Opposition politicians across Europe, from cautious centrists to firebrand populists, have had to walk a tricky political tightrope over the past two months, as coronavirus has taken over the political agenda. How to stay politically relevant while governments, even when making errors, are benefiting from a \u2018rally round the flag\u2019 effect and seeing approval ratings rise? And how to hold those governments responsible for their mistakes, without playing political games during a health crisis? \u201cIt\u2019s a very hard balance to strike, but there have been moments where we had no choice except to fight back,\u201d admitted the mayor of Budapest, Gergely Kar\u00e1csony, in a recent interview at his office. Chinas foreign minister is dismissing claims that the country is exploiting the coronavirus outbreak to expand its footprint in the South China Sea, labeling such accusations as sheer nonsense, Reuters reports. State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi told reporters at a news conference on Sunday that China was cooperating closely on anti-virus efforts with Southeast Asian countries, several of whom have overlapping territorial claims with China in the strategically vital waterway. While China has long been stepping up its presence in the region, Wang said other countries, implying the United States and its allies, have been creating instability with military flights and sea patrols. Their ill-intentioned and despicable moves are meant to sow discord between China and (Southeast Asian countries) and undermine the hard-won stability in the region, Wang said. Sydney Opera House\u2019s livestreamed concert series could be a game-changer for local bands Sydney\u2019s Vivid festival was due to light up the city on Friday but instead the city is dark and silent bar a few night-joggers ploughing the streets. There\u2019s a stir at Joan Sutherland theatre though, guitars leaning on amps ready for post-punk band Low Life\u2019s concert \u2013 the first contemporary music act to be presented as part of the opera house\u2019s digital season. At the band\u2019s request, a slab of silver bullets (Reschs Pilsener) and KFC have been delivered to the green room. The venue is permitting individual dinners only: buckets and shared fries would breach its social distancing rules. Onstage, plastic bags are puckered around each microphone and, when they\u2019re removed, engineers clap to test the audio. Say goodbye, world, to handshakes, shared Holy Communion, candles on cake and \u201cmicrophone check 1-2\u201d. New Zealand media group Stuff to be sold to chief executive Sinead Boucher for NZ$1 One of New Zealand\u2019s largest media organisations will be sold for a single dollar to its chief executive, the owners announced on Monday. Stuff prints many of the nation\u2019s daily newspapers and runs a popular news website of the same name. It employs about 900 staff, including 400 journalists. Owned by Australia\u2019s Nine Entertainment, Stuff faced financial challenges before the coronavirus pandemic struck and has since seen advertising revenues plunge. In a statement to the Australian stock market, Nine said Stuff would be sold to CEO Sinead Boucher in a management buyout deal that will be completed by the end of the month. \u201cWe have always said that we believe it is important for Stuff to have local ownership and it is our firm view that this is the best outcome for competition and consumers in New Zealand,\u201d said Hugh Marks, the CEO of Nine. Boucher said her plan is to transition the ownership by giving staff a direct stake as shareholders in the company. Coronavirus strands English-born musher in Alaska after Iditarod win Thomas Waerner won this year\u2019s Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race in March, but he is still waiting to return to his home in Norway. Waerner and his 16 dogs have been stranded in Alaska by travel restrictions and flight cancellations caused by the coronavirus pandemic, The Anchorage Daily News reported Saturday. \u201cI like Alaska a lot,\u201d Waerner said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of my dream place. But I have a family.\u201d Waerner, whose official bio states he was born in England but lives in Norway, has five children and 35 other sled dogs in rural Torpa. He missed the 10th birthday of one of his children and misses morning coffee with his wife, Guro, who left Alaska in March shortly before health restrictions stopped travel. The 47-year-old plans to fly home in early June on a DC-6 aircraft bound for the Air History Museum in Sola, Norway. Everts Air Cargo of Fairbanks is selling the historic plane, and Waerner said the museum is expected to finalize the deal this week. \u201cWe are hitchhiking,\u201d Waerner said. \u201cThe plane is going to Norway, and we are going with them. We are so lucky.\u201d Blog readers: get in touch via Twitter @helenrsullivanor email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com. Tips, questions, feedback or fun are welcome.

China said Sunday that its relations with the United States were \u201con the brink of a new Cold War,\u201d fuelled partly by tensions over the coronavirus pandemic that has killed nearly 350,000 people worldwide and pitched the global economy into a massive downturn. Fresh tensions between Beijing and Washington emerged as virus restrictions continued to shape and remake lives around the world, and in very different ways. US President Donald Trump has accused Beijing of a lack of transparency over the outbreak, suggesting the virus may have leaked from a top-security Chinese laboratory. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Sunday that Washington seemed infected by a \u201cpolitical virus\u201d but that Beijing would nevertheless be open to an international effort to find the coronavirus source. \u201cSome political forces in the US are taking China-US relations hostage and pushing our two countries to the brink of a new Cold War,\u201d Wang said. Only locals will benefit from Spain\u2019s open beaches for the time being. Travel between regions is still forbidden and foreigners arriving in Spain must quarantine for 14 days. But the government plans to reopen the borders to foreign tourists in July. The lockdown, in force since mid-March, has been among the most severe in the world. In the first few weeks, Spaniards could hardly set foot outside and their children were kept indoors. Many residents have become impatient over the government\u2019s slow and cautious process of lifting the restrictions. Thousands of people protested on Saturday by car in major Spanish cities at the call of the far-right Vox party. Drivers honked their horns, waved Spanish flags and banged on pots and pans to denounce the management of the coronavirus crisis by the left-wing government of Pedro Sanchez. Coronavirus lockdown measures will finally be eased for people in Madrid and Barcelona from Monday, while elsewhere in Spain the first beaches are due to reopen, AFP reports. Residents in the two cities can now meet in groups of up to 10 people in their homes or on the terraces of bars and restaurants. The gates of the capital\u2019s parks will also be reopened, and major museums will be able to receive a limited number of visitors. The Madrid and Barcelona regions, the most populated in the country, and a large part of Castile-Leon in the northwest are moving into the first phase of Spain\u2019s four-phase deconfinement programme, following what has been one of the strictest lockdowns in the world. These regions have been on a slower deconfinement track as they bore the brunt of the pandemic in Spain, which has killed more than 28,700 people to date, one of the world\u2019s highest tolls. Everyone must continue to wear a mask, which is already compulsory in buildings and on public streets when it is not possible to keep a distance of two metres (six feet). The rest of the country meanwhile - 22 million out of Spain\u2019s 47 million inhabitants - is moving on to the second phase, which is expected to last until the end of June. Restaurants may then reopen to a limited number of customers, and outings for walks or sports will no longer be limited to certain hours of the day. Americans defy Covid-19 social distancing rules to celebrate Memorial Day holiday Americans across the country appeared to abandon social distancing guidelines as they sunbathed on beaches and gathered for pool parties on Memorial Day weekend. The long weekend traditionally signals the start of the US summer, and despite the country\u2019s Covid-19 death toll approaching 100,000, many revellers dismissed any safety concerns to celebrate. At the Lake of the Ozarks, made famous by the television series with the same name, hundreds gathered for a pool party to enjoy the warm spring weather. Bar tables installed in the pool were filled with drinks, as people danced and apparently forgot that Covid-19 existed. Missouri, where the Ozarks are located, has had 686 deaths from Covid-19. There are currently 5,405,029 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The death toll stands at 345,036. Both figures are likely to be higher, due to differing test rates, definitions and deliberate underreporting. These are the ten worst-affected countries worldwide in terms of numbers of infections: US: 1,642,021 Brazil: 363,211 Russia: 344,481 United Kingdom: 260,916 Spain: 235,772 Italy: 229,858 France: 182,709 Germany: 180,328 Turkey: 156,827 India: 138,536 Australia\u2019s most populous state, New South Wales, on Monday deployed hundreds of crowd control staff to enforce social distancing on public transport amid an expected commuter surge as schools and offices reopened and coronavirus cases fell. Australia has reported just over 7,100 Covid-19 infections, including 102 deaths, well below figures reported by other developed countries. With fewer than 20 new Covid-19 cases most days, Australian states are pressing ahead with a three-stage plan to remove most social restrictions imposed by July. In New South Wales, which includes the city of Sydney, children returned to full-time face-to-face learning on Monday, allowing many parents to return to offices. But officials warned locals to expect travel delays, with buses and trains operating at significantly reduced capacity due to distancing requirements. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 1.2 million kids on the move,\u201d NSW Transport Minister Andrew Constance told Australia\u2019s Channel 9. \u201cWe just need everyone to be patient.\u201d With international borders likely to remain closed for months, Morrison is also pressing locals to begin holidays locally to help support Australia\u2019s tourism sector. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has spoken to the heads of the country\u2019s six big banks to get their views on the state of the economy and the Covid-19 relief efforts, the Globe and Mail reported on Sunday, citing multiple sources. This was Trudeau\u2019s first one-on-one dialogue with the CEOs since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, according to the report, which added that the calls took place around the Victoria Day long weekend. The topics covered included adjustments required in relief efforts rolled out by the government, need for further support and pressures faced by clients of the banks, the report said, adding that the talks were \u2018high-level check-ins rather than deep policy discussions\u2019. Brazil, the world\u2019s second-worst coronavirus hotspot behind the United States, registered 653 new coronavirus deaths on Sunday, taking the total number of fatalities to 22,666, the Health Ministry said. Brazil has 363,211 confirmed cases, up 15,813 from Saturday, the ministry said. The Guardian\u2019s Charlotte Graham-McLay reports: New Zealand has reported another day of no new cases of Covid-19, with the news from health officials coming hours before Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, is expected to announce further loosening of lockdown restrictions on the country. After a week of \u201czero days\u201d for the coronavirus, peppered with the odd day of one new case \u2013 most recently on Friday \u2013 New Zealand\u2019s total number of confirmed instances of Covid-19 remains under 1,500. 97% of all confirmed and probable cases of the virus have recovered, health officials said in a statement on Monday. One person in New Zealand is in hospital with Covid-19. They are not in intensive care. Ardern has drawn praise for a strict, swift lockdown of the country in late March, at a time when there were just over 200 cases and no deaths. 21 people have now died of the virus. She has slowly relaxed restrictions on the country as new case numbers have fallen, and is expected to announce today that her Cabinet has agreed gatherings can be increased to more than 10 people. She will also outline a plan to take the country from its current status of alert level 2 \u2013 out of a possible 4 \u2013 down to level 1. There is not currently a timeline in place for that to happen. Mexican health officials on Sunday reported 2,764 new cases of the novel coronavirus and 215 deaths, bringing the totals to 68,620 and 7,394, respectively. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Sunday that the novel coronavirus could cost as many as a million jobs in the country as many industries considered not essential remain shut, Reuters reports. The Mexican economy was already in recession before the pandemic struck and different investment banks have forecast contractions as large as 9% for this year with only a gradual recovery next year. \u201cMy prediction is that with coronavirus, a million jobs will be lost,\u201d Lopez Obrador said in a televised speech. \u201cBut we will create two million new jobs.\u201d The job loss number matches the estimate by the country\u2019s business coordinating council. Lopez Obrador\u2019s government repeatedly said it had the outbreak under control but since posted record numbers for new cases and deaths. Earlier this week, his government issued guidelines for restarting operations in carmaking, mining and construction in Latin America\u2019s second-largest economy that is linked to the United States and Canada through a free trade agreement. In April, the finance ministry said in an annual economic report used to guide the budget that the economy could contract by as much as 3.9% this year, adding that the numbers incorporated a \u201cdrastic\u201d impact from coronavirus. China reported 11 new imported cases yesterday, compared to three the day before, according to the People\u2019s Daily. There were 40 new asymptomatic cases, up from 36 the day before. There were no new deaths. South Africa\u2019s President Cyril Ramaphosa on Sunday said a controversial ban on the sale of alcohol would be lifted for home consumption when the country moves into level three of a five-tier coronavirus lockdown next month. South Africans were prohibited from buying alcohol and cigarettes when the country went into one of the world\u2019s strictest lockdowns on 27 March. The booze ban was meant to prevent a spike in violence and reduce pressure on emergency wards as hospitals geared up to face a virus that has infected at least 22,583 people across the country and killed 429. \u201cAlcohol will be sold for home consumption only under strict conditions on specified days and for limited hours,\u201d Ramaphosa announced in an address to the nation. \u201cThe sale of tobacco products will remain prohibited in alert level 3 due to the health risks associated with smoking,\u201d he added. South Africa started gradually easing confinement measures on 1 May, allowing citizens to exercise outdoors in the morning and some businesses to partially resume operations. Japan is considering a fresh stimulus package worth over $929bn that will consist mostly of financial aid programmes for companies hit by the coronavirus pandemic, the Nikkei newspaper said on Monday. The package, to be funded by a second extra budget for the current fiscal year beginning in April, would follow a record $1.1tn spending plan deployed last month to cushion the economic blow from the pandemic, reports Reuters. The second extra budget, worth \u00a5100tn ($929.45bn), will include \u00a560tn yen for expanding loan programmes that state-affiliated and private financial institutions offer to firms hit by virus, the paper said. Another \u00a527tn will be set aside for other financial aid programmes, including \u00a515tn for a new programme to inject capital into ailing firms, it said. The government is expected to approve the budget, which will also include subsidies to help companies pay rent and wages as they close businesses, at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam has repeatedly urged Virginia residents to cover their faces in public during the coronavirus pandemic. On Friday, he told reporters wearing a mask \u201ccould literally save someone else\u2019s life\u201d. But the Democrat did not heed his own advice on Saturday, when he posed without a mask for photographs with residents during a visit to the Virginia Beach Oceanfront. A spokeswoman for the governor\u2019s office said Northam should have had a mask. \u201cHe was outside and not expecting to be within 6ft of anyone,\u201d Alena Yarmosky said. \u201cThis is an important reminder to always have face coverings in case situations change. We are all learning how to operate in this new normal, and it\u2019s important to be prepared.\u201d Northam has suggested he will announce a statewide policy on face coverings on Tuesday. At the beach on Saturday, he told reporters his administration was still working on the details. Critics on social media chided Northam, a doctor, for not practicing what he has preached. \u201cPhysician, heal thyself,\u201d tweeted Todd Gilbert, Virginia\u2019s Republican House minority leader. Chile\u2019s healthcare system is under strain and \u201cvery close to the limit,\u201d President Sebastian Pinera said on Sunday, as the number of confirmed novel coronavirus infections approaches 70,000 after a rapid increase in recent days, Reuters reports. The Ministry of Health reported 3,709 new cases in the last day, bringing the total to 69,102. The death toll is at 718. \u201cWe are very close to the limit because we have had a very large increase in the needs and demands for medical care, and for intensive care unit beds and ventilators,\u201d Pinera said during a visit to a hospital in Santiago, which has the highest concentration of cases. More than 1,000 people have been hospitalized for disease associated with the coronavirus, according to the government. Chile, the world\u2019s top copper producer, confirmed its first case of coronavirus in early March and surpassed 50,000 infections this week. A third of Chile\u2019s population of about 19 million is under mandatory quarantine after the government put Santiago and several other cities under lockdown. Here\u2019s the full story on Robert O\u2019Brien, Donald Trump\u2019s national security adviser, accusing China of a cover-up that will \u201cgo down in history along with Chernobyl\u201d, and ramping up efforts to deflect attention from a Covid-19 death toll in the US fast closing on 100,000. A top White House official on Sunday likened China\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak to the Soviet Union\u2019s cover-up of the meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in 1986. National security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien said Beijing knew what was happening with the virus, which originated in Wuhan, from November but lied to the World Health Organization and prevented outside experts from accessing information. \u201cThey unleashed a virus on the world that\u2019s destroyed trillions of dollars in American economic wealth that we\u2019re having to spend to keep our economy alive, to keep Americans afloat during this virus,\u201d O\u2019Brien said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cThe cover-up that they did of the virus is going to go down in history, along with Chernobyl. We\u2019ll see an HBO special about it ten or 15 years from now,\u201d he added, referring to a television miniseries. The disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, in the former Soviet republic of Ukraine, released radioactive nuclear material that killed dozens of people within weeks and forced tens of thousands to flee. Moscow delayed revealing the extent of what is regarded as the worst nuclear accident in history. \u201cThis is a real problem and it cost many, many thousands of lives in America and around the world because the real information was not allowed to get out,\u201d O\u2019Brien said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cIt was a cover-up. And we\u2019ll get to the bottom of it eventually.\u201d More on the US travel ban from Brazil: The White House on Sunday broadened its travel ban against countries hard-hit by the coronavirus by denying admission to foreigners who have been in Brazil during the two-week period before they hoped to enter the US. President Donald Trump had already banned travel from the United Kingdom, Europe and China. He said last week that he was considering similar restrictions for Brazil. The ban on travel from Brazil takes effect late Thursday. As with the other bans, it does not apply to legal permanent residents. A spouse, parent or child of a US citizen or legal permanent resident also would be allowed to enter the country. The White House has announced it is prohibiting foreigners from traveling to the US if they had been in Brazil in the last two weeks, two days after the South American nation became the world No. 2 hot spot for coronavirus cases. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the new restrictions would help ensure foreign nationals do not bring additional infections to the US, but would not apply to the flow of commerce between the new countries. Brazil became the No. 2 hot spot for cases on Friday, second only to the US. Brazil has recorded over 347,000 infections, while the US has over 1.6 million. The decision follows comments by the national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, to CBS.\u201cWe hope that\u2019ll be temporary, but because of the situation in Brazil, we\u2019re going to take every step necessary to protect the American people,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live global coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan. I\u2019ll be bringing you the very latest news for the next few hours \u2013 as always, it would be great to hear from you via Twitter @helenrsullivan or email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com. Tips, questions, feedback or fun are welcome. British PM Boris Johnson has doubled down on his defence of chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, who breached lockdown rules to drive his wife, who who was suffering coronavirus symptoms, and son 425km (264 miles) to his parents\u2019 farm in Durham. Cummings is facing a possible police investigation after retired chemistry teacher Robin Lees made a complaint to the police over the breach. Meanwhile in the US, the Trump administration has barred travel from Brazil, which now has the second-highest number of confirmed cases worldwide. The White House announced it is prohibiting foreigners from traveling to the US if they had been in Brazil in the last two weeks. Here are the main developments from the last few hours: Global toll passes 340,000 The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases stands at 5,344,539, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. There have been 342,695 deaths officially linked to coronavirus around the world. Dominic Cummings reported to police over lockdown breach. Boris Johnson\u2019s chief advisor is facing a possible police investigation under health laws over a claim that he breached self-isolation rules in north-east England, after a weekend of mounting pressure on the prime minister to sack his chief adviser. Boris Johnson described Cummings as acting \u201cresponsibly, legally and with integrity\u201d. US bars travellers who have been in Brazil in last two weeks. The White House has announced it is prohibiting foreigners from traveling to the US if they had been in Brazil in the last two weeks, two days after the South American nation became the world\u2019s second-worst affected country in terms of coronavirus cases. France has lowest daily rise in new coronavirus cases and deaths since lockdown. French authorities reported the smallest daily rise in new coronavirus cases and deaths on Sunday since before a lockdown began on 17 March, raising hopes that the worst of the epidemic is over in France. The French government has discouraged citizens from travelling abroad this summer, recommending they holiday in France, the environment minister Elisabeth Borne has said. This follows Emmanuel Macron saying it was unlikely that French people would be able to undertake major foreign trips this summer. South Africa announces further easing of lockdown. South Africa will further relax coronavirus lockdown restrictions from 1 June, President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced, allowing large areas of the economy to fully reopen. \u201cCabinet has determined that the alert level for the whole country should be lowered from level four to level three,\u201d he said in an address broadcast on television, describing the move as a significant shift in approach to the pandemic. South Africa\u2019s AngloGold Ashanti has suspended operations at its Mponeng mine after at least 164 employees tested positive for coronavirus. The mining company said it had tested 650 workers at the gold mining site in Merafong, Gauteng province, after a first case was detected last week. Contact tracing and sanitisation processes are under way. India resumes domestic flights despite record spike in new cases. Domestic flights will resume across India on Monday, the federal civil aviation minister has said, despite a 24-hour record increase in new cases on Sunday. The announcement follows a day of \u201chard negotiations\u201d, the minister said, after some states sought to limit the number of flights. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Canada has risen to 84,081 from 82,892. There have been 103 more deaths, bringing the country\u2019s toll up to 6,380. German authorities are trying to trace the people who attended a church service in Frankfurt after 107 tested positive for the coronavirus. The service took place at a Baptist church on 10 May, and it is not clear whether all the 107 attended the service, or whether the figure includes those who were infected by those who did. China\u2019s top diplomat Wang Yi has said the US should stop wasting time in its fight against the coronavirus and work with China to combat it, instead of smearing the country. State councillor Wang\u2019s comments came as he expressed his sympathy to the US for the pandemic, where the death toll is approaching 100,000. Thousands of pro-democracy protesters assembled in Hong Kong against a controversial security law proposed by China, defying a coronavirus measure banning gatherings of more than eight people. The planned legislation is expected to ban treason, subversion and sedition, and the clashes between police and demonstrators were the most intense seen in months. Italy has recorded 50 new deaths \u2013 but worst-hit Lombardy\u2019s figures are missing due to late reporting. The number of new infections rose by 531, down from 669 on Saturday. There have been 32, 785 deaths and 140,479 people have recovered.",

The study is the latest to suggest genetics may play a role in why some people are more vulnerable to the coronavirus than others, and could help explain why people with dementia have been hard hit: dementia is one of the most common underlying health conditions among those who have died from Covid-19 in England and Wales. \u201cIt is not just age: this is an example of a specific gene variant causing vulnerability in some people,\u201d said David Melzer, a professor of epidemiology and public health at Exeter University and a co-author of the study.

      "bodyText": "An Australian trial of two experimental drugs to treat Covid-19 is under review after the World Health Organization halted all its trials involving hydroxychloroquine due to concerns about its efficacy and safety. The board responsible for monitoring the safety of the trial was meeting on Tuesday evening to discuss the future of the study. On Friday the Lancet published a study that found Covid-19 patients who received hydroxychloroquine were dying at higher rates and experiencing more heart-related complications than other virus patients. The large observational study analysed data from nearly 15,000 patients with Covid-19 who received the drug alone or in combination with antibiotics, comparing this data with 81,000 controls who did not receive the drug. The drug\u2019s efficacy and safety profile is known in preventing and treating malaria, and in treating some autoimmune conditions, but following the global pandemic researchers have hoped it would prove useful in tackling Covid-19. However, the findings from the Lancet and other studies, including one which found higher mortality rates in severely ill hospital patients given hydroxychloroquine, prompted the World Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to halt the hydroxychloroquine arm of the international \u201cSolidarity Trial\u201d. The trial aims to find out if existing medications can manage the virus. He said the trial would be paused while the latest safety data for hydroxychloroquine was reviewed. The Australasian Covid-19 trial (Ascot) has been recruiting patients in more than 70 hospitals in every state and territory, and 11 hospitals in New Zealand. The randomised control trial is exploring whether hydroxychloroquine in combination or on its own can treat Covid-19 patients and prevent deterioration in their condition. A spokeswoman for the Ascot trial told Guardian Australia on Tuesday the governance committee would meet on Tuesday evening to discuss the implications of the Lancet study and other data, and of the World Health Organization statement, on the future of the trial. \u201cThe governance committees of Ascot are continually reviewing all available evidence regarding treatment for Covid-19,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are currently reviewing this new evidence and implications for Ascot.\u201d A press release promoting the Ascot trial, published in April, described how \u201claboratory tests have shown that lopinavir/ritonavir, which is currently used to treat HIV, and hydroxychloroquine, used to treat arthritis and prevent and treat malaria, can stop Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, in its tracks\u201d. Philanthropy has played a significant role in funding Ascot with donations from the Royal Brisbane and Women\u2019s Hospital Foundation, and from the Pratt Foundation and Andrew Forrest\u2019s Minderoo Foundation. Meanwhile, the Therapeutic Goods Administration granted former federal politician Clive Palmer a contract to import 1m doses of the drug to add to the national medical stockpile. Despite the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee recommending against it, the health department\u2019s advice until now has been to allow the drug to be given to patients outside clinical trials, as long as they are severely ill in hospital and the drug is administered by a specialist doctor. On Tuesday a health department spokesman told Guardian Australia this advice would now change. \u201cThe department will be updating its advice that hydroxychloroquine use in treating Covid-19 is strongly discouraged including in hospitalised patients unless the patient is enrolled in a clinical trial, noting that currently numbers hospitalised in Australia are very low, at this stage only 30, and there are fewer than 500 active cases across Australia,\u201d he said. The investigators from the Lancet study warned drug regimens for Covid-19 that involve hydroxychloroquine should not be used outside clinical trials and said urgent confirmation from randomised clinical trials was needed. However, the Lancet study has been criticised for lacking rigour in its research methods and interpretation of findings, and there is general concern that strong scientific methods are being made a casualty in the rush to find treatments for the virus. Professor Marc Pellegrini, the lead investigator of Australia\u2019s Covid Shield clinical trial to determine whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent the virus, said careful consideration had been given to the evidence. \u201cWe have taken the advice of the authors of that paper who emphasise their study must be cautiously interpreted and must not be generalised with regard to the treatment (or prophylaxis) of people who are not unwell,\u201d he said. \u201cThe trial is continuing and participants are being kept well informed.\u201d",

The Spanish government also announced that it would scrap quarantine for foreign arrivals from 1 July, in the hope of helping the battered tourism sector. As gyms and swimming pools reopened in Germany, Iceland, Italy and Spain, slowing infection rates in Greece allowed restaurants to resume business a week ahead of schedule \u2013 but only for outdoor service. However, in Sweden, which has gained international attention for not enforcing stay-at-home measures, the Covid-19 death toll passed 4,000, a much higher figure than its neighbours.

The police and crime commissioner for Durham, the area Cummings visited, has formally asked police to launch an investigation. Hopes that anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine \u2013 the drug Donald Trump said he was taking as a precaution \u2013 could be used as a potential treatment for the virus have taken a hit after the WHO halted clinical trials \u201cwhile the safety is reviewed\u201d. Director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the decision was taken in light of a paper published last week that showed people taking the drug were at higher risk of death and heart problems. In other global developments: In Mexico, doubts about the accuracy of the official Covid-19 death toll are growing after Mexico City recorded more than 8,000 more deaths so far this year than the four-year average. The country\u2019s official death toll is 7,633, according to the Johns Hopkins tracker. Germany has given Lufthansa a \u20ac9bn ($9.8bn) bailout in a deal that gives Berlin a veto in the event of a hostile bid for the airline.The largest German corporate rescue since the coronavirus crisis struck will see the government get a 20% stake, which could rise to 25% plus one share in the event of a takeover attempt, as it seeks to protect thousands of jobs.

      "body": "<p>If you want to see how little the government would prefer things to change once the coronavirus pandemic has subsided, look at its immigration policy. Over the past few months the Home Office has fought hard to maintain the labyrinthine bureaucracy, exorbitant fees and harsh punishments that govern the lives of migrants from outside the European Union. Rules that ban some people from accessing NHS treatment, food banks and emergency housing have <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2020/may/the-hostile-environment-continued\">only been partially eased</a>; while detention centres have not been <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52560093\">fully evacuated</a>, and the Home Office has been accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/06/home-office-accused-of-pressuring-judiciary-over-immigration-decisions\">putting pressure on immigration judges</a> releasing detainees on bail. Concessions for NHS and care workers, meanwhile \u2013 on visa extensions for bereaved families, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/21/a-timeline-of-the-pms-u-turn-on-the-nhs-surcharge-a-timeline-of-pms-u-turn-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers\">lifting the immigration health surcharge</a> \u2013 have only been made haltingly, after pressure from the public, the Labour party and even some Conservative MPs.</p> <p>The government has pushed ahead with its plans to extend much of this migration system to include EU citizens. The home secretary, Priti Patel, who has previously been criticised for <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/priti-patel-home-office-asylum-seekers-detention-coronavirus-a9480036.html\">avoiding scrutiny</a> during the crisis, began a publicity drive for the second reading of the new immigration bill. \u201cThis historic piece of legislation,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1283319/priti-patel-news-immigration-EU-free-movement-brexit\">Patel wrote</a> in the Express, \u201cends the European Union\u2019s free movement of people and lays the foundations to build a fairer, firmer, skills-led points-based immigration system.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Labour rightly pointed out the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of pushing through legislation that will prevent many health and care workers find work</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The bill, which passed its second reading in a parliamentary vote on 18 May, is being presented as the fulfilment of the central demand of Brexit voters. But it is better described as a leap in the dark. Rather than setting out what the new immigration system \u2013 due to come into force in January 2021 \u2013 will look like, it gives the government powers to amend the law as it sees fit, without bringing it back to parliament for full scrutiny. Key areas remain undetermined, such as rights to family union and permanent settlement, visas for NHS workers, and the treatment of trafficking victims and asylum seekers. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) <a href=\"https://www.jcwi.org.uk/immigration-bill-2020-second-reading-briefing\">describes</a> the bill as a \u201cblank cheque\u201d that will transfer EU citizens into \u201cthe same system as non-EU nationals which is dysfunctional and chaotic, with a long history of incorrect decision-making\u201d.</p> <p>To many people, the bill will seem an entirely fair proposition. It purports to offer a system based on merit \u2013 where \u201cpeople can come here based on their skills, not where they\u2019re from\u201d, as a slogan floating above the union jack, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pritipatel/status/1262430422954389504\">tweeted by Patel</a>, puts it. High earners and people with certain specialisms, such as research scientists, are in; \u201clower-skilled\u201d workers, who have jobs with salaries below \u00a325,600, are not. But this rests on a claim that has been exposed as false by the pandemic, which is that \u201clow-skilled\u201d workers are worth less to society, and easily replaced.</p> <p>Labour, which voted against the government on the second reading, rightly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/18/tories-accused-of-hypocrisy-over-key-workers-with-immigration-bill\">pointed out</a> the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of pushing through legislation that will prevent many health and care workers find work in the UK in future, and leaves a question hanging over the visas of some already here, even as these workers are publicly celebrated for their role during the pandemic.</p> <p>In truth, the contradiction was beginning to show even before Covid-19 arrived. When the immigration bill last came up for public discussion in February, a series of industry representatives warned they would face dire shortages if they were expected to replace workers from the EU by the start of next year. The public services union Unison warned of \u201cabsolute disaster\u201d in the care sector, while farmers and builders also said they would face labour shortages. At the time, Patel\u2019s response was that businesses should focus on training up the 8.5 million \u201ceconomically inactive\u201d people already resident in the UK, a figure that critics soon <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/51560120\">pointed out</a> was largely composed of people who were too old or too sick to work, or who were students or carers.</p> <p>This stance was regarded by some as a gaffe, yet it is consistent with Patel\u2019s ideology. Since becoming home secretary last year, she has openly positioned herself as an heir to Margaret Thatcher: so far the most prominent part of this has been her hardline stance on borders and crime, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/11/reckless-tory-pantomime-authoritarianism-thatcherism\">displayed</a>, for instance, at last October\u2019s Conservative party conference. But she is also an acolyte of Thatcherite economics. Patel, along with other ministers including the foreign secretary Dominic Raab, is a co-author of Britannia Unchained, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\">2012 book</a> by what was then a new crop of rightwing Conservative MPs who argued that the UK should strip away employment laws and other state protections to better compete with rival global economies. \u201cThe British are among the worst idlers in the world,\u201d the authors infamously declared.</p> <p>Although ending EU free movement has sometimes been dressed up as a way to protect British workers\u2019 interests, this is far from the government\u2019s primary concern. What\u2019s more likely is that it expects British residents to assume the same low-paid and precarious jobs that were previously being filled by immigrants from elsewhere in the EU. And when that proves impossible, the government will most likely look to create temporary exceptions that allow immigrants to take up jobs in sectors where there are labour shortages.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/nhs-surcharge-migrant-staff-government-campaign\">The NHS surcharge for migrant staff is gone. Why did it take such a fight? | Nesrine Malik</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unlike free movement, which at least gave EU workers the choice to come and go as they please and to look for other jobs when they were mistreated, these exceptions will come with heavy restrictions on migrants\u2019 rights \u2013 time limits, visa conditions, bans on accessing state support \u2013 that make it easier for employers to push them around, or for traffickers and abusers to exploit them.

      "bodyText": "If you want to see how little the government would prefer things to change once the coronavirus pandemic has subsided, look at its immigration policy. Over the past few months the Home Office has fought hard to maintain the labyrinthine bureaucracy, exorbitant fees and harsh punishments that govern the lives of migrants from outside the European Union. Rules that ban some people from accessing NHS treatment, food banks and emergency housing have only been partially eased; while detention centres have not been fully evacuated, and the Home Office has been accused of putting pressure on immigration judges releasing detainees on bail. Concessions for NHS and care workers, meanwhile \u2013 on visa extensions for bereaved families, or lifting the immigration health surcharge \u2013 have only been made haltingly, after pressure from the public, the Labour party and even some Conservative MPs. The government has pushed ahead with its plans to extend much of this migration system to include EU citizens. The home secretary, Priti Patel, who has previously been criticised for avoiding scrutiny during the crisis, began a publicity drive for the second reading of the new immigration bill. \u201cThis historic piece of legislation,\u201d Patel wrote in the Express, \u201cends the European Union\u2019s free movement of people and lays the foundations to build a fairer, firmer, skills-led points-based immigration system.\u201d The bill, which passed its second reading in a parliamentary vote on 18 May, is being presented as the fulfilment of the central demand of Brexit voters. But it is better described as a leap in the dark. Rather than setting out what the new immigration system \u2013 due to come into force in January 2021 \u2013 will look like, it gives the government powers to amend the law as it sees fit, without bringing it back to parliament for full scrutiny. Key areas remain undetermined, such as rights to family union and permanent settlement, visas for NHS workers, and the treatment of trafficking victims and asylum seekers. The Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) describes the bill as a \u201cblank cheque\u201d that will transfer EU citizens into \u201cthe same system as non-EU nationals which is dysfunctional and chaotic, with a long history of incorrect decision-making\u201d. To many people, the bill will seem an entirely fair proposition. It purports to offer a system based on merit \u2013 where \u201cpeople can come here based on their skills, not where they\u2019re from\u201d, as a slogan floating above the union jack, tweeted by Patel, puts it. High earners and people with certain specialisms, such as research scientists, are in; \u201clower-skilled\u201d workers, who have jobs with salaries below \u00a325,600, are not. But this rests on a claim that has been exposed as false by the pandemic, which is that \u201clow-skilled\u201d workers are worth less to society, and easily replaced. Labour, which voted against the government on the second reading, rightly pointed out the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of pushing through legislation that will prevent many health and care workers find work in the UK in future, and leaves a question hanging over the visas of some already here, even as these workers are publicly celebrated for their role during the pandemic. In truth, the contradiction was beginning to show even before Covid-19 arrived. When the immigration bill last came up for public discussion in February, a series of industry representatives warned they would face dire shortages if they were expected to replace workers from the EU by the start of next year. The public services union Unison warned of \u201cabsolute disaster\u201d in the care sector, while farmers and builders also said they would face labour shortages. At the time, Patel\u2019s response was that businesses should focus on training up the 8.5 million \u201ceconomically inactive\u201d people already resident in the UK, a figure that critics soon pointed out was largely composed of people who were too old or too sick to work, or who were students or carers. This stance was regarded by some as a gaffe, yet it is consistent with Patel\u2019s ideology. Since becoming home secretary last year, she has openly positioned herself as an heir to Margaret Thatcher: so far the most prominent part of this has been her hardline stance on borders and crime, displayed, for instance, at last October\u2019s Conservative party conference. But she is also an acolyte of Thatcherite economics. Patel, along with other ministers including the foreign secretary Dominic Raab, is a co-author of Britannia Unchained, the 2012 book by what was then a new crop of rightwing Conservative MPs who argued that the UK should strip away employment laws and other state protections to better compete with rival global economies. \u201cThe British are among the worst idlers in the world,\u201d the authors infamously declared. Although ending EU free movement has sometimes been dressed up as a way to protect British workers\u2019 interests, this is far from the government\u2019s primary concern. What\u2019s more likely is that it expects British residents to assume the same low-paid and precarious jobs that were previously being filled by immigrants from elsewhere in the EU. And when that proves impossible, the government will most likely look to create temporary exceptions that allow immigrants to take up jobs in sectors where there are labour shortages. Unlike free movement, which at least gave EU workers the choice to come and go as they please and to look for other jobs when they were mistreated, these exceptions will come with heavy restrictions on migrants\u2019 rights \u2013 time limits, visa conditions, bans on accessing state support \u2013 that make it easier for employers to push them around, or for traffickers and abusers to exploit them. This already happens with many low-paid migrant workers from outside the EU, and the conditions are being set for a repeat. The JCWI warns that a temporary visa scheme for seasonal agricultural workers, which the government plans to expand to make up for the shortfall once free movement ends, is ripe for exploitation, and that workers \u201cwill have no meaningful way of challenging abusive employers\u201d. This isn\u2019t just an issue for the UK: countries around the world have belatedly discovered the need for people who clean, care and provide food, even though they are frequently underpaid and their jobs frequently reserved for those societies find easier to exploit: migrants from poorer countries and regions, women, and people from minority ethnic backgrounds. The pressure to keep these jobs going during a pandemic has opened up a debate in many countries about how they are valued: undocumented migrant workers in southern Europe and the US; Romanians flown in to pick western European crops; Ukrainians desperate to avoid travel restrictions to work in Poland. In a recent essay, the labour researchers Sara Farris and Mark Bergfeld suggest that we stop calling the jobs that underpin the economy \u201clow-skilled\u201d and instead describe them as \u201clife-making\u201d. They have proved essential to our survival, and it is only right that they should be treated as such with good pay and conditions, and that the people who move around to do them should be free of harassment by the state. Any government that uses immigration control to dodge this central issue is ripping workers off, whatever their nationality. \u2022 Daniel Trilling is the author of Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the Borders of Europe and Bloody Nasty People: the Rise of Britain\u2019s Far Right",

Some countries are considering a green recovery from the crisis by attaching stern conditions to any bailouts for fossil fuel-dependent industries, such as aviation, and by pumping money into infrastructure that reduces greenhouse gases, from broadband for remote working to better cycle lanes and electric vehicle charging points. A recent study from Oxford University found this would yield more jobs and a better return on public investment than returning to business as usual. \u201cHealth professionals are at the frontlines of this emergency, and we are seeing the immense loss of lives because of acting too late,\u201d said Miguel Jorge, the president of the World Medical Association. \u201cWe know now more than ever that healthy lives depend on a healthy planet. As we walk on the road to recovery, we need to build a system that will protect us from further damage. We need a healthy and green recovery.\u201d Health professionals are concerned that the world will resume its unhealthy practices as the immediate impacts of the coronavirus fade, without learning the lessons needed to put us on a healthier path that would reduce the likelihood of such devastating pandemics in future, as well as reducing illness from other causes and staving off climate breakdown. \u201cCovid-19 has forced the world to pause and take stock, providing us with a unique opportunity to make changes that will benefit the planet and all the people on it,\u201d said Annette Kennedy, president of the International Council of Nurses. \u201cClimate change poses an imminent and serious threat to the health of the world\u2019s population. We are calling on governments to make sure that pollution levels do not return to previous levels, so that our children and grandchildren will be able to grow up healthily in a liveable and sustainable climate. Only by investing in both healthcare and the environment can we create a sustainable future.\u201d The signatories include the World Medical Association, the International Council of Nurses, the Commonwealth Nurses and Midwives Federation, the World Organization of Family Doctors and the World Federation of Public Health Associations, as well as thousands of individual health professionals. The letter has been sent to all G20 leaders, including Boris Johnson, Angela Merkel and Xi Jinping, who are under pressure to approve a green recovery, as well as those who have been criticised for a lax approach to the crisis or for using it to weaken environmental protections, including Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and Jair Bolsonaro.",

      "body": "<p>It was Thursday night, 8pm. Clap for our carers: the sound of applause rising in the air. Leila was doing her rounds of the Waitrose in west London where she works as a store supervisor, rounding up the stragglers. An expensively dressed young woman was browsing the aisles. Leila asked her to make her way to the tills, as the store was now closed.</p> <p>The woman erupted in rage. \u201cShe said: \u2018There\u2019s a fucking pandemic, can\u2019t you have a little patience?\u2019\u201d Leila remembers. \u201cI thought: \u2018I am working through this pandemic. You\u2019re just shopping in it.\u2019\u201d Shaking with anger, Leila fetched a security guard, who escorted the woman to the tills. Leaving work that evening, the irony of being verbally abused during the weekly celebration of key workers was not lost on her.</p> <p>\u201cThe public has this sanitised image of what a key worker is,\u201d Leila says. \u201cThey think a key worker is a consultant in a suit, or a nurse in scrubs. They don\u2019t consider us key workers \u2013 they just think we\u2019re unskilled. There have been so many instances of people getting frustrated, angry, taking things out on us.\u201d She sounds fatigued. \u201cYou just feel kind of empty about it, I guess.\u201d</p> <p>But supermarket workers <em>are</em> key workers, exempt from the lockdown restrictions that have kept so many of us at home over recent months. And as essential workers, they were there for the initial panic-buying through to our bread-baking mania and everything in between. No one is better placed to comment on how we, as a nation, responded to the coronavirus crisis than our supermarket workers. </p> <p>\u201cOh man,\u201d remembers Alex Hogan<strong>,</strong> of those March stockpiling days. \u201cThe panic-buying was just crazy.\u201d Hogan, who is 22 and lives in North Ayrshire, works as a checkout operator at the biggest Tesco in Scotland, in the south of Glasgow. \u201cPeople would be pushing past each other in the aisles, and they would become quite protective of their shopping, as well,\u201d Hogan says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ac23ca7d8083ff62704da47abd607e92190ba32d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac23ca7d8083ff62704da47abd607e92190ba32d/0_0_3937_2363/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018One manager told me he didn\u2019t even try to put toilet paper on the shelves.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018One manager told me he didn\u2019t even try to put toilet paper on the shelves.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For about a fortnight, Britain became a nation obsessed with loo roll. And antibacterial hand gel. And soap. And pasta. And tinned goods. But mostly loo roll. \u201cPeople were like animals,\u201d Leila says. \u201cThey were just going for the toilet paper the minute they saw it.\u201d In her branch of Waitrose, only managers were allowed to replenish the pasta and toilet paper during those initial weeks. \u201cOne of my managers told me that he didn\u2019t even try to put the toilet paper on the shelves \u2013 he just left it on the crate,\u201d Leila says. \u201cPeople were taking it the minute it was out. There was such a swarm of people.\u201d</p> <p>During this period, some shoppers behaved disgracefully \u2013 particularly after the major supermarket chains brought in restrictions on how many items shoppers could purchase in an effort to curb stockpiling. \u201cAround the time they brought in the restrictions I had some of the least enjoyable shifts I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d says Warren, a general assistant at one of the big four supermarkets (he prefers not to say which) in Gloucestershire. Like Leila and Hogan, he got in touch after a Guardian callout for supermarket workers. Warren had to tell one customer that he could only buy three tins of tomato soup, not 20. This did not go down well, and the customer demanded that Warren brought over his supervisor. When Warren\u2019s supervisor confirmed that, yes, he could only purchase three tins, he demanded to speak to the store manager, who said the same thing.</p> <p>Had he behaved more respectfully, Warren would have told the customer that he could have circumvented the restrictions by buying tomato soup from different brands. But he was so rude, Warren didn\u2019t want to. \u201cThat\u2019s a weird feeling for me,\u201d says Warren, \u201cbecause even though this isn\u2019t a great job \u2013 it\u2019s not well paid and you can\u2019t afford much, or any, quality of life, really, on the minimum wage \u2013 it\u2019s still a job. I take pride in what I do. I want to help people. But when customers are shouting and causing a fuss, you don\u2019t want to help them.\u201d</p> <p>It was not just the customers piling on the pressure during those early days. \u201cThe managers were blasting out the orders,\u201d says Gavin, a warehouse worker and shop-floor replenisher at a big supermarket near Cardiff. \u201cEspecially because a lot of people were off sick, they hadn\u2019t recruited enough extra staff, so they were having to push a depleted workforce. They\u2019d be pressuring staff on headphones to put more items on the shelves.\u201d For some of Gavin\u2019s colleagues, it was too much. \u201cThey\u2019d be coming up to me, stressed out of their heads, because after an eight-hour shift the tensions and frustrations with customers and managers was so high.\u201d</p> <p>Gavin\u2019s experience is not unique. \u201cEven before coronavirus, there had been a rising problem of violence and abuse to supermarket staff,\u201d says Doug Russell of the USDAW union, which represents approximately 260,000 shop workers, including staff from Tesco, Morrisons, Sainsbury\u2019s, Co-op and Asda. \u201cUnfortunately, the Covid-19 crisis added to that, because it required shop workers to limit the numbers of people going into stores and enforce social distancing and restriction on sales of products, which can be flashpoints for abuse.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8474f2f3b6fc12453ea746004a852d7358cec1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8474f2f3b6fc12453ea746004a852d7358cec1c/61_0_5710_3426/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shoppers queueing at an Asda in Gateshead.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shoppers queueing at an Asda in Gateshead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is evidence that supermarket staff feel stress more acutely than other frontline workers. Dr Rachel Sumner of the University of Gloucestershire has been conducting research into the health and wellbeing of frontline workers during the pandemic. Of the 1,300 people who responded to her survey, about 86 were supermarket staff. \u201cThese workers had higher levels of burnout and lower levels of wellbeing than both other types of frontline workers, and population norms,\u201d says Sumner. Additionally, supermarket staff were less likely to think the government\u2019s response had been timely and effective than those from the emergency services.</p> <p>Sumner speculates that the burnout and poor wellbeing are due to the fact that most supermarket staff didn\u2019t plan to be on the frontline in any conventional sense. Unlike medicine, nursing or police work, supermarket jobs are predominantly minimum-wage, without the higher earnings, benefits or sense of vocation enjoyed by many emergency personnel. \u201cThe thing is, these people never thought they would be on the frontline of a pandemic,\u201d says Sumner. \u201cYour police officer or nurse, to a certain extent, they expect to be frontline. But a checkout worker or Amazon delivery guy, they never expected they would be getting spat on or shouted at.\u201d</p> <p>But it has not all been abuse. After the stockpiling abated, and the restrictions were lifted, the British public settled into a kind of equilibrium. \u201cWhen everyone was panic-buying, people were a lot more abusive,\u201d says Hogan. \u201cBut when clap for our carers came in, people stopped doing that as much.\u201d She\u2019s noticed customers are more talkative than usual. \u201cI\u2019ve had customers tell me they live on their own,\u201d Hogan says, \u201cand they seem quite lonely. And then there are parents who tell me they\u2019re trying to home school their kids, and they\u2019re stressed out. I think people miss having that human interaction they\u2019d have from seeing their friends and going to work.\u201d</p> <p>But, with normal order being restored, physical distancing rules are starting to be ignored by some members of the public, as is the government recommendation to shop as infrequently as possible. \u201cThe majority of people are still social distancing,\u201d says Russell, \u201cbut many aren\u2019t. And the more we get confused messages about lockdown being relaxed, the more problematic it gets for workers in shops, because you get more people wanting to nip in for something quickly.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1975553db40a17cbf8d1de211115e8336af50020\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1975553db40a17cbf8d1de211115e8336af50020/0_187_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Distancing rules are starting to be ignored by some members of the public.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Distancing rules are starting to be ignored by some members of the public.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Childs/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All of the supermarket workers I speak to agree. \u201cHow do you stop customers coming right up to you and asking you for the frozen peas?\u201d muses Gavin. \u201cWhen they\u2019re in the store, they want to get out of there as quickly as possible. They take no notice of the signage, they ignore the two-metre rule \u2026 There\u2019s a melee to get in and out as fast as they can.\u201d Now, when customers approach him, he holds out the palm of his hand, like a police officer stopping traffic. \u201cMy first instinct was to ask them not to come up so close,\u201d Gavin says, \u201cbut by the time you ask politely, they\u2019ve already ignored you. All they see is a uniform, not a person, and all they care about is finding an item.\u201d</p> <p>Inevitably, working in an enclosed space such as a supermarket will increase a worker\u2019s risk of contracting Covid-19. Recent data from the Office for National Statistics shows that male sales and retail workers have Covid-19 death rates that are twice the national average. Distribution of personal protective equipment (PPE) varies among the major supermarket chains: Warren has been given rubber gloves, but they make it difficult to operate the self-scan tills, which ends up annoying customers.</p> <p>One worker at an Asda in south Wales told me staff had been given no form of PPE whatsoever. \u201cAfter about four weeks some bottles of hand sanitiser appeared in the rest rooms, but we\u2019ve been given no individual hand sanitiser,\u201d he says. \u201cI get paid \u00a39 an hour to put my life on the line,\u201d says the worker, whose age (he is in his 60s) puts him in the higher-risk group for coronavirus. \u201cThat\u2019s not being over the top about it. We are putting our lives on the line, for \u00a39 an hour.\u201d</p> <p>In response, Asda commented: \u201cWe have worked with our colleagues to provide them with extensive support throughout this period and we are proud of the work they are doing every day to serve customers. Although colleagues haven\u2019t raised concerns with us \u2026 we\u2019re doing everything possible to support them as they carry out their vital roles, such as providing gloves, masks and Perspex screens.\u201d</p> <p>Of all the supermarkets, Waitrose appears to have been the best when it comes to offering PPE to staff. \u201cThey\u2019ve given us masks and visors, gloves, loads of sanitiser, and we have protective screens at all the checkouts,\u201d Leila concedes. \u201cI can\u2019t fault them.\u201d</p> <p>Hogan\u2019s mother is in a high-risk group for coronavirus as a result of a kidney transplant. When she gets home from work, Hogan takes off all her clothes at the front door, and showers immediately. But she worries it\u2019s not enough. \u201cMy mum hasn\u2019t been going out,\u201d Hogan says, \u201cso if she was to get symptoms, I know it would come from me. I\u2019m a bit anxious. I have to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen, which is why I\u2019m super-careful.\u201d</p> <p>As for the wider public, what better indication of how they are coping than their shopping baskets? In the Waitrose where Leila works, the predominantly middle-class customers have sought comfort in familiar pleasures. \u201cWe sold out of Charlie Bigham\u2019s ready meals really quickly,\u201d Leila says. \u201cAnother hilarious thing we sold out of is manuka honey \u2013 I think because coronavirus has respiratory symptoms. Everyone\u2019s buying a lot of alcohol and fancy meat.\u201d One customer kicked up a fuss because they had purchased \u00a33,000 of wine but couldn\u2019t get a delivery slot.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"488d6304bff1f499d4673b4118fca5707a7b2b5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/488d6304bff1f499d4673b4118fca5707a7b2b5f/0_55_4918_2951/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Waitrose appears to have been the best when it comes to offering PPE to staff.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Waitrose appears to have been the best when it comes to offering PPE to staff.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But there are more subtle indicators that all is not well. Shoplifting is up, for a start. \u201cI think because security is so busy manning the queue, there are a lot more shoplifters,\u201d says Leila. \u201cTwo weeks ago, someone nearly got away with \u00a3500 worth of alcohol.\u201d In addition to the professional shoplifters, who target high-value items such as alcohol and meat, and steal to order, Gavin has noticed more \u201cpilfering\u201d: shoplifting cheaper minor essentials. \u201cI think it\u2019s people who are now suffering economically who are taking things because they can\u2019t afford to pay for them,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople haven\u2019t been paid for a while, and they\u2019ve come to the supermarket and for the first time in their life perhaps they\u2019ve been hungry and stolen something.\u201d</p> <p>The pilfering, the rudeness, the stockpiling and more: truly, the supermarket worker saw it all. And having a front-row seat during this period of national crisis has been a simultaneously heartening and dispiriting experience. \u201cI\u2019ve had people say: \u2018You\u2019re doing really important work,\u2019\u201d says Warren. \u201cBut as with life in general, you tend to remember the bad stuff \u2013 the customer who called you a twat, rather than the one who patted you on the back.\u201d</p> <p>Hogan hopes that the lockdown will usher in an era of greater respect for low-paid workers. \u201cBefore, when people would ask what I do, they would be quite judgmental,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019d say: \u2018Why don\u2019t you do something else?\u2019\u201d Not any more. \u201cPeople will come up to me and say: \u2018Thank you for being on the checkout.\u2019 I\u2019ve never had that before.\u201d She sounds surprised. \u201cI just hope it lasts.\u201d</p> <p><em>Some names have been changed. </em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 May 2020 because Dr Rachel Sumner\u2019s research measured workers for low wellbeing, not stress as an earlier version said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was Thursday night, 8pm. Clap for our carers: the sound of applause rising in the air. Leila was doing her rounds of the Waitrose in west London where she works as a store supervisor, rounding up the stragglers. An expensively dressed young woman was browsing the aisles. Leila asked her to make her way to the tills, as the store was now closed. The woman erupted in rage. \u201cShe said: \u2018There\u2019s a fucking pandemic, can\u2019t you have a little patience?\u2019\u201d Leila remembers. \u201cI thought: \u2018I am working through this pandemic. You\u2019re just shopping in it.\u2019\u201d Shaking with anger, Leila fetched a security guard, who escorted the woman to the tills. Leaving work that evening, the irony of being verbally abused during the weekly celebration of key workers was not lost on her. \u201cThe public has this sanitised image of what a key worker is,\u201d Leila says. \u201cThey think a key worker is a consultant in a suit, or a nurse in scrubs. They don\u2019t consider us key workers \u2013 they just think we\u2019re unskilled. There have been so many instances of people getting frustrated, angry, taking things out on us.\u201d She sounds fatigued. \u201cYou just feel kind of empty about it, I guess.\u201d But supermarket workers are key workers, exempt from the lockdown restrictions that have kept so many of us at home over recent months. And as essential workers, they were there for the initial panic-buying through to our bread-baking mania and everything in between. No one is better placed to comment on how we, as a nation, responded to the coronavirus crisis than our supermarket workers. \u201cOh man,\u201d remembers Alex Hogan, of those March stockpiling days. \u201cThe panic-buying was just crazy.\u201d Hogan, who is 22 and lives in North Ayrshire, works as a checkout operator at the biggest Tesco in Scotland, in the south of Glasgow. \u201cPeople would be pushing past each other in the aisles, and they would become quite protective of their shopping, as well,\u201d Hogan says. For about a fortnight, Britain became a nation obsessed with loo roll. And antibacterial hand gel. And soap. And pasta. And tinned goods. But mostly loo roll. \u201cPeople were like animals,\u201d Leila says. \u201cThey were just going for the toilet paper the minute they saw it.\u201d In her branch of Waitrose, only managers were allowed to replenish the pasta and toilet paper during those initial weeks. \u201cOne of my managers told me that he didn\u2019t even try to put the toilet paper on the shelves \u2013 he just left it on the crate,\u201d Leila says. \u201cPeople were taking it the minute it was out. There was such a swarm of people.\u201d During this period, some shoppers behaved disgracefully \u2013 particularly after the major supermarket chains brought in restrictions on how many items shoppers could purchase in an effort to curb stockpiling. \u201cAround the time they brought in the restrictions I had some of the least enjoyable shifts I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d says Warren, a general assistant at one of the big four supermarkets (he prefers not to say which) in Gloucestershire. Like Leila and Hogan, he got in touch after a Guardian callout for supermarket workers. Warren had to tell one customer that he could only buy three tins of tomato soup, not 20. This did not go down well, and the customer demanded that Warren brought over his supervisor. When Warren\u2019s supervisor confirmed that, yes, he could only purchase three tins, he demanded to speak to the store manager, who said the same thing. Had he behaved more respectfully, Warren would have told the customer that he could have circumvented the restrictions by buying tomato soup from different brands. But he was so rude, Warren didn\u2019t want to. \u201cThat\u2019s a weird feeling for me,\u201d says Warren, \u201cbecause even though this isn\u2019t a great job \u2013 it\u2019s not well paid and you can\u2019t afford much, or any, quality of life, really, on the minimum wage \u2013 it\u2019s still a job. I take pride in what I do. I want to help people. But when customers are shouting and causing a fuss, you don\u2019t want to help them.\u201d It was not just the customers piling on the pressure during those early days. \u201cThe managers were blasting out the orders,\u201d says Gavin, a warehouse worker and shop-floor replenisher at a big supermarket near Cardiff. \u201cEspecially because a lot of people were off sick, they hadn\u2019t recruited enough extra staff, so they were having to push a depleted workforce. They\u2019d be pressuring staff on headphones to put more items on the shelves.\u201d For some of Gavin\u2019s colleagues, it was too much. \u201cThey\u2019d be coming up to me, stressed out of their heads, because after an eight-hour shift the tensions and frustrations with customers and managers was so high.\u201d Gavin\u2019s experience is not unique. \u201cEven before coronavirus, there had been a rising problem of violence and abuse to supermarket staff,\u201d says Doug Russell of the USDAW union, which represents approximately 260,000 shop workers, including staff from Tesco, Morrisons, Sainsbury\u2019s, Co-op and Asda. \u201cUnfortunately, the Covid-19 crisis added to that, because it required shop workers to limit the numbers of people going into stores and enforce social distancing and restriction on sales of products, which can be flashpoints for abuse.\u201d There is evidence that supermarket staff feel stress more acutely than other frontline workers. Dr Rachel Sumner of the University of Gloucestershire has been conducting research into the health and wellbeing of frontline workers during the pandemic. Of the 1,300 people who responded to her survey, about 86 were supermarket staff. \u201cThese workers had higher levels of burnout and lower levels of wellbeing than both other types of frontline workers, and population norms,\u201d says Sumner. Additionally, supermarket staff were less likely to think the government\u2019s response had been timely and effective than those from the emergency services. Sumner speculates that the burnout and poor wellbeing are due to the fact that most supermarket staff didn\u2019t plan to be on the frontline in any conventional sense. Unlike medicine, nursing or police work, supermarket jobs are predominantly minimum-wage, without the higher earnings, benefits or sense of vocation enjoyed by many emergency personnel. \u201cThe thing is, these people never thought they would be on the frontline of a pandemic,\u201d says Sumner. \u201cYour police officer or nurse, to a certain extent, they expect to be frontline. But a checkout worker or Amazon delivery guy, they never expected they would be getting spat on or shouted at.\u201d But it has not all been abuse. After the stockpiling abated, and the restrictions were lifted, the British public settled into a kind of equilibrium. \u201cWhen everyone was panic-buying, people were a lot more abusive,\u201d says Hogan. \u201cBut when clap for our carers came in, people stopped doing that as much.\u201d She\u2019s noticed customers are more talkative than usual. \u201cI\u2019ve had customers tell me they live on their own,\u201d Hogan says, \u201cand they seem quite lonely. And then there are parents who tell me they\u2019re trying to home school their kids, and they\u2019re stressed out. I think people miss having that human interaction they\u2019d have from seeing their friends and going to work.\u201d But, with normal order being restored, physical distancing rules are starting to be ignored by some members of the public, as is the government recommendation to shop as infrequently as possible. \u201cThe majority of people are still social distancing,\u201d says Russell, \u201cbut many aren\u2019t. And the more we get confused messages about lockdown being relaxed, the more problematic it gets for workers in shops, because you get more people wanting to nip in for something quickly.\u201d All of the supermarket workers I speak to agree. \u201cHow do you stop customers coming right up to you and asking you for the frozen peas?\u201d muses Gavin. \u201cWhen they\u2019re in the store, they want to get out of there as quickly as possible. They take no notice of the signage, they ignore the two-metre rule \u2026 There\u2019s a melee to get in and out as fast as they can.\u201d Now, when customers approach him, he holds out the palm of his hand, like a police officer stopping traffic. \u201cMy first instinct was to ask them not to come up so close,\u201d Gavin says, \u201cbut by the time you ask politely, they\u2019ve already ignored you. All they see is a uniform, not a person, and all they care about is finding an item.\u201d Inevitably, working in an enclosed space such as a supermarket will increase a worker\u2019s risk of contracting Covid-19. Recent data from the Office for National Statistics shows that male sales and retail workers have Covid-19 death rates that are twice the national average. Distribution of personal protective equipment (PPE) varies among the major supermarket chains: Warren has been given rubber gloves, but they make it difficult to operate the self-scan tills, which ends up annoying customers. One worker at an Asda in south Wales told me staff had been given no form of PPE whatsoever. \u201cAfter about four weeks some bottles of hand sanitiser appeared in the rest rooms, but we\u2019ve been given no individual hand sanitiser,\u201d he says. \u201cI get paid \u00a39 an hour to put my life on the line,\u201d says the worker, whose age (he is in his 60s) puts him in the higher-risk group for coronavirus. \u201cThat\u2019s not being over the top about it. We are putting our lives on the line, for \u00a39 an hour.\u201d In response, Asda commented: \u201cWe have worked with our colleagues to provide them with extensive support throughout this period and we are proud of the work they are doing every day to serve customers. Although colleagues haven\u2019t raised concerns with us \u2026 we\u2019re doing everything possible to support them as they carry out their vital roles, such as providing gloves, masks and Perspex screens.\u201d Of all the supermarkets, Waitrose appears to have been the best when it comes to offering PPE to staff. \u201cThey\u2019ve given us masks and visors, gloves, loads of sanitiser, and we have protective screens at all the checkouts,\u201d Leila concedes. \u201cI can\u2019t fault them.\u201d Hogan\u2019s mother is in a high-risk group for coronavirus as a result of a kidney transplant. When she gets home from work, Hogan takes off all her clothes at the front door, and showers immediately. But she worries it\u2019s not enough. \u201cMy mum hasn\u2019t been going out,\u201d Hogan says, \u201cso if she was to get symptoms, I know it would come from me. I\u2019m a bit anxious. I have to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen, which is why I\u2019m super-careful.\u201d As for the wider public, what better indication of how they are coping than their shopping baskets? In the Waitrose where Leila works, the predominantly middle-class customers have sought comfort in familiar pleasures. \u201cWe sold out of Charlie Bigham\u2019s ready meals really quickly,\u201d Leila says. \u201cAnother hilarious thing we sold out of is manuka honey \u2013 I think because coronavirus has respiratory symptoms. Everyone\u2019s buying a lot of alcohol and fancy meat.\u201d One customer kicked up a fuss because they had purchased \u00a33,000 of wine but couldn\u2019t get a delivery slot. But there are more subtle indicators that all is not well. Shoplifting is up, for a start. \u201cI think because security is so busy manning the queue, there are a lot more shoplifters,\u201d says Leila. \u201cTwo weeks ago, someone nearly got away with \u00a3500 worth of alcohol.\u201d In addition to the professional shoplifters, who target high-value items such as alcohol and meat, and steal to order, Gavin has noticed more \u201cpilfering\u201d: shoplifting cheaper minor essentials. \u201cI think it\u2019s people who are now suffering economically who are taking things because they can\u2019t afford to pay for them,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople haven\u2019t been paid for a while, and they\u2019ve come to the supermarket and for the first time in their life perhaps they\u2019ve been hungry and stolen something.\u201d The pilfering, the rudeness, the stockpiling and more: truly, the supermarket worker saw it all. And having a front-row seat during this period of national crisis has been a simultaneously heartening and dispiriting experience. \u201cI\u2019ve had people say: \u2018You\u2019re doing really important work,\u2019\u201d says Warren. \u201cBut as with life in general, you tend to remember the bad stuff \u2013 the customer who called you a twat, rather than the one who patted you on the back.\u201d Hogan hopes that the lockdown will usher in an era of greater respect for low-paid workers. \u201cBefore, when people would ask what I do, they would be quite judgmental,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019d say: \u2018Why don\u2019t you do something else?\u2019\u201d Not any more. \u201cPeople will come up to me and say: \u2018Thank you for being on the checkout.\u2019 I\u2019ve never had that before.\u201d She sounds surprised. \u201cI just hope it lasts.\u201d Some names have been changed. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 May 2020 because Dr Rachel Sumner\u2019s research measured workers for low wellbeing, not stress as an earlier version said.",

      "body": "<p>In September 1968, songwriting titans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/aug/23/jerry-leiber-obituary\">Jerry Leiber</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/03/how-we-made-stand-by-me\">Mike Stoller</a> were on the hunt for a singer for their curious new composition Is That All There Is? The song was something of a departure for the writers of Hound Dog and Jailhouse Rock. It had been inspired by Thomas Mann\u2019s 1896 short story <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24072516-disillusionment\">Disillusionment</a>, which deals with what Leiber called \u201cthe existential hole that sits in the centre of our souls\u201d. The fatalistic spoken-word verses describe the narrator watching their house burn down, losing their first love, and even facing death, \u201cthat final disappointment\u201d, with sanguine grace.</p> <p>The pair felt the song needed an actress to sell it so offered it to Marlene Dietrich and Barbra Streisand before thinking of Peggy Lee. After catching her show at the Copacabana in New York, they handed Lee a demo. She called them the moment she listened to it. \u201cI will kill you if you give this song to anyone but me,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is my song. This is the story of my life.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not surprising that Lee wasn\u2019t Leiber and Stoller\u2019s first thought. Best known for her smouldering 1958 version of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGb5IweiYG8\">Fever</a>, she had spent years carefully crafting an image for herself as an impossibly glamorous blonde with a seductive purr. Is That All There Is? spoke to the woman behind that image. As a child, on two separate occasions, she really had watched her family home burn down. Her first husband had left her to raise their daughter alone. There was even a lyrical reference to clowns, one of Lee\u2019s lifelong obsessions. She felt that she too had learned to paint on a happy face. \u201cThat song completely resonated with her,\u201d says her granddaughter, Holly Foster Wells. \u201cTo her it was about looking at everything that\u2019s unfolding in front of you, pulling yourself back, accepting it, and going on living. What she heard was: survivor.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was like watching a play unfold, watching her sing one song</p> <footer> <cite>Holly Foster Wells</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lee, who died in 2002, was born 100 years ago on Tuesday. There had been plans to celebrate the milestone with<a href=\"https://www.hollywoodbowl.com/events/performances/1121/2020-08-05/miss-peggy-lee-at-100-the-legendary-count-basie-orchestra\"> a tribute concert at the Hollywood Bowl</a>, with performances from Herbie Hancock, Sheryl Crow and Debbie Harry. \u201cUnfortunately the great equaliser, Mother Nature, has put us all on notice,\u201d laments Harry. As a child, she heard Lee for the first time on the radio show Your Hit Parade. \u201cThe timbre of her voice was exciting and mysterious against the woodwind and brass. She had a wonderfully smoky voice and a phenomenal sense of time.\u201d</p> <p>When Lee was born, in the small farming town of Jamestown, North Dakota, she was named Norma Deloris Egstrom. She was the seventh of eight children, and her childhood was an unhappy one. Her father Marvin was a station agent for the Midland Continental Railroad and an alcoholic. Her mother, Selma, died when she was four. Her father remarried, the older children left home, and for 11 years Lee bore the brunt of her stepmother\u2019s physical and emotional abuse.

By September 1937 she had scraped together enough confidence to audition for WDAY radio in Fargo. She impressed them, but the programme\u2019s director, Ken Kennedy, couldn\u2019t picture \u201cNorma Egstrom\u201d on a marquee. On the spot, he christened her Peggy Lee. The following year she tried her luck in Hollywood. Arriving in California with $18 and her father\u2019s railroad pass, she wound up working as a carnival barker on Balboa Island. For a time, one of the of the 20th century\u2019s great voices could be heard bellowing: \u201cThree for a dime! You break one, you win!\u201d</p> <p>Undeterred, Lee continued to seek opportunities to develop her style. On stage one night early in 1941 at <a href=\"https://en-gb.facebook.com/psdollhouse/\">The Doll House</a>, a tiny celebrity haunt in Palm Springs, she found herself struggling to hear the music over the roar of conversation and clinking cocktail glasses. Rather than shout over the din, Lee softened her voice. A hush fell. It suited her. \u201cShe said she didn\u2019t like the idea of screaming: \u2018I love you\u2019,\u201d says Foster Wells. \u201cFor her, it should be said softly, with feeling.\u201d</p> <p>Among the audience at The Doll House was Frank Bering, who owned the Ambassador West Hotel in Chicago. He booked Lee to play their venue, the Buttery Room, which is where bandleader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/apr/27/benny-goodman-jazz\">Benny Goodman</a> stumbled across her while searching for a new singer. Years later, appearing on This Is Your Life, Goodman reminisced about the moment, telling Lee: \u201cI was so impressed that I hired you on the spot.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uTcw_A80Bo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4uTcw_A80Bo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The 1942 hit Why Don\u2019t You Do Right? made Lee a household name</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Singing with the Benny Goodman Orchestra was a dream come true for Lee, but Goodman was a tough boss. On stage she wore a borrowed dress and sang in someone else\u2019s key. Critics compared her unfavourably to Goodman\u2019s previous singer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/1999/jul/14/guardianobituaries.johnfordham\">Helen Forrest</a>, while producer John Hammond assessed her witheringly: \u201cMiss Lee is a lady whose attractiveness occasionally makes the listener forget that she has no vocal or interpretive talent.\u201d Devastated, Lee tried to quit. Goodman refused. Less than a year later, on 27 July 1942, they recorded Why Don\u2019t You Do Right?, which sold 1m copies and made Peggy Lee a household name.</p> <p>As her star was ascending, Lee was falling in love with the orchestra\u2019s guitarist, David Barbour. Goodman had a strict rule forbidding his musicians from fraternising with their female singer. When Lee became pregnant the couple could no longer keep their relationship secret. After breaking the news to Goodman that they were leaving, the couple married and moved to Los Angeles where Barbour could get work as a session musician. Lee planned to retire to raise their daughter, Nicki, but found she couldn\u2019t stop writing lyrics. \u201cMy grandfather would come home at night,\u201d says Foster Wells, \u201cAnd my grandmother would say to him: \u2018Dinner isn\u2019t ready, but the song is.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The couple made an ideal songwriting team. After Lee resumed her singing career they had their biggest hit in 1947 with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64qYKrJNt6c\">Ma\u00f1ana (Is Soon Enough for Me)</a>, which spent nine weeks at No 1. Behind the scenes, however, their marriage was collapsing. Barbour, like Lee\u2019s father, was an alcoholic. You can sense her heartbreak close to the surface in her remarkable turn in 1955\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0048484/\">Pete Kelly\u2019s Blues</a>, playing a singer debilitated by drink. Despite having little acting experience she was nominated for the best supporting actress Oscar. \u201cOf course, she was an actress while she sang,\u201d says Foster Wells. \u201cIt was like watching a play unfold, watching her sing one song.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"746361874c69b84470162584a5b764df6c6402f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/746361874c69b84470162584a5b764df6c6402f0/0_0_2361_1854/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peggy Lee and Danny Thomas in a poster for the 1952 film The Jazz Singer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"785\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peggy Lee and Danny Thomas in a poster for the 1952 film The Jazz Singer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lee was devastated by the breakup.

      "bodyText": "In September 1968, songwriting titans Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller were on the hunt for a singer for their curious new composition Is That All There Is? The song was something of a departure for the writers of Hound Dog and Jailhouse Rock. It had been inspired by Thomas Mann\u2019s 1896 short story Disillusionment, which deals with what Leiber called \u201cthe existential hole that sits in the centre of our souls\u201d. The fatalistic spoken-word verses describe the narrator watching their house burn down, losing their first love, and even facing death, \u201cthat final disappointment\u201d, with sanguine grace. The pair felt the song needed an actress to sell it so offered it to Marlene Dietrich and Barbra Streisand before thinking of Peggy Lee. After catching her show at the Copacabana in New York, they handed Lee a demo. She called them the moment she listened to it. \u201cI will kill you if you give this song to anyone but me,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is my song. This is the story of my life.\u201d It\u2019s not surprising that Lee wasn\u2019t Leiber and Stoller\u2019s first thought. Best known for her smouldering 1958 version of Fever, she had spent years carefully crafting an image for herself as an impossibly glamorous blonde with a seductive purr. Is That All There Is? spoke to the woman behind that image. As a child, on two separate occasions, she really had watched her family home burn down. Her first husband had left her to raise their daughter alone. There was even a lyrical reference to clowns, one of Lee\u2019s lifelong obsessions. She felt that she too had learned to paint on a happy face. \u201cThat song completely resonated with her,\u201d says her granddaughter, Holly Foster Wells. \u201cTo her it was about looking at everything that\u2019s unfolding in front of you, pulling yourself back, accepting it, and going on living. What she heard was: survivor.\u201d Lee, who died in 2002, was born 100 years ago on Tuesday. There had been plans to celebrate the milestone with a tribute concert at the Hollywood Bowl, with performances from Herbie Hancock, Sheryl Crow and Debbie Harry. \u201cUnfortunately the great equaliser, Mother Nature, has put us all on notice,\u201d laments Harry. As a child, she heard Lee for the first time on the radio show Your Hit Parade. \u201cThe timbre of her voice was exciting and mysterious against the woodwind and brass. She had a wonderfully smoky voice and a phenomenal sense of time.\u201d When Lee was born, in the small farming town of Jamestown, North Dakota, she was named Norma Deloris Egstrom. She was the seventh of eight children, and her childhood was an unhappy one. Her father Marvin was a station agent for the Midland Continental Railroad and an alcoholic. Her mother, Selma, died when she was four. Her father remarried, the older children left home, and for 11 years Lee bore the brunt of her stepmother\u2019s physical and emotional abuse. Her only escape was the radio. She fell in love with big band and jazz, and did her chores to a rhythm. The first time Lee ever sang in public, at church, she was so paralysed with nerves she sang facing a wall. By September 1937 she had scraped together enough confidence to audition for WDAY radio in Fargo.

The death toll stands at 346,232. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting.</p> <h2><strong>WHO warns of \u2018second peak\u2019 in areas where Covid-19 is declining</strong></h2> <p>Countries where coronavirus infections are declining could still face an \u201cimmediate second peak\u201d if they let up too soon on measures to contain the outbreak, the World Health Organization said on Monday. WHO emergencies chief, Dr Mike Ryan, told an online briefing: \u201cWe cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave. We may get a second peak in this wave.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Mexico City records thousands more deaths than usual, amid doubt over official Covid-19 toll</strong></h2> <p>This year, Mexico City has issued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/mexico-city-records-thousands-more-deaths-than-usual-amid-doubt-over-official-covid-19-toll\">8,072 more death certificates than the average</a> for the same period in the past four years, according to a new study that suggests the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll could be significantly higher than the official figure of nearly 7,400. The report\u2019s authors found 37% more death certificates were issued in April 2020 than that month\u2019s average during the previous four years. By the end of May they estimated the number may grow to 120%.</p> <h2><strong>White House brings forward Brazil travel restrictions by two days</strong></h2> <p>The US has amended the timing of its Brazil travel ban to come into force at 11.59pm Washington time on Tuesday. It came as Brazil recorded a daily death toll higher than the US for the first time (807 versus 620). Brazil has the world\u2019s second highest number of infections. In its original announcement, the White House said the travel restrictions would come into force on 28 May.</p> <h2><strong>Dutch PM Mark Rutte did not visit dying mother due to Covid-19 restrictions</strong></h2> <p>The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, was unable to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/dutch-pm-mark-rutte-did-not-visit-dying-mother-due-to-covid-19-restrictions\">visit his dying mother</a> in her final weeks because he obeyed coronavirus restrictions against visiting care homes, his office has said. His mother did not die of Covid-19, although there had earlier been an outbreak of the disease in the home where she was living, Dutch media reported.</p> <h2><strong>UK PM\u2019s aid refuses to apologise or resign over lockdown breach</strong></h2> <p>The British prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has refused to apologise or resign for breaching lockdown rules. Cummings drove 264 miles from London to his parents\u2019 estate in Durham, despite suspecting that both he and his wife had coronavirus. Cummings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-refuses-to-resign-or-apologise-for-lockdown-breach\">also admitted to having taken a second trip</a>, to a beauty spot 30 miles from Durham, which he claimed was necessary to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-says-he-drove-to-barnard-castle-to-test-his-eyesight-video\">check his eyesight</a> was good enough for the longer drive back to London.</p> <h2><strong>WHO suspends hydroxychloroquine trial</strong></h2> <p>The World Health Organization has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine-trial-trump-coronavirus-safety-fears\">suspended testing the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients</a> due to safety concerns.

In light of the study, he said, the organisation would pause the hydroxychloroquine arm of its solidarity global clinical trial.</p> <h2><strong>Coronavirus measures \u2018disastrous\u2019 for children, says Dutch watchdog</strong></h2> <p>The coronavirus pandemic will have a \u201cdisastrous\u201d impact on children\u2019s rights worldwide, making them more vulnerable to forced labour and underage marriage, a rights group said on Tuesday. School closures left boys and girls more vulnerable to child labour, early marriage and teenage pregnancy, while millions would fall into extreme poverty because of the coronavirus outbreak, the NGO KidsRights said.</p> <h2><strong>Australia will not open the country\u2019s borders \u2018anytime soon\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Australia will not open the country\u2019s borders \u201canytime soon\u201d, the PM, Scott Morrison, said on Tuesday, but added the country would continue its discussions with neighbouring New Zealand about a trans-Tasman safe travel zone. \u201cI was speaking with Prime Minister Ardern this morning, and we\u2019ll continue to have our discussions about the trans-Tasman safe travel zone,\u201d Morrison told the National Press Club in Canberra.</p> <h2><strong>Masks too dangerous for children under two, Japan medical group says</strong></h2> <p>Children under the age of two shouldn\u2019t wear masks because they can make breathing difficult and increase the risk of choking, a Japan medical group has said, launching an urgent appeal to parents as the country reopens from the coronavirus crisis.</p> <h2><strong>Saudi Arabia to revise curfew times</strong></h2> <p>Saudi Arabia will revise curfew times this week, and lift them entirely across the Kingdom with the exception of the holy city of Mecca, starting on 21 June, state news agency reported in a statement early on Tuesday. Bans on domestic travel, holding prayers in mosques, and workplace attendance in both the government and private sector will be lifted, starting 31 May, the statement added. For Mecca, the curfew time will be adjusted to 3pm-6pm and prayers will be allowed to be held in mosques from 21 June.</p> <h2><strong>Iceland eases national alert</strong></h2> <p>Iceland eased its national alert against the coronavirus on Monday, allowing for public gatherings of up to 200 people and night clubs and gyms to reopen as the country nears complete recovery from the outbreak. Iceland, which limited the virus spread through a meticulous test-and-trace strategy and a full lockdown, has confirmed 1,804 infections and 10 deaths. But there have been only five reported new cases in May, and more than 99% of infected persons have recovered.</p>",

Researchers say that even if emissions fell sharply from now, climate velocity in the depths would rocket from about 6km per decade to 50km by the 2050s. But over the same period the rate of migration would halve at the surface. Tuna, for example, could become separated from their surface-dwelling plankton food source. \u201cThis means that marine life in the deep ocean will face escalating threats from ocean warming until the end of the century, no matter what we do now,\u201d said Prof Anthony Richardson of the University of Queensland and the CSIRO, one of the study\u2019s 10 authors.</p> \n<h2>Coronavirus Extra</h2> \n<p>The World Health Organization, citing safety fears, says it will temporarily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine-trial-trump-coronavirus-safety-fears\">drop hydroxychloroquine from its global anti-Covid drug trials</a>.

At an unprecedented press conference Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s chief aide, has repeatedly refused to resign or apologise for breaking the rules by relocating his family from London to Durham during lockdown. His appearance in the Rose Garden of No 10 raised yet more questions after the admission he suspected both he and his wife had coronavirus when they travelled across the country. \u201cI don\u2019t regret what I did \u2026 reasonable people might disagree,\u201d Cummings said. Questions remain unanswered including why the family did not explore feasible options that might have avoided travelling much of the length of England. By way of contrast, the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, has revealed that his mother has died and due to Covid-19 restrictions he did not visit her in her last days. Following the press conference, Johnson once again gave his full backing to his senior adviser, who was a key architect of Brexit and of Johnson\u2019s election victory last year. People with a genetic mutation that increases the risk of dementia are more susceptible to severe Covid-19, researchers think. The vulnerability does not depend on a person\u2019s age, or whether they have already developed dementia. \u201cThis is an example of a specific gene variant causing vulnerability in some people,\u201d said David Melzer, a professor at Exeter University and a co-author of the study, which drew on gene profiles of half a million people. The coronavirus pandemic will have a \u201cdisastrous\u201d impact on children\u2019s rights worldwide, making them more vulnerable to forced labour and underage marriage, a rights group has said, as the World Health Organization warned of an \u201cimmediate second peak\u201d if restrictions were lifted too soon.

One of the first bills reintroduced after Morrison was re-elected was the ensuring integrity legislation, designed to increase powers to deregister unions and disqualify their officials.

But its genesis also reflected the difficulty of running against a man whose appetite for political combat defined his rise to power.</p> <p>Name-calling, conspiracy-peddling and grievance-airing were parts of the playbook Trump deployed in 2016, first against 16 Republicans, then against Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Now, six months before another election, eager to distract from a pandemic that has killed nearly 100,000 and ravaged the US economy, Trump and his allies are reprising these same brutal tactics, generating a fog of insinuations, accusations and smears.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump is going to throw everything and the kitchen sink. And we haven't seen the kitchen sink yet</p> <footer> <cite>Moe Vela</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to throw everything and the kitchen sink,\u201d said Moe Vela, a former senior adviser to Biden. \u201cAnd we haven\u2019t seen the kitchen sink yet.\u201d</p> <p>Flush with cash and digital prowess, the Trump campaign recently unveiled an ad offensive targeting Biden on fronts including his age and past comments on China. Trump hammered the theme in an <a href=\"https://abc3340.com/news/nation-world/exclusive-one-on-one-with-president-trump-on-battle-against-coronavirus\">interview</a> on Sunday, the 73-year-old president accusing his 77-year-old rival of lacking the mental acuity to lead an economic recovery, claiming Biden \u201cdoesn\u2019t know he\u2019s alive\u201d.</p> <p>The president\u2019s sons also got in on the act. On Fox News, Eric Trump accused Democrats of \u201cmilking\u201d coronavirus lockdowns to improve their electoral prospects. Donald Trump Jr shared a meme that baselessly suggested Biden was a pedophile. The younger Trump claimed he was \u201cjust joking\u201d \u2013 then shared another message that made the same insinuation.</p> <p>All of that came as Trump launched a dark and unfounded accusation that Barack Obama \u2013 and by extension his vice-president \u2013 was involved in a plot to undermine his successor.</p> <p>\u201cGod almighty this is sick,\u201d Biden told Yahoo News. But he dismissed the onslaught as a tired attempt to divert the public from Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, a central theme of the Biden post-primary campaign so far.</p> <p>Asked if he intended to ignore the president, Biden, who once challenged Trump to a push-up contest, replied: \u201cI don\u2019t want to get down in the mud with these guys.\u201d</p> <p>And yet his campaign has acknowledged the effectiveness of Trump\u2019s tactics in a fundraising email that included a screen grab of one of the president\u2019s campaign blasts to supporters that carried the subject line: Joe Biden Is Guilty.<br><br>Biden\u2019s campaign, lamenting the falsehoods in the email, warned: \u200b\u201c\u200bIt is the EXACT same thing he did in 2016. And quite honestly, we\u2019re scared because we know it worked last time.\u200b\u201d\u200b</p> <h2>\u2018The more he talks, the better off I am\u2019</h2> <p>The Trump camp hopes to frame the election as it did in 2016: a choice between an anti-establishment change agent and a corrupt Washington insider. But it is far from certain if it can deliver the same dramatic ending, as the cast, roles and backdrop have all changed significantly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22c79ca8384889f4ab49f58978770fce35dc39f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22c79ca8384889f4ab49f58978770fce35dc39f8/0_276_5009_3006/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump speaks.

And Biden, despite his vulnerabilities and a lengthy record of his own, is far less polarizing than Clinton, who had been the target of decades of sensationalist attacks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/24/trump-campaign-family-members-don-jr-jared-kushner\">All in the Trump family: meet the president\u2019s surrogates and strategists</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The campaign looks different too. It remains uncertain when, if ever, the candidates will be able return to the traditional trail. Under the pandemic, rallies, debates, even party conventions are in doubt. And though Biden lacks Trump\u2019s bully pulpit, he believes the new landscape has worked to his advantage.</p> <p>\u201cThe more he talks, the better off I am,\u201d the challenger said this week.</p> <p>Yet even by the standards of Trump\u2019s presidency, his behavior has alarmed some in his party. They fear he may <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/us-senate-democrats-elections-2020\">cost them the Senate </a>and the White House. But he has also rattled some Democrats, who warn that he now has at his disposal the arsenal of the federal government, reinforced by Republican allies in Congress.</p> <p>\u201cHe used to tweet, \u2018Lock her up,\u2019 said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic operative who worked on Clinton\u2019s campaign. \u201cNow he pressures the justice department to issue a subpoena.\u201d</p> <p>After Trump alleged criminal conduct by his predecessor in the Oval Office, attorney general William Barr was forced to respond, dismissing the possibility of an investigation into Obama or Biden. But Barr did not count out investigations of Obama aides and Senate Republicans vowed to look into the matter. Ron Johnson, of Wisconsin,<strong> </strong>forged ahead<strong> </strong>with a vote this week, authorizing a subpoena to investigate business dealings involving Biden\u2019s son, Hunter.</p> <p>Democrats think an anxious nation simply wants leadership in a moment of crisis.</p> <p>\u201c[Trump] tries to be the master distractor but it\u2019s those very distractions that are one of his biggest problems right now,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cEvery time he goes in for a smear, what people see is him avoiding responsibility for his failures.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018A lizard brain\u2019</h2> <p>Trump\u2019s penchant for conspiracy theories poses a unique problem. Responding to baseless claims risks elevating them. Not responding can allow such claims to spread uncontrollably.</p> <p>Already Trump has elevated unsubstantiated claims about Biden\u2019s ties to China, his son\u2019s business dealings and the supposed \u201cdeep state\u201d plot he calls \u201cObamagate\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Once, Joe Biden was adamant. He would wait until after the November election to give his opponent a nickname: \u201cFormer president Donald Trump.\u201d But as the smears from the president, his family and his campaign grew increasingly caustic, Biden responded with a moniker of his own. \u201cI call him President Tweety,\u201d Biden said this week. The name was perhaps more a statement of fact than an effective rejoinder to Trump\u2019s own nickname for Biden: \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d. But its genesis also reflected the difficulty of running against a man whose appetite for political combat defined his rise to power. Name-calling, conspiracy-peddling and grievance-airing were parts of the playbook Trump deployed in 2016, first against 16 Republicans, then against Hillary Clinton. Now, six months before another election, eager to distract from a pandemic that has killed nearly 100,000 and ravaged the US economy, Trump and his allies are reprising these same brutal tactics, generating a fog of insinuations, accusations and smears. \u201cHe\u2019s going to throw everything and the kitchen sink,\u201d said Moe Vela, a former senior adviser to Biden. \u201cAnd we haven\u2019t seen the kitchen sink yet.\u201d Flush with cash and digital prowess, the Trump campaign recently unveiled an ad offensive targeting Biden on fronts including his age and past comments on China. Trump hammered the theme in an interview on Sunday, the 73-year-old president accusing his 77-year-old rival of lacking the mental acuity to lead an economic recovery, claiming Biden \u201cdoesn\u2019t know he\u2019s alive\u201d. The president\u2019s sons also got in on the act. On Fox News, Eric Trump accused Democrats of \u201cmilking\u201d coronavirus lockdowns to improve their electoral prospects. Donald Trump Jr shared a meme that baselessly suggested Biden was a pedophile. The younger Trump claimed he was \u201cjust joking\u201d \u2013 then shared another message that made the same insinuation. All of that came as Trump launched a dark and unfounded accusation that Barack Obama \u2013 and by extension his vice-president \u2013 was involved in a plot to undermine his successor. \u201cGod almighty this is sick,\u201d Biden told Yahoo News. But he dismissed the onslaught as a tired attempt to divert the public from Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, a central theme of the Biden post-primary campaign so far. Asked if he intended to ignore the president, Biden, who once challenged Trump to a push-up contest, replied: \u201cI don\u2019t want to get down in the mud with these guys.\u201d And yet his campaign has acknowledged the effectiveness of Trump\u2019s tactics in a fundraising email that included a screen grab of one of the president\u2019s campaign blasts to supporters that carried the subject line: Joe Biden Is Guilty. Biden\u2019s campaign, lamenting the falsehoods in the email, warned: \u201cIt is the EXACT same thing he did in 2016. And quite honestly, we\u2019re scared because we know it worked last time.\u201d \u2018The more he talks, the better off I am\u2019 The Trump camp hopes to frame the election as it did in 2016: a choice between an anti-establishment change agent and a corrupt Washington insider. But it is far from certain if it can deliver the same dramatic ending, as the cast, roles and backdrop have all changed significantly. Trump is now a president with a governing record to defend. And Biden, despite his vulnerabilities and a lengthy record of his own, is far less polarizing than Clinton, who had been the target of decades of sensationalist attacks. The campaign looks different too. It remains uncertain when, if ever, the candidates will be able return to the traditional trail. Under the pandemic, rallies, debates, even party conventions are in doubt. And though Biden lacks Trump\u2019s bully pulpit, he believes the new landscape has worked to his advantage. \u201cThe more he talks, the better off I am,\u201d the challenger said this week. Yet even by the standards of Trump\u2019s presidency, his behavior has alarmed some in his party. They fear he may cost them the Senate and the White House. But he has also rattled some Democrats, who warn that he now has at his disposal the arsenal of the federal government, reinforced by Republican allies in Congress. \u201cHe used to tweet, \u2018Lock her up,\u2019 said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic operative who worked on Clinton\u2019s campaign. \u201cNow he pressures the justice department to issue a subpoena.\u201d After Trump alleged criminal conduct by his predecessor in the Oval Office, attorney general William Barr was forced to respond, dismissing the possibility of an investigation into Obama or Biden. But Barr did not count out investigations of Obama aides and Senate Republicans vowed to look into the matter. Ron Johnson, of Wisconsin, forged ahead with a vote this week, authorizing a subpoena to investigate business dealings involving Biden\u2019s son, Hunter. Democrats think an anxious nation simply wants leadership in a moment of crisis. \u201c[Trump] tries to be the master distractor but it\u2019s those very distractions that are one of his biggest problems right now,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cEvery time he goes in for a smear, what people see is him avoiding responsibility for his failures.\u201d \u2018A lizard brain\u2019 Trump\u2019s penchant for conspiracy theories poses a unique problem. Responding to baseless claims risks elevating them. Not responding can allow such claims to spread uncontrollably. Already Trump has elevated unsubstantiated claims about Biden\u2019s ties to China, his son\u2019s business dealings and the supposed \u201cdeep state\u201d plot he calls \u201cObamagate\u201d. Inside the conservative media echo chamber, these messages are easily amplified. \u201cTrump is uniquely skilled at this,\u201d said Tim Miller, a Republican who worked on Jeb Bush\u2019s 2016 campaign. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lizard brain for it.\u201d Miller said it was important to closely monitor stories on social media and fringe websites, to determine what is gaining traction and thus warrants a response. Part of the trick is knowing when and how to respond. He said Biden\u2019s campaign should arm allies and surrogates with forceful rebuttals, particularly to claims about Hunter Biden and the Obama administration. Perhaps most importantly, he said, the campaign must be ready to go on the offensive. \u201cOne of the lessons we learned from 2016 is that just pivoting to policy is not a solution,\u201d he said. Biden\u2019s campaign has been quick to decry Trump\u2019s attacks as a sign of desperation, as the president slides in national polls. In response to the effort to paint Biden as \u201cChina\u2019s puppet\u201d, an ad hit Trump as soft on Beijing. And the campaign has also escalated critiques of Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis. \u201cWe know that Donald Trump has utterly failed his test of leadership,\u201d Biden said at a virtual Wisconsin rally. \u201cHe thinks he\u2019s a builder but he\u2019s a destroyer of everything he touches.\u201d In turn, the Trump camp has indicated that little will be off limits \u2013 even charges that apply equally to the president himself. When Biden said on Friday that African Americans who don\u2019t support him \u201cain\u2019t black\u201d, the Trump campaign quickly assembled a press call featuring prominent black supporters of a president whose critics regularly accuse him of racism. Hours later, Biden apologized. As one Republican operative described the strategy, \u201cIt\u2019s not, \u2018My guy is better than your guy.\u2019 It\u2019s \u2018Your guy isn\u2019t as good as you think he is.\u2019\u201d \u2018You can\u2019t let any attack go unanswered\u2019 Give the current national crisis, few strategists believe Trump can successfully reframe the election as anything but a referendum on his record in office. Democrats say his scattershot messaging suggests his campaign is struggling to find a line of attack that sticks. But even a marginal impact on support or turnout could make a difference in what will likely be another close race, said Ben Tulchin, a top pollster on both Bernie Sanders campaigns for the Democratic nomination. \u201cYou can\u2019t let any attack go unanswered,\u201d he said. \u201cAny attack he makes, you have to respond forcefully. You can\u2019t allow him to define you.\u201d After nearly 50 years in national politics, Biden believes Trump and his allies face an uphill battle trying to change public perception of him. \u201cPeople know me,\u201d Biden said this week. \u201cThe good news is the bad news.\u201d On Friday evening, perhaps seeking to assuage any doubts stoked by Trump\u2019s \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d attacks, the candidate outlined for donors a daily workout routine designed by a former White House doctor.

NF, by email The National Trust\u2019s cottage booking T&amp;Cs are explicitly clear that it will not offer refunds if the property cannot be supplied due to events \u201coutside our control\u201d. I assume that the previous shutdown caused by the foot and mouth outbreak led to the clause\u2019s inclusion. The NT\u2019s offer of a credit note to rebook within two years seems reasonable for most customers \u2013 but only if there is a good chance they will be able to use it. We asked the NT to take a second look at this given your husband\u2019s medical position, and it has agreed to refund you the \u00a3929 charge. \u201cThese guests should have been refunded without question due to their health concerns and we can only apologise for the delay in doing so. We\u2019re now reviewing our support centre guidance to make sure this situation doesn\u2019t arise again and that the individual circumstances of our guests are always considered,\u201d it says. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually. Email us at consumer.champions@theguardian.com. Please include a daytime phone number.

      "bodyText": "Two schools located just 2km apart in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs have closed after a student at each tested positive for coronavirus. The news comes one day after all students across the state returned to the classroom full-time. Waverley College sent home the 1,100 students from its senior campus on Tuesday morning, after being notified by the parents of a year 7 boy that he had tested positive for the virus. Parents were told to come and collect their children just before 10am on Tuesday morning. The school organised private buses for those whose parents were unable to pick them up, deputy principal Patrick Brennan told reporters, and alerted staff and students who were in direct contact with the infected pupil. Down the road, Moriah College evacuated its campus a few hours later after New South Wales Health notified the school that one of its students had also tested positive for Covid-19. While public schools across the state officially reopened yesterday, Moriah and Waverley, both independent colleges, resumed face-to-face teaching last week. Moriah has confirmed the infected student was at school last Thursday 21 May. Both schools were closed for campus cleaning and contact tracing to take place. Waverley College and Moriah College are not the first schools in NSW forced to close. Epping Boys high school, Normanhurst West public school, Warragamba public school, St Marys senior high school and St Ignatius college Riverview, have all had to shut their doors temporarily after students and staff tested positive for coronavirus. Originally, NSW students were not supposed to return to the classroom full-time until late July. But the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, brought the date forward last week due to declining transmission rates across the state. Berejiklian said at the time the \u201chealth advice is very clear \u2013 a return to full-time face-to-face teaching is safe\u201d, but that it would be common to see schools close due to outbreaks. The education minister, Sarah Mitchell, warned after Waverley College closed on Tuesday morning that school shutdowns were \u201csomething that we are going to have to live with\u201d. \u201cWe are living through a pandemic and there will be occasions from time to time that we do have a positive case that effects a school community,\u201d Mitchell told reporters. \u201cOn any given day, one in five people in NSW are associated with a school community, whether they are a student, a parent or a teacher.\u201d It is unclear whether other schools in Waverley will need to reevaluate face-to-face teaching in light of the nearby outbreaks. A spokeswoman for St Catherine\u2019s College said it hadn\u2019t prompted them to reconsider staying open, but that it had put the school on \u201calert\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve revisited our processes that we have put in place before should we have to close the school,\u201d the spokeswoman said. Meanwhile, spokespersons for Reddam House school, St Clare\u2019s College and Sydney Catholic schools \u2013 which oversees St Charles\u2019 Catholic primary school \u2013 said the confirmed cases in Waverley had not prompted them to consider closing.",

The sights and sounds of the wet market form part of the rich tapestry of community life, where local people buy affordable food, or just go for a stroll and meet their neighbours for a chat.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>While supermarkets selling chilled or frozen meats are increasingly popular in Asia, older shoppers generally prefer buying freshly slaughtered meat for daily consumption, believing it produces flavour in dishes and soup that is superior to frozen meat.</p>\n    <p>\u201cWet markets\u201d, where water is sloshed on produce to keep it cool and fresh, may be considered unsanitary by western standards.

What we are concerned about is the illegal consumption of highly threatened wildlife, often seen as a delicacy.\u201d</p> \n<p>There is no doubt that wild meat hunting and consumption is heavily impacting the world\u2019s wildlife, giving rise to what is called \u201cthe empty forest\u201d, where few large mammals remain. A <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.160498\">2016 Royal Society paper</a> shows that the bushmeat trade is growing fast, with devastating results. \u201cAs wildlife populations outside protected areas decline, poaching pressure is increasing in many parks and reserves,\u201d say the authors. \u201cAs a consequence many forests, savannahs, grasslands and deserts in the developing world are now becoming \u2018empty landscapes\u2019 devoid of harvest-sensitive wild mammals.\u201d</p> \n<p>What has changed over 50 years, say scientists, is the scale of the commercial wild meat trade. In the past, local subsistence hunters killed animals in small numbers. Today a high-volume industry supplies fast-expanding Asian and African cities. No longer run by local hunters, it is helped by modern firearms and cellphones, and utilises a vast network of new roads driven deep into forest concessions by the international logging industry. Hunters can strip a forest or wetland in a few nights and access home and export markets for their meat. And as the forests are emptied of their animals, the price of wild meat soars and it becomes a luxury commodity for urban elites.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7924ef86a71e43dd45752f7fa40fa9296b49a674\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7924ef86a71e43dd45752f7fa40fa9296b49a674/0_0_4134_2751/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dead pangolins seized by authorities in Belawan, North Sumatra.

I am not saying that people should not eat wild animals [but] there is not enough to go round any more. Commercialisation is the problem. The first priority must be to stop the commercial markets. They can\u2019t go on. Practices that originated hundreds of years ago have to stop. The amount it would cost to provide chicken and farmed fish to everyone [in Africa] is negligible compared to what this pandemic is costing.\u201d</p> \n<p>But critics of a ban say that the legal wildlife meat trade employs hundreds of thousands of people, provides protein for between 30 million and 70 million people in Africa alone and kills few threatened, or rare animals.</p> \n<p>What about the environmental impacts of farming? According to a <a href=\"https://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/articles/ANasi1101.pdf\">major 2011 study</a> led by Robert Nasi, director general of the Center for International Forestry Research (Cifor), a switch to cattle to provide protein in place of wild animals would have huge impact.</p> \n<p>Hunters, says Nasi, take about <a href=\"https://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/articles/ANasi1101.pdf\">4.5m tonnes of bushmeat a year from forests in the Congo </a><a href=\"https://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/articles/ANasi1101.pdf\">basin and </a><a href=\"https://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/articles/ANasi1101.pdf\">possibly 1.299</a><a href=\"https://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/articles/ANasi1101.pdf\">m tonnes in the Amazon</a>. \u201cWe would need to transform large areas of tropical forests or savannas into pasture to replace [this amount of] bushmeat by cattle. For comparison, Brazilian beef production is considered responsible for about 50m hectares [124m acres \u2013 twice the size of the UK] of deforestation. If bushmeat consumption in the Congo basin was to be replaced by locally produced beef, an area as large as 25 m hectares might have to be converted to pastures.\u201d</p> \n<p>Factory farming has devastating effects on wildlife, says Philip Lymbery, director of UK-based <a href=\"https://www.ciwf.org.uk/\">Compassion in World Farming</a>. \u201cIt is a main driver of wildlife decline and the destruction of the world\u2019s remaining wild lands,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about keeping animals caged in sheds, which sounds efficient but you have to devote vast areas of land to grow their feed. It drives encroachment into wild lands and the destruction of habitats.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt would cause unimaginable suffering to the animals, and even more environmental devastation. It would also create the perfect breeding ground for the next pandemic. Factory farming and pandemics are strongly linked. The main driver of future pandemics will be factory farming.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f3189e21780ad48cc15012340a8effd6410da19c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3189e21780ad48cc15012340a8effd6410da19c/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bushmeat on sale at the weekly market in Yangambi, DRC\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bushmeat on sale at the weekly market in Yangambi, DRC.

After the 2013\u201316 Ebola outbreak in west Africa, she says, bans were brought in by several countries but could not be policed. The result was <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S027795361730758X\">a marked increase</a> in hunting for wild meat. \u201cThere [is] no conclusive evidence that banning the wildlife trade will prevent the emergence of zoonotic diseases in the future,\u201d she says. \u201cThe legal trade for species that can be safely harvested can facilitate improved hygiene and animal welfare, while complete bans can drive trade underground, resulting in illegal markets with lower hygiene regulation and increased risk of disease transmission.\u201d</p> \n<p>As for the idea that disease is more likely to accompany wild meat, experts point out that illnesses like Mers and Sars, BSE, swine and bird flu, E coli, MRSA and salmonella, originated in intensive poultry, pig and livestock farms where the overuse of antibiotics and unhygienic conditions can spread disease quickly. Many are common. According <a href=\"https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/update-on-avian-influenza/2017/\">to the OIE</a>, the World Organisation for Animal Health, there are currently more than 25 outbreaks of H5 and H7 avian flu having to be controlled in more than 20 countries, including the US, Germany, India and Saudi Arabia. Any one, if unattended by vets, could develop into an epidemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cIntensive farming is an area that must also be looked at\u201d, says Eric Fevre, chair of veterinary infectious diseases at Liverpool University. \u201cAs we select for better milk cows, better beef cows or better egg-laying chickens, we create populations of animals that often live in intensive conditions, but where the genetics are very similar. This creates risks for [the] emergence of diseases, because if these genetically uniform large populations are susceptible, things can spread very quickly.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ed8205adf6e85bcd80bdd6ceaecd173de363fac\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ed8205adf6e85bcd80bdd6ceaecd173de363fac/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Congo, part-time hunters boost their income with bushmeat.

In the UK we like farmers\u2019 markets with fresh cornfed chickens, farm-sourced meats and nice looking sausages. That\u2019s basically a wet market, though in a different cultural context.

They should not be blanket banned, as that is not sensitive to the needs of their clients who depend on them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Conservationists are struggling to diminish consumption of wild animals through behaviour campaigns, legislation and law enforcement \u2013 especially in urban Africa, says Congo analyst <a href=\"https://www.bookdepository.com/author/Theodore-Trefon\">Theodore Trefon</a>, a researcher at the Belgian Royal Museum for central Africa.</p> \n<p>\u201cMany consumers [there] believe that eating bushmeat is quite simply normal, respectful of tradition, healthy, desirable and commonsensical,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a well-known challenge to wildlife conservationists but one that is relatively new to public health experts confronted by known and yet-to-come zoonotic diseases.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>This piece was edited on 27 May 2020 to clarify Stephanie Brittain\u2019s experience in Cameroon and correct the name of her institution</em></p>",

This creates risks for [the] emergence of diseases, because if these genetically uniform large populations are susceptible, things can spread very quickly.\u201d Delia Grace, programme leader for food safety and zoonoses at the International Livestock Research Institute, said: \u201cWet markets are basically fresh food markets. In the UK we like farmers\u2019 markets with fresh cornfed chickens, farm-sourced meats and nice looking sausages. That\u2019s basically a wet market, though in a different cultural context. They are essential to bring fresh food to urban populations, and provide for the food security of millions of people. \u201cThey do need to be regulated and controlled. They should not be blanket banned, as that is not sensitive to the needs of their clients who depend on them.\u201d Conservationists are struggling to diminish consumption of wild animals through behaviour campaigns, legislation and law enforcement \u2013 especially in urban Africa, says Congo analyst Theodore Trefon, a researcher at the Belgian Royal Museum for central Africa. \u201cMany consumers [there] believe that eating bushmeat is quite simply normal, respectful of tradition, healthy, desirable and commonsensical,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a well-known challenge to wildlife conservationists but one that is relatively new to public health experts confronted by known and yet-to-come zoonotic diseases.\u201d This piece was edited on 27 May 2020 to clarify Stephanie Brittain\u2019s experience in Cameroon and correct the name of her institution",

Samira agrees. \u201cTeachers feel more like family now.\u201d There is enthusiastic nodding from her schoolmates.</p> <p>The headteacher, David Alexander, and Cole, went through their entire roll to identify pupils they felt should have the opportunity to attend \u2013 those who were vulnerable, although not in the government\u2019s stated categories.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/apr/07/when-the-covid-19-crisis-finally-ends-uk-schools-must-never-return-to-normal\">When the Covid-19 crisis finally ends, schools must never return to normal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe want as many to come in as possible,\u201d Alexander says. As schools closed across the country, Rednock staff telephoned 280 families to make sure they knew their child had a place. \u201cSome parents and carers are hesitant,\u201d Alexander acknowledges. \u201cAnd some prefer to have their children at home.\u201d But efforts are unstinting to support the 160 or so students who, Cole says, \u201cwe would class as vulnerable, and who we\u2019d prefer to be in school but aren\u2019t\u201d.</p> <p>Cole feels anxious for the welfare of some children who haven\u2019t been seen for the past seven weeks.

They know, too, that the return of the hurley burley will affect the more vulnerable children.</p> <p>And the pupils have mixed feelings about normal school resuming. Samira hopes there might be smaller classes, but says: \u201cI\u2019m not excited about going back \u2013 all the madness and screaming in corridors.\u201d Molly agrees.: \u201cIt\u2019ll probably be more stressful. Everything crowded again.\u201d</p> <p>Caitlin is looking to the positives. \u201cI\u2019ve had the opportunity to reflect on who I want to be when I\u2019m older,\u201d she says. \u201cI can be quite negative, and this time has given me a break. The extra support from school means that I know even when things get tough \u2013 because we\u2019re in a pandemic and I\u2019m getting through it \u2013 I can get through other things now.\u201d</p> <p>Alexander and Cole emphasise that even in normal times this school tries to create a family atmosphere. But to these children, a caring school has never felt as much of a reality as it does now. There is no testing or targets, no pressure to achieve academically. They feel adults are there for them. And despite the immense stresses and limitations of living in a time of pandemic, they are blossoming.</p> <p><em>* All children\u2019s names have been changed.</em></p>",

It can be that they come in for just a couple of hours. And I think we are seeing huge benefits to that.\u201d One boy who had refused to attend for eight months, has been coming in every day, thanks to this flexibility and the attention he can now be given. Another year 8 child, \u201cwho arrived midway through this year and has been struggling \u2026 he\u2019s been attending for four weeks now and he\u2019s really benefited\u201d, says Cole. \u201cYou can just see how his shoulders have relaxed.\u201d The gap in GCSE results between children from disadvantaged backgrounds and the rest is thought to be around 19 months and, without changes in policy priorities, at the current rate it will take 50 years to close, according to the Education Policy Institute thinktank. Many fear children will fall even further behind during the pandemic, one reason the government gives for wanting to reopen schools to more pupils by 1 June. Rednock was hoping some 240 pupils would attend during lockdown, but numbers have been lower than expected. The corridors of the school\u2019s spacious modern building are hushed. Children walk around alone, and don\u2019t wear uniform. For many, \u201cstrange school\u201d has huge advantages. \u201cBefore, I had quite a few classmates who were really annoying and distracting, but now this new way, it\u2019s quieter,\u201d says Edie, 13. \u201cTeachers are ever so supportive, and it\u2019s calmer because there\u2019s not tonnes of people crowding around,\u201d adds Molly, 11. \u201cThere\u2019s less people who intimidate other people,\u201d says Alfie, 12, whose parents, both nurses, have been at work during the crisis. \u201cYou can be yourself more rather than be the person other people think you should be.\u201d His mum has had Covid-19, he says, and has recovered. Everyone nods. \u201cBefore, people used to sometimes judge you,\u201d says Samira, 11. \u201cYou can sometimes have fake friends who really bring you down. This has given you a little bit of a break.\u201d Because the school is being so careful about physical distancing, I meet students in the hall, with one child per desk. This small group either have key-worker parents, are under the care of a social worker, have an education, health and care plan (EHCP) for their special needs, or are otherwise defined as \u201chigh priority\u201d by their teachers. They miss their friends but, to a child, say they feel immense relief from the pressures of \u201cnormal\u201d school. \u201cThe teachers have more time to spend with you, and you get the help you need,\u201d says Maisie, 12, whose mother works in food manufacturing. Samira agrees. \u201cTeachers feel more like family now.\u201d There is enthusiastic nodding from her schoolmates. The headteacher, David Alexander, and Cole, went through their entire roll to identify pupils they felt should have the opportunity to attend \u2013 those who were vulnerable, although not in the government\u2019s stated categories. \u201cWe want as many to come in as possible,\u201d Alexander says. As schools closed across the country, Rednock staff telephoned 280 families to make sure they knew their child had a place. \u201cSome parents and carers are hesitant,\u201d Alexander acknowledges. \u201cAnd some prefer to have their children at home.\u201d But efforts are unstinting to support the 160 or so students who, Cole says, \u201cwe would class as vulnerable, and who we\u2019d prefer to be in school but aren\u2019t\u201d. Cole feels anxious for the welfare of some children who haven\u2019t been seen for the past seven weeks. She is in regular contact with their social workers and, in some cases, the police. Teachers continue to check in, ringing some children weekly, some daily. In school, staff are sensitive to new needs. \u201cSome here have really difficult home lives and they feel safer in school. And they feel worried about their parents who are at work. We\u2019ve had tears, shouting, aggression,\u201d says Cole. \u201cOr they go quiet, or go off on their own,\u201d adds Alexander. \u201cOr you get over-the-top laughter, or clinginess,\u201d says Cole. When all students do come back, Alexander and Cole are hoping there will be lessons they can use from lockdown. They know, too, that the return of the hurley burley will affect the more vulnerable children. And the pupils have mixed feelings about normal school resuming. Samira hopes there might be smaller classes, but says: \u201cI\u2019m not excited about going back \u2013 all the madness and screaming in corridors.\u201d Molly agrees.: \u201cIt\u2019ll probably be more stressful. Everything crowded again.\u201d Caitlin is looking to the positives. \u201cI\u2019ve had the opportunity to reflect on who I want to be when I\u2019m older,\u201d she says. \u201cI can be quite negative, and this time has given me a break. The extra support from school means that I know even when things get tough \u2013 because we\u2019re in a pandemic and I\u2019m getting through it \u2013 I can get through other things now.\u201d Alexander and Cole emphasise that even in normal times this school tries to create a family atmosphere. But to these children, a caring school has never felt as much of a reality as it does now. There is no testing or targets, no pressure to achieve academically. They feel adults are there for them. And despite the immense stresses and limitations of living in a time of pandemic, they are blossoming. * All children\u2019s names have been changed.",

The parts are sold to companies making either TCM pharmaceuticals \u2013 dried and baked pangolin scales, for example, are ground into powder for several treatments \u2013 or for products such as tiger and leopard bone wine, advertised as having \u201cTCM qualities\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not as much a Chinese medicine practitioner issue, it is more the industry, the people who make money,\u201d Lao said. \u201cThis makes Chinese medicine look bad.

Wildlife conservation organisation Traffic told the Guardian that it has seen positive direction from within the TCM community in China in recent years to move away from the use of threatened species.

By the end of 2020, China\u2019s state council expects the total value of the country\u2019s TCM industry to reach about $420bn, according to <a href=\"http://www.scio.gov.cn/37236/38180/Document/1626694/1626694.htm\">a white paper</a> it released four years ago. In China\u2019s TCM capital of Bozhou, Anhui province, the industry is estimated to be worth 109bn yuan ($15bn).</p> <p>The report also indicated that there were 900 million TCM practitioners in 183 countries, and growing. TCM hospitals and clinics in China recorded a billion visits in 2017 and that number is increasing by <a href=\"http://www.nhc.gov.cn/guihuaxxs/s10743/201806/44e3cdfe11fa4c7f928c879d435b6a18.shtm\">about </a><a href=\"http://www.nhc.gov.cn/guihuaxxs/s10743/201806/44e3cdfe11fa4c7f928c879d435b6a18.shtm\">6% </a><a href=\"http://www.nhc.gov.cn/guihuaxxs/s10743/201806/44e3cdfe11fa4c7f928c879d435b6a18.shtm\"> a year</a>.</p> <p>Separately, a 2017 report from the Chinese Academy of Engineering put the total value of the wildlife industry specifically breeding parts for TCM at 50bn yuan, or about $7bn. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"290954d44db247ca348afef7b8d14f115dbf3c7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/290954d44db247ca348afef7b8d14f115dbf3c7a/0_0_5126_3417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traders wait for customers at a traditional Chinese medicine market in Bozhou, Anhui province, China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Traders wait for customers at a traditional Chinese medicine market in Bozhou, Anhui province, China.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Qilai Shen/Corbis/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That figure does not take into account the illegal trade in live animals, whole dead animals and animal parts. That number is likely to be many times higher, judging by seizures of animal parts such as pangolin scales, rhino horn and tiger bone.</p> <p>In February, China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress put a full ban on any trade in terrestrial wildlife until the country\u2019s Wildlife Protection Law and follow-on regulations around the industry can be fully updated \u2013 though the main focus will likely be on bushmeat, with little action expected on products used for TCM and fur or leather.</p> <p>Moves are also afoot globally to stop all use of endangered wildlife in traditional medicine. Three Chinese NGOs and two global organisations <a href=\"https://www.iucncongress2020.org/motion/108\">recently proposed</a> that all members of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) support a halt to the use of threatened species in traditional medicine.</p> <p>The<a href=\"https://www.iucncongress2020.org/motion/108\"> proposal</a> was listed by the IUCN and will go before members for approval or debate in January next year.

      "bodyText": "Supporters and practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine have warned that the discipline is threatened by those who continue to trade in endangered animals. The small segment of the TCM community that insists on using endangered animal parts in the pharmaceutical side of TCM, ignoring welfare considerations and the idea of respecting biodiversity, could destroy its reputation for good, they argue. \u201cThe balance with nature is a key point [of TCM], and the use of [endangered] animals is against nature,\u201d Dr Lixing Lao, president of the Virginia University of Integrative Medicine, told the Guardian. \u201cEven in the principles of TCM practice, this is not good,\u201d Lao said, referring to Tang dynasty experts 1,500 years ago who believed 100% of TCM could be derived from plants. TCM encompasses many things \u2013 acupuncture therapies, breathing and physical exercise, eating habits related to particular conditions of the body and a variety of views about how to strike balance within the body, alongside medicinal TCM drugs. For Lao and others, the path of reform is to abandon the use of parts derived from endangered species such as pangolins, tigers, leopards and rhinos. The $74bn (\u00a360bn) wildlife trade in China, pointed to as a likely source of Covid-19, has been largely perpetuated by superstition and confusion about the benefits of animal parts. Until the recent nationwide pause on the wildlife trade, China\u2019s state forestry and grassland administration provided permits to TCM pharmaceutical companies to use animal parts from previous stockpiles or \u201cfarmed\u201d wildlife. But poaching and the illegal trafficking of parts and live animals from protected species across the globe has continued. The parts are sold to companies making either TCM pharmaceuticals \u2013 dried and baked pangolin scales, for example, are ground into powder for several treatments \u2013 or for products such as tiger and leopard bone wine, advertised as having \u201cTCM qualities\u201d. \u201cThis is not as much a Chinese medicine practitioner issue, it is more the industry, the people who make money,\u201d Lao said. \u201cThis makes Chinese medicine look bad. They use our TCM name for their own purpose but we\u2019re innocent.\u201d Rhino horn and tiger bone were removed from the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, the official listing of what is allowed in TCM, in the 1980s. Wildlife conservation organisation Traffic told the Guardian that it has seen positive direction from within the TCM community in China in recent years to move away from the use of threatened species. Richard Thomas, communications director at Traffic, said: \u201cThe issue is very much within the TCM consciousness.\u201d China\u2019s government and leaders, including President Xi Jinping, have long lauded the benefits of TCM medicines. Xi is firmly behind the idea of combining traditional Chinese and western medicine, and has encouraged the acceleration of research on TCM drugs. TCM experts such as Lao believe medicinal cures should be used only when absolutely necessary and not overprescribed in the way western pharmaceuticals often are, instead favouring deeper preventive practices to reduce the need for medicine in the first place. But support for TCM, which was formally approved into the global compendium of medical practices by the World Health Organization last year, may dissipate if the issues at the heart of the wildlife trade \u2013 which is linked in many people\u2019s minds to the Covid-19 outbreak and decimation of endangered species \u2013 are not addressed. Big Business For Xi and much of the country\u2019s leadership, promoting TCM is one of several ways of raising millions out of poverty. By the end of 2020, China\u2019s state council expects the total value of the country\u2019s TCM industry to reach about $420bn, according to a white paper it released four years ago. In China\u2019s TCM capital of Bozhou, Anhui province, the industry is estimated to be worth 109bn yuan ($15bn). The report also indicated that there were 900 million TCM practitioners in 183 countries, and growing. TCM hospitals and clinics in China recorded a billion visits in 2017 and that number is increasing by about 6% a year. Separately, a 2017 report from the Chinese Academy of Engineering put the total value of the wildlife industry specifically breeding parts for TCM at 50bn yuan, or about $7bn. That figure does not take into account the illegal trade in live animals, whole dead animals and animal parts. That number is likely to be many times higher, judging by seizures of animal parts such as pangolin scales, rhino horn and tiger bone. In February, China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress put a full ban on any trade in terrestrial wildlife until the country\u2019s Wildlife Protection Law and follow-on regulations around the industry can be fully updated \u2013 though the main focus will likely be on bushmeat, with little action expected on products used for TCM and fur or leather. Moves are also afoot globally to stop all use of endangered wildlife in traditional medicine. Three Chinese NGOs and two global organisations recently proposed that all members of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) support a halt to the use of threatened species in traditional medicine. The proposal was listed by the IUCN and will go before members for approval or debate in January next year. No timeline for members to adopt any of the language will be available until the text is agreed upon. \u201cWe support the sustainable development of traditional medicine,\u201d Linda Wong, deputy secretary general of the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation, one of the NGOs involved in bringing the proposal forward, told the Guardian. \u201cWe strongly disagree with the use of endangered wildlife in traditional medicine, which drives species like the pangolin to extinction,\u201d she said, adding that of 128 motions currently under consideration by the IUCN this year, it is the \u201cmost controversial\u201d. \u201cRecent moves to reopen trade in these products appear very much business-interest driven rather than medicinal-sector driven,\u201d Richard Thomas told the Guardian. The confusion and mixed signals over what is legal and what is illegal only adds to potential loopholes, many conservation activists claim. Debbie Banks, tigers and wildlife crime campaign leader at the UK-based Environmental Investigation Agency, said there are still many issues to work out in the text of the IUCN motion, particularly related to \u201csustainable use\u201d of wildlife and adopting what is known as the FairWild standard for sourcing wild plants and applying it to wildlife. \u201cThere is a risk that advocates for captive breeding of tigers [for example] will use this language to argue that the \u2018harvest\u2019 of tigers bred in captivity is sustainable, without taking into account that the trade in captive-bred specimens sustains demand for wild specimens, particularly given consumer preference for wild,\u201d Banks said. Banks adds that standards meant for plant species can\u2019t simply be applied to the harvesting of wild animal products and reference in the motion should be explicitly stated as applying to plants only. \u201cWe\u2019ve been hoping that lawmakers extend provisions to Chinese medicine under the reforms to the Wildlife Protection Law, as academics and NGOs in China have been proposing,\u201d said Aron White, China specialist at the Environmental Investigation Agency. \u201cThe problem isn\u2019t Chinese medicine per se, it\u2019s the ingredients that are still used that are made from threatened wildlife which could be replaced by herbal or artificial alternatives, as many practitioners already do,\u201d White said. Bear bile and Covid-19 Throughout the Covid-19 outbreak, China\u2019s leaders and state-run media have supported the TCM industry, concentrating largely on the benefits of TCM pharmaceuticals as a pillar industry. TCM doctor Zhang Boli, who set up a makeshift hospital where none of the 564 carriers of Covid-19 that he treated with TCM drugs turned into critical cases, was hailed as a success, with state-run media and government officials showering him with praise. But a recent report in the journal Nature indicated growing calls outside of China for more rigorous clinical trials of TCM products, especially those promoted abroad as Covid-19 treatments. These are often being sent with aid shipments of personal protective equipment. Outside China, the use of bile extracted from the gall bladders of captive Asiatic black bears as one ingredient in TCM drugs listed by the government as treatment for severe and critical coronavirus cases has been strongly criticised by wildlife groups. \u201cIt really pains me to see that TCM is now using bear bile to treat Covid-19 and the amount used is so tiny,\u201d Grace Gabriel, Asia director for the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), told the Guardian. \u201cWhy, why do you want to destroy your good name and associate with that?\u201d Gabriel said. \u201cThe only conclusion that I can come to, is that the wildlife farming industry [in China] has hijacked TCM\u2019s name.\u201d Originally from China, Gabriel grew up during the Cultural Revolution and was often able to get medical assistance only from TCM doctors and counts herself as a believer in TCM\u2019s benefits. \u201cAs a Chinese [person] I really respect TCM, and one of the underlying principles is to achieve balance within one\u2019s own body as well as with the outside world,\u201d she said. China already has alternatives to bear bile that can be used as a substitute in TCM drugs, she said, but the captive breeding industry is so strong they don\u2019t want to see those alternatives promoted. \u201cThe one thing that is missing is education,\u201d Lao said. \u201cWe need to educate the public that Chinese medicine emphasises the balance between humans and nature, so we have to respect nature.\u201d Additional reporting by Jonathan Zhong Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",

The treatment shows less of his characteristic concern for topographical accuracy and more for drama as bright sunlight is threatened by storm clouds creating sharp contrasts of light and shade. The canvas betrays the influence of his father, a theatre set designer, with whom he initially trained. Later works became lighter, larger in scale and more even in tone and treatment. Image: The Grand Canal, Venice, Looking North East from the Palazzo Balbi to the Rialto Bridge, c.1724, Canaletto (1697-1768), Ferens Art Gallery, 2:D - In the early 1880s Steer studied in Paris where he was influenced by the work of the French Impressionists. When he returned to England in 1884 he painted a series of beach scenes and coastal views with broken dabs and dashes of luminous colour suggesting bright, translucent light. Although his style was influenced by French Impressionism this picture also draws from a tradition of similar pictures, especially JMW Turner\u2019s Shrimpers, of 1827 (Bury Art Gallery). Image: Boulogne Sands (Children Shrimping), 1891, Philip Wilson Steer (1860-1942), Ferens Art Gallery, 3:D - Though never exhibiting as a group during their lives the four artists now known as the Scottish Colourists used bright colour and created painterly canvases reflecting the influence of French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Peploe spent extended periods in Paris before the outbreak of the first world war. This later still life shows the continuation of one of favourite themes. Image: Martagon Lilies, late 1920s, Samuel John Peploe (1871-1935), Ferens Art Gallery, 4:A - This was the first work by Ward to enter the Ferens collection in 1936. The Forfarshire traded between Hull and Dundee but two years after being launched in Hull she was spectacularly wrecked off the Northumberland coast. Grace Darling and her father rescued some of the passengers and crew from a rowing boat. Her bravery became the subject of Victorian legend. Darling died of tuberculosis aged 26. Image: PS \u2018Forfarshire\u2019 Leaving Hull for Dundee, 19th century, John Ward (1798-1849), Ferens Art Gallery, 5:C - Joseph Duveen, later Lord Duveen of Millbank, was born in Hull and became a significant 20th century benefactor to the Tate and the British Museum. He came from a Dutch Sephardic Jewish family that emigrated and established a prosperous import business in the city. Duveen went on to become one of the world\u2019s leading art dealers supporting building projects at the British Museum and the Tate. The background of Brown\u2019s portrait contains an early self-portrait by his now far better-known student, Gwen John, that is now held in the Tate Britain. Image: Portrait of the Artist, 1926, Frederick Brown (1851-1941), Ferens Art Gallery, 6:D - John had love affairs with both men and women throughout her life but her relationship with Rodin was the longest and most significant. During her lifetime her artistic reputation was overshadowed by that of her brother, Augustus John, and her lover, Auguste Rodin, but has risen steadily since her death. Her small, subtle and intense portraits of women in interiors, painted in chalky, muted tones, are now celebrated internationally. Image: The Seated Woman, c.1910-1920, Gwen John (1876-1939), Ferens Art Gallery, 7:D - Ulysses and the Sirens, by Herbert Draper (1864-1920) depicts one of many incidents from the hero's 10-year journey home to Ithaca as described in the Greek poet Homer's epic poem the Odyssey. The Sirens were mythical creatures whose enchanting singing lured sailors to shipwreck off the rocky coast of their island. Image: Ulysses and the Sirens, c.1909, Herbert James Draper (1864-1920), Ferens Art Gallery, 8:A - Hull City Association Football Club traditionally play in a black and amber shirts and black shorts, often with a striped shirt design, hence the nickname The Tigers. In 2013 club owner Assem Allam attempted to officially change the club name to Hull Tigers, a move met with opposition by the fans and the FA.

The Al Kuwait arrived on Friday after sailing from the United Arab Emirates. Six of the 48 multinational crew on board have since tested positive to the virus. On Tuesday, Western Australian police commissioner Chris Dawson said half a dozen Fremantle port workers went on to the ship and authorities knew who they were but he was not aware if they had been placed in quarantine. The WA premier, Mark McGowan, said he had been advised the federal Department of Agriculture was told crew members had a fever but didn\u2019t pass that information on to Fremantle Port Authority before the vessel berthed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to point fingers at this point in time,\u201d McGowan said on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to find out exactly what has gone on. \u201cObviously we\u2019re very concerned and to a degree, disappointed.\u201d He said the men who had tested positive were being quarantined at a Perth hotel while the remaining 42 were being kept on board. They would be monitored and given health assessments as required. \u201cThis is a fast-evolving situation. \u201cBut I suspect it is probably more than likely that more crew members may become infected with the virus.\u201d McGowan said the state government wanted the ship to sail as soon as possible, but obviously needed to ensure the vessel was cleaned first. \u201cWe\u2019re working with the ship\u2019s agents to get the ship to sail as soon as possible.\u201d On Tuesday afternoon, Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, faced several questions about the coronavirus outbreak on the ship during a Senate select committee inquiry into Covid-19. Murphy said he only learned about the outbreak during a meeting of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee on Tuesday afternoon, and that he rushed straight from the meeting to the inquiry so had not had time to find out more. However, he did acknowledge the Australian Border Force, and ultimately the commonwealth, was responsible for cases coming into Australia from ships. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to comment on the circumstances of the Western Australian ship.

      "body": "<p>It takes 18 seconds for Dancing Queen to drop into one of the greatest moments in pop. It speaks volumes that the 18 seconds preceding it are pretty wonderful too: that song bursting into life on that impossibly joyous piano glissando, before eight bars of sparkling, effortless mid-tempo pop.</p> <p>Then Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog and Frida Lyngstad start to sing, effectively bringing us into the middle of a chorus. Their lyrics should scan as simple, bouncy instructions (\u201cYou can dance / You can jive / Having the time of your life\u201d) but the women\u2019s longing harmonies transform them. Stretched over two yearning notes, the word \u201cyou\u201d is delivered to the listener as if Agnetha and Frida are trying desperately to fill them with confidence. As they sing \u201chaving the time of your life\u201d, the melody takes a downward, melancholic turn, and the bassline follows. A moment of enjoyment turns into something sadder, more reflective, perhaps one of nostalgia.</p> <p>We\u2019re then told to switch our perspective \u2013 \u201cto see that girl, watch that scene\u201d \u2013 to imagine ourselves as the Dancing Queen, only 17, feeling the beat of the tambourine. Maybe we once were. Maybe we still can be, even if only in our wedding disco-lit memories, or our glittering imaginations.<br><br>Dancing Queen was the lead single from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/abba\">Abba</a>\u2019s fourth album, Arrival. Released in the summer of 1976, it got to No 1 in 15 countries including the UK (where it stayed at the top for five weeks) and the US. It first came to life a year earlier, when Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson were in their tiny songwriting cabin on the Swedish island of Viggs\u00f6, trying to craft their own take on early disco. They loved the loose, languid drumbeat of George McCrae\u2019s 1974 hit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/31/george-mccrae-rock-your-baby\">Rock Your Baby</a>, and used it as an inspiration (it was even played in the studio before Dancing Queen\u2019s final recording for them to capture its atmosphere).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFrGuyw1V8s\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xFrGuyw1V8s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Abba: Dancing Queen \u2013 video</figcaption> </figure>   <p>They initially called the song Boogaloo, but Abba manager and co-writer Stig Anderson suggested a different title. When Benny Andersson played Lyngstad (then his partner) the instrumental demo, she burst into tears.</p> <p>The dense arrangements in Dancing Queen\u2019s final mix make it especially magical. Their Phil Spector-obsessed audio mixer, Michael B Tretow, talked through the layering of the song in a 2001 BBC pop music series, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375495/\">Walk </a><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375495/\">on By</a>. Multiple tracks of percussion, stuttering guitars, synthesised strings, clavinet and vocals filled every second of the song with nagging pop hooks. In the same documentary, Nile Rodgers said he was hugely inspired by this approach to songcraft (in 1976, he was in the early stages of putting together Chic).</p> <p>Dancing Queen was premiered in June 1976 in a suitably regal setting: a gala to celebrate the wedding of Sweden\u2019s King Carl XVI. By the autumn, it was an international smash, with even smirking music press critics recognising its brilliance. \u201cAny band that can make even disco sound like the Ronettes can\u2019t be all bad!\u201d crowed Robot A Hull in Creem. \u201cIt\u2019s fodder for the masses in its least derogatory sense,\u201d wrote Tim Lott in Sounds. New wavers loved Dancing Queen too. Elvis Costello cribbed its piano line for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jan/27/elvis-costello-10-of-the-best\">Oliver\u2019s Army</a> and Chris Stein admitted that Blondie\u2019s Dreaming was \u201cpretty much a copy of Dancing Queen\u201d.<br><br>Although some of its lyrics have dated (\u201cYou\u2019re a teaser, you turn \u2019em on\u201d might not pass muster today), the bulk of them capture a sense of boundless possibility. Our dancing queen is looking for someone to dance with, but \u201canybody could be that guy\u201d \u2013 the thrilling mystery of the future from the perspective of youth gleams in those words. A verse later, we\u2019re told \u201canyone will do / You\u2019re in the mood for a dance\u201d. Even in the less progressive mid-1970s, having someone to dance with was far less important than the dancing itself.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/29/all-abbas-uk-singles-ranked\">All Abba's UK singles \u2013 ranked!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAnd when you get the chance,\u201d we\u2019re told, we become the dancing queen \u2013 that small word \u201cand\u201d positing this transformation as an inevitability.

      "bodyText": "It takes 18 seconds for Dancing Queen to drop into one of the greatest moments in pop. It speaks volumes that the 18 seconds preceding it are pretty wonderful too: that song bursting into life on that impossibly joyous piano glissando, before eight bars of sparkling, effortless mid-tempo pop. Then Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog and Frida Lyngstad start to sing, effectively bringing us into the middle of a chorus. Their lyrics should scan as simple, bouncy instructions (\u201cYou can dance / You can jive / Having the time of your life\u201d) but the women\u2019s longing harmonies transform them. Stretched over two yearning notes, the word \u201cyou\u201d is delivered to the listener as if Agnetha and Frida are trying desperately to fill them with confidence. As they sing \u201chaving the time of your life\u201d, the melody takes a downward, melancholic turn, and the bassline follows. A moment of enjoyment turns into something sadder, more reflective, perhaps one of nostalgia. We\u2019re then told to switch our perspective \u2013 \u201cto see that girl, watch that scene\u201d \u2013 to imagine ourselves as the Dancing Queen, only 17, feeling the beat of the tambourine. Maybe we once were. Maybe we still can be, even if only in our wedding disco-lit memories, or our glittering imaginations. Dancing Queen was the lead single from Abba\u2019s fourth album, Arrival. Released in the summer of 1976, it got to No 1 in 15 countries including the UK (where it stayed at the top for five weeks) and the US. It first came to life a year earlier, when Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson were in their tiny songwriting cabin on the Swedish island of Viggs\u00f6, trying to craft their own take on early disco. They loved the loose, languid drumbeat of George McCrae\u2019s 1974 hit Rock Your Baby, and used it as an inspiration (it was even played in the studio before Dancing Queen\u2019s final recording for them to capture its atmosphere). They initially called the song Boogaloo, but Abba manager and co-writer Stig Anderson suggested a different title. When Benny Andersson played Lyngstad (then his partner) the instrumental demo, she burst into tears. The dense arrangements in Dancing Queen\u2019s final mix make it especially magical. Their Phil Spector-obsessed audio mixer, Michael B Tretow, talked through the layering of the song in a 2001 BBC pop music series, Walk on By. Multiple tracks of percussion, stuttering guitars, synthesised strings, clavinet and vocals filled every second of the song with nagging pop hooks. In the same documentary, Nile Rodgers said he was hugely inspired by this approach to songcraft (in 1976, he was in the early stages of putting together Chic). Dancing Queen was premiered in June 1976 in a suitably regal setting: a gala to celebrate the wedding of Sweden\u2019s King Carl XVI. By the autumn, it was an international smash, with even smirking music press critics recognising its brilliance. \u201cAny band that can make even disco sound like the Ronettes can\u2019t be all bad!\u201d crowed Robot A Hull in Creem. \u201cIt\u2019s fodder for the masses in its least derogatory sense,\u201d wrote Tim Lott in Sounds. New wavers loved Dancing Queen too. Elvis Costello cribbed its piano line for Oliver\u2019s Army and Chris Stein admitted that Blondie\u2019s Dreaming was \u201cpretty much a copy of Dancing Queen\u201d. Although some of its lyrics have dated (\u201cYou\u2019re a teaser, you turn \u2019em on\u201d might not pass muster today), the bulk of them capture a sense of boundless possibility. Our dancing queen is looking for someone to dance with, but \u201canybody could be that guy\u201d \u2013 the thrilling mystery of the future from the perspective of youth gleams in those words. A verse later, we\u2019re told \u201canyone will do / You\u2019re in the mood for a dance\u201d. Even in the less progressive mid-1970s, having someone to dance with was far less important than the dancing itself. \u201cAnd when you get the chance,\u201d we\u2019re told, we become the dancing queen \u2013 that small word \u201cand\u201d positing this transformation as an inevitability. Today, the song\u2019s legacy still delivers this message. Its way of bringing people together was underlined in the Abba film, Mamma Mia, as an ever-growing crowd gathered to sing it while roaming the streets of the fictional Greek island of Kalokairi. (This montage was revisited, with even bigger crowds, in its 2018 sequel.) Theresa May\u2019s arrival to the song on stage at the 2018 Conservative party conference also showed us its transformative power: the right-wing press briefly turned in her favour in the midst of Brexit negotiations because of it (the Daily Mail said she\u2019d \u201cdanced her way back to authority\u201d). Covers of the song also kept coming in lockdown. US alt-pop artist Elliot Lee released a fragile ukulele version. Lewis Capaldi covered it for an American coronavirus fundraising campaign. It made regular appearances in online social-distancing singalongs too, telling us all that we can dance, we can jive, even when we\u2019re not allowed to look \u201cout for a place to go\u201d. Dancing Queen reminds us that having the time of our lives is something that\u2019s always there, and that\u2019s always possible.",

      "body": "<p>My grandma, who lives in Derry, had never been to England until last year, so it was a great honour when she made the trip to London to visit me and my sister, who have both lived on the mainland (in one city or another) for the best part of a decade. We had \u201cgreat craic\u201d during her stay. We went to the big art galleries and museums, which everyone in the UK helps fund through their taxes, but many never get to visit; she accidentally attended a pro-Brexit protest; and she charmed the waiter of a pizza restaurant with what she calls her \u201cDerry eyes\u201d, striking because of their unusual blue and orange-yellow irises, which she has passed down to my mum, my siblings and me. She wore a lime green suit for the duration of her stay, like a very elegant leprechaun.</p> <p>That was almost a year ago and I haven\u2019t seen her in person since. I\u2019m always a bit jealous of people for whom family get-togethers like these aren\u2019t a rarity. As they are for many young people in the UK who grew up outside of the economic hub of the south-east, the job prospects in the region where I\u2019m from are, shall we say, not great. So, like many young people, I moved away for university, then to London for work, and now my life feels awkwardly spread across several versions of home. I don\u2019t see most of my family as much as I\u2019d like and I feel like I move every few years for reasons not totally within my control. Now that a pandemic has prompted this mass experiment in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/18/from-boardroom-to-spare-room-the-working-from-home-revolution-coronavirus\">working from home</a>, I have been thinking more about whether it has to be this way.</p> <p>The well-trodden path of young people moving to London was detailed in a 2016 report, the Great British Brain Drain, which found that almost a quarter of all UK graduates from the three previous years were <a href=\"https://www.centreforcities.org/publication/great-british-brain-drain-where-graduates-move-and-why/\">working in London within six months</a> of graduating. Of course, some of those students would have gone to universities in London, but the report looked at movement between regions too. It found that, of graduates who moved from the city where they studied, more than a fifth were working in London within six months. For graduates with a first or a 2:1 from Russell Group universities, this jumped to 38%, and for Oxbridge graduates the figure was more than half.</p> <p>The report discussed this \u201cbrain drain\u201d mostly in terms of the negative economic impact it has on the regions that young people leave, but there is a social and cultural one too, which is harder to quantify. I\u2019ve often thought about this and discussed it with friends in similar positions, but the first time I saw any reference to it written down was in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/20/new-model-island-alex-niven-review-mark-fisher\">New Model Island</a>, a book by Alex Niven. In it, he described the \u201cprofound emotional and practical difficulties that come with being uprooted from successive locales\u201d<strong> </strong>experienced by young people from places such as \u201cLiverpool, Newport or Belfast\u201d who move constantly in search of work. It stuck with me because usually this issue is framed only in terms of economics, with no mention of the value of social ties or community. There is an irony here that, while it was Margaret Thatcher who famously declared, \u201cThere is no such thing as society. There are individual men and women and there are families\u201d, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/16/state-intervention-agenda-dont-assume-neoliberalism-dead\">neoliberal economic model</a> she pioneered has driven a geographic wedge into families.</p> <p>Young people from London who aren\u2019t born wealthy fare no better (as Niven also points out), as they are forced out of the boroughs they grew up in (if not the city itself) by ever-rising rents. Communities that were formed by working-class immigrants, who have taken care to preserve elements of their cultural heritage, are broken up to make way for renters, who will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/12/uk-freeze-private-rents-homelessness-coronavirus-labour\">likely be replaced by new renters</a> in a higher salary bracket a few years later. Last week the activist group <a href=\"https://london.eater.com/2020/5/21/21259754/nour-brixton-eviction-hondo-enterprises-brixton-market\">Save Nour</a>, which is campaigning against the eviction of Nour Cash and Carry from Brixton market in south London, released a video in which members of the local community eloquently explained how gentrification had impacted their lives. In this way, London is being hollowed out; a city, as well as a generation, in constant flux.</p> <p>Professional life in the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/britain-imbalance-centuries-old-more-than-shaking-money-tree-correct-it\">orbits around the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/britain-imbalance-centuries-old-more-than-shaking-money-tree-correct-it\">south </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/britain-imbalance-centuries-old-more-than-shaking-money-tree-correct-it\">east</a>; and while politicians may speak of the need to regenerate \u201cleft behind\u201d areas in the rest of the country around election time, it seems unlikely that this government will affect meaningful change any time soon. But now the pandemic has prompted this mass experiment in home working, it seems a shift in the relationship between UK geography and job opportunities doesn\u2019t have to be led by the government.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/pandemic-failings-centralised-state-councils-coronavirus\">The pandemic has exposed the failings of Britain's centralised state | John Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Since the UK started taking the coronavirus seriously, in late March, we\u2019ve seen many societal changes that were supposedly logistically impossible implemented quickly and with relative ease. Almost overnight, most people who work in an office were sent home, and it now seems clear that many could do their job remotely, if not all the time, then at least for most it. Several big tech companies (an industry famous for its early adoption of working practices such as flexible hours, free food and the wearing of hoodies by senior staff), including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/21/facebook-coronavirus-remote-working-policy-extended-years\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52628119\">Twitter</a>, have already said employees will be given the option to work remotely for good. A set-up in which people work from home or a local co-working space and commute to the main office once or twice a month seems feasible for a lot of \u201cknowledge\u201d work, and if this does end up filtering out to other industries it would not be the worst thing for the UK\u2019s regional divide and the rising cost of living in London.</p> <p>I won\u2019t say there would be no drawbacks to the atomisation of the workforce; it may make <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/20/lockdown-union-power-coronavirus\">union organising</a> harder, for example, but it could be a way of starting to transition from a society in which so many elements of our lives are organised around what job we want to do. The neoliberal agenda pursued for the past few decades, in which people are encouraged to maximise their usefulness to private companies and property developers by moving to wherever their skills might be most lucratively deployed, has proven itself to be incompatible with forming or maintaining communities. This could be a chance to reset.</p> <p>\u2022 Rachel Connolly writes about technology, cultural trends and politics</p>",

There are individual men and women and there are families\u201d, the neoliberal economic model she pioneered has driven a geographic wedge into families. Young people from London who aren\u2019t born wealthy fare no better (as Niven also points out), as they are forced out of the boroughs they grew up in (if not the city itself) by ever-rising rents. Communities that were formed by working-class immigrants, who have taken care to preserve elements of their cultural heritage, are broken up to make way for renters, who will likely be replaced by new renters in a higher salary bracket a few years later. Last week the activist group Save Nour, which is campaigning against the eviction of Nour Cash and Carry from Brixton market in south London, released a video in which members of the local community eloquently explained how gentrification had impacted their lives. In this way, London is being hollowed out; a city, as well as a generation, in constant flux. Professional life in the UK orbits around the south east; and while politicians may speak of the need to regenerate \u201cleft behind\u201d areas in the rest of the country around election time, it seems unlikely that this government will affect meaningful change any time soon. But now the pandemic has prompted this mass experiment in home working, it seems a shift in the relationship between UK geography and job opportunities doesn\u2019t have to be led by the government. Since the UK started taking the coronavirus seriously, in late March, we\u2019ve seen many societal changes that were supposedly logistically impossible implemented quickly and with relative ease. Almost overnight, most people who work in an office were sent home, and it now seems clear that many could do their job remotely, if not all the time, then at least for most it. Several big tech companies (an industry famous for its early adoption of working practices such as flexible hours, free food and the wearing of hoodies by senior staff), including Facebook and Twitter, have already said employees will be given the option to work remotely for good. A set-up in which people work from home or a local co-working space and commute to the main office once or twice a month seems feasible for a lot of \u201cknowledge\u201d work, and if this does end up filtering out to other industries it would not be the worst thing for the UK\u2019s regional divide and the rising cost of living in London. I won\u2019t say there would be no drawbacks to the atomisation of the workforce; it may make union organising harder, for example, but it could be a way of starting to transition from a society in which so many elements of our lives are organised around what job we want to do. The neoliberal agenda pursued for the past few decades, in which people are encouraged to maximise their usefulness to private companies and property developers by moving to wherever their skills might be most lucratively deployed, has proven itself to be incompatible with forming or maintaining communities. This could be a chance to reset. \u2022 Rachel Connolly writes about technology, cultural trends and politics",

      "body": "<p>Two days after their first date \u2013 which was also their first meeting \u2013 the comedian Peter Sellers gave Britt Ekland a dachshund puppy called Pepper.</p> <p>Ekland had just arrived in London from Sweden to be 20th Century Fox\u2019s next big star. She was 21 years old and living at the Dorchester hotel; a dog was a ridiculous gift, she says. So was Sellers\u2019 previous largesse \u2013 every bloom in the hotel\u2019s flower shop. \u201cThat was the way he wooed me.\u201d</p> <p>Just 10 days after their first date, Ekland and Sellers \u2013 17 years her senior \u2013 were married, and the puppy was lost in the whirlwind. \u201cAll these years, I always wondered: what happened to Pepper?\u201d says Ekland, now 77. Two weeks ago, she found out. A woman wrote to Ekland\u2019s agent, saying she had taken Pepper, and that he lived a \u201clong and happy life\u201d. Ekland sighs, audibly relieved.</p> <p>Although she lives mostly in Sweden and Los Angeles, Ekland was in the UK touring in the play The Cat and the Canary when the coronavirus hit. She is coping well in lockdown in London, walking her dog and cleaning. But, as a \u201c<em>totally</em> nonessential worker\u201d, life has slowed dramatically.</p> <p>Ekland\u2019s career began when she was a teenager, appearing in chewing gum adverts and doing modelling jobs. She would go on to become one of the most-photographed women of the 1970s: as Sellers\u2019 young bride, Roger Moore\u2019s Bond girl in The Man With the Golden Gun and in high-profile relationships with the record exec Lou Adler and rock stars Rod Stewart, Phil Lewis and Slim Jim Phantom.</p> <p>That she remains so prolific today \u2013 a fixture of reality television, talkshows and the panto circuit \u2013 is down to her work ethic. \u201cIf you want publicity, you\u2019ve got to do something to deserve publicity,\u201d she says. Even since lockdown began, she has appeared in BBC One\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08fpbkd\">The Real Marigold Hotel</a> (where a group of older<strong> </strong>celebrities live out a retirement fantasy<strong> </strong>in India) and in the BBC Two documentary <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000j4c1\">Peter Sellers: A State of Comic Ecstasy</a>, about the comedian\u2019s mental health problems, and his alcohol and substance misuse. That Ekland is still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/03/britt-ekland-on-peter-sellers-he-was-a-very-tormented-soul\">best known</a> as Sellers\u2019 former wife is testament to the star power \u2013 and infamous intensity \u2013 of their pairing.</p> <p>They met in January 1964 after Sellers saw Ekland\u2019s photograph in the newspaper and sent his valet round to her room. As he put it once: \u201cI thought that I would like to meet what I saw.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"137b52fa6004272619cf51dc54d8681782c2f7ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/137b52fa6004272619cf51dc54d8681782c2f7ad/0_473_1796_1077/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ekland with Peter Sellers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ekland with Peter Sellers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allan Grant/The LIFE Images Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ekland knew his name only from gossip magazines as a beauty pageant judge who had reportedly tried it on with Miss Sweden. She wore \u201ca lot\u201d of clothes to go to his suite, she says wryly. She thought Sellers worldly and suave, but she \u201cdidn\u2019t have a clue\u201d about his career. When Sellers realised, he suggested a trip to the cinema \u2013 to see The Pink Panther, in which he played Inspector Clouseau. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t about you telling him about yourself,\u201d says Ekland. \u201cThis was about him telling you.\u201d</p> <p>His marriage proposal, if you can call it that, was similarly brazen. About a week after they met, Ekland left for New York. Sellers called her. \u201cHe said: \u2018I\u2019ve told the press we\u2019re getting married. Is that OK with you?\u2019 I didn\u2019t know what to say. Even to this day, I don\u2019t know what I said.\u201d</p> <p>Ekland says she wasn\u2019t the type to look for red flags. She describes herself as wilful and \u201cextremely impulsive \u2026 I\u2019m like a steamroller \u2013 I just go forward. I don\u2019t have that stopper in me \u2026 Someone falls down in front of me, then I fall in love with him.\u201d As a teenager in Stockholm, she \u201cfell in love every five seconds\u201d, once writing in her diary in blood while playing Tchaikovsky\u2019s Swan Lake. \u201cYou had a bit of a snog, then it was over, so you wrote in blood,\u201d Ekland says pragmatically, when I bring it up.</p> <p>Her father was delighted when she married Sellers, despite the age gap. \u201cFame overcomes a lot of things,\u201d she says drily. Not that he could have stopped her. She was \u201cdeliriously happy\u201d, \u201cmadly in love\u201d and soon to be a big star.</p> <p>Then, she says: \u201cIt all came crashing down.\u201d Days after their wedding, Sellers flew to Los Angeles for a film and sent her a <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/5940486/New-Peter-Sellers-letter-on-marriage-to-Britt-Ekland.html\">three-page letter</a> obsessing that she might leave him or be unfaithful, and saying he wanted to have \u201cviolent\u201d sex with her. It was signed with 25 kisses.</p> <p>Sellers urged Ekland to join him for Easter, waving away her commitments<strong> </strong>to shoot the film Guns at Batasi. She acquiesced. Within days of her arrival in Los Angeles, he had the first of a series of heart attacks. \u201cBy the following Sunday, he was on life support.\u201d Ekland\u2019s parents flew out to join her, and she learned to drive between Sellers\u2019 mansion and the hospital. \u201cI prayed to God a lot, even though I\u2019m not a religious person \u2026 just hoping and believing that he would pull through.\u201d He did, and their daughter Victoria was born in January 1965.</p> <p>By then, Ekland had been fired by Fox for breach of contract for leaving Guns at Batasi, and knew about Sellers\u2019 dark side. In company, he was \u201cthe joker, the fabulous comedian\u201d, she says sarcastically. \u201cHe kept the table going for hours \u2026 everyone loved him: \u2018Such a fun evening!\u2019\u201d The question she has been asked most in her life is: \u201cHow fun was Peter Sellers at home?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"122babbda34d8a93b6537ed9f41e4293bbd8eb9e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/122babbda34d8a93b6537ed9f41e4293bbd8eb9e/0_186_2781_1667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ekland with Rod Stewart in 1975.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ekland with Rod Stewart in 1975.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In truth, he was \u201cvery possessive and very, very moody\u201d. He would threaten Ekland with divorce, then just as capriciously make up, and fly into jealous rages. The abuse was never physical \u2013 if it had been, Ekland says she \u201cmight have left sooner \u2026 I know that sounds horrible. [But] I\u2019m just being practical.\u201d Did she see the relationship as abusive at all? She hesitates. \u201cWell, I realised it wasn\u2019t right \u2013 someone putting me through emotional and psychological warfare.\u201d</p> <p>Once, Hugh Hefner told Sellers he had nude pictures of Ekland as a ploy to get Sellers, a keen photographer, to supply some himself. Ekland, who was always \u201cvery prudish\u201d, knew it was a bluff. \u201cI never purposely posed half-naked.\u201d Even shooting films, she would cover herself up with black camera tape \u2013 \u201chowever painful it was to take off\u201d. She scoffs to hear herself described as a sex symbol. \u201cI don\u2019t know what a \u2018sex symbol\u2019 is.\u201d<strong><br><br></strong>Sure enough, Hefner\u2019s smoking gun showed Ekland with scarcely a bare shoulder. But Sellers had not believed her. \u201cIt was just horrifying that he should accuse me of something that was so very far from who I was.\u201d</p> <p>No fight was too petty, says Ekland. \u201cIf I spoke to my mother in Swedish, that would be a huge rant for hours, like this \u2026\u201d She mimics an unintelligible, screeching tirade. \u201cHe never took a pause.\u201d Ekland confided in the actor Nanette Newman and her husband, the director Bryan Forbes \u2013 the couple\u2019s closest friends in Hollywood. \u201cOne night, I just got in the car and drove to them to seek shelter \u2026 this continued throughout my marriage.\u201d</p> <p>It all ended as abruptly as it began. After dinner at the Excelsior hotel in Rome, Ekland permitted the paparazzi to take their photograph, enraging Sellers. In their room, his \u201chigh-pitched waffling\u201d went on all night, prompting noise complaints.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cd26faac2ee1f419ac220022d9acb6a617396aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cd26faac2ee1f419ac220022d9acb6a617396aa/0_507_3961_2378/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Sellers in the 1965 film After the Fox.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Sellers in the 1965 film After the Fox.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mondadori Portfolio/Mondadori via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEventually, at 5am, I\u2019d been so traumatised, I couldn\u2019t take any more,\u201d says Ekland. (Some accounts say she took a Valium.) \u201cAnd he suddenly just said: \u2018That\u2019s it. You\u2019re out of here.\u2019\u201d Sellers called the couple\u2019s agent, who took Ekland to another hotel nearby, \u201cwhere I hid until I got the flight to Sweden\u201d. There she was reunited with Victoria, then about five, who had been in the UK with her nanny.</p> <p>Sellers made several efforts to reconcile, but, says Ekland: \u201cI knew that this was it \u2013 I\u2019d had enough.\u201d Only someone \u201cmentally super-strong\u201d could have withstood four years, she adds. They divorced in December 1968.</p> <p>Sellers died of a heart attack in 1980. Although he was never diagnosed, Ekland believes him to have had bipolar disorder. Though she <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_92twoB5-h/\">has disputed</a> accounts of Sellers\u2019 alcohol and cocaine dependency, she told the recent BBC Two documentary that he was unable to get help for his mental health problems \u201cbecause he was such a valuable asset\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m the proudest Bond girl there is, because there are not a lot of us left</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ekland has only ever sought help for her mental health once \u2013 in the 80s, after her mother died of Alzheimer\u2019s aged 78. Although she disliked her father, she and her mother were very close. \u201cWherever I worked, she always came.\u201d Ekland was prescribed antidepressants after her loss, but stopped taking them after three days.</p> <p>She is used to getting on with things. \u201cI am so used to taking care of myself, I don\u2019t need anyone to do anything for me.\u201d Her most recent marriage, to the Stray Cats drummer, Slim Jim Phantom, ended after eight years in 1992. After three children by three partners, Ekland was preaching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/06/self-partnered-emma-watson-is-right-we-need-more-ways-to-be-single\">\u201cself-partnership\u201d</a> long before Emma Watson, back when there really was a stigma.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been a modern woman, and I still am,\u201d says Ekland now. That said, she is scathing of some modern women \u2013 specifically, social media influencers. Without naming names, she says she pities \u201cthose poor Plasticine models \u2026 throwing themselves explicitly over their Instagrams. All that effort, for such little payback.\u201d<br><strong><br></strong>Even Bond girls do not make the same impact today, says Ekland. \u201cI\u2019m the proudest Bond girl there is because there are not a lot of us left, and there won\u2019t be any in future.\u201d She <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/man-with-the-golden-gun-siren-britt-ekland-says-modern-bond-girls-have-tough-time-8168115.html\">has said</a> modern Bond girls have it harder than she did, there now being \u201cso many demands\u201d \u2013 she believes, imposed by political correctness.<br><br>\u201cThe Bond girl has to look good in a bikini: that was her role \u2026 The Bond girl of my era exists no more because they\u2019re not presented that way. You wouldn\u2019t see her in a bikini next to Daniel Craig in a suit today \u2013 the PR department would make sure that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e2dac8168603f4d7ffff04bde4a3b63494b15e62\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2dac8168603f4d7ffff04bde4a3b63494b15e62/0_52_1592_1988/801.jpg\" alt=\"Ekland in a publicity shot for The Man With the Golden Gun.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ekland in a publicity shot for The Man With the Golden Gun.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: United Artists/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ekland also brushes off beauty standards as a factor in her historical embrace of cosmetic surgery. Once outspoken in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/aug/17/healthandwellbeing.celebrity\">her praise of it</a> for over-40s (\u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful\u201d), it is now among her biggest regrets thanks to a botched lip procedure in 1994. \u201cExcruciatingly painful\u201d corrective attempts \u201cto try to melt the stuff\u201d injected into her lips have not been quite successful \u2013 as is \u201cconstantly\u201d pointed out on social media, says Ekland exasperatedly. \u201cTo all the people who say: \u2018She\u2019s destroyed her face,\u2019 \u2013 yes! I didn\u2019t do that purposely; I don\u2019t want to look like this, but I have no choice. I\u2019ve learned to live with it, so you\u2019d better learn to live with it.\u201d</p> <p>Until \u201ca few years ago\u201d, Ekland observes ironically, \u201cI was always striving to look older\u201d. She credits her youthful appearance with keeping her from the predation in Hollywood exposed by #MeToo. \u201cI knew that was going on, but I was never in the inner [circles] where it was gossiped about \u2026 men were a little bit intimidated by the naivety of me. I think they\u2019d just look at me and say: \u2018She\u2019s so young \u2013 we can\u2019t touch her.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Today, Ekland is grandmother to seven-year-old Cash and three-year-old Lucas \u2013 born to her second child, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4989393/?ref_=nmbio_trv_5\">Nic Adler</a>, in Los Angeles. Months after he was born, Lucas was found to have <a href=\"https://www.alextlc.org/what-is-a-leukodystrophy/the-different-leukodystrophies/adrenoleukodystrophy-ald/\">adrenoleukodystrophy</a>, an <a href=\"https://www.alextlc.org/what-is-a-leukodystrophy/the-different-leukodystrophies/adrenoleukodystrophy-ald/\">untreatable genetic condition</a> that causes progressive degeneration of the brain in boys and is often terminal.

      "bodyText": "Two days after their first date \u2013 which was also their first meeting \u2013 the comedian Peter Sellers gave Britt Ekland a dachshund puppy called Pepper. Ekland had just arrived in London from Sweden to be 20th Century Fox\u2019s next big star. She was 21 years old and living at the Dorchester hotel; a dog was a ridiculous gift, she says. So was Sellers\u2019 previous largesse \u2013 every bloom in the hotel\u2019s flower shop. \u201cThat was the way he wooed me.\u201d Just 10 days after their first date, Ekland and Sellers \u2013 17 years her senior \u2013 were married, and the puppy was lost in the whirlwind. \u201cAll these years, I always wondered: what happened to Pepper?\u201d says Ekland, now 77. Two weeks ago, she found out. A woman wrote to Ekland\u2019s agent, saying she had taken Pepper, and that he lived a \u201clong and happy life\u201d. Ekland sighs, audibly relieved. Although she lives mostly in Sweden and Los Angeles, Ekland was in the UK touring in the play The Cat and the Canary when the coronavirus hit. She is coping well in lockdown in London, walking her dog and cleaning. But, as a \u201ctotally nonessential worker\u201d, life has slowed dramatically. Ekland\u2019s career began when she was a teenager, appearing in chewing gum adverts and doing modelling jobs. She would go on to become one of the most-photographed women of the 1970s: as Sellers\u2019 young bride, Roger Moore\u2019s Bond girl in The Man With the Golden Gun and in high-profile relationships with the record exec Lou Adler and rock stars Rod Stewart, Phil Lewis and Slim Jim Phantom. That she remains so prolific today \u2013 a fixture of reality television, talkshows and the panto circuit \u2013 is down to her work ethic. \u201cIf you want publicity, you\u2019ve got to do something to deserve publicity,\u201d she says. Even since lockdown began, she has appeared in BBC One\u2019s The Real Marigold Hotel (where a group of older celebrities live out a retirement fantasy in India) and in the BBC Two documentary Peter Sellers: A State of Comic Ecstasy, about the comedian\u2019s mental health problems, and his alcohol and substance misuse. That Ekland is still best known as Sellers\u2019 former wife is testament to the star power \u2013 and infamous intensity \u2013 of their pairing. They met in January 1964 after Sellers saw Ekland\u2019s photograph in the newspaper and sent his valet round to her room. As he put it once: \u201cI thought that I would like to meet what I saw.\u201d Ekland knew his name only from gossip magazines as a beauty pageant judge who had reportedly tried it on with Miss Sweden. She wore \u201ca lot\u201d of clothes to go to his suite, she says wryly. She thought Sellers worldly and suave, but she \u201cdidn\u2019t have a clue\u201d about his career. When Sellers realised, he suggested a trip to the cinema \u2013 to see The Pink Panther, in which he played Inspector Clouseau. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t about you telling him about yourself,\u201d says Ekland. \u201cThis was about him telling you.\u201d His marriage proposal, if you can call it that, was similarly brazen. About a week after they met, Ekland left for New York. Sellers called her. \u201cHe said: \u2018I\u2019ve told the press we\u2019re getting married. Is that OK with you?\u2019 I didn\u2019t know what to say. Even to this day, I don\u2019t know what I said.\u201d Ekland says she wasn\u2019t the type to look for red flags. She describes herself as wilful and \u201cextremely impulsive \u2026 I\u2019m like a steamroller \u2013 I just go forward. I don\u2019t have that stopper in me \u2026 Someone falls down in front of me, then I fall in love with him.\u201d As a teenager in Stockholm, she \u201cfell in love every five seconds\u201d, once writing in her diary in blood while playing Tchaikovsky\u2019s Swan Lake. \u201cYou had a bit of a snog, then it was over, so you wrote in blood,\u201d Ekland says pragmatically, when I bring it up. Her father was delighted when she married Sellers, despite the age gap. \u201cFame overcomes a lot of things,\u201d she says drily. Not that he could have stopped her. She was \u201cdeliriously happy\u201d, \u201cmadly in love\u201d and soon to be a big star. Then, she says: \u201cIt all came crashing down.\u201d Days after their wedding, Sellers flew to Los Angeles for a film and sent her a three-page letter obsessing that she might leave him or be unfaithful, and saying he wanted to have \u201cviolent\u201d sex with her. It was signed with 25 kisses. Sellers urged Ekland to join him for Easter, waving away her commitments to shoot the film Guns at Batasi. She acquiesced. Within days of her arrival in Los Angeles, he had the first of a series of heart attacks. \u201cBy the following Sunday, he was on life support.\u201d Ekland\u2019s parents flew out to join her, and she learned to drive between Sellers\u2019 mansion and the hospital. \u201cI prayed to God a lot, even though I\u2019m not a religious person \u2026 just hoping and believing that he would pull through.\u201d He did, and their daughter Victoria was born in January 1965. By then, Ekland had been fired by Fox for breach of contract for leaving Guns at Batasi, and knew about Sellers\u2019 dark side. In company, he was \u201cthe joker, the fabulous comedian\u201d, she says sarcastically. \u201cHe kept the table going for hours \u2026 everyone loved him: \u2018Such a fun evening!\u2019\u201d The question she has been asked most in her life is: \u201cHow fun was Peter Sellers at home?\u201d In truth, he was \u201cvery possessive and very, very moody\u201d. He would threaten Ekland with divorce, then just as capriciously make up, and fly into jealous rages. The abuse was never physical \u2013 if it had been, Ekland says she \u201cmight have left sooner \u2026 I know that sounds horrible. [But] I\u2019m just being practical.\u201d Did she see the relationship as abusive at all? She hesitates. \u201cWell, I realised it wasn\u2019t right \u2013 someone putting me through emotional and psychological warfare.\u201d Once, Hugh Hefner told Sellers he had nude pictures of Ekland as a ploy to get Sellers, a keen photographer, to supply some himself. Ekland, who was always \u201cvery prudish\u201d, knew it was a bluff. \u201cI never purposely posed half-naked.\u201d Even shooting films, she would cover herself up with black camera tape \u2013 \u201chowever painful it was to take off\u201d. She scoffs to hear herself described as a sex symbol. \u201cI don\u2019t know what a \u2018sex symbol\u2019 is.\u201d Sure enough, Hefner\u2019s smoking gun showed Ekland with scarcely a bare shoulder. But Sellers had not believed her. \u201cIt was just horrifying that he should accuse me of something that was so very far from who I was.\u201d No fight was too petty, says Ekland. \u201cIf I spoke to my mother in Swedish, that would be a huge rant for hours, like this \u2026\u201d She mimics an unintelligible, screeching tirade. \u201cHe never took a pause.\u201d Ekland confided in the actor Nanette Newman and her husband, the director Bryan Forbes \u2013 the couple\u2019s closest friends in Hollywood. \u201cOne night, I just got in the car and drove to them to seek shelter \u2026 this continued throughout my marriage.\u201d It all ended as abruptly as it began. After dinner at the Excelsior hotel in Rome, Ekland permitted the paparazzi to take their photograph, enraging Sellers. In their room, his \u201chigh-pitched waffling\u201d went on all night, prompting noise complaints. \u201cEventually, at 5am, I\u2019d been so traumatised, I couldn\u2019t take any more,\u201d says Ekland. (Some accounts say she took a Valium.) \u201cAnd he suddenly just said: \u2018That\u2019s it. You\u2019re out of here.\u2019\u201d Sellers called the couple\u2019s agent, who took Ekland to another hotel nearby, \u201cwhere I hid until I got the flight to Sweden\u201d. There she was reunited with Victoria, then about five, who had been in the UK with her nanny. Sellers made several efforts to reconcile, but, says Ekland: \u201cI knew that this was it \u2013 I\u2019d had enough.\u201d Only someone \u201cmentally super-strong\u201d could have withstood four years, she adds. They divorced in December 1968. Sellers died of a heart attack in 1980. Although he was never diagnosed, Ekland believes him to have had bipolar disorder. Though she has disputed accounts of Sellers\u2019 alcohol and cocaine dependency, she told the recent BBC Two documentary that he was unable to get help for his mental health problems \u201cbecause he was such a valuable asset\u201d. Ekland has only ever sought help for her mental health once \u2013 in the 80s, after her mother died of Alzheimer\u2019s aged 78. Although she disliked her father, she and her mother were very close. \u201cWherever I worked, she always came.\u201d Ekland was prescribed antidepressants after her loss, but stopped taking them after three days. She is used to getting on with things. \u201cI am so used to taking care of myself, I don\u2019t need anyone to do anything for me.\u201d Her most recent marriage, to the Stray Cats drummer, Slim Jim Phantom, ended after eight years in 1992. After three children by three partners, Ekland was preaching \u201cself-partnership\u201d long before Emma Watson, back when there really was a stigma. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a modern woman, and I still am,\u201d says Ekland now. That said, she is scathing of some modern women \u2013 specifically, social media influencers. Without naming names, she says she pities \u201cthose poor Plasticine models \u2026 throwing themselves explicitly over their Instagrams. All that effort, for such little payback.\u201d Even Bond girls do not make the same impact today, says Ekland. \u201cI\u2019m the proudest Bond girl there is because there are not a lot of us left, and there won\u2019t be any in future.\u201d She has said modern Bond girls have it harder than she did, there now being \u201cso many demands\u201d \u2013 she believes, imposed by political correctness. \u201cThe Bond girl has to look good in a bikini: that was her role \u2026 The Bond girl of my era exists no more because they\u2019re not presented that way. You wouldn\u2019t see her in a bikini next to Daniel Craig in a suit today \u2013 the PR department would make sure that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Ekland also brushes off beauty standards as a factor in her historical embrace of cosmetic surgery. Once outspoken in her praise of it for over-40s (\u201cI think it\u2019s wonderful\u201d), it is now among her biggest regrets thanks to a botched lip procedure in 1994. \u201cExcruciatingly painful\u201d corrective attempts \u201cto try to melt the stuff\u201d injected into her lips have not been quite successful \u2013 as is \u201cconstantly\u201d pointed out on social media, says Ekland exasperatedly. \u201cTo all the people who say: \u2018She\u2019s destroyed her face,\u2019 \u2013 yes! I didn\u2019t do that purposely; I don\u2019t want to look like this, but I have no choice. I\u2019ve learned to live with it, so you\u2019d better learn to live with it.\u201d Until \u201ca few years ago\u201d, Ekland observes ironically, \u201cI was always striving to look older\u201d. She credits her youthful appearance with keeping her from the predation in Hollywood exposed by #MeToo. \u201cI knew that was going on, but I was never in the inner [circles] where it was gossiped about \u2026 men were a little bit intimidated by the naivety of me. I think they\u2019d just look at me and say: \u2018She\u2019s so young \u2013 we can\u2019t touch her.\u2019\u201d Today, Ekland is grandmother to seven-year-old Cash and three-year-old Lucas \u2013 born to her second child, Nic Adler, in Los Angeles. Months after he was born, Lucas was found to have adrenoleukodystrophy, an untreatable genetic condition that causes progressive degeneration of the brain in boys and is often terminal. Lucas\u2019s early diagnosis from routine newborn screening in California allowed for early interventions. Ekland has since become a patron for the UK leukodystrophy charity Alex TLC to campaign for the condition to be added to the birth screen in the UK, \u201cso that all these boys have a future\u201d. When she will next be able to see her family in person is a concern \u2013 but as ever, Ekland takes a pragmatic view. \u201cI\u2019m very much a person who lives for the day. Today, I feel good, nothing is really horrible \u2026 so: I find that I\u2019m lucky.\u201d For now, her plans are only to write back to the woman who took in her dog 56 years ago, \u201cand find out exactly what happened\u201d. But, says Ekland emphatically, \u201cthe only thing I care about is that Pepper had a wonderful life.\u201d",

Some of them need the assistance of nurses or walkers, or both, to complete the journey. \u201cUsually, we do this a couple of times but it is a little bit cold today so we are going just once,\u201d says Henry Ofori Mensah, administrator at Comfort For The Aged, a residential care home in Kasoa, a dormitory town west of Accra, Ghana\u2019s capital. At the turn of the century, a facility like this would have been hard to imagine in Ghana. About 58% of Ghana\u2019s population is under the age of 25. But improvements in public health and advances in medicine have ment that life expectancy has increased from 54 years in 1984 to 63 years in 2016.

Traditionally, elderly relatives stayed at home to help raise grandchildren and, as they aged, they were in turn cared for by those younger family members. But Ghana, now a middle-income country, has an expanding middle class. An increase in women\u2019s education means family sizes have shrunk substantially. The total fertility rate in Ghana has almost halved from 6.4 children per woman in 1988 to 3.9 children per woman (3.3 children for an urban woman) in 2017. The pace of urban life, the demands of education and work means that many families are struggling to care for their elderly relatives. \u201cGrandma will wake up to an empty house, has, maybe, the TV for company \u2026 and because of traffic, [the rest of the family] come home late at night. That is when she is trying to talk to them but they are tired,\u201d says Dr Esi Ansah, founder of the Association of Ghana\u2019s Elders (Age). \u201cSo there is a lot of benign neglect; a lot of seniors are around people but they are alone and lonely. The state assumes the family will take care of people but families have changed, family structures have changed,\u201d says Ansah. Chronic loneliness can precipitate depression and, \u201conce depression sets in, so many other things follow,\u201d says Dr Akye Essuman, director of Ghana\u2019s first geriatric medicine fellowship. \u201cPeople with hypertension can get out of control; if they have diabetes that can also get out of control.\u201d Private care homes are slowly but steadily being introduced in the hope of revolutionising how this conservative society on the cusp of tradition and modernity cares for its senior citizens.

The home has a structured daily routine, with nurses on hand to help with medication, hospital visits and other assisted living services such as grooming.

But when she came here, she started talking because we were always engaging [with] her,\u201d says Asomani. \u201cWe give them total nursing care. When you come here, you stay as if you are in your house.\u201d During the three-week coronavirus lockdown of Ghana\u2019s two largest metropolitan areas, staff stayed at the residential home and visitors were banned to prevent the virus from spreading into the home, a restriction that remains in place. Benjamin Ocansey, an electronics technician in Accra, moved his 89-year-old mother from a village in Ghana\u2019s central region to the care home six months ago because of her mobility issues. \u201cIn the rural area, the management of such conditions is next to nothing [but in the care home], she is going to get all those services and the management will be better than when she is on her own in the family home,\u201d he said. However, the main challenge is confronting societal perceptions about care homes. \u201c[They are] culturally perceived as a foreign or western concept, which is alien to the Ghanaian culture,\u201d says Dr Delali Adjoa Dovie of the Centre for Ageing Studies at the University of Ghana. One thing nearly all of the residents have in common is that they have previously lived, or their children currently live, in the west. Initially, Ocansey\u2019s five younger siblings were not happy about their mother\u2019s move to the home. \u201cThey had no knowledge of how the care system worked so they thought that I was going to dump her somewhere and forget about her,\u201d he says. But after visiting the home, there was a change of mind and some siblings have begun contributing to the monthly costs. There are no government-run care homes for older people and the cost of private care homes puts them out of reach for many Ghanaians struggling to look after ageing parents. A national ageing policy drafted in 2010 is \u201cstill sitting on ice\u201d, says Ansah. Essuman believes it is also important to develop alternative care structures, such as daycare centres and home care services so that older adults can stay in their own homes to receive care for as long as possible. \u201cWe need to look at what is culturally acceptable and what is also medically prudent and see where we can marry the two.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Good evening, here are the latest developments on the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. This is Ben Doherty and it is Tuesday 26 May. Six Covid-19 cases detected on board a ship in WA and two in Sydney schools Coronavirus has been detected on board a live export ship in Western Australia and forced two schools to close in Sydney, sparking fresh warnings of further outbreaks. Six members of Al Kuwait\u2019s 48 crew have tested positive for the disease after the ship docked at Fremantle port on Friday. Two independent schools in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs, which had been a virus hotspot in the early stages of the pandemic\u2019s spread in Australia, were closed on Tuesday after a student at each tested positive. Waverley College and Moriah College \u2013 less than 2km from each other \u2013 sent students home a day after state schools reopened across New South Wales. Australian active cases remain under 500 Australia has recorded 7,133 confirmed cases of Covid-19, with 15 new cases confirmed on Tuesday. There are 478 active cases of coronavirus across the country, and 102 people have died. Globally, the number of infections is approaching 5.5 million, and 346,000 people have died, nearly 100,000 of those in the United States. Around the grounds ... In Western Australia, after six cases of Covid-19 were confirmed aboard Al Kuwait, the premier, Mark McGowan, said he was concerned federal agriculture officials were aware crew members had a fever but allowed the ship to anchor without telling state authorities. The state\u2019s health minister, Roger Cook, said the incident highlighted the ongoing risks of the virus. \u201cWe expect to see clusters of the virus continue to pop up. This is another reason why our hard border must stay for now.\u201d In Queensland, a Ruby Princess passenger has tested positive more than two months after leaving the notorious cruise ship. And the state\u2019s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has maintained her uncompromising line on state border closures despite pressure from the federal government and tourism operators. In Victoria, a Melbourne teacher was confirmed to have coronavirus on Friday before 400,000 public school students returned on Tuesday. The teacher, one of 17,500 staff tested before Victoria\u2019s staggered reopening of primary and secondary schools, had not been at the school where he taught. Five new cases were reported in Victoria, three of which were travellers recently returned from overseas in hotel quarantine. The Northern Territory chief minister, Michael Gunner, has indicated borders will reopen within 60 days to kickstart tourism. And Tasmania will consider easing restrictions ahead of schedule after the number of active cases in the state fell to eight. The South Australian chief health officer, Nicola Spurrier, reported one new case of coronavirus in that state, from a woman in her 50s who had come into the state from Victoria. The woman had recently returned from overseas, and had been in quarantine in Melbourne. She was granted an exemption for family and compassionate reasons to fly to South Australia. Four new cases were reported in NSW: two in school students (see above), and two in returned travellers quarantined in hotels. And pubs are back open in the ACT, with strict social distancing measures in place, and limits of 20 people in a single room or space (but some larger venues will be able to accommodate up to 150 people). NRL\u2019s fan proposal \u2018absurd and dangerous\u2019, doctors say The NRL\u2019s ambitious push to get crowds back into stadiums on match days in a matter of weeks has been dismissed as \u201cabsurd and dangerous\u201d by the Australian Medical Association. With the NRL to resume its suspended 2020 season behind closed doors on Thursday, the ARLC chairman, Peter V\u2019landys, on Monday raised the idea of a limited number of fans being allowed back into stadiums by 1 July. \u201cPut bluntly, this absurd and dangerous idea belongs in the sin bin,\u201d the AMA president, Tony Bartone, said. In economic news \u2026 The prime minister, Scott Morrision, wants to ditch Australia\u2019s \u201cclunky and unresponsive\u201d training system as part of his government\u2019s jobmaker employment reform plans to be unveiled after the pandemic. Speaking at the National Press Club, Morrison said the Coalition would not pursue union-busting legislation as a sign of good faith, as he seeks to encourage business and unions to join a four-month Accord-style negotiation for widespread industrial relations reform. The Australian share market jumped to an 11-week high amid global optimism at a world economy gradually reopening. The benchmark ASX 200 index ended the day 2.9% higher at 5,780 points \u2013 its highest level since March 10. The market has gained 5.15% in two days.

Thousands of non-EU migrants, who require visas to work or study here, have a visa condition of \u201cno recourse to public funds\u201d (NRPF), so they cannot access any benefits, or Covid-19 crisis government support schemes, says Daghlian. \u201cNRPF should have been suspended at the start of this pandemic and it should be suspended now. It is causing enormous stress, hunger, and may lead to homelessness.\u201d </p> <p>Stephen Timms, the Labour MP for Newham, has even said that NRPF has \u201cundoubtedly contributed to the scale of Covid-19 fatalities\u201d in his constituency. It may also pose a risk to all our health, continues Daghlian: \u201cIf you can\u2019t feed yourself without working, you will go to work if you possibly can, even if you\u2019ve been exposed to Covid-19 or have symptoms.\u201d</p> <p>Migrants make up a disproportionate number of the workers in the frontline of the Covid crisis. <a href=\"https://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/2020/between-immobility-and-resistance-low-skilled-migrants-in-the-pandemic/\">In 2019</a>, around 20% of health workers were migrants, along with 18% of those in social care and 26% in the transport and storage sectors. They are also <a href=\"https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/migrants-in-the-uk-labour-market-an-overview/\">more likely than others to work in insecure employment</a>.</p> <p>\u201cSome migrants have worked here for years (and paid taxes) and NRPF hasn\u2019t been a problem,\u201d Daghlian continues, \u201cbut when a crisis like Covid-19 comes along and they lose their job, or worse, the family breadwinner, there\u2019s no safety net.\u201d</p> <p>Families who have lost their income may resort to using money saved for their next visa renewal, says Daghlian. Non-EU migrants (and potentially EU citizens as well after the Brexit transition period ends) must renew their visas periodically: in many cases every 2.5 years until they have been here 10 years and are able to apply for indefinite leave to remain. Each renewal can cost a family thousands of pounds, says Daghlian: \u201cThe government is profiteering. They have raised fees to extortionate levels that are causing real hardship.\u201d</p> <p>She cites the example of Praxis client Michelle (not her real name) from west Africa<strong>,</strong> who has two British children and works for the NHS in what the government would call an \u201cunskilled\u201d role. \u201cShe has been cleaning Covid-19 wards and feeding Covid patients\u201d explains Daghlian. \u201cWe clap every Thursday, but she was still expected to pay \u00a32,000 to renew her visa (which expired earlier this month) and \u00a31,000 of that was an NHS surcharge, required on top of her tax and national insurance, to allow her access to the NHS\u201d.</p> <p>Following pressure from all sides, the government last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/johnson-forced-to-drop-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers\">dropped the NHS surcharge</a> for all those working in the health service, but it is not yet clear if this is retrospective. And while visas are being automatically renewed for many health workers and some social care staff until October, this does not apply to support staff, such as cleaners and hospital porters.</p> <p>The charity is helping Michelle apply for a fee waiver on grounds of destitution.

Reporting lags mean the actual infection rate for both tribes could be significantly higher. Coronavirus is novel to the world, but the impact on native communities is anything but a new experience. Native Americans feared the worst because they\u2019ve been here before many times. European colonizers introduced, sometimes deliberately, an array of new infectious diseases including measles, cholera, typhoid and smallpox, which for many decades historians believed were solely responsible for killing more than 70% of native people who had no immunity to these deadly foreign germs. \u201cMore than any other population in the country, the shared experience of surviving a pandemic is in our blood, it\u2019s not historic, it\u2019s current for American Indians, it\u2019s our reality.

More than 70% of Native Indians and Alaskan Natives live in urban areas, where many use county and state health services where the data black holes exist.

But the actual death toll will probably have hit that figure days before the official tallies reflect it. And despite scientists\u2019 best efforts, that date may for ever go unmarked.</p> <p>Coronavirus was probably spreading through the US before the Trump administration restricted travel from China, before the US had a reliable supply of diagnostic tests, and before the disease caused by the virus was even named. Models of the Covid-19 outbreak estimate that the virus was making its way through America\u2019s major cities, undetected, weeks before a California woman in early February became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/coronavirus-killing-americans-weeks-earlier-than-thought\">first American known to have died</a> of related causes.</p> <p>Researchers are now doing detective work, revisiting autopsies from early this year and studying how the virus has subtly evolved to try to trace when Covid-19 may have first sickened and killed people in the US. Infectious disease experts caution, however, that finding a \u201cpatient zero\u201d, or even figuring out exactly how many Americans were infected and died before testing was available, will be nearly impossible.</p> <h2><strong>The first \u2018first case\u2019</strong></h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/21/coronavirus-us-cdc-case-china-health\">first report</a> of coronavirus in the US came on 21 January, when a man in Washington state who had traveled to Wuhan, China, tested positive. The Seattle area soon became a hotspot, with cases soaring after an outbreak at a nursing home outside the city. On 29 February, Washington state reported what at the time was believed to be the nation\u2019s first death from Covid-19.</p> <p>Coronavirus cases were also identified in California in late January, initially among those who had recently travelled to Wuhan. By late February, California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, said officials were monitoring more than 8,400 patients \u2013 but the state had only 200 testing kits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"707af33893ee48d2448bdf41ceb95e0c0d47a2eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/707af33893ee48d2448bdf41ceb95e0c0d47a2eb/0_0_5310_3576/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers man the Medical Health and Coordination Center at the California Department of Public Health on February 27, 2020 in Sacramento, California.

Initially, only the most severely ill patients were being tested, and those who had recently travelled were prioritized.</p> <p>It was only by looking back that California officials realized that the virus may have been spreading through the state and killing residents earlier than they had thought. Large hospitals and academic medical centers routinely preserve and store tissue samples from autopsies for six months to a year. In April, an analysis of samples from the autopsy of a 57-year-old Santa Clara woman who died suddenly in her home on 6 February revealed that she succumbed to the disease. The woman probably contracted the virus at least a week or two before she died.

      "bodyText": "The US is nearing the bleak milestone of 100,000 confirmed coronavirus deaths. But the actual death toll will probably have hit that figure days before the official tallies reflect it. And despite scientists\u2019 best efforts, that date may for ever go unmarked. Coronavirus was probably spreading through the US before the Trump administration restricted travel from China, before the US had a reliable supply of diagnostic tests, and before the disease caused by the virus was even named. Models of the Covid-19 outbreak estimate that the virus was making its way through America\u2019s major cities, undetected, weeks before a California woman in early February became the first American known to have died of related causes. Researchers are now doing detective work, revisiting autopsies from early this year and studying how the virus has subtly evolved to try to trace when Covid-19 may have first sickened and killed people in the US. Infectious disease experts caution, however, that finding a \u201cpatient zero\u201d, or even figuring out exactly how many Americans were infected and died before testing was available, will be nearly impossible. The first \u2018first case\u2019 The first report of coronavirus in the US came on 21 January, when a man in Washington state who had traveled to Wuhan, China, tested positive. The Seattle area soon became a hotspot, with cases soaring after an outbreak at a nursing home outside the city. On 29 February, Washington state reported what at the time was believed to be the nation\u2019s first death from Covid-19. Coronavirus cases were also identified in California in late January, initially among those who had recently travelled to Wuhan. By late February, California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, said officials were monitoring more than 8,400 patients \u2013 but the state had only 200 testing kits. Tests were difficult to come by across the nation, after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had botched the rollout of diagnostic kits and delayed allowing private and academic labs to develop their own. Initially, only the most severely ill patients were being tested, and those who had recently travelled were prioritized. It was only by looking back that California officials realized that the virus may have been spreading through the state and killing residents earlier than they had thought. Large hospitals and academic medical centers routinely preserve and store tissue samples from autopsies for six months to a year. In April, an analysis of samples from the autopsy of a 57-year-old Santa Clara woman who died suddenly in her home on 6 February revealed that she succumbed to the disease. The woman probably contracted the virus at least a week or two before she died. The fact that she had not travelled outside the country means that coronavirus was spreading within the community by mid-to-late January. Recently, Washington officials have been looking into the cases of two patients with symptoms typical of Covid-19 in late December, after they recently tested positive for antibodies to the virus. These patients could have suffered from a severe flu or other respiratory illness, and contracted the coronavirus later \u2013 but more research and widespread serological tests could help clear up whether some severe cases in late December or January that appeared to be cold or flu were in fact Covid-19. \u201cAbsolutely there\u2019s a chance that there were more infections that resulted in death, at a time when we didn\u2019t know about this novel coronavirus,\u201d said Andrew Badley, chair of the Mayo Clinic\u2019s Covid-19 research task force. \u201cAs we do more testing, I think it would be quite likely that we will find cases that go back several months in North America.\u201d \u2018We\u2019re not going to exhume bodies\u2019 But much about these early cases is \u2013 and will remain \u2013 unclear. Newsom, the California governor, ordered coroners in the state to review autopsies back to December, and the Mayo Clinic is one of many academic medical centers giving cases of pneumonia and flu-like illness a second look. But because only a fraction of deaths at a given medical center are autopsied, and because of the small number of coronavirus infections, even widespread reviews of preserved tissues would not fill in the full picture. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re not going to exhume bodies and test them,\u201d said George Rutherford, an epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco.

The panel will hold a virtual meeting to select the artists, announcing them in late June.

Corporate-friendly politicians like the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, are using the pandemic to brandish their images and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/14/andrew-cuomo-bill-gates-eric-schmidt-coronavirus\">install billionaires to run things</a>. Progressive lawmakers in Congress are being steamrolled, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/497578-pelosi-presses-forward-with-relief-vote-despite-grumbling-from-left\">even by their own party\u2019s leadership</a>. And a recession is battering the state and local budgets that fund progressive priorities like education and the social safety net.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/joe-biden-radicalism-fdr-economic-crisis-coronavirus\">Joe Biden pushed to embrace radicalism of FDR by scale of economic crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps this is a temporary stall-out \u2013 a fleeting moment of retreat in a two-steps-forward-one-step-back trajectory. After all, polls continue to show that from <a href=\"https://onlabor.org/new-poll-americans-see-big-power-imbalance-in-the-workplace/\">workers\u2019 rights</a> to <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/69-percent-americans-want-medicare-all-including-46-percent-republicans-new-poll-says-1500187\">universal healthcare</a>, a majority of Americans support a progressive policy agenda.</p> <p>The problem, though, is that Democrats in Washington are not just passively failing to mount a strong opposition to Donald Trump \u2013 they are actively helping Republicans try to fortify the obstacles to long-term progressive change well after this emergency subsides.</p> <p>This corporate counter-revolution is easiest to see in Democrats\u2019 enthusiastic support for Republicans\u2019 legislative response to the coronavirus crisis. Democrats\u2019 entire 2018 electoral campaign told America that the opposition party needed to win back Congress in order to block Trump\u2019s regressive agenda. And yet, when the Republicans proposed a bill to let Trump\u2019s appointees dole out government cash to their corporate allies with <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/shivaramrajgopal/2020/03/31/the-500-billion-in-corporate-assistance-will-end-up-as-a-corrupt-cash-grab-if-we-dont-ask-the-right-questions/#2969dfb55d4a\">no strings attached</a>, this same opposition party mustered <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/us/politics/coronavirus-house-voting.html\">not a single recorded vote</a> against the package. Not one.</p> <p>Thanks to that, Trump appointees and the Federal Reserve can now hand out <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/business/economy/fed-coronavirus-stimulus.html\">$4tn</a> to politically connected corporations as they lay waste to our economy and steamroll progressive reforms. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-coronavirus-stimulus-offers-taxpayer-cash-to-buyout-firm-companies-11586988495\">Private equity firms</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-15/-stealth-bailout-shovels-millions-of-dollars-to-oil-companies\">fossil fuel companies</a> get new tax breaks as they buy elections and try to lock in permanent climate change.</p> <p>These bailouts were part of a larger legislative package that included good things like expanded unemployment benefits \u2013 and so you could argue that Democrats simply had to swallow a bitter pill and vote yes. Except, they subsequently proposed their own standalone legislation that would further strengthen the corporate opponents of progressive reform.</p> <p>For example, there is the Democrats\u2019 push to alter the so-called paycheck protection program (PPP). Those loans were designed to help employees of mom-and-pop enterprises throughout the country. House Democrats\u2019 new stimulus legislation would open up the small business lending program to what they call \u201csmall nonprofits\u201d, but their language was crafted to provide the forgivable loans to industry trade associations.

As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/us-health-insurance-layoffs-coronavirus\">43 million Americans</a> face the prospect of losing private health insurance, Democrats had a huge opportunity.

Such a system is totally inadequate during a pandemic: it doesn\u2019t guarantee healthcare \u2013 it only only guarantees insurance coverage, which is so often <a href=\"https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/aca-plans-denied-nearly-1-in-5-in-network-claims-in-2017/549312/\">denied</a> or restricted when a medical claim is actually filed. Moreover, corporate health insurance has far <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-costs-administration/more-than-a-third-of-u-s-healthcare-costs-go-to-bureaucracy-idUSKBN1Z5261\">higher administrative costs</a> than single-payer programs like <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20110920.013390/full/\">Medicare</a>, and even the much-vaunted Affordable Care Act allows insurers to siphon up to <a href=\"https://pnhp.org/news/why-medical-loss-ratio-rebates-benefit-the-insurers/\">20%</a> of customers\u2019 premiums to corporate profits rather than actual medical care.</p> <p>But then, Democrats\u2019 Cobra plan is not merely a financial bailout for insurers \u2013 it is also a political bailout when the industry needs it most.

      "bodyText": "These are bleak days for America\u2019s progressive movement. The Democratic primary process handed the party\u2019s nomination to the candidate with the most conservative record. Corporate-friendly politicians like the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, are using the pandemic to brandish their images and install billionaires to run things. Progressive lawmakers in Congress are being steamrolled, even by their own party\u2019s leadership. And a recession is battering the state and local budgets that fund progressive priorities like education and the social safety net. Perhaps this is a temporary stall-out \u2013 a fleeting moment of retreat in a two-steps-forward-one-step-back trajectory. After all, polls continue to show that from workers\u2019 rights to universal healthcare, a majority of Americans support a progressive policy agenda. The problem, though, is that Democrats in Washington are not just passively failing to mount a strong opposition to Donald Trump \u2013 they are actively helping Republicans try to fortify the obstacles to long-term progressive change well after this emergency subsides. This corporate counter-revolution is easiest to see in Democrats\u2019 enthusiastic support for Republicans\u2019 legislative response to the coronavirus crisis. Democrats\u2019 entire 2018 electoral campaign told America that the opposition party needed to win back Congress in order to block Trump\u2019s regressive agenda. And yet, when the Republicans proposed a bill to let Trump\u2019s appointees dole out government cash to their corporate allies with no strings attached, this same opposition party mustered not a single recorded vote against the package. Not one. Thanks to that, Trump appointees and the Federal Reserve can now hand out $4tn to politically connected corporations as they lay waste to our economy and steamroll progressive reforms. Private equity firms and fossil fuel companies get new tax breaks as they buy elections and try to lock in permanent climate change. These bailouts were part of a larger legislative package that included good things like expanded unemployment benefits \u2013 and so you could argue that Democrats simply had to swallow a bitter pill and vote yes. Except, they subsequently proposed their own standalone legislation that would further strengthen the corporate opponents of progressive reform. For example, there is the Democrats\u2019 push to alter the so-called paycheck protection program (PPP). Those loans were designed to help employees of mom-and-pop enterprises throughout the country. House Democrats\u2019 new stimulus legislation would open up the small business lending program to what they call \u201csmall nonprofits\u201d, but their language was crafted to provide the forgivable loans to industry trade associations. Those lobby groups represent the planet\u2019s biggest corporations \u2013 and their political action committees have delivered more than $191m of campaign cash to lawmakers in the last two decades. Democrats have pitched their legislation as a \u201cmessage\u201d bill that declares their values \u2013 and in this case, they are reassuring Washington power-players that money meant for workers at neighborhood restaurants, local shops and other mom-and-pop concerns can be raided by the front groups representing giant drug companies, health insurers and Wall Street firms. If the legislation passes, it would not merely be an epic tale of greed \u2013 the new funding stream for corporate lobbying groups would bolster the very forces that make sure federal policy disempowers workers, maximizes private profit and generally protects the ruling class. It\u2019s an even worse story on healthcare. As 43 million Americans face the prospect of losing private health insurance, Democrats had a huge opportunity. After Trump himself suggested he wanted the government to pay healthcare providers directly for treating uninsured Covid-19 patients, they could have called his bluff and passed existing legislation to expand a Medicare program that provides actual medical care.

Taken together, these initiatives would route yet more public money through a corporate insurance bureaucracy in hopes that medical care eventually trickles down to Americans who desperately need it. Such a system is totally inadequate during a pandemic: it doesn\u2019t guarantee healthcare \u2013 it only only guarantees insurance coverage, which is so often denied or restricted when a medical claim is actually filed. Moreover, corporate health insurance has far higher administrative costs than single-payer programs like Medicare, and even the much-vaunted Affordable Care Act allows insurers to siphon up to 20% of customers\u2019 premiums to corporate profits rather than actual medical care. But then, Democrats\u2019 Cobra plan is not merely a financial bailout for insurers \u2013 it is also a political bailout when the industry needs it most. At a time when popular support for Medicare for All is surging \u2013 when even a Republican president feels the need to make rhetorical (if empty) gestures toward the concept of government-funded healthcare \u2013 the Cobra plan would use public money to firm up the private health insurance industry\u2019s dominance over the healthcare system, just in time to short circuit a Medicare expansion.

      "body": "<p>Stephin Merritt has just spent six weeks confined to his Manhattan apartment after contracting coronavirus. He was ill for 10 days, then recovered. He\u2019s usually a crazily prolific songwriter \u2013 two of his band\u2019s most celebrated albums, <a href=\"https://choice.npr.org/index.html?origin=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2017/03/06/518765367/a-life-in-music-the-magnetic-fields-50-song-memoir\">50 Song Memoir</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/aug/25/69-love-songs-magnetic-fields\">69 Love Songs</a>, obviously contain 119 songs between them \u2013 but he hasn\u2019t come up with any new numbers since he got ill. The problem is that he can only write songs in bars. And not just any bar \u2013 it needs to be \u201cone-third full of cranky old gay men gossiping over thumping disco music\u201d. Plus he needs a glass of cognac, to be slowly sipped, and a corner with a light so he can see his notebook.</p> <p>Fortunately, before the outbreak, he was able to find a place that fulfilled these conditions and the result is the Magnetic Fields\u2019 latest album. Like most of Merritt\u2019s records, there\u2019s a concept \u2013 on this one, titled <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/the-magnetic-fields-announce-new-album-quickies-share-video-for-new-song-watch/\">Quickies</a>, all the songs but one are two minutes 15 seconds or less. However, that\u2019s not an unusual length for a Magnetic Fields tune \u2013 as Merritt points out over the phone, one-third of the songs on 69 Love Songs would qualify.</p> <p>Is it ingrained in him that this is the perfect length for a pop song? \u201cIt\u2019s ingrained in everyone in Gen X or earlier,\u201d he says. \u201cIt used to be that seven-inch singles were 2 mins 50 in length maximum \u2013 this is before Bohemian Rhapsody and such epics were considered singles.\u201d It\u2019s much more rare for him to write a song that lasts around five minutes. \u201cThat\u2019s long to me, yes, both in my tastes and musical output. I like bubblegum and experimental music so I\u2019m comfortable with two minutes and I\u2019m comfortable with six hours.\u201d</p> <p>This is a relatively loquacious answer for Merritt, whose laconic baritone has had many interviewers tearing their hair out. When I mention his long-standing interest in brevity \u2013 he co-wrote a book,<a href=\"http://www.houseoftomorrow.com/blog/2015/2/16/101-two-letter-words\"> 101 Two-Letter Words</a>, with the New Yorker cartoonist <a href=\"https://rozchast.com/\">Roz Chast</a>, inspired by the shortest words you can use in Scrabble \u2013 his entire answer is: \u201cHm.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8ddc32777e0bf956006724980e873077cf91790\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8ddc32777e0bf956006724980e873077cf91790/0_0_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Merritt performing with the Magnetic Fields in Barcelona, 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Merritt performing with the Magnetic Fields in Barcelona, 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordi Vidal/Redferns via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He\u2019s hilarious, if you don\u2019t mind protracted awkward silences \u2013 a man of passionately held, if quietly expressed, views.

His previous album, 50 Song Memoir, had a lyric about each year in his life (he\u2019s now 55) and detailed everything from his eccentric mother \u2013 who gave away all her money and joined new-age cults around the US, dragging her son with her \u2013 to the many odd illnesses he has been plagued with. The most debilitating is hyperacusis, an acute sensitivity to certain sounds, which would make it impossible for Merritt to play with an amplified rock band \u2013 Magnetic Fields gigs are much quieter affairs.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dfkW9OLlFM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-dfkW9OLlFM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Merritt believes he all but destroyed his hearing watching the industrial band <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/18/blixa-bargeld-interview-einsturzende-neubauten\">Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten</a> play a gig in New York in the early 80s.

      "bodyText": "Stephin Merritt has just spent six weeks confined to his Manhattan apartment after contracting coronavirus. He was ill for 10 days, then recovered. He\u2019s usually a crazily prolific songwriter \u2013 two of his band\u2019s most celebrated albums, 50 Song Memoir and 69 Love Songs, obviously contain 119 songs between them \u2013 but he hasn\u2019t come up with any new numbers since he got ill. The problem is that he can only write songs in bars. And not just any bar \u2013 it needs to be \u201cone-third full of cranky old gay men gossiping over thumping disco music\u201d. Plus he needs a glass of cognac, to be slowly sipped, and a corner with a light so he can see his notebook. Fortunately, before the outbreak, he was able to find a place that fulfilled these conditions and the result is the Magnetic Fields\u2019 latest album. Like most of Merritt\u2019s records, there\u2019s a concept \u2013 on this one, titled Quickies, all the songs but one are two minutes 15 seconds or less. However, that\u2019s not an unusual length for a Magnetic Fields tune \u2013 as Merritt points out over the phone, one-third of the songs on 69 Love Songs would qualify. Is it ingrained in him that this is the perfect length for a pop song? \u201cIt\u2019s ingrained in everyone in Gen X or earlier,\u201d he says. \u201cIt used to be that seven-inch singles were 2 mins 50 in length maximum \u2013 this is before Bohemian Rhapsody and such epics were considered singles.\u201d It\u2019s much more rare for him to write a song that lasts around five minutes. \u201cThat\u2019s long to me, yes, both in my tastes and musical output. I like bubblegum and experimental music so I\u2019m comfortable with two minutes and I\u2019m comfortable with six hours.\u201d This is a relatively loquacious answer for Merritt, whose laconic baritone has had many interviewers tearing their hair out. When I mention his long-standing interest in brevity \u2013 he co-wrote a book, 101 Two-Letter Words, with the New Yorker cartoonist Roz Chast, inspired by the shortest words you can use in Scrabble \u2013 his entire answer is: \u201cHm.\u201d He\u2019s hilarious, if you don\u2019t mind protracted awkward silences \u2013 a man of passionately held, if quietly expressed, views. Don\u2019t get him started on bonus tracks. \u201cI\u2019ve always hated bonus tracks. The whole idea bugs me. Either it\u2019s an album or it\u2019s not an album. It gets my Asperger\u2019s up to even think about it.\u201d Does he really have Asperger\u2019s? \u201cI don\u2019t know, I refuse to ask for a diagnosis, but my various friends with Asperger\u2019s swear I do, yes.\u201d As well as brevity, it\u2019s Merritt\u2019s way with a lyric that makes the songs on Quickies extraordinary. It\u2019s hard to imagine anyone else writing tracks called You\u2019ve Got a Friend in Beelzebub, I Wish I Were a Prostitute Again and The Biggest Tits in History.

reports of family members of aged-care residents \u201cwho for ideological reasons don\u2019t accept the science behind vaccinations\u201d that have been subsequently barred from visiting their

\u201cvery confident\u201d that a \u201cbad influenza season\u201d would cause \u201cfar greater\u201d deaths in aged-care facilities than what has so far been seen from Covid-19, pointing to the 2017 flu as an example of a more deadly outbreak at multiple Australian residential facilities.</p> \n<p>The committee heard that the median age of Covid-19 fatalities in Australia is 80 years old, and that 29% of deaths in Australia have occurred at residential aged-care facilities.</p> \n<p>The aged care quality and safety commissioner, Janet Anderson, reported a spike in complaints to the regulator from families of residents in aged-care facilities, from 371 nationally in March to 760 in April, however she noted these did not reflect the national code for visitation that was released in May that restored visitation at many facilities that had halted it.</p> \n<p>The revelation about operator Anglicare\u2019s surge staffing decision was one of several outbreak response issues identified by senior Department of Health officials and Anderson, who described the effort to contain the virus spread at the Newmarch facility \u2013 Australia\u2019s second biggest cluster to date \u2013 as \u201cnot a compellingly good example\u201d of management.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email

      "bodyText": "The operators of the Newmarch House aged-care home, where 19 residents have died from Covid-19, waited six days before allowing a federal government-funded surge workforce of private medical clinicians to enter its facility, a Senate inquiry focusing on aged care during the pandemic has heard. Senior health bureaucrats also told the Senate committee there have been reports of family members of aged-care residents \u201cwho for ideological reasons don\u2019t accept the science behind vaccinations\u201d that have been subsequently barred from visiting their relatives in facilities because of a recent requirement under the aged care visitation code that all visitors must have this year\u2019s flu shot before entry. \u201cThose people have been in recent times complaining about the measures, and certainly aged-care providers \u2026 are reporting some resistance from some individuals who don\u2019t accept a vaccination, proof of vaccination, is required for entry to visit their loved ones,\u201d said Michael Lye, deputy secretary of the aged care division of the Department of Health. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, told Tuesday\u2019s Senate select committee on Covid-19 that he was \u201cvery confident\u201d that a \u201cbad influenza season\u201d would cause \u201cfar greater\u201d deaths in aged-care facilities than what has so far been seen from Covid-19, pointing to the 2017 flu as an example of a more deadly outbreak at multiple Australian residential facilities. The committee heard that the median age of Covid-19 fatalities in Australia is 80 years old, and that 29% of deaths in Australia have occurred at residential aged-care facilities. The aged care quality and safety commissioner, Janet Anderson, reported a spike in complaints to the regulator from families of residents in aged-care facilities, from 371 nationally in March to 760 in April, however she noted these did not reflect the national code for visitation that was released in May that restored visitation at many facilities that had halted it. The revelation about operator Anglicare\u2019s surge staffing decision was one of several outbreak response issues identified by senior Department of Health officials and Anderson, who described the effort to contain the virus spread at the Newmarch facility \u2013 Australia\u2019s second biggest cluster to date \u2013 as \u201cnot a compellingly good example\u201d of management. \u201c(We) concluded that they needed significant help in their management of that outbreak,\u201d said Anderson, the chief of the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, the sector\u2019s regulator that intervened in the situation at Newmarch earlier in May, with action that included ordering an independent adviser to be appointed, and halting all new admissions to the facility. \u201cWe weren\u2019t getting the responsiveness that we expected from an aged-care service managing an outbreak,\u201d Anderson said. Amy Laffan, the acting first assistant secretary in the Department of Health\u2019s aged care reform and compliance division, responded to a question from the Liberal senator James Paterson, confirming the date that Aspen Medical surge staff were deployed to Newmarch House after a delay of several days. \u201cSo Aspen was first offered to Newmarch House on the 14th of April, and ... were first deployed on the 20th of April,\u201d she said. Anglicare would later allege a Newmarch clinician breached personal protective equipment (PPE) protocol while working in the Covid-19 positive section of the facility. Lye also responded to a question from the Labor senator Kristina Keneally about the Anglicare chief executive, Grant Millard, who claimed that requests for PPE from the national stockpile were not met. \u201cWe had some degree of difficulty with the organisation in terms of responding to requests to identify their needs in terms of PPE,\u201d Lye said. \u201cSo we had an issue ... in terms of the organisation\u2019s ability to both ask for and receive PPE and that could account for the CEO\u2019s concern that they didn\u2019t have it. I think the Department (of Health) would say that the organisation may not have been sure about what they did actually have. \u201cOn several occasions throughout the timeline of the Newmarch outbreak, it\u2019s two or three days before what is required is specified by the organisation,\u201d Lye said. Asked about the lessons the Department of Health and the aged care regulator had learned from the Newmarch outbreak, Anderson said she now personally phones the manager of any aged-care facility within 36 hours of a case being identified. The committee also heard that authorities are now more \u201cenergetic\u201d and \u201cassertive\u201d in conveying to facility managers how difficult it is to control an outbreak, and the impact it will have on staffing. The first case at Newmarch House was a part-time carer who worked six shifts before being diagnosed with the virus on 11 April, the day before the first resident returned a positive result. Six days later, 25 residents were infected, and 14 staff had tested positive. Last week, the facility\u2019s 19th resident died of Covid-19, with a further two deaths also reported of residents who had contracted, but later recovered from Covid-19 before their deaths. There have now been 71 cases reported from Newmarch House, from 34 staff and 37 residents.",

At all stages we were assured that the association had the support of the large majority of vice chancellors for a fair industry-wide solution to the current crisis. </p> \n   <p>It\u2019s now clear the AHEIA was either not representing a broad coalition of vice chancellors, or negotiated an agreement that gives employees more rights and protections than some vice chancellors were willing to tolerate. It is up to AHEIA to explain why at least 17 of its members have abandoned the solution it negotiated on behalf of the universities.</p> \n   <p>The worst crisis in the history of Australian universities demanded a collective solution to save careers and livelihoods. Too many vice chancellors are now baulking at the strong oversight provisions in the jobs framework that guarantee transparency and ensure that any contribution our members make will be dedicated to saving jobs. </p> \n   <p>Vice chancellors appear to have abandoned their industrial association, and demonstrated they are allergic to scrutiny. They are showing reckless disregard for their workforce.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T08:38:13.794Z\">at 9.38am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eccbe958f08a1782fa81828\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T07:32:18.009Z\">8.32am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>With that, I\u2019ll be handing over to <strong>Michael McGowan</strong>, who will be blogging for the rest of the day.

We sat on rickety old shares, there was a scuffed-up table. </p> \n   <p>The office looked like it had been saved from demolition. I noted the surroundings.

Our safety, our security, our social safety net of which we\u2019re so proud. </p> \n   <p>To strengthen and agree our economy, the boats we need to go faster are the hundreds of thousands of small and medium and large businesses that make up our economy and create the value upon which everything else depends. Value created by establishing successful products and services, the ability to be able to sell them at a competitive and profitable price, and into growing and sustainable markets. Economics 101.

<em>Corporations Act 2001</em> (the Act) so that companies and officers\u2019 will only be liable if there has been \u201cknowledge, recklessness or negligence\u201d with respect to updates on price

crisis.</p> \n   <p>The heightened level of uncertainty around companies\u2019 future prospects as a result of the crisis also exposes companies to the threat of opportunistic class actions for allegedly falling foul of their continuous disclosure obligations if their forecasts are found to be inaccurate.</p> \n   <p><strong>In response, companies may hold back from making forecasts of future earnings or other forward-looking estimates, limiting the amount of information available to investors during this period.</strong></p> \n   <p>The changes announced today will make it harder to bring such actions against companies and officers\u2019 during the coronavirus crisis and while allowing the market to continue to stay informed and function effectively. </p> \n   <p>The changes

Here\u2019s what we learned today: Prime minister Scott Morrison confirmed the government\u2019s union-busting \u201censuring integrity\u201d bill is dead \u2013 for now. Instead, Christian Porter will lead the \u201cAccords 2.0\u201d bringing together unions, employers and business groups to discuss what changes could be made to industrial relations laws. Morrison also announced vocational education will be reformed to meet skills demand, as well as simplified across the nation. The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, announced what he called \u201ca fast evolving\u201d Covid-19 situation in the state after six crew members on a live export ship in Fremantle tested positive for coronavirus. They are currently in a Perth hotel for quarantine. A passenger of the Ruby Princess who tested positive to coronavirus on Monday is suspected to have carried the \u201cdormant\u201d virus for almost 10 weeks before falling ill. Two Sydney schools had to be closed after students tested positive for Covid-19. It came only a day after schools across New South Wales resumed full-time face-to-face classes. The Nation Tertiary Education Union abandoned its National Jobs Protection Framework after a revolt from its members. The NTEU issued a blistering statement attacking vice chancellors and the Australian Higher Education Industry Association for failing to follow through with the deal and vowed to escalate industrial action. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, officially turned down appearing in front of the Covid-19 Senate select committee. The ABC revealed the American embassy has held private meetings with Canberra to clarify a US State Department document that was used by a Sydney newspaper to link the Covid-19 pandemic to a Chinese government laboratory despite a lack of direct evidence. The first human trials of a vaccine for Covid-19 began in the southern hemisphere, at Melbourne\u2019s Alfred hospital. The former prime minister, Kevin Rudd, who is no friend of Rupert Murdoch-owned media outlets, has come out swinging after the ABC reported earlier today that a Daily Telegraph report about \u201ca dossier prepared by concerned western governments\u201d about the origins of Covid-19 was actually a \u201cnon-paper\u201d with no new information in it. Rudd told my colleague Daniel Hurst: \u201cThese revelations should be utterly humiliating to the Murdoch media, except that the Murdoch media has zero shame.\u201d He believes the document \u201cwas leaked to News Corp in Australia with the clear intention that it would be funnelled back into the American media, giving the appearance that Australian spies were backing Trump\u2019s claims\u201d. In reality, though, \u201cAustralian intelligence officials don\u2019t believe Trump at all\u201d. Read the full story here: The fallout from that extraordinary NTEU statement is coming thick and fast. Alma Torlakovic, an NTEU branch committee member and national councillor at Sydney University has called it a win for members who had fought back against the union\u2019s plan. This is a major victory for the organising efforts of hundreds of rank and file NTEU members who have resisted the national leadership\u2019s capitulation to vice chancellors. That effort has also prepared the way for a more vigorous campaigns against the attacks that university managements are already mounting against our pay, conditions and job security\u201d. Quite a story from my friends at the Newcastle Herald, who have just reported that face masks have begun washing up on beaches on the Central Coast. The masks were apparently inside some of the 40 shipping containers which fell from a cargo ship on Sunday. \u201cWe have received a report of some medical supplies washing up between Magenta and The Entrance,\u201d the Australian Maritime Safety Authority\u2019s general manager of operations, Allan Schwartz, told the Herald on Tuesday. The federal government has announced cultural institutions such as the National Gallery and National Library will reopen on 30 May under special arrangements, AAP reports. National galleries and museums are set to reopen to the public on 30 May following their shutdown over the coronavirus pandemic. Around 4.5 million people visit the National Gallery of Australia, National Museum of Australia, National Portrait Gallery, National Library of Australia, National Film and Sound Archives and the Australian National Maritime Museum each year. It is hoped the states will also follow suit in reopening museums, galleries and libraries. Special arrangements will be in place including timed entry and one-way flow through gallery spaces, and visitors may be asked to provide their contact information to allow public health tracing. There will also be increased signage throughout buildings and more frequent cleaning of \u201ctouch\u201d areas. The National Tertiary Education Union has just issued an extraordinary statement in which it has announced it is abandoning the hugely controversial National Jobs Protection Framework that had prompted a revolt among its members. The NTEU has faced a sustained and vocal backlash from its members for the plan, which aims to protect more than 12,000 jobs in return for up to one-year salary reductions between 5% and 15%. The deal had prompted a revolt from a splinter group from within the union, NTEU Fightback, which accused the union of caving to vice chancellors without putting pressure on the federal government for funding. It has also since been abandoned by a number of universities. In a statement issued just now, the NTEU has blasted vice chancellors and the Australian Higher Education Industry Association, with which it negotiated the deal, and vowed to escalate to \u201chistorically high levels of industrial disputation and campaigning to fight for every job\u201d. Here\u2019s part of the statement: The NTEU approached negotiations with the Australian Higher Education Industry Association (AHEIA) in good faith. At all stages we were assured that the association had the support of the large majority of vice chancellors for a fair industry-wide solution to the current crisis. It\u2019s now clear the AHEIA was either not representing a broad coalition of vice chancellors, or negotiated an agreement that gives employees more rights and protections than some vice chancellors were willing to tolerate. It is up to AHEIA to explain why at least 17 of its members have abandoned the solution it negotiated on behalf of the universities. The worst crisis in the history of Australian universities demanded a collective solution to save careers and livelihoods. Too many vice chancellors are now baulking at the strong oversight provisions in the jobs framework that guarantee transparency and ensure that any contribution our members make will be dedicated to saving jobs. Vice chancellors appear to have abandoned their industrial association, and demonstrated they are allergic to scrutiny. They are showing reckless disregard for their workforce. With that, I\u2019ll be handing over to Michael McGowan, who will be blogging for the rest of the day. Thanks for following along, and stay safe. The University of New South Wales will reportedly close its childcare centres at the end of this year, saying they were operating at a loss even before the impact of Covid-19. The university wrote to parents that it was \u201cno longer sustainable\u201d to run the childcare centres. Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy has faced several questions about the coronavirus outbreak on a Western Australian livestock vessel during a Senate select committee inquiry into Covid-19 on Tuesday. Murphy said he only learned about the outbreak during a meeting of the Australian health protection principal committee meeting on Tuesday afternoon, and that he rushed from the meeting to the inquiry so had not had time to find out more information. However, he acknowledged that the Australian Border Force, and ultimately the commonwealth, was responsible for cases to come into Australia from ships. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to comment on the circumstances of the Western Australian ship. I don\u2019t know what that ship told agriculture, what they told border force ... I really can\u2019t comment without knowing the details. We [the commonwealth] have absolute responsibility, but we do not have public health officers on the ground and we delegate under a usually extremely effective partnership with the state and territory public health officers, whom I appointed as chief human biosecurity officers, so it is a partnership. I absolutely accept we need to look into what\u2019s happened with this livestock vessel. And from earlier, my colleague Christopher Knaus has this extraordinary story of a whistleblower who was told to contact the prime minister using the generic online form. Labor\u2019s Tony Burke, the shadow minister for industrial relations, says he has \u201can open mind\u201d about changes to industrial relations laws. Burke has welcomed the government\u2019s offer to discuss with unions what Scott Morrison today termed the \u201cAccords 2.0\u201d. But he has stressed that the government has not laid out any plans and \u201call it has done so far is book a room\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a series of meetings,\u201d he said in a statement. He also said that some demands, aired by business groups, would not be something Labor would agree to. The demands business groups have been making in recent days \u2013 including a return to WorkChoices-style individual contracts and the scrapping of awards \u2013 suggest it will be extremely difficult to forge an IR consensus. Those sorts of changes would be a disaster for workers and for the economy. For years Labor has been urging the government to bring workers and unions to the industrial relations negotiating table in a bid to deliver those sorts of reforms. It\u2019s a shame it took a global crisis for them to finally realise that workers\u2019 voices are worth listening to. Pauline Hanson\u2019s Facebook page is seeking to raise $1m for a legal challenge, saying closed borders are causing economic and social damage. The One Nation leader is launching what she has called the \u201cQueensland Border Battle\u201d to take the state\u2019s border closures to the high court. One Nation says it is trying to \u201cstop the damage being caused by unnecessary state border lockdown laws\u201d. Hanson\u2019s page says the party has the assistance of a pro bono lawyer, but \u201cdue to the urgency of this matter\u201d now needs funds to continue the challenge. The South Australian chief health officer, Prof Nicola Spurrier, has reported that there is a new case of coronavirus in the state, from a woman in her 50s who had come into the state from Victoria. \u201cI know this might come as quite a surprise to many people because we have had so many days now with no cases,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it is a very timely reminder to everybody in the state that Covid-19 is here, it is in Australia, and we have to continue to be vigilant.\u201d Spurrier said that the woman had recently returned from overseas, and was in quarantine in Victoria. She was then given an exemption for family and compassionate reasons to come into South Australia, to continue her quarantine. Spurrier says it was a \u201cvery, very compelling reason\u201d. She also adds that the woman has \u201cvery mild symptoms\u201d. People on the plane near her will be contacted for contact tracing. Jennifer Westacott, the chief executive of the Business Council of Australia, is speaking in favour of the government\u2019s idea for \u201cAccord 2.0\u201d and changes to industrial relations laws. Westacott says that current workplace laws and conditions are \u201ctoo complicated\u201d. \u201cIt is too hard to get enterprise agreements done,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are too many things in them ... we have multiple clauses.\u201d She says that the Hawke-Keating reforms, the original Accord, led to higher wages. \u201cWe know from history that that system created higher wages and if we could get back to that system then I believe Australians will have more secure jobs, better workplaces and higher wages.\u201d The WA premier, Mark McGowan, says the federal Department of Agriculture knew crew members on board had \u201celevated temperatures\u201d, but they did not tell the Fremantle Port Authority. He says he \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to point fingers at this time\u201d, but that he is \u201cconcerned and, to a degree, disappointed\u201d. \u201cThe advice I have at this point in time is the Department of Agriculture was informed there were people with elevated temperatures but they didn\u2019t tell the Fremantle Port Authority.\u201d He denies this is a Ruby Princess-like scenario because \u201cpeople didn\u2019t get off the ship\u201d. He says he is working on making the ship leave as soon as possible. There are two Australians among the 48 crew, according to the WA police commissioner, Chris Dawson. \u201cI spoke with the chief health officer only a few minutes ago,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ll make an assessment of how many crew need to come off that vessel.\u201d He adds that the harbourmaster \u201c100% confirmed\u201d to him that no crew members have come ashore before today, when the six positive crew were taken into quarantine. The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, has just announced what he called \u201ca fast evolving\u201d Covid-19 situation in the state. Six crew members on a live export ship in Fremantle have tested positive for coronavirus, and are currently in a Perth hotel for quarantine. \u201cThere is currently a situation evolving as we speak at Fremantle port,\u201d he said. \u201cJust this morning I was informed about the situation currently confronting our state.\u201d The ship, Al Kuwait, left the United Arab Emirates on 7 May and docked in Fremantle on Friday. \u201cThis morning, seven crew members were tested for Covid-19,\u201d McGowan said. \u201cSix have tested positive, all males, and are being moved off the ship to a Perth hotel for quarantine purposes. \u201cFor the time being, the remaining 42 crew members, who I am advised are currently well, will remain on board the ship and will be monitored and undergo health assessments as required.\u201d Thanks to Amy Remeikis, as always, for her incredible work carrying the blog today. The ACTU has responded to the government\u2019s announcement of an \u201cAccords 2.0\u201d process of changing industrial relations laws, saying it \u201cwelcomes the opportunity to sit down with the government and employers\u201d to discuss the changes. The ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, said the unions would measure any changes \u201con the benchmarks of: will they give working people better job security and will they lead to working people receiving their fair share of the country\u2019s wealth? \u201cWorking people need to be at the centre of rebuilding our economy. That means getting us through this pandemic, better quality jobs with security and ensuring working people fairly share in the wealth of our country. She added that the priority for unions was still to stop a \u201csecond wave of infections ... otherwise the pain and sacrifices working people have made, with 20% of working people now unemployed or underemployed and so many losing income, will be for nothing\u201d. I am going to hand you over to the wonderful Naaman Zhou for the next part of the day. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Take care of you. The operators of the Newmarch House aged care home, where 19 residents have died from Covid-19, did not initially accept a federal government-funded surge workforce, waiting six days before allowing the private medical clinicians to enter the facility. The revelation about operator Anglicare\u2019s decision was heard during the Senate select committee\u2019s inquiry into Covid-19, which is focussing on the aged care sector on Tuesday. Amy Laffan, the acting first assistant secretary in the Department of Health\u2019s Aged Care reform and compliance division, responded to a question from Liberal senator James Paterson, confirming the date that Aspen Medical surge staff were deployed to the home after a delay of several days. So Aspen was first offered to Newmarch House on the 14th of April, and ... were first deployed on the 20th of April. During Tuesday\u2019s proceedings, the committee also heard from aged care quality and safety commissioner Janet Anderson that Anglicare\u2019s management of the Newmarch outbreak \u201cwas not a compellingly good example\u201d. [We] concluded that they needed significant help in their management of that outbreak. Earlier this month, the ACQSC \u2013 the sector\u2019s regulator \u2013 intervened in the situation at Newmarch, which included ordering an independent adviser to be appointed, and to not admit any new residents. The committee also heard that the median age of Covid-19 fatalities in Australia was 80 years old, and that 29% of deaths in Australia have occurred at residential aged care facilities. Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy will also appear before the inquiry on Tuesday. Andrew Barr says that from Saturday, \u201cour galleries, museums, national institutions and outdoor attractions, such as the zoo, will be able to reopen from this weekend for groups of up to 20 people in a designated session\u201d. Andrew Barr continues: Beauty therapy businesses, including nail salons, tanning and waxing services, day spas, including massage parlours and tattoo businesses, can reopen from this weekend. These businesses must complete a plan, observe strict hand hygiene requirements and ensure physical distancing as much as possible. Again, these businesses cannot exceed one person per 4 sq m, including staff. These businesses should also keep a record of their customers to support faster contact tracing. In the fitness industry, indoor gyms and fitness centres can begin a gradual reintroduction of their businesses. Small, supervised group sessions and classes indoors can recommence with a maximum of 20 people to any enclosed space or, again, one person per 4 sq m. These businesses must also complete a Covid-safe plan, observe hand hygiene requirements and shore physical distancing as much as possible. In community sport, the maximum capacity for organised social sport will be increased to 20 participants. Indoor sport can commence under a one person per 4 sq m rule. Sporting organisations are to ensure low levels of physical contact and to limit sharing of equipment. Hand washing before and after sessions is strongly advised. Shared facilities, other than toilets, will not be open. Andrew Barr is explaining the new restrictions a little more clearly. You can have up to 150 patrons in some larger venues \u2013 meaning, in the ACT, pubs are back. So, starting on Saturday, hospitality-sector venues will be able to implement a scalable framework for the sector to align maximum occupancy with the size of a venue. So, cafes, bars, restaurants and clubs will be able to cater for up to 20 people in each enclosed space. Venues cannot exceed one person per 4 sq m, including staff. And this is for both indoor and outdoor spaces. So if a venue has multiple enclosed spaces, they can have multiple groups of 20 patrons. Provided that enclosed space allows for 20 patrons, and that is it would need to be 80 sq m. If it was 60 sq m, 15 patrons would be allowed. If it was 40 sq m, 10 patrons; 20 sq m, five. This framework allows larger venues with clearly separated enclosed spaces to cater for more. There are some large venues in the ACT with multiple enclosed and outdoor spaces which may be able to accommodate up to 150 patrons or more under these arrangements. Sally McManus is responding to the prime minister\u2019s speech, saying that previously \u201cunion bashing\u201d had become too entrenched and she was glad to see it looked like changing. But she doesn\u2019t believe that IR changes alone will be enough to kick-start the economy Andrew Barr, the ACT chief minister, says eateries can have up to 20 patrons from Saturday. Beauticians will also be able to reopen. Melissa Davey has this update on hydroxychloroquine: On Victoria signing up to the belt and road initiative, federal deputy Labor leader Richard Marles says: Ultimately, I\u2019ll let Victoria speak for themselves, but let me make this clear: a future Labor government would not be signing a Belt and Road agreement with China. When it comes to Chinese investment in infrastructure projects, that\u2019s a matter which we think should be taken on a case-by-case basis, and we should proceed down that path with some caution. For example, we would not have sold the port of Darwin to a Chinese state-owned company, which is what this government has done. Our position has been: Victoria can speak for themselves but, from the point of view of federal Labor, our position has been very clear from the outset. We would not be signing a Belt and Road agreement. We would be taking Chinese investment in infrastructure projects on a case-by-case basis, and doing so with caution. Richard Marles finishes with (after repeating his line from this morning that the economy \u201cbarely had a heartbeat\u201d entering the Covid crisis): Today\u2019s speech was such a lost opportunity. You know, we heard lots of slogans and lots of marketing. Jobseeker, jobkeeper, jobmaker \u2013 really hope that it doesn\u2019t end up being a jobblunder. But at the end of the day, this is the most significant moment of reconstructing, of reimagining the Australian economy, that we have seen since the end of the second world war. And all we got today was tired old leftovers from this prime minister and this government. On the IR changes, Richard Marles says: And the government is talking about the importance of industrial relations. We welcome the shelving of the Ensuring Integrity Bill. Sure, it\u2019s a good thing to get people round the table. But I can tell you there\u2019s a lot more to industrial relations than simply booking the room. And the idea that a Liberal government is about to engage in industrial relations reform will send a chill down the spine of every Australian worker. We do need to be bringing Australians together at this moment, but this is a government, and a prime minister, that has been more responsible for pulling Australians apart than any other. Deputy Labor leader Richard Marles is responding to the prime minister\u2019s speech, which he said was an example of a \u201ctired government which has found nothing but old solutions\u201d: The government talks about the importance of resilient manufacturing, and yet this is the government which goaded the car industry offshore and which has presided over a massive reduction in manufacturing. The government talked about the importance of getting energy policy right, and yet this is a government which is on its 19th energy policy. The prime minister spoke about the importance of universities, but it\u2019s his government which has been strangling university funding. The prime minister talked about the importance of science and research, but it\u2019s his government which has cut money to CSIRO hand over fist and, at times, has been absolutely anti-science. And this government is now talking about seeing a salvation in skills and training. Skills and training are really important, but it is Scott Morrison\u2019s government which has cut $3bn from skills and training since it came to office, such that we have 140,000 fewer apprenticeships and traineeships. If it wants to see the future built through skills and training, we\u2019re unlikely to see it from a government which has allowed the VET sector to bleed out. NRL \u2013 it just keeps delivering In the context of the sport restarting at the end of this week... As a palette cleanser \u2013 can you help with this? The attorney general, Christian Porter, has left the door open to the commonwealth intervening to support Clive Palmer\u2019s bid to have the Western Australian border ban ruled unconstitutional. Porter told Guardian Australia: I will consider the strength of Mr Palmer\u2019s matter and the commonwealth\u2019s position on it when more details about its circumstances are provided through the normal processes. What did we learn from Scott Morrison\u2019s speech? Not a huge amount of new information \u2013 more a trail of breadcrumbs to where the government plans are going. The union-busting \u201censuring integrity\u201d is dead \u2013 for now. Which we expected and knew, but now is set in stone. Christian Porter will lead the \u201cAccords 2.0\u201d bringing together unions, employers and business groups to discuss what changes could be made to industrial relations laws. Some have already made a point of saying Labor isn\u2019t invited to this roundtable, but that ignores that the union movement is part of the Labor movement, and often carries out its grassroot policy drives. Vocational education is to be reformed to meet skills demand, and hopefully simplified across the nation. The stimulus payments will come to an end (which we knew). Coag \u2013 currently acting as the national cabinet \u2013 will look at reforming national partnerships, which is something quite a lot of premiers have been asking for for quite some time. The health partnerships, for example, make it difficult for the states to forward plan, given they all have time limits and usually get changed when a new government comes in. Trade will continue. Scott Morrison acknowledged the economic Covid crisis is hitting younger generations \u201cmuch harder\u201d. But Boomers will not be asked to give up franking credits, because they are hurting too. Scott Morrison is not going to take a pay cut, and instead will keep doing \u201ca good job\u201d. They just beat me to this joke. Should older generations, who have benefited from government policies such as franking credits, be prepared to sacrifice a bit more, given that it is the younger generations who will have to pay for it, for decades to come? (Millennials, in particular have been doubly screwed during their working lives \u2013 first with the GFC and now the Covid crisis, occurring during what would be the highest-earning years for many.) Scott Morrison: The answer to coming out of this crisis is not setting one group of Australians against another. All Australians are in this together. I remind you of that fellow Andrew [one of the letters he received] who was married to his wife for 50 years and couldn\u2019t give her the send-off that she wanted. I had another letter, one I didn\u2019t read out, from a daughter. She would have been in her \u2013 probably 60s. And she didn\u2019t get to see her mum in the aged care facility before she died. To suggest that any one group is not feeling the impacts of this one way or the other and to set it up as some sort of generation conflict, I think, is very unconstructive. It\u2019s not the approach my government. We\u2019ve all got to do what we\u2019ve got to do. I agree, it is hitting young people much harder. That\u2019s why we have invested in additional services on mental health. The biggest beneficiary of the process I\u2019ve outlined today, if employers and employees can come together and get this sorted, will be young people. They will be the biggest beneficiaries. The jobs that we will create will go first and most rapidly to young people. That is the most important thing I think we can do to help them. Will Scott Morrison take a pay cut, in solidarity with those who have lost their jobs or businesses? I have no plans to make any changes to those arrangements [pay]. We will follow the same practices that we\u2019re applying to public servants right across the board. We\u2019re not singling anyone out when it comes to those issues, I will keep doing a good job. That\u2019s my plan. I will be accountable to Australians for that job. [Cont from previous post] When jobkeeper was designed and first costed, the uncertainties were extreme. And it\u2019s always been my practice - as, indeed, the Treasurer\u2019s - and I always like it when Treasury does it too - that they are cautious in their forecasting. It\u2019s been said to me, if you\u2019re going to miss the mark, it\u2019s better to miss the mark on the right side of the line. I can\u2019t say that about when the Labor Party was in government. They missed the mark often, and on the wrong side of the line. Forecast revenue - didn\u2019t turn up - spend it anyway. That\u2019s not what\u2019s happened here. What Treasury has done is made an estimate of what could be the case. It was the worst-case scenario, effectively, that they were forecasting - estimating. We are now in what is their best-case scenario. And that is something we should welcome. We acknowledge that, over at the Tax Office, there was a tracking mechanism that was put in place that wasn\u2019t leading to anyone getting a payment they shouldn\u2019t. Everyone that was entitled to that payment was getting that payment they should. But the tracking mechanism made it look like we were heading to the worst-case scenario. But, thankfully, we weren\u2019t. And I see this as a relief. And, as I said the other day, if your builder comes to you when you\u2019re building your house and they say, \u201cThis is going to cost 500 grand,\u201d and you go, \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of money I\u2019ve got to borrow, then they come back to you and go, \u201cI got that estimate off - it\u2019s actually going to cost you $350,000 or $250,000,\u201d you don\u2019t get disappoint would the news, and you don\u2019t borrow the rest of the money to put a heated swimming pool on the roof, I think as Barnaby recently said. You don\u2019t do that. So what we have done is acted responsibly. The estimates were provided to deliver a program that is doing its job. And for those for whom that program isn\u2019t designed to assist, JobSeeker is there for them, and they\u2019re getting that support at record levels. assist, JobSeeker is there for them. They are getting that support at record levels. getting that support at record levels. Scott Morrison continues: And jobseeker was set at a commensurate level. Because, remember, jobseeker is not the only benefit you get. Jobseeker \u2013 when you\u2019re on jobseeker \u2013 you get access to a range of other benefits which includes rental assistance, family tax benefit payments, and a whole range of other benefits and allowances. And that has meant that those, in fact, on jobseeker, in many cases, may well be getting more than those on jobkeeper. So I don\u2019t accept the argument particularly put by the Labor party that jobseeker is some sort of second-best option for Australians. I mean, the Labor party like to accuse us often of saying that we demonise the former Newstart. Well, that\u2019s basically what they\u2019re doing now, by sending that message to Australians. My message to Australians \u2013 and that of the treasurer and the entire government \u2013 is that we designed a system, through cashflow allowances for businesses, jobseeker, jobkeeper, and the myriad of other payments and benefits, to get them through. And that\u2019s what it is doing. Whether it\u2019s in any of those different programs. And it\u2019s been very successful in that 5 million Australians are benefiting. Now, you raise the point about the jobkeeper estimates. On those who can\u2019t receive jobkeeper, because they have been left out of the package, Scott Morrison says there is jobseeker (which comes with income testing and has also left quite a few people out) But we get the longest monologue so far, (which doesn\u2019t actually address the issue): Well, first of all, I don\u2019t buy into the demonisation of jobseeker. I don\u2019t. JobSeeker and jobkeeper - and it was actually the jobseeker changes we announced first - we announced them as a priority. Because the jobseeker measures is the ultimate social safety net for all of those who are affected. That is what is intended to catch everyone who finds themselves out of work. Jobkeeper was designed for those who worked in businesses, who have full-time jobs, part-time jobs, or what were effectively full-time casual jobs. That\u2019s who it was designed for. It was not designed to pay the bills of state governments or local governments. That is their responsibility. Nor was it designed to pay the bills of foreign governments. And those policy designs were put in place. And everyone who falls within those designs is getting JobKeeper. That\u2019s who is intended to get those payments. [Cont in next post] The prime minister is now seemingly comparing a breakdown in the employer/employee relationship in some places, to a soured marriage in need of counselling: The only way you\u2019re going to get the strength of an outcome through this process is if you engage in it seriously and in good faith and you seek to build the cooperation that is needed for these agreements to stick. That\u2019s true in any relationship. A business relationship, an employer/employee relationship, in any partnership. It\u2019s about the relationship you build. And what I\u2019m saying is the relationships have got pretty sick. And they need a bit of counselling. And that\u2019s what this process, I hope, will do. It\u2019ll bring people together again, and they can rediscover why they\u2019re together in the first place. And that they depend on each other for their success and their shared success. And I think there has been a real disconnection along these lines. Employers have felt that their investments and their sacrifices and risks aren\u2019t always appreciated. And employees can often feel ripped off and feel like they\u2019re not getting a fair share of how the business is going. Well, you\u2019ve got to start there. And let\u2019s see how we go from there. Does the prime minister want the \u201cbetter off overall test\u201d or Boot, removed from IR laws? I want to see employers and employees sit down around a table, talk about those very issues and find a way forward. I\u2019m not going to prescribe it for them. Whatever they agree is more likely to be sustained and maintained into the future. But what I want them to focus on is an understanding that, if there\u2019s no business, there\u2019s no job. There\u2019s no income. There\u2019s nothing. And the success of the enterprise is what all those involved in it need to be committed to. And in return for that commitment, there must be a sharing of the benefits and the success of that organisation back to employees. Back to the shareholders in that business. And those who are running it. And so, what I\u2019m trying to do differently about this process is not run out there with an IR shopping list. I haven\u2019t seen that work in my political experience in the time I\u2019ve been in the parliament. All that\u2019s tended to do is force people away from the table, not draw them to it. So I think, you know, the issues you\u2019re talking about are obviously very important to business, and the concerns that employees have are also important to them. But we\u2019re only going to get through it if they can work this through. Now, sure, we\u2019ll take a, I think, active role in this process and try to take those discussions forward. But at the end of the day, I\u2019m asking everyone to focus on getting that business back on track, making money, so they can pay employees and they can employ more of them. It\u2019s really that simple. Q: When you come to the table on pushing for industrial relations reform, what are the sorts of things that you can offer the employees and the union movement? Scott Morrison: Well, all of the things you\u2019ve just talked about are all central features of our government services delivery. All of the things you\u2019ve talked about. We have reformed childcare. We have increased the subsidies that are available - particularly to the most disadvantaged workers. We have got record funding for schools. Record funding for hospitals. We do have a social security system which is the envy of the world. That is the product of the last 20 or 30 years. And it\u2019s something I think we will have an absolute commitment to maintaining. This is why I keep coming back to the point about the economy and what we\u2019ve learnt about it during the course of this crisis. When you\u2019ve had consistent economic growth for almost 30 years, it can be taken for granted. And as treasurer, I used to warn about this as well. But I think no-one has any doubt now that, if you don\u2019t look after the growth in your economy, then you can\u2019t guarantee any of the things you\u2019ve talked about. You can make big, bold promises about them, and you can talk about how important they are. But you can\u2019t fund them. And so that\u2019s why my point today has been that, unless we focus on the success of that business that is going to employ someone, then there\u2019s nothing really to offer. Because there\u2019s no economy to offer it from. And so that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to get our priorities right. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to get the order right. Now, if we can make that work on those supply-side reforms, as they\u2019re sort of known technically, then all of the things [you] has just talked about will be able to be guaranteed. I can guarantee hospitals, schools, the aged pension, childcare, one of the world\u2019s most generous pharmaceutical benefits schemes, on the basis of a strong economy. And if you don\u2019t put businesses at the centre of that economy, you can\u2019t make that pledge. Should Australian businesses consider investment with China to be a riskier prospect? Scott Morrison: I think that\u2019s a judgment Australian businesses can only make. And, like any business, they have to weigh up the security of the markets in which they sell to. And the risks that are associated with those. And those risks will move, from time to time. They\u2019ll ebb and flow. And we would like to see stable, reliable, dependable markets all the time for our products and services. But those are not decisions that governments make for businesses, be they primary producers and exporters or be they resources companies or industries or, indeed, service companies working in the aged care area on training or things like this. I think one of the most exciting parts of the China free trade agreement \u2013 China-Australia free trade agreement \u2013 was the ability to actually sell aged care services into China. I\u2019ve said that on many occasions before. But businesses have got to weigh up those risks and make those assessments. Austrade can assist with those things on the ground. While I\u2019m pleased to see Mathias and Josh and I this morning reviewing those iron ore trading figures this morning \u2013 we\u2019re very reassured by what we\u2019re seeing on those patterns compared to what there\u2019d been in the past. Australia has a very bright trading future, and businesses will make their judgments about how they participate in that. Another eastern Sydney school has had to send children home after a student tested positive for Covid-19. Waverley College closed earlier this morning. Now Moriah College has sent children home. On the industrial accords 2.0 Scott Morrison says: One of the keys in this is you don\u2019t speak for them - you let them speak for themselves. We\u2019ve booked the room, we\u2019ve hired the hall, we\u2019ve got the table ready. Whether the chairs will be as rickety as the ones I saw in Auckland a few years ago, I don\u2019t know. But our job is to bring people together. And we\u2019ve been doing that through this crisis. And though I\u2019ve got to say, it\u2019s been one of the greatest privileges to work with people across the spectrum - the National Cabinet has been a great example of that, and I thank the premiers and chief ministers again for the good faith in which they\u2019ve engaged. Sure, we haven\u2019t agreed all the time, but the relationships are stronger now than they have ever been, despite those disagreements. I hope to see something of that nature replicated in this process. But it\u2019s not for the government to stick their nose in here and start predefining what these outcomes are. We need people to get together and sort this stuff out. As I say, they\u2019ve been caught in grooves for too long, and grooves going in parallel lines and not coming together. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m hoping this process will achieve. It may succeed. It may fail. But I can assure you, we\u2019re going to give it everything we can. And I\u2019m very grateful of the engagements that I\u2019ve had with the sectors that you\u2019ve nominated. It\u2019s been in good faith and it\u2019s been honest, and it requires everybody to leave a bit aside. I acknowledge and respect that as well. Scott Morrison says \u201chow good is Australia\u201d and concludes his speech. As reported (and expected), the government is dumping its union-busting bill: In good faith, we have decided the government will not pursue a further vote in the Senate on its Ensuring Integrity Bill. Not pursuing a further vote, though, I hasten to caution on this bill, does not reflect any change or lack of commitment to the principle that lawful behaviour of registered organisations should be strictly required on all work sites in Australia. The government maintains its complete lack of tolerance for the kinds of behaviour we have particularly seen from the CFMEU on Australian construction sites in recent years. It\u2019s not only illegal, it\u2019s costing jobs. Given how critical the construction sector will be to the task of rebuilding the Australian economy, the government remains committed to ensuring the lawbreaking stops. We are committed to ensuring that this happens in the simplest, fairest and most effective statutory form possible, which we will consider going forward. But our first \u2013 the here and now \u2013 priority, what we have to do right now, is to take this opportunity to work together through a genuine good-faith process to get some real outcomes and to make the jobs that Australians need. Here we go. Christian Porter will lead a \u201ctime-bound\u201d process bringing employers, industry groups, employee representatives and government to the table \u201cto chart a practical reform agenda \u2013 a job-making agenda \u2013 for Australia\u2019s industrial relations system\u201d. The minister will chair five working groups, for discussion, negotiation and hopefully agreement, to produce that jobmaker package in the following areas: award simplification, what most small- and medium-sized businesses deal with in their employees every single day. Enterprise agreement-making \u2013 we\u2019ve got to get back to the basics. Casuals and fixed-term employees, made even more prescient by recent changes through the Fair Work Commission. Compliance and enforcement. People should be paid properly. And unions need to, obviously, do the right thing. As must employers. Greenfield agreements for new enterprises, where the new investment will go and the certainty is needed more so than ever. Membership of each group will include employer and union representatives, as well as individuals chosen based on their demonstrated experience and expertise, and that will include \u2013 especially \u2013 small businesses, rural and regional operators, multicultural communities, women, families. This process, as I said, will be time-bound, and it is expected to run through to September. We must make the most of this time we have, and we must move quickly. It will become apparent very quickly if progress is to be made. The working groups will either reach something approaching a consensus on issues, or they won\u2019t. But we\u2019ve got to give it a go. We get on to the IR changes: Now, on industrial relations \u2013 I have been genuinely heartened by the constructive approach of employees and employers and business groups and unions working together in the ACTU with the government through this crisis to find practical solutions to keeping Australians in jobs. We now need to turn that into cooperation to create even more jobs, especially during this all-important recovery phase. Our current system is not fit for purpose, especially given the scale of the jobs challenge that we now face as a nation. Our industrial relations system has settled into a complacency of unions seeking marginal benefits and employers closing down risks, often by simply not employing anyone. The system has lost sight of its purpose to get the workplace settings right, so the enterprise \u2013 the business \u2013 can succeed, so everybody can fairly benefit from their efforts and their contributions. It is a system that has, to date, retreated to tribalism, conflict and ideological posturing. No side of that debate has been immune from those maladies. This will need to change, or more Australians will unnecessarily lose their jobs and more Australians will be kept out of jobs. The first step is to get everyone back in the room, to bring people together. That\u2019s our job. And in particular, that\u2019s my job. No one side has all the answers. Employees or employers. Unions or employer organisations. It is not beyond Australians to put aside differences to find cooperative solutions to specific problems, especially at a time like this. On the vocational changes, Scott Morrison describes it as thus: Firstly, the complexity of a system that is clunky and unresponsive to skills demands. Ask any business - they will tell you that. The lack of clear information about what those skills needs are, now and into the future, to guide training and funding. Ask any student or their parents about what it is like to deal with the system and whether they think they are getting value out of it. They will tell you that. A funding system marred by inconsistencies and incoherence with little accountability back to any results. Currently, the average time frame to develop or update training products is 18 months with a third taking over two years to update. Not very responsive. For prospective student, the large number of choices they face for qualifications can be bewildering and overwhelming. Compounded by lack of visibility over the quality of training providers and the employment outcomes for those courses. There are over 1,400 qualifications on offer and almost 17,000 units of competency. There is also substantial variations in fees for students, depending on which state they are in. For example, in 2019, a student undertaken certificate 3 in blinds, awning and security screens received a subsidy of $3,726 in Queensland, $9,630 in New South Wales, and no subsidy in Victoria, unless the qualification is taken as an apprenticeship. Now, I\u2019m not making any comment on each of those individual measures. But there is a wide variety. Subsidies for a diploma of nursing in 2017 varied between $19,963 in Western Australia and $8,218 in Queensland. And all of this is before the question surrounding the quality of that training is addressed. No surprise, then, that state subsidised students in Queensland [finish with vocational] debts that are on average more than double of those in New South Wales. It is no wonder when faced with this, many potential students default to the university system. (ahhhh, the university system isn\u2019t much better) Even if their career could be best enhanced through vocational education. I want those trade and skills jobs to be aspired to, not looked down upon or seen as a second best option. It is a first best option. Scott Morrison on what \u201cjobmaker\u201d is all about: I will seek to bring people together, to define and achieve the change we need to in all these areas. And today I just want to focus on two areas: skills and industrial relations. Now, I will address many of the other components of our jobmaker plan in the weeks and months ahead as we proceed to the budget in October \u2013 a process that is one of patiently putting each brick in the wall. This will occur simultaneously with managing the ongoing pandemic. Let\u2019s not lose sight of that in addressing the right here, right now needs of Australian who continue to be severely impacted. So, on skills. We need Australians better trained for the jobs, businesses are looking to create. It is that simple. This is not how medication works. In many cases, people need to stay on medication for the rest of their lives in order to live. But you are going to her A LOT about this, because the prime minister has decided it\u2019s a good line: At some point, you\u2019ve got to get your economy out of ICU. You\u2019ve got to get it off the medication before it becomes too accustomed to it. We must enable our businesses to earn Australia\u2019s way out of this crisis. And that means focusing on the things that can make their businesses go faster: the skilled labour businesses need to draw on; the affordable and reliable energy they need; the research and technology they can draw on and utilise; the investment capital and finance that they can access; the markets they can connect to; the economic infrastructure that supports and connects them; the amount of government regulation they must comply with. And the amount \u2013 the efficiency of the taxes they must pay, in particular whether such taxes encourage them to invest and to employ. Scott Morrison, who had a \u201cwe stopped these\u201d sculpture of a boat in his office, says his fifth principle is to \u201cmake the boat go faster\u201d: And then there\u2019s the fifth principle, which I like to call the Sir Peter Blake principle. I spoke to Jacinda Ardern this morning. Doing what makes the boat go faster. My colleagues are very familiar with this principle. Many years ago I worked in New Zealand, where I looked after the government\u2019s then engagement with the Team New Zealand 2000 America\u2019s Cup defence. Team New Zealand, led by the late Sir Peter Blake, was competing in one of the richest sporting events in the world. Biggest sponsors, enormous global media investments, broadcast rights, high-tech sport, like you have never seen. You would think no expense spared by any team in that great quest. But early on I learned the key to Team New Zealand\u2019s success. At one of our early meetings we met at the headquarters in Auckland. There was a fellow called Alan Sefton, who was head of the corporate operations. We sat on rickety old shares, there was a scuffed-up table. The office looked like it had been saved from demolition. I noted the surroundings. And Alan responded by saying: \u201cIn Team New Zealand you only ask one question \u2013 what makes the boat go faster?\u201d Those chairs weren\u2019t going to make any difference. Nor their accommodations. And their united and focused effort brought a whole country together. Not just the team. And they won. And so can we. This health and economic crisis is a reminder of just how much we depend on a strong and growing economy for our jobs, for our incomes, for our health and education services. Our safety, our security, our social safety net of which we\u2019re so proud. To strengthen and agree our economy, the boats we need to go faster are the hundreds of thousands of small and medium and large businesses that make up our economy and create the value upon which everything else depends. Value created by establishing successful products and services, the ability to be able to sell them at a competitive and profitable price, and into growing and sustainable markets. Economics 101. That is what happens in a sustainable and successful job-making market economy. He continues: Fourthly, we must ensure there is an opportunity in Australia for those who have a go to get a go. This is our Australian way. Access to essential services, incentive for effort, respect for the principles of mutual obligation, ensuring equal opportunities for those in rural and regional communities to be the same as those in our cities and our suburbs. All translated into policies that seek not to punish those who have success, but devise ways for others to achieve it. Scott Morrison: Thirdly, we must seek to leverage and build on our strengths and educated and highly skilled workforce that not just supports a thriving service sector but a modern, advanced competitive manufacturing sector, resources and agricultural sectors that can fuel and feed large global population, including our own, and support vibrant rural and regional communities. I know the Deputy Prime Minister would agree thoroughly. A financial system that has proved to be one of the most stable and resilient in the world. World leading scientist, specialist, researchers, technologists and an emerging space sector. And we are back to \u201cliving within our means\u201d (sound familiar?) Scott Morrison: Secondly is the principle of caring for country. A principle that Indigenous Australians have practised for tens of thousands of years. It means responsible management and stewardship of what has been left to us to sustainably manage that inheritance for current and future generations. We must not borrow from generations in the future from what we cannot return to them. This is as true for our environmental, cultural and natural resources as it is for our economic and financial ones. Governments, therefore, must live within their means, so we don\u2019t impose impossible debt burdens on future generations. That violates that important caring for country principle. On trade, Scott Morrison says: We will remain in Australia an outward-looking, open and sovereign trading economy. We will not retreat into the downward spiral of protectionism. To the contrary. We will be a part of global supply chains that can deliver the prosperity we rely on to create jobs, support incomes and build businesses. Our economic sovereignty will be achieved by ensuring our industries are highly competitive, resilient and able to succeed in a global market. Not by protectionism. While a trading nation, we will never trade away our values or our future for short-term gain. With trade alliances and other partners, we will work to establish and maintain the balance needed for peace and stability in our region, upon which everyone\u2019s prosperity depends. The prime minister then sends a very unsubtle message to the \u201cwhy even lockdown?\u201d critics. You know, we should not downplay this, this achievement, and pretend like [the threat] never existed or that our preparations or our precautions were unwarranted. Let me assure you, Australia, the risk was great. And uncertain. And it still is. Countries like ours \u2013 developed, sophisticated economies, with strong health systems \u2013 have experienced death rates more than 100 times what we have experienced here in Australia. The fact our worst-case scenarios have not been realised is cause for great relief, not apathy. The prime minister says he received more than 100,000 letters and emails from Australians during the pandemic, outlining their experiences. Scott Morrison: A year ago, I said, \u201cHow good is Australia? And how good are Australians?\u201d Over the past year Australians have proved this time and again. We are an amazing country \u2013 a view shared by all of my government, I\u2019m sure all of the parliament, my colleagues here with me today, the deputy prime minister, the treasurer, the leader of the government in the Senate, my many colleagues. We believe this passionately. Australians have stood up. Australians are proving once again that we are capable of doing extraordinary things, but in a very Australian way. I am thankful for the many sacrifices that Australians have made to get us to this point. We\u2019ve had jobseeker and jobkeeper \u2013 now get ready for jobmaker. Scott Morrison will talk about his plan to get the economy through the next few years, which includes a focus on vocational training \u2013 but we are yet to hear whether or not there will be any money for the plan. And we can only expect bushfire season to get longer and more intense The prime minister is due to begin his press club address at 12.30pm. You can follow along live, here. I\u2019ve just been sent some new statistics on the extraordinary numbers of masks, gloves and other PPE the federal government has added to its national medical stockpile during the pandemic. In responses to questions on notice from crossbench senator Rex Patrick, the government has confirmed it will have added 60m masks, 5.8m gloves and 15m gowns to the national stockpile by the end of May. About 11.5m gloves and 520,000 gowns have been received in recent weeks. The government has also revealed that more than 37m masks have been sent from the stockpile to frontline health workers, including 24m to the public hospital system, 7.7m to general practice and 2.4m to aged care. A further 40m masks will be sent to frontline health workers by the end of May. The government is generally reluctant to provide details about its national medical stockpile for reasons of national security. The stockpile is an emergency reserve of medical equipment for times of disaster and crisis. But Patrick told the Guardian that the state of Australia\u2019s national medical reserves needed to be examined by the Senate. On the face of it, noting emergency efforts to purchase PPE and spin up Australian industry, it appears that the stockpile was insufficient. It is my understanding the Covid oversight committee will seek a private briefing from Health and other relevant departments. And Victoria\u2019s daily update: The total number of coronavirus (Covid-19) cases in Victoria is 1,610 \u2013 an increase of five since yesterday. There have been no new deaths reported. To date, 19 people have died from coronavirus in Victoria. There have been 182 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Victoria that may have been acquired through community transmission. Currently eight people are in hospital, including three patients in intensive care; 1,533 people have recovered. Of the total 1,610 cases, there have been 1,333 in metropolitan Melbourne and 236 in regional Victoria. Several cases remain under investigation. The total number of cases is made up of 850 men and 760 women. More than 437,000 tests have been processed to date. Of the new cases, three cases were detected in returned travellers in hotel quarantine and one case was detected through community testing unrelated to any known outbreak. A case of Covid-19 has also been detected in a resident at the HammondCare aged care facility in Caulfield, bringing the total number of cases at that facility to two. The resident has been moved to a separate building at the facility, and identified close contacts are already in quarantine. These close contacts will be re-tested. The source of acquisition for this case is still under investigation and all potential sources of transmission will be explored. Potential links to the previous case at the facility are being investigated. All residents and staff at the facility were tested following the first notification of a case of coronavirus at the facility. Due to an existing medical condition, only one resident remains to be tested. This resident remains in strict quarantine. NSW Health has released its daily update: As at 8pm Monday 25 May 2020, there have been two additional cases of Covid-19 diagnosed since 8pm 24 May, bringing the total number of cases in NSW to 3,092. Both of the new cases are in returned travellers who are now in quarantine hotels. There were 4,621 tests carried out in the reporting period, compared with 4,783 in the previous 24 hours. Nearly 457,000 Covid-19 tests have now been carried out in NSW. As previously advised, NSW Health is modifying how it records testing numbers moving forward to take into account how many times a person has had an individual test, until they become positive. Once the person has tested positive, subsequent testing to confirm whether they are clear of the virus will not be recorded in the overall count as those subsequent tests will not add to the number of infections in the community. NSW Health is again urging anyone feeling unwell \u2013 even with the mildest of symptoms, such as a runny nose or scratchy throat \u2013 to come forward and get tested, so cases in the community are identified as quickly as possible. Catherine King has some thoughts on jobkeeper, as the government moves towards jobmaker: With last week\u2019s revelation that the number of people on jobkeeper has been revised down by 3 million, the government cannot continue to deny support to dnata\u2019s 5,500 Australian workers. Three weeks ago, one of Australia\u2019s leading aviation services companies, dnata, had to tell its 5,500 workers that the company is currently ineligible for the jobkeeper wage subsidy program. Dnata\u2019s Australian workers provide crucial ground handling, charter handling, cargo and logistics, and catering services to Australia\u2019s aviation sector. For weeks the Morrison government has been telling casuals and other excluded workers that the jobkeeper program was full when in reality it was 3 million workers short. The treasurer has extraordinary powers to extend jobkeeper with the stroke of a pen. He should do so immediately. AAP has a bit more on the new Queensland Covid diagnosis, which is suspected to be linked to the Ruby Princess cruise ship: A passenger of the Ruby Princess who tested positive to coronavirus is suspected to have carried the \u201cdormant\u201d virus for almost 10 weeks before falling ill. The woman was diagnosed in Cairns on Monday, taking the total number of Queensland cases to 1057, with just 12 remaining active. Authorities suspect she is the latest coronavirus case to have carried the inactive virus and become sick weeks after exposure. Last week another woman in Queensland was diagnosed two months after returning from India. \u201cWe are monitoring that very closely to work out if it\u2019s directly related to the Ruby Princess or if it was acquired in some other way,\u201d Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told reporters on Tuesday. A spokesperson for the health minister told AAP the woman had returned a negative result after a recent test and it was not possible she was contagious since she left the ship on 19 March. I just rewatched Annastacia Palaszczuk\u2019s press conference from earlier today, and the Queensland premier seems quite exasperated at the border questions. She asked a journalist if they were willing to put their family at risk of community transmission of Covid-19 by opening the borders to NSW, and said Simon Birmingham \u201clives in a state that has the borders shut\u201d. National cabinet this Friday should be fun. NSW transport minister and the almost-Eden-Monaro candidate, Andrew Constance, says specialist teams will be deployed to check on social distancing on public transport: You know, at the end of the day, I just want to echo this message \u2013 complacency is going to kill us. If we\u2019re complacent with Covid across our community, people are going to get sick and we\u2019re going to lose lives. What we want to do in terms of our transport system, use every available resource to make sure that people maintain that 1.5m, don\u2019t get crowded on services, and don\u2019t risk their lives. And to have an additional 80 staff backing up our frontline deployed specifically monitoring the 11,000 cameras, CCTV cameras across the network, using the load data on the trains to ensure we can get there quickly and get people safe is what this is all about. For us, this is a really important initiative, it\u2019s one which is very insightful in terms of the community. Footy might be back, but the crowds are still some time off. Pauline Hanson is still working out if she can challenge the Queensland border closures legally, and Clive Palmer is taking his Western Australia border complaints to the high court as well. Simon Birmingham, who previously was \u201copen the borders\u201d, took a more conciliatory approach on Sky News this morning: It\u2019s their right, it\u2019s anybody\u2019s right to initiate legal challenges. I hope it doesn\u2019t come to that. I hope these matters can be resolved before it gets to the determination of the high court. In the end, we are having enormous success across Australia in suppressing the spread of Covid-19 and every state and territory has played a role in that and every state and territory\u2019s enjoying that success. And they are now safely, successfully reopening schools, getting pubs and restaurants back open, getting people back to work which is the most important thing. But ultimately, and hopefully well before September, as the health advice allows, I want to see those interstate border restrictions come down because one in 13 Australian jobs relies on our tourism industry and yet of course with no international travellers coming now or for the foreseeable future, we need to see domestic tourism recover to sustain some of those jobs and businesses. Non-Covid related, but something which will be capturing headlines into the future Victoria has reported five new Covid-19 cases, as some students return to school. Victorian education minister Gayle Tierney says there have been many successes from the recent remote learning and he will be ordering an independent inquiry into what can be incorporated into the usual school program. A summit of education leaders will be held next month to discuss the issue. Tierney: I mean, the pandemic across the globe has been very, very challenging. It is a crisis of tragic proportions, but when you look at how schools have responded, there is gold, there is gold in the way that schools have responded, and we got to mine that gold and make it a feature of our education system. Every principal I have spoken to, every teacher, talk about students who have reengaged, students who disengaged at school, seven weeks ago, are suddenly embracing their learning. Students who are performing very well academically compared to when they were at school. So we got to ask the question: why is that the case? We got to take those positives out of this crisis and make it a feature of our education system. So that\u2019s why today as students return to school, I have asked teachers and staff across all schools, across all sectors, to think about what has worked for them as teachers and what has worked for their students during flexible and remote learning. It\u2019s why we\u2019ll commission an independent analysis of what we can learn from flexible and remote learning over the last seven weeks and it\u2019s why I\u2019ll be calling for an \u2013 a summit, I\u2019ll be holding a summit, of education leaders across government, Catholic and independent schools. We\u2019ll be holding that summit later in June but it\u2019s about examining what has worked and how we can make that a feature of our education system. Out of every crisis, there\u2019s an opportunity and what I have seen as education minister is our schools have been doing a brilliant job and there are thousands and thousands of students across Victoria who have thrived through remote and flexible learning. We need to learn from that and make it a feature of our education system. Queensland has reported one new case of Covid-19. Where it came from is still under investigation, but at this point, authorities think it may be related to the Ruby Princess. Annastacia Palaszczuk says there will be more information on the next stage of loosening restrictions, on Sunday. She also says she is holding meetings with representatives from the tourism industry: We still only have 12 active cases in Queensland and that is wonderful news as we approach Sunday when we make decisions on what restrictions will be lifted for sage 2. It is excellent news to know that we are sitting on just 12 active cases in Queensland which is a stark contrast to what\u2019s happening in other parts of Australia. Today, I\u2019m also very pleased to be on the Gold Coast. I\u2019ll be meeting the minister of tourism, a range of stakeholders across the Gold Coast \u2013 both big employers and small employers. It\u2019s really important that we\u2019re hear listening to the views of Gold Coast and I know that people want to get up and running as quickly as possible, but we need to do it in a safe and measured way. It is absolutely vital that we do it in the safest way possible, making sure that we listen to the expert advice which is, of course, from Dr [Jeannette] Young, but also to \u2013 listening to the views of people here on the Gold Coast. So we\u2019ll be having a range of meetings. The Greens leader has some thoughts on the latest policy buzzword. I have to say, I am very excited for JobBaker and JobCandlestickmaker. Josh Frydenberg has officially turned down appearing in front of the Covid-19 Senate select committee. Non-government MPs had wanted the treasurer to front the committee, to explain the $60bn jobkeeper issue. That is not a surprise \u2013 he all but said he wouldn\u2019t be appearing yesterday. But it is also a signal that the bipartisanship during the height of the Covid-19 crisis is over. The employment, skills and small business minister, Michaelia Cash, has quietly authorised a \u201cnational communications campaign to support small business\u201d. An instrument, which commences today, Tuesday, authorises funding for a campaign to support small businesses affected by Covid-19. \u201cThe purpose of the program is to mitigate the negative economic impacts of Covid\u201119 on these businesses by encouraging consumers to patronise small businesses,\u201d it said. Just how much will taxpayers be charged to be told to come out from under the doona? Unclear at this stage \u2013 as this instrument merely authorises spending rather than making an appropriation or awarding a contract. The authorisation is provided by section 33 of the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 \u2013 which allows the minister to \u201cprescribe one or more programs in relation to industry, innovation, science or research\u201d. I guess ads telling people to go back to shops, cafes and restaurants fits in the broad parameters of a \u201cprogram in relation to industry\u201d. Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, has said households and businesses\u2019 \u201cdemand confidence\u201d will be the difference between a V-shaped and U-shaped recovery but it is \u201cvery hard to determine\u201d whether consumers would flock back to shops and cafes now restrictions were easing. Let\u2019s hope the ads \u2013 when they hit the airwaves \u2013 help. The ABC is reporting a student at Waverley College in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs, which went back to on-site learning last week, has tested positive for Covid-19. It reports parents have been asked to collect their children from school. In case you missed it, there was this quiet announcement from the Treasurer\u2019s office, yesterday as well: Given the impact of the coronavirus crisis and the uncertainty it continues to generate, it has been considerably more difficult for companies to release reliable forward-looking guidance to the market. Therefore, the government will temporarily amend the Corporations Act 2001 (the Act) so that companies and officers\u2019 will only be liable if there has been \u201cknowledge, recklessness or negligence\u201d with respect to updates on price sensitive information to the market. These changes will be made under the instrument-making power that has been inserted into the Act as part of our response to the coronavirus crisis. The heightened level of uncertainty around companies\u2019 future prospects as a result of the crisis also exposes companies to the threat of opportunistic class actions for allegedly falling foul of their continuous disclosure obligations if their forecasts are found to be inaccurate. In response, companies may hold back from making forecasts of future earnings or other forward-looking estimates, limiting the amount of information available to investors during this period. The changes announced today will make it harder to bring such actions against companies and officers\u2019 during the coronavirus crisis and while allowing the market to continue to stay informed and function effectively. The changes will be in effect for six months from [today]. Another quiet announcement The ACCC says seven million of us are now connected to the NBN: More than seven million Australian consumers are now connected to the NBN after the activation of 455,000 new services in the three months to 31 March. The connections were made as available NBN bandwidth per user jumped by 31% during the March quarter, following NBN Co\u2019s boost of the network capacity in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The ACCC\u2019s latest quarterly Wholesale Market Indicators Report, released today, shows total Connectivity Virtual Circuit (CVC) per user increased from 1.92Mbps to 2.52Mbps during the March quarter, after NBN Co temporarily provided retail service providers (RSPs) with up to 40% extra capacity at no additional cost. \u201cWe were pleased to see NBN Co and RSPs work together to ensure Australians can stay connected during these unprecedented times,\u201d ACCC chair Rod Sims said. \u201cConsumers have been downloading and uploading record amounts of data for online work, school and social activities, which has been essential in helping households get through this challenging situation.\u201d The special commission of inquiry into the Ruby Princess continues. AAP has a recap on what happened yesterday: Carnival Australia\u2019s port operations director has disputed claims he told a staff member at the NSW Port Authority the Ruby Princess docking should be \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d. The special commission of inquiry into the Ruby Princess continued on Monday with a focus on the communication between Carnival\u2019s Paul Mifsud and the NSW Port Authority in the early hours of March 19. Mifsud told the inquiry he had learned the ship had been cleared by NSW Health about 5.30pm on March 18 via a text message from Carnival Australia port agent manager Valerie Burrows. This was questioned about midnight by NSW Port Authority senior manager Robert Rybanic who had been told there were Covid-19 concerns regarding two passengers needing ambulance transport from the ship. Mifsud says he didn\u2019t recall saying to Rybanic it was \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d or mentioning anything about the ship being deemed low risk by NSW Health. Richard Marles is having a chat to Sky News this morning, where he gives an idea of where Labor is headed with its attacks on Scott Morrison this week: He likes to be there on the good days, but when times get tough, he likes to be somewhere else. Addressing the \u201ctake the economy out of the ICU\u201d line that the PM will be using to frame his press club address today, Marles says: The fact of the matter is the economy barely had a heartbeat before we came into the Covid crisis, it was already really sick. We had the lowest wage growth on record. We had a government which doubled the debt, we had an economy with anaemic growth, and that set the conditions for this economy going into the Covid crisis. The prime minister will deliver his press club address just after lunch. The ABC is also reporting that the first human trials of a vaccine for Covid-19 have begun in the southern hemisphere, at Melbourne\u2019s Alfred hospital today. The drug has been developed by a US biotech company, Novavax, and results are hoped for by July. The ABC has published a story by Dylan Welch, detailing the \u201cdossier\u201d Sydney News Corp papers claimed was connected to the Five Eyes alliance: The American embassy has held private meetings with Canberra to clarify a US State Department document that was used by a Sydney newspaper to link the COVID-19 pandemic to a Chinese government laboratory despite a lack of direct evidence. The so-called \u201cWestern governments dossier\u201d used by the Saturday Telegraph and sister newspaper the Daily Telegraph was, in fact, a widely distributed \u2014 and deniable \u2014 background document created by the US State Department. The document contained no new evidence linking the laboratory to the outbreak and instead relied on publicly available news and scientific journal papers. Speaking of stimulus and what comes after, you may find this new Guardian series interesting. Well, it\u2019s the prime minister\u2019s speech day, which means you are going to hear a lot of analogies about medication and doonas and weaning the economy off of both of them and something-something ICU. Scott Morrison will try to hit the reset button before the June parliamentary sittings, while trying to ensure that everyone forgets about that pesky $60bn the government was going to borrow but now is trying not to. Which means everything is focused on the next few months and getting business back up and running. We\u2019ll cover that, plus all the days other coronavirus and political developments as Australia starts to examine what this new normal looks like. You have Amy Remeikis with you for most of the day. Ready?",

      "body": "<p>A sacred site in Western Australia that showed 46,000 years of continual occupation and provided a 4,000-year-old genetic link to present-day traditional owners has been destroyed in the expansion of an iron ore mine.</p> <p>The cave in Juukan Gorge in the Hammersley Ranges, about 60km from Mt Tom Price, is one of the oldest in the western Pilbara region and the only inland site in Australia to show signs of continual human occupation through the last Ice Age. It was blasted along with another sacred site on Sunday.</p> <p>Mining company Rio Tinto received ministerial consent to destroy or damage the site in 2013 under WA\u2019s outdated Aboriginal heritage laws, which were drafted in 1972 to favour mining proponents.</p> <p>One year after consent was granted, an archeological dig intended to salvage whatever could be saved discovered the site was more than twice as old as previously thought and rich in artefacts, including sacred objects.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/29/australia-lodges-world-heritage-submission-for-50000-year-old-burrup-peninsula-rock-art\">Australia lodges world heritage submission for 50,000-year-old Burrup Peninsula rock art</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most precious was a 4,000-year-old length of plaited human hair, woven together from strands from the heads of several different people, which DNA testing revealed were the direct ancestors of Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura traditional owners living today.</p> <p>But the outdated Aboriginal Heritage Act does not allow for a consent to be renegotiated on the basis of new information. So despite regular meetings with Rio Tinto, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) Aboriginal Corporation was unable to stop the blast from going ahead.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most sacred sites in the Pilbara region \u2026 we wanted to have that area protected,\u201d PKKP director Burchell Hayes told Guardian Australia.</p> <p>\u201cIt is precious to have something like that plaited hair, found on our country, and then have further testing link it back to the Kurrama people. It\u2019s something to be proud of, but it\u2019s also sad. Its resting place for 4,000 years is no longer there.\u201d</p> <p>Hayes said the site had been used as a campsite by Kurrama moving through the area, including in the memory of some elders.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to do the same, we want to show the next generation,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, if this site has been destroyed, then we can tell them stories but we can\u2019t show them photographs or take them out there to stand at the rock shelter and say: this is where your ancestors lived, starting 46,000 years ago.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c2c8858774f61ac337ccd2e99cfb597a4aae681\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c2c8858774f61ac337ccd2e99cfb597a4aae681/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The cave in Juukan Gorge that was blasted.

      "bodyText": "A sacred site in Western Australia that showed 46,000 years of continual occupation and provided a 4,000-year-old genetic link to present-day traditional owners has been destroyed in the expansion of an iron ore mine. The cave in Juukan Gorge in the Hammersley Ranges, about 60km from Mt Tom Price, is one of the oldest in the western Pilbara region and the only inland site in Australia to show signs of continual human occupation through the last Ice Age. It was blasted along with another sacred site on Sunday. Mining company Rio Tinto received ministerial consent to destroy or damage the site in 2013 under WA\u2019s outdated Aboriginal heritage laws, which were drafted in 1972 to favour mining proponents. One year after consent was granted, an archeological dig intended to salvage whatever could be saved discovered the site was more than twice as old as previously thought and rich in artefacts, including sacred objects. Most precious was a 4,000-year-old length of plaited human hair, woven together from strands from the heads of several different people, which DNA testing revealed were the direct ancestors of Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura traditional owners living today. But the outdated Aboriginal Heritage Act does not allow for a consent to be renegotiated on the basis of new information. So despite regular meetings with Rio Tinto, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) Aboriginal Corporation was unable to stop the blast from going ahead. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most sacred sites in the Pilbara region \u2026 we wanted to have that area protected,\u201d PKKP director Burchell Hayes told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt is precious to have something like that plaited hair, found on our country, and then have further testing link it back to the Kurrama people. It\u2019s something to be proud of, but it\u2019s also sad. Its resting place for 4,000 years is no longer there.\u201d Hayes said the site had been used as a campsite by Kurrama moving through the area, including in the memory of some elders. \u201cWe want to do the same, we want to show the next generation,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, if this site has been destroyed, then we can tell them stories but we can\u2019t show them photographs or take them out there to stand at the rock shelter and say: this is where your ancestors lived, starting 46,000 years ago.\u201d The Aboriginal Heritage Act has been up for review, in some form, since 2012. Draft legislation put forward by the former Liberal government in 2014 was rejected after even a National party MP argued it was unfair to traditional owners and did not allow for adequate consultation. Rewriting the act was listed as a priority for Labor before their election win in 2017, and last month WA\u2019s Aboriginal affairs minister Ben Wyatt pushed back the final consultation on his draft bill until later this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. The new legislation will provide options to appeal or amend agreements to allow for the destruction of heritage sites, Wyatt said. He wasn\u2019t aware of the risk to the Juukan site, or its destruction, until Monday. \u201cIt will provide for agreements between traditional owners and proponents to include a process to consider new information that may come to light, and allow the parties to be able to amend the agreements by mutual consent,\u201d he said. \u201cThe legislation will also provide options for appeal should either party not be compliant with the agreement.\u201d In its submission to the legislative review, Rio Tinto said it was broadly supportive of the proposed reform but that consent orders granted under the current system should be carried over, and that rights of appeal should be fixed, not broad or subject to extensions, lest it \u201cprolong approvals or appeals processes at a critical point in the project.\u201d A spokesman from Rio Tinto said the company had a relationship with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people dating back three decades, \u201cand we have been working together in relation to the Juukan area over the past 17 years\u201d. \u201cRio Tinto has worked constructively together with the PKKP People on a range of heritage matters and has, where practicable, modified its operations to avoid heritage impacts and to protect places of cultural significance to the group,\u201d the company said. The mining company signed a native title agreement with the traditional owners in 2011, four years before their native title claim received formal assent by the federal court. They facilitated the salvage dig in 2014, which uncovered the true age of the site. Archeologist Dr Michael Slack, who led that dig, said it was a once-in-a-lifetime discovery. An earlier 1 metre test dig, conducted in 2008, dated the site at about 20,000 years old, but the salvage expedition uncovered a \u201cvery significant site\u201d with more than 7,000 artefacts collected, including grid stones that were 40,000 years old, thousands of bones from middens which showed changes in fauna as the climate changed, and sacred objects.

Why no, he had not \u2018offered his resignation, or even thought of offering it\u2019, because he had absolutely no idea why he should have. Over and over again he repeated: \u2018I acted reasonably\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Of Cummings\u2019 Easter jaunt to Barnard Castle, undertaken \u2013 by his account \u2013 to check that his eyesight was up to the journey back to London, Lib\u00e9ration remarked: \u201cTo many, driving 30 miles with blurred vision and a four-year-old in the back might not be considered entirely reasonable. But not, apparently, to Dominic Cummings.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2020/05/25/royaume-uni-dominic-cummings-tente-de-sauver-sa-tete_6040715_3210.html\">Le Monde was</a> equally astonished. \u201cUsually, special advisers remain in the shadows,\u201d it said. \u201cAt worst, when things go wrong, they quit. They never speak in public ... But for more than an hour, Cummings delivered his version of the facts, assuring all that he had \u2018acted reasonably\u2019, without breaking the rules.\u201d</p> <p>There was \u201cno question of apologising. At most, he conceded one or two minor errors \u2026 But will the operation have been successful? It will, in any case, have shown how deeply Cummings wants to keep his job. And how deeply Boris Johnson cares about this very special special adviser.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://elpais.com/internacional/2020-05-25/el-asesor-estrella-de-johnson-asegura-que-no-se-arrepiente-de-haberse-saltado-el-confinamiento.html\">Spain\u2019s El Pa\u00eds said</a> Cummings was meant to be \u201cthe breath of fresh, irreverent air that was going to help Boris Johnson design a new country after Brexit\u201d. But the adviser\u2019s \u201crefusal to express any remorse for breaking the lockdown rules has caused a political gale that may irreparably damage the prime minister\u2019s political credibility\u201d.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s \u201cmachiavellian henchman is asking for a display of understanding and empathy that at another time, and for another person, might have seemed humane and reasonable\u201d, the paper said.</p> <p>\u201cBut Cummings has left a trail of political enemies along the way, and the patience of British public opinion is at breaking point. The adviser so famously capable of scenting the mood of the people has not grasped that sometimes a resignation is not fair or unfair, but necessary to protect a superior.\u201d</p> <p>In Germany, <a href=\"https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article208272341/Lockdown-Affaere-um-Dominic-Cummings-Bizarrer-Auftritt-im-Rosengarten.html?cid=onsite.onsitesearch\">Die Welt described</a> a \u201cbizarre\u201d event at which \u201cthe second most powerful man in Westminster after Boris Johnson \u2026 refused to step down or even apologise, despite massive criticism of his trip to relatives during the coronavirus crisis. Cummings could have irreparably damaged confidence in the government.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/corona-warum-johnson-nicht-auf-dominic-cummings-verzichten-will-16786221.html\">Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said</a> Cummings had \u201cgone down in history as the first adviser to give a live press conference in Downing Street\u201d. Usually, the paper said, \u201cpolitical advisers work for the government. In Cummings\u2019 case, it is ministers who work for the adviser: one after another has been sent out to defend him.\u201d</p> <p>Whether the adviser\u2019s trip broke the rules \u201cremains a matter of interpretation,\u201d the paper said, but there was no denying the extent of \u201cthe outrage that has shaken the country in the past few days. Not just politicians and commentators, but academics and churchmen \u2013 all echoing the chorus of citizens demanding Cummings go.\u201d</p> <p>In the Netherlands, <a href=\"https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2020/05/24/johnsons-adviseur-cummings-vond-dat-de-strenge-lockdown-niet-voor-hem-gold-a4000600\">NRC Handelsblad</a> said Johnson was now stuck with \u201ca growing problem.

      "bodyText": "World media have reacted with disbelief to Dominic Cummings\u2019 defence of his trip to Durham, saying that what the \u201cmachiavellian\u201d adviser saw as reasonable behaviour did not appear so to many and risked damaging not just Boris Johnson\u2019s government but democracy. \u201cNo regrets, no excuses, no resignations \u2026 Il ne regrette rien,\u201d said Lib\u00e9ration, telling the story of \u201can extraordinary press conference during which Dominic Cummings confirmed that he had rewritten for himself the rules of the lockdown laid down by the government for which he works\u201d. Only once did the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser appear confused, the French paper said, \u201calmost taken aback by the question. Why no, he had not \u2018offered his resignation, or even thought of offering it\u2019, because he had absolutely no idea why he should have. Over and over again he repeated: \u2018I acted reasonably\u2019.\u201d Of Cummings\u2019 Easter jaunt to Barnard Castle, undertaken \u2013 by his account \u2013 to check that his eyesight was up to the journey back to London, Lib\u00e9ration remarked: \u201cTo many, driving 30 miles with blurred vision and a four-year-old in the back might not be considered entirely reasonable. But not, apparently, to Dominic Cummings.\u201d Le Monde was equally astonished. \u201cUsually, special advisers remain in the shadows,\u201d it said. \u201cAt worst, when things go wrong, they quit. They never speak in public ... But for more than an hour, Cummings delivered his version of the facts, assuring all that he had \u2018acted reasonably\u2019, without breaking the rules.\u201d There was \u201cno question of apologising. At most, he conceded one or two minor errors \u2026 But will the operation have been successful? It will, in any case, have shown how deeply Cummings wants to keep his job. And how deeply Boris Johnson cares about this very special special adviser.\u201d Spain\u2019s El Pa\u00eds said Cummings was meant to be \u201cthe breath of fresh, irreverent air that was going to help Boris Johnson design a new country after Brexit\u201d. But the adviser\u2019s \u201crefusal to express any remorse for breaking the lockdown rules has caused a political gale that may irreparably damage the prime minister\u2019s political credibility\u201d. Johnson\u2019s \u201cmachiavellian henchman is asking for a display of understanding and empathy that at another time, and for another person, might have seemed humane and reasonable\u201d, the paper said. \u201cBut Cummings has left a trail of political enemies along the way, and the patience of British public opinion is at breaking point. The adviser so famously capable of scenting the mood of the people has not grasped that sometimes a resignation is not fair or unfair, but necessary to protect a superior.\u201d In Germany, Die Welt described a \u201cbizarre\u201d event at which \u201cthe second most powerful man in Westminster after Boris Johnson \u2026 refused to step down or even apologise, despite massive criticism of his trip to relatives during the coronavirus crisis. Cummings could have irreparably damaged confidence in the government.\u201d The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said Cummings had \u201cgone down in history as the first adviser to give a live press conference in Downing Street\u201d. Usually, the paper said, \u201cpolitical advisers work for the government. In Cummings\u2019 case, it is ministers who work for the adviser: one after another has been sent out to defend him.\u201d Whether the adviser\u2019s trip broke the rules \u201cremains a matter of interpretation,\u201d the paper said, but there was no denying the extent of \u201cthe outrage that has shaken the country in the past few days. Not just politicians and commentators, but academics and churchmen \u2013 all echoing the chorus of citizens demanding Cummings go.\u201d In the Netherlands, NRC Handelsblad said Johnson was now stuck with \u201ca growing problem. Firing Cummings, even temporarily, would remove his right hand \u2013 and Johnson\u2019s most important ministers were appointed because of their views on Brexit, not their expert special knowledge or leadership experience.\u201d But keeping him \u201cis equally dangerous\u201d, the paper said. \u201cIt will show the British public that they do not need to observe the lockdown rules so strictly. And in that case, the authority of the Johnson government will crumble yet further.\u201d Beyond Europe, Australia\u2019s The Age said Cummings\u2019 press conference had \u201ccompounded his difficulties in a manner reminiscent of Prince Andrew\u2019s catastrophic BBC interview in November\u201d. Of the trip to Barnard Castle \u201cto test whether his eyes were working properly\u201d, it asked: \u201cAfter setting himself up as examiner and examinee, what were other drivers on the open road to do if he failed his own assessment?\u201d In a crisis such as the coronavirus, the paper said, \u201cthose who wield power \u2212 especially when they do so largely behind the scenes \u2212 cannot be exempted from accountability for their actions. In arguing, as Cummings has, that his is an exceptional case, he has given the impression he is beyond reproach. That is not a healthy position for anyone in a democracy to occupy.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, Do our genes decide whether or not we are vulnerable to severe cases of Covid-19? That\u2019s the implication of new research, which found that people with a genetic mutation that increases the risk of dementia are at least twice as likely to suffer severe symptoms if they catch the coronavirus \u2013 regardless of whether they have been diagnosed with dementia. UK researchers analysed genetic data from 500,000 people and said the link they uncovered between the virus and the \u201ce4\u201d variant of the ApoE gene was \u201cpretty bulletproof\u201d. Meanwhile, as the World Health Organization continues its search for effective coronavirus treatments, it has temporarily dropped trials of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, which Donald Trump claims to have been taking as a precaution. The WHO paused the trials in light of a study published last week, which suggested taking the drug put patients at higher risk of heart problems and death. Ending lockdown early could cause an \u2018immediate second peak\u2019 The world is still in the middle of the first wave of the coronavirus outbreak, and countries that are lifting their lockdowns now risk an \u201cimmediate second peak\u201d of infections, according to the WHO. Over Memorial Day weekend, with the US nearing 100,000 coronavirus deaths, crowds gathered at beaches in California and bars in Missouri \u2013 scenes that left Dr Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, \u201cvery concerned\u201d. Virginia governor Ralph Northam was criticised after failing to wear a mask during a beachfront stroll on Saturday, a day after the Democrat told Virginians that wearing a face covering \u201ccould literally save someone else\u2019s life\u201d. Kentucky anti-lockdown protesters hung an effigy of their Democratic governor Andy Beshear from a tree on the grounds of the state capitol in Frankfort, an act criticised by lawmakers from both sides of the aisle. America may never identify its \u201cpatient zero\u201d, according to experts who are investigating the undetected early spread of the coronavirus in the US. Trump spent the weekend golfing and insulting women Donald Trump marked Memorial Day with a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, following two days of golfing at his club in nearby Sterling, Virginia \u2013 the president\u2019s first round on a golf course in almost three months. He also devoted some of the holiday weekend to Twitter, retweeting personal attacks on Nancy Pelosi and Stacey Abrams for their looks or weight, and another that denounced Hillary Clinton as a \u201cskank\u201d. In another series of tweets on Monday, Trump threatened to move the Republican national convention in August from Charlotte, North Carolina, to another state with less strict lockdown requirements. North Carolina\u2019s Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, was \u201cstill in shutdown mood,\u201d the president complained, saying he wanted to be sure the convention arena would be packed with GOP supporters. Joe Biden said it felt \u201cgood to be out of my house\u201d as he laid a wreath at a Delaware veterans\u2019 memorial on Monday. Trump\u2019s 2020 challenger and his wife Dr Jill Biden both wore face masks for the trip. The pandemic is a \u2018disaster\u2019 for children\u2019s rights A Dutch NGO has warned that the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic will be \u201cdisastrous\u201d for the human rights of the world\u2019s children, making them more vulnerable to forced labour and underage marriage, plunging millions into extreme poverty and depriving them of health and education provisions. KidsRights chairman, Marc Dullaert, said the crisis \u201cturns back the clock on years of progress made on the wellbeing of children\u201d. Elsewhere in the world\u2026 \u2026 Mexico City has seen 8,000 more deaths so far this year than the four-year average, suggesting the country\u2019s official coronavirus death toll of approximately 7,400 could be a vast underestimate. \u2026 Brazil\u2019s embattled president Jair Bolsonaro is facing further pressure after his political idol, Donald Trump, announced a ban on travel to the US from Brazil amid a surge of cases in the country. \u2026 The Russian resort of Sochi will reopen its 65 seaside sanatoriums next week, as the popular tourist destination begins lifting its lockdown before the summer season. In other news\u2026 Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s murder is being investigated as a possible hate crime, according to the Arbery family\u2019s lawyer, who said on Monday that the FBI has launched a criminal inquiry into two district attorneys and the Georgia police department involved in the case.

It\u2019s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out \u2013 eventually.</p>\n    <p>At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 \u2013 higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles.

      "bodyText": "People in England could be allowed to socialise in bigger groups in gardens or parks in the coming weeks, a cabinet minister has confirmed, but visiting friends and family indoors still appears to be some way off. Pressure is mounting on the government to make clear its plans for easing restrictions on social contact, after Boris Johnson announced outdoor markets and car showrooms could open from next week and non-essential retail outlets from 15 June. Speaking to broadcast media, Michael Gove, a Cabinet Office minister, acknowledged the restrictions on seeing family and friends were \u201ctough\u201d and suggested rules on seeing only one person from another household outdoors could soon be relaxed. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cYou can see members of your family or friends out of doors, and we are looking at seeing how we can make it easier to see, in particular, more family members out of doors in a safe way.\u201d Changes to the rules about outdoor gatherings could be announced this week, it is understood, with ministers keen to assuage public concerns about being unable to see friends and family. However, Gove gave no hint when indoor visits to family and friends may be allowed again. The possibility of more outdoor meetings \u2013 discussed at cabinet \u2013 could pave the way for barbecues, garden parties and other forms of socialising, although it is likely the physical distancing rules would still apply. The government\u2019s plan for easing the lockdown in England, published this month, included a commitment to consider \u201csocial bubbles\u201d, whereby households could mingle with one other household. It said: \u201cThe intention of this change would be to allow those who are isolated some more social contact, and to reduce the most harmful effects of the current social restrictions, while continuing to limit the risk of chains of transmission.\u201d However, the prime minister gave no update about this on Sunday or Monday when he spoke at the daily press conference, while Gove talked only about bigger outdoor meetings being allowed \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d. One Whitehall source suggested the government\u2019s scientific advisers were not enthusiastic about the idea of bubbles, which could be difficult to enforce. Gove also suggested it would be some time before pubs, restaurants, cafes and bars would return to normal. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be more difficult with pubs, restaurants and bars in full,\u201d Gove told LBC radio. \u201cWhat I hope we may be able to see is people being able to have outdoor hospitality, so that you can enjoy a drink in the garden of a pub or eat outdoors in a cafe. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very, very difficult for us to return to any of us standing at the bar or any of us mingling in a cafe indoors in a way that we have in the past.\u201d",

The death toll stands at 346,612.

The total includes new figures published on Tuesday by the Office for National Statistics covering England and Wales, which combined with information published last week by the National Records of Scotland and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency show that so far 47,343 deaths have been registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, including suspected cases.</p> <h2><strong>French doctor dismisses WHO verdict on hydroxychloroquine</strong></h2> <p>The controversial French doctor Didier Raoult has dismissed a study suggesting the drug he hails as a miracle treatment for coronavirus is ineffective at best and possibly life-threatening at worst. The World Health Organization has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine-trial-trump-coronavirus-safety-fears\">suspended testing the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients</a> due to safety concerns. The WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/22/hydroxychloroquine-trumps-covid-19-cure-increases-deaths-global-study-finds\">a paper published last week in the Lancet </a>that showed people taking hydroxychloroquine were at higher risk of death and heart problems than those who were not taking it. But Raoult dismissed the concerns: \u201cNothing will change what I have seen with my own eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea if elsewhere, hydroxychloroquine kills, but here it\u2019s saving people.\u201d</p> <h2>UN refugee agency warns of catastrophe in Yemen</h2> <p>A humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding in Yemen, a country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/people-are-very-afraid-yemen-faces-spectre-of-coronavirus-amid-aid-cuts\">ravaged by five years of war</a> that finds itself uniquely vulnerable to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/26/coronavirus-live-news-covid-19-uupdates-who-drops-hydroxychloroquine-trial-as-mexico-death-toll-questioned?page=with:block-5eccf3f38f08a1782fa81a50#block-5eccf3f38f08a1782fa81a50\">In a virtual briefing</a> on Tuesday, the UN\u2019s refugee agency, UNHCR, said it was seeing a \u201cgrowing number of families resorting to harmful coping mechanism\u201d such as begging, child labour and marrying of children to survive. A UNHCR spokesman, Charlie Yaxley, said: \u201cWe are reaching a potential breaking point in our programmes where if we don\u2019t receive further funding soon, many of our programmes and particularly our cash assistance programmes to internally displaced Yemenis may have to stop.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Saudi Arabia to revise curfew times</strong></h2> <p>Saudi Arabia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/26/coronavirus-live-news-covid-19-uupdates-who-drops-hydroxychloroquine-trial-as-mexico-death-toll-questioned?page=with:block-5ecce6088f08a1782fa81982#block-5ecce6088f08a1782fa81982\">will revise curfew times this week</a>, and lift them entirely across the kingdom with the exception of the holy city of Mecca, from 21 June.

Children were due to return to school at the end of August after classes for more than 25 million primary and secondary students were shut down in March. But Duterte said he believed the risk was too great, even if it held students back academically. \u201cUnless I am sure that they are really safe it\u2019s useless to be talking about opening of classes,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/26/coronavirus-live-news-covid-19-uupdates-who-drops-hydroxychloroquine-trial-as-mexico-death-toll-questioned?page=with:block-5eccd5a88f0886ce4f5da5ef#block-5eccd5a88f0886ce4f5da5ef\">the president said</a>. \u201cFor me, vaccine first.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Dutch PM Mark Rutte did not visit dying mother due to Covid-19 restrictions</strong></h2> <p>The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, was unable to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/dutch-pm-mark-rutte-did-not-visit-dying-mother-due-to-covid-19-restrictions\">visit his dying mother</a> in her final weeks because he obeyed coronavirus restrictions against visiting care homes, his office has said. His mother did not die of Covid-19, although there had earlier been an outbreak of the disease in the home where she was living, Dutch media reported.</p> <h2><strong>Mexico City records thousands more deaths than usual, amid doubt over official Covid-19 toll</strong></h2> <p>This year, Mexico City has issued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/mexico-city-records-thousands-more-deaths-than-usual-amid-doubt-over-official-covid-19-toll\">8,072 more death certificates than the average</a> for the same period in the past four years, according to a study that suggests the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll could be significantly higher than the official figure of nearly 7,400. The report\u2019s authors found 37% more death certificates were issued in April 2020 than that month\u2019s average during the previous four years. By the end of May they estimated the number may grow to 120%.</p> <h2><strong>Australia will not open the country\u2019s borders \u2018anytime soon\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Australia will not open the country\u2019s borders \u201canytime soon\u201d, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/26/coronavirus-live-news-covid-19-uupdates-who-drops-hydroxychloroquine-trial-as-mexico-death-toll-questioned?page=with:block-5ecc928e8f0864e579f17a41#block-5ecc928e8f0864e579f17a41\">said on Tuesday</a>, but added the country would continue its discussions with neighbouring New Zealand about a trans-Tasman safe travel zone. \u201cI was speaking with Prime Minister Ardern this morning, and we\u2019ll continue to have our discussions about the trans-Tasman safe travel zone,\u201d Morrison told the National Press Club in Canberra.</p> <h2><strong>Masks too dangerous for children under two, Japan medical group says</strong></h2> <p>Children under the age of two should not wear masks because they can make breathing difficult and increase the risk of choking, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/26/coronavirus-live-news-covid-19-uupdates-who-drops-hydroxychloroquine-trial-as-mexico-death-toll-questioned?page=with:block-5ecc92be8f0886ce4f5da42e#block-5ecc92be8f0886ce4f5da42e\">a Japan medical group has said</a>, launching an urgent appeal to parents as the country reopens from the coronavirus crisis.<br></p>",

The death toll stands at 346,612. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting. UK Covid-19 death toll passes 47,000 The number of deaths involving Covid-19 in the UK has topped 47,000, according to the latest available data. The total includes new figures published on Tuesday by the Office for National Statistics covering England and Wales, which combined with information published last week by the National Records of Scotland and the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency show that so far 47,343 deaths have been registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, including suspected cases. French doctor dismisses WHO verdict on hydroxychloroquine The controversial French doctor Didier Raoult has dismissed a study suggesting the drug he hails as a miracle treatment for coronavirus is ineffective at best and possibly life-threatening at worst. The World Health Organization has suspended testing the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients due to safety concerns. The WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, cited a paper published last week in the Lancet that showed people taking hydroxychloroquine were at higher risk of death and heart problems than those who were not taking it. But Raoult dismissed the concerns: \u201cNothing will change what I have seen with my own eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea if elsewhere, hydroxychloroquine kills, but here it\u2019s saving people.\u201d UN refugee agency warns of catastrophe in Yemen A humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding in Yemen, a country ravaged by five years of war that finds itself uniquely vulnerable to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. In a virtual briefing on Tuesday, the UN\u2019s refugee agency, UNHCR, said it was seeing a \u201cgrowing number of families resorting to harmful coping mechanism\u201d such as begging, child labour and marrying of children to survive. A UNHCR spokesman, Charlie Yaxley, said: \u201cWe are reaching a potential breaking point in our programmes where if we don\u2019t receive further funding soon, many of our programmes and particularly our cash assistance programmes to internally displaced Yemenis may have to stop.\u201d Saudi Arabia to revise curfew times Saudi Arabia will revise curfew times this week, and lift them entirely across the kingdom with the exception of the holy city of Mecca, from 21 June. Bans on domestic travel, holding prayers in mosques, and workplace attendance in both the government and private sector will be lifted from 31 May, while a phased lifting of curfews will begin this week. Russia reports 8,915 new cases and 174 deaths Russia has announced that 174 people with coronavirus have died in the past 24 hours, a record one-day amount that has pushed the nationwide death toll to 3,807. Officials reported 8,915 new cases, pushing its overall case tally to 362,342. WHO warns of \u2018second peak\u2019 in areas where Covid-19 is declining Countries where coronavirus infections are declining could still face an \u201cimmediate second peak\u201d if they let up too soon on measures to contain the outbreak, the World Health Organization said. The WHO emergencies chief, Dr Mike Ryan, told an online briefing: \u201cWe cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down.\u201d Philippine president confirms no school before vaccine The president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, has said he will not allow students to go back to school until a vaccine is available. Children were due to return to school at the end of August after classes for more than 25 million primary and secondary students were shut down in March. But Duterte said he believed the risk was too great, even if it held students back academically. \u201cUnless I am sure that they are really safe it\u2019s useless to be talking about opening of classes,\u201d the president said. \u201cFor me, vaccine first.\u201d Dutch PM Mark Rutte did not visit dying mother due to Covid-19 restrictions The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, was unable to visit his dying mother in her final weeks because he obeyed coronavirus restrictions against visiting care homes, his office has said. His mother did not die of Covid-19, although there had earlier been an outbreak of the disease in the home where she was living, Dutch media reported. Mexico City records thousands more deaths than usual, amid doubt over official Covid-19 toll This year, Mexico City has issued 8,072 more death certificates than the average for the same period in the past four years, according to a study that suggests the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll could be significantly higher than the official figure of nearly 7,400. The report\u2019s authors found 37% more death certificates were issued in April 2020 than that month\u2019s average during the previous four years. By the end of May they estimated the number may grow to 120%. Australia will not open the country\u2019s borders \u2018anytime soon\u2019 Australia will not open the country\u2019s borders \u201canytime soon\u201d, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said on Tuesday, but added the country would continue its discussions with neighbouring New Zealand about a trans-Tasman safe travel zone. \u201cI was speaking with Prime Minister Ardern this morning, and we\u2019ll continue to have our discussions about the trans-Tasman safe travel zone,\u201d Morrison told the National Press Club in Canberra. Masks too dangerous for children under two, Japan medical group says Children under the age of two should not wear masks because they can make breathing difficult and increase the risk of choking, a Japan medical group has said, launching an urgent appeal to parents as the country reopens from the coronavirus crisis.",

The job losses amount to more than a quarter of the Surrey-based company\u2019s 4,000 workforce and will be spread across the company\u2019s Formula One, road-car and applied technologies operations. The group blamed the cuts on the cancellation of motorsport events, the suspension of manufacturing and car sales, reduced demand for its technology solutions, as well as the new Formula One cost cap due to be introduced next season. McLaren has already furloughed a significant number of its employees as the Formula One season and sales of supercars ground to a halt amid the spread ofCovid-19. \u201cWe deeply regret the impact that this restructure will have on all our people, but especially those whose jobs may be affected,\u201d said Paul Walsh, the executive chairman of McLaren Group. \u201cIt is a course of action we have worked hard to avoid, having already undertaken dramatic cost-saving measures across all areas of the business. But we now have no other choice but to reduce the size of our workforce.\u201d The cuts, first reported by Sky News, come as the group seeks to raise \u00a3275m from investors, backed against the value of its classic car collection and its state-of-the-art Norman Foster-designed headquarters building in Woking. McLaren has burned through \u00a3257m in the year to 20 April, with production at its Woking plant suspended since March. The group\u2019s existing shareholders pledged \u00a3300m of equity investment in March as McLaren sought to shore up its finances as the pandemic hammered its balance sheet. The carmaker reportedly failed in its request for a \u00a3150m emergency loan from the government. \u201cThis is undoubtedly a challenging time for our company, and particularly our people,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cBut we plan to emerge as an efficient, sustainable business with a clear course for returning to growth.\u201d McLaren is tentatively hoping for the restart of the Formula One season . The race series accounts for about 12% of the group\u2019s revenues through prize money and advertising deals. \u201cMcLaren Racing has been a proponent of the introduction in 2021 of the new Formula One budget cap which will create a sustainable financial basis for the teams and lead to a more competitive sport,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cWhile this will have a significant impact on the shape and size of our F1 team, we will now begin to take the necessary measures to be ready to run at the cap from 2021 onwards, in order to challenge again for race wins and championships in the future.\u201d McLaren is due to start the first deliveries to customers of the 765LT supercar in October, which comes with a recommended price tag of $358,000. Towards the end of the year they company will also start deliveries of the Elva, an ultra-exclusive open-top speedster, which will cost a reported \u00a31.4m, before options such as a 24-carat gold engine heat shield are included. \u201cWe have already invested in developing a new lightweight, hybrid vehicle architecture that will commence series production at the end of this year with the first deliveries to customers now sure in early 2021,\u201d he said. The Japanese carmaker Nissan is also expected to announce job cuts in the coming days, with as many as 20,000 jobs globally at risk.",

      "body": "<p>The mayor of London has warned that funding for the coronavirus emergency programme to house all rough sleepers in hotels will run out in mid-June, and without new government money there could be a surge in homeless people returning to the streets.</p> \n<p>About 1,400 of the capital\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/07/i-might-have-died-if-hadnt-rescued-me-hotels-for-homeless\">homeless people are currently staying in hotels at the state\u2019s expense</a>. \u201cUnless we get support from the government, we haven\u2019t got the money to continue literally to pay for the hotels past the middle of June,\u201d Sadiq Khan said. Beyond that point, \u201cI can\u2019t hand on heart tell you how we can fund the work we\u2019re doing,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p>Khan said he wanted to be optimistic about the possibility that the drive to bring all rough sleepers into hotels to stop the spread of the virus could have a permanent positive impact on homelessness in the capital, allowing charities time to work to help find longer-term solutions for rough sleepers.</p> \n<p>It could be \u201cthe one silver lining from this awful virus\u201d, he added. But he was increasingly concerned about whether central government funding would stretch to make this possible.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe could be the generation that ends rough sleeping; we think we are on the cusp of something amazing, but it could go either way. I can\u2019t sugar-coat it. Unless the government steps in by the middle of June, there will be a cliff-edge fall,\u201d the mayor said in an interview with the Guardian.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat will be so heartbreaking because we have met people who have been on our streets for years and this is the first time they have accepted help.\u201d</p> \n<p>He welcomed a government announcement on Saturday that funding would be brought forward to make an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/24/england-to-provide-3300-homes-for-homeless-after-coronavirus\">extra 3,300 homes available to prevent rough sleepers returning to the streets</a>. But he said it was \u201cvital that the government guarantees it will continue levels of support for rough sleepers right now, ensuring that we can continue to provide emergency accommodation to protect them from this deadly pandemic\u201d.<br></p> \n<p>Since lockdown was announced in March, more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/councils-told-to-house-all-rough-sleepers-in-england-by-weekend\">5,400 rough sleepers have been placed in Holiday Inns, Travelodges and Ibis hotels all over of England</a>. Similar schemes are in operation elsewhere in the UK.</p> \n<p>Those who have been staying in hotels under the emergency scheme are increasingly anxious about their future, many of them monitoring the news as announcements are made about the easing of lockdown.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7bb26bfc-05df-4557-a9be-5e1c95185a79\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In April the UK government set out these five tests it said had to be met before they would consider easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>The NHS has sufficient capacity to provide critical care and specialist treatment right across the UK</li>\n     <li>A sustained and consistent fall in daily deaths from Coronavirus</li>\n     <li>Reliable data to show that the rate of infection is decreasing to manageable levels across the board</li>\n     <li>Operational challenges including testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) are in hand with supply able to meet future demand</li>\n     <li>Confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Rising speculation about the resumption of summer holiday planning has triggered concern about when the hotels housing the homeless may need to open to their regular clients.</p> \n<p>Homelessness charities such as <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.org.uk/?gclid=CjwKCAjw_LL2BRAkEiwAv2Y3STur36D5jYWPGf9473G92_c-QdOZyWMtrOhoTezV0-5GuAqa9XZCYBoCsXAQAvD_BwE\">Glass Door</a> are concerned about the absence of an exit plan setting out what will happen to hotel residents once lockdown ends.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnxiety is starting to be more prevalent. We don\u2019t know when this is going to be terminated, when are they going to be asked to leave and what is the exit strategy,\u201d said Alex Norris, a case worker with the London charity.</p> \n<p>\u201cIndividuals are really worried, asking us: have you heard about what will happen after the hotels reopen? People who are sleeping rough do not want to go back to that situation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Khan said he was hoping London\u2019s homeless could continue to be housed until mid-August, which would give the charities working with them enough time to help people find longer-term housing.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe think that is enough time to provide the support they need \u2013 help for alcohol dependency, help for drug dependency \u2013 we could get a plan in place,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the hotels have got to be emptied out [before then], I can\u2019t answer the question. Where do they go?\u201d</p> \n<p>For the moment, he said hotels remained \u201centhusiastic about helping out\u201d. The Greater London Authority is paying \u00a330-\u00a340 for each room.</p> \n<p>Khan said: \u201cOf course they can\u2019t get tourists to stay in hotel rooms, so this is an opportunity to get some revenue. This is a virtuous circle: the government gives us money to get rough sleepers in off the streets, we keep them safe and potentially get them off the streets for good; the hotels are can stay in business, because they are receiving this money.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is no shortage of hotel space.

      "bodyText": "The mayor of London has warned that funding for the coronavirus emergency programme to house all rough sleepers in hotels will run out in mid-June, and without new government money there could be a surge in homeless people returning to the streets. About 1,400 of the capital\u2019s homeless people are currently staying in hotels at the state\u2019s expense. \u201cUnless we get support from the government, we haven\u2019t got the money to continue literally to pay for the hotels past the middle of June,\u201d Sadiq Khan said. Beyond that point, \u201cI can\u2019t hand on heart tell you how we can fund the work we\u2019re doing,\u201d he added. Khan said he wanted to be optimistic about the possibility that the drive to bring all rough sleepers into hotels to stop the spread of the virus could have a permanent positive impact on homelessness in the capital, allowing charities time to work to help find longer-term solutions for rough sleepers. It could be \u201cthe one silver lining from this awful virus\u201d, he added. But he was increasingly concerned about whether central government funding would stretch to make this possible. \u201cWe could be the generation that ends rough sleeping; we think we are on the cusp of something amazing, but it could go either way. I can\u2019t sugar-coat it. Unless the government steps in by the middle of June, there will be a cliff-edge fall,\u201d the mayor said in an interview with the Guardian. \u201cThat will be so heartbreaking because we have met people who have been on our streets for years and this is the first time they have accepted help.\u201d He welcomed a government announcement on Saturday that funding would be brought forward to make an extra 3,300 homes available to prevent rough sleepers returning to the streets. But he said it was \u201cvital that the government guarantees it will continue levels of support for rough sleepers right now, ensuring that we can continue to provide emergency accommodation to protect them from this deadly pandemic\u201d. Since lockdown was announced in March, more than 5,400 rough sleepers have been placed in Holiday Inns, Travelodges and Ibis hotels all over of England. Similar schemes are in operation elsewhere in the UK. Those who have been staying in hotels under the emergency scheme are increasingly anxious about their future, many of them monitoring the news as announcements are made about the easing of lockdown. Rising speculation about the resumption of summer holiday planning has triggered concern about when the hotels housing the homeless may need to open to their regular clients. Homelessness charities such as Glass Door are concerned about the absence of an exit plan setting out what will happen to hotel residents once lockdown ends. \u201cAnxiety is starting to be more prevalent. We don\u2019t know when this is going to be terminated, when are they going to be asked to leave and what is the exit strategy,\u201d said Alex Norris, a case worker with the London charity. \u201cIndividuals are really worried, asking us: have you heard about what will happen after the hotels reopen? People who are sleeping rough do not want to go back to that situation.\u201d Khan said he was hoping London\u2019s homeless could continue to be housed until mid-August, which would give the charities working with them enough time to help people find longer-term housing. \u201cWe think that is enough time to provide the support they need \u2013 help for alcohol dependency, help for drug dependency \u2013 we could get a plan in place,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the hotels have got to be emptied out [before then], I can\u2019t answer the question. Where do they go?\u201d For the moment, he said hotels remained \u201centhusiastic about helping out\u201d. The Greater London Authority is paying \u00a330-\u00a340 for each room. Khan said: \u201cOf course they can\u2019t get tourists to stay in hotel rooms, so this is an opportunity to get some revenue. This is a virtuous circle: the government gives us money to get rough sleepers in off the streets, we keep them safe and potentially get them off the streets for good; the hotels are can stay in business, because they are receiving this money. \u201cThere is no shortage of hotel space. We won\u2019t see these hotels saying in June or July: can you please leave because we have tourists arriving. By and large the hotels by and large are being fantastic.\u201d So far, things had gone reasonably smoothly. \u201cThe hotels were concerned about what sort of people they would get \u2013 there were worries about alcohol issues, drug issues, antisocial behaviour,\u201d Khan said. Charities had adapted the hotels to make them suitable. \u201cYou can\u2019t simply book a hotel room and send rough sleepers there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has to be wrap-around care: doctors, counselling, therapy.\u201d There has been some damage to some hotel rooms, mostly minor: people smoking in non-smoking rooms, some damage to doors. \u201cSome people have complex mental health issues, which have been exhibited in damage to rooms,\u201d Khan said. The government has said about 90% of rough sleepers have been housed in hotels. However, Khan said this was not the case in London, where 400-600 newly homeless people were arriving on the streets every week. \u201cThe government is not helping us with the new people on the streets,\u201d he said. Some are hospitality workers who have lost their jobs, lodgers who have been asked to leave, people experiencing domestic abuse fleeing violence, and about half are EU citizens who have no right to access benefits (because they have not been working for long enough in the UK) and other non-EU migrants who have no right to access public funds. A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: \u201cAny suggestion we are rowing back on our commitment to support rough sleepers is untrue. \u201cWe have given councils in London \u00a3517 million to deal with the immediate pressures they are facing \u2013 including to support rough sleepers \u2013 and the Greater London Authority has been given \u00a318m much of which is being used to support rough sleepers.\u201d \u2022 Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?",

      "body": "<p>A Chinese city is planning to make a health-tracking app introduced as part of the coronavirus response a permanent fixture for its population of 10 million.</p> <p>Versions of the app have been used across mainland China. It displays a QR code with an individual\u2019s virus status, which can be used to determine the extent to which the individual is allowed to move about.</p> <p>Authorities in the city of Hangzhou, a tech hub home to e-commerce giant Alibaba where the app was first launched, have announced they will seek to launch a broader version to monitor people\u2019s health.</p> <p>Sun Yongrong, the director of the Hangzhou health commission, told a meeting on Friday a number of advancements in healthcare administration had already been achieved through the health code app, and proposed integrating the data with more health indicators to develop individual index rankings.</p> <p>In the proposed app an individual\u2019s status would be colour-coded and scored out of 100 based on medical records, physical test results, levels of activity and other lifestyle choices such as smoking.</p> <p>Screenshots of the proposed app showed a numeral and colour bar indicating the relative health of the user, and the tracking of factors that contribute to the score, including the number of cigarettes smoked that day, steps taken, or hours slept.</p> <p>For example, drinking a glass of white wine could set your score back by 1.5 points, while sleeping for seven hours could improve it by one point.</p> <p>According to Chinese media reports, Hangzhou authorities plan to have the app ready by the end of next month. The city\u2019s health commission said the proposed system would be a \u201cfirewall to enhance people\u2019s health and immunity\u201d after the pandemic.</p> <p>Although apps used during the outbreak have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/07/how-global-health-crisis-turns-into-state-run-surveillance-opportunity\">raised concerns about privacy</a> and a lack of transparency in how they operate, Chinese people generally appear to have accepted them as necessary.</p> <p>However, the push to make a permanent version appears to have crossed a line for some. \u201cOutside of the epidemic periods, it has strong privacy issues,\u201d said one commenter on a news article posted to Weibo.</p> <p>Another said: \u201cThe boundary between personal health and public health should be reflected. The health code is for others to read. Others have no right to read your personal health reports.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell do my smoking, drinking and sleeping habits have to do with you?\u201d read another comment on Weibo.</p> <p>\u201cWe have no privacy left whatsoever,\u201d lamented another user.</p> <p>The existing apps have run on the ubiquitous platforms Alipay and WeChat, developed for the Chinese government. One commenter said they would delete Alipay from their phone if the app became permanent.</p> <p>Others expressed fear it would be used by insurance companies for tiered pricing, or by employers to screen job applicants.</p> <p>Chinese tech commentator and privacy advocate Lawrence Li said that the new app should ideally be an opt-in system to protect citizens\u2019 rights.</p> <p>\u201cIn the case of Covid [data collection] I think people willingly participated, but it\u2019s another story if the government wants to make it the \u2018new normal\u2019,\u201d he told AFP.</p> <p>Last week\u2019s annual meeting of the Chinese Communist party heard calls from delegates to strengthen oversight of security breaches. There were also calls for the National People\u2019s Congress to speed up the introduction of <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202005/25/WS5ecba521a310a8b241158511.html\">data protection laws</a> in response to the massive amounts of information collected on Chinese citizens during the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the data explosion, the demand for data security has become increasingly urgent,\u201d <a href=\"https://technode.com/2019/06/19/china-data-protections-law/\">said Wei Ming</a>, a deputy to the congress and chairman and general manager of China Mobile\u2019s Guangdong branch.</p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Lillian Yang and AFP</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "A Chinese city is planning to make a health-tracking app introduced as part of the coronavirus response a permanent fixture for its population of 10 million. Versions of the app have been used across mainland China. It displays a QR code with an individual\u2019s virus status, which can be used to determine the extent to which the individual is allowed to move about. Authorities in the city of Hangzhou, a tech hub home to e-commerce giant Alibaba where the app was first launched, have announced they will seek to launch a broader version to monitor people\u2019s health. Sun Yongrong, the director of the Hangzhou health commission, told a meeting on Friday a number of advancements in healthcare administration had already been achieved through the health code app, and proposed integrating the data with more health indicators to develop individual index rankings. In the proposed app an individual\u2019s status would be colour-coded and scored out of 100 based on medical records, physical test results, levels of activity and other lifestyle choices such as smoking. Screenshots of the proposed app showed a numeral and colour bar indicating the relative health of the user, and the tracking of factors that contribute to the score, including the number of cigarettes smoked that day, steps taken, or hours slept. For example, drinking a glass of white wine could set your score back by 1.5 points, while sleeping for seven hours could improve it by one point. According to Chinese media reports, Hangzhou authorities plan to have the app ready by the end of next month. The city\u2019s health commission said the proposed system would be a \u201cfirewall to enhance people\u2019s health and immunity\u201d after the pandemic. Although apps used during the outbreak have raised concerns about privacy and a lack of transparency in how they operate, Chinese people generally appear to have accepted them as necessary. However, the push to make a permanent version appears to have crossed a line for some. \u201cOutside of the epidemic periods, it has strong privacy issues,\u201d said one commenter on a news article posted to Weibo. Another said: \u201cThe boundary between personal health and public health should be reflected. The health code is for others to read. Others have no right to read your personal health reports.\u201d \u201cWhat the hell do my smoking, drinking and sleeping habits have to do with you?\u201d read another comment on Weibo. \u201cWe have no privacy left whatsoever,\u201d lamented another user. The existing apps have run on the ubiquitous platforms Alipay and WeChat, developed for the Chinese government. One commenter said they would delete Alipay from their phone if the app became permanent. Others expressed fear it would be used by insurance companies for tiered pricing, or by employers to screen job applicants. Chinese tech commentator and privacy advocate Lawrence Li said that the new app should ideally be an opt-in system to protect citizens\u2019 rights. \u201cIn the case of Covid [data collection] I think people willingly participated, but it\u2019s another story if the government wants to make it the \u2018new normal\u2019,\u201d he told AFP. Last week\u2019s annual meeting of the Chinese Communist party heard calls from delegates to strengthen oversight of security breaches. There were also calls for the National People\u2019s Congress to speed up the introduction of data protection laws in response to the massive amounts of information collected on Chinese citizens during the pandemic. \u201cGiven the data explosion, the demand for data security has become increasingly urgent,\u201d said Wei Ming, a deputy to the congress and chairman and general manager of China Mobile\u2019s Guangdong branch.

The country\u2019s poor treatment of Roma and Gypsy children was criticised while the UK\u2019s anti-terrorism strategy, Prevent, was found to have a stigmatising effect on Muslim children.</p> <p>British children\u2019s views were not systematically heard in developing policy that affects them, the report found. It also highlighted concerns around lack of legal aid while many children feel they are not listened to by social workers, paid carers, judges and other professionals working in family legal proceedings.</p> <p>Chad has fallen behind Afghanistan to reach the bottom of the rankings while Sierra Leone has the third worst result.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/15/will-we-die-of-hunger-how-covid-19-lockdowns-imperil-street-children\">\u2018Will we die of hunger?\u2019: how Covid-19 lockdowns imperil street children</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The advocacy group\u2019s chairman, Marc Dullaert, told the Guardian the pandemic would have a dire impact: \u201cOur index shows that even before Covid-19, countries were not allocating sufficient budgets around the protection of child rights. Now we expect the economic consequences of the crisis to turn the clock back 10 years on the progress made around the wellbeing of children, unless governments take swift action.\u201d</p> <p>Countries are scored using UN data and evidence collected from the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. They are assessed across five areas including health, education, and enabling an environment that promotes child rights.</p> <p>\u201cOverall, we see two big red flags in the findings this year,\u201d said Dullaert.

      "bodyText": "The suspension of vaccination programmes, school closures and a surge in domestic violence during coronavirus lockdowns are likely to derail a decade\u2019s worth of progress for children, according to new global research. The Kidsrights Foundation on Tuesday published its annual rankings of children\u2019s rights in 182 countries with Iceland scoring top for the second year running followed by Switzerland, Finland and Sweden. The UK fared poorly, ranking in 169th place behind countries including Sudan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Yemen. The country\u2019s poor treatment of Roma and Gypsy children was criticised while the UK\u2019s anti-terrorism strategy, Prevent, was found to have a stigmatising effect on Muslim children. British children\u2019s views were not systematically heard in developing policy that affects them, the report found. It also highlighted concerns around lack of legal aid while many children feel they are not listened to by social workers, paid carers, judges and other professionals working in family legal proceedings. Chad has fallen behind Afghanistan to reach the bottom of the rankings while Sierra Leone has the third worst result. The advocacy group\u2019s chairman, Marc Dullaert, told the Guardian the pandemic would have a dire impact: \u201cOur index shows that even before Covid-19, countries were not allocating sufficient budgets around the protection of child rights. Now we expect the economic consequences of the crisis to turn the clock back 10 years on the progress made around the wellbeing of children, unless governments take swift action.\u201d Countries are scored using UN data and evidence collected from the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child. They are assessed across five areas including health, education, and enabling an environment that promotes child rights. \u201cOverall, we see two big red flags in the findings this year,\u201d said Dullaert. One is lack of government funding around children\u2019s health, education and protection. The other is around the discrimination of children with more than a third of countries having the lowest possible score in this area. \u201cWe see in 91 of 182 countries that girls do not have the same rights as boys in terms of inheritance rights, access to education and equal treatment in legislation. It is not only in developing countries that there is a problem with discrimination.\u201d Italy ranked 15th in the index, up from 74, after being commended for adopting laws on cyberbullying and protecting children with disabilities. It was criticised for smear campaigns against organisations helping migrants. The index is not an absolute ranking of countries where children have the best life but nations are scored relative to their capacity to implement children\u2019s rights. \u201cOnce we take this into account, surprising rankings might occur,\u201d said Professor Karin Arts, of the International Institute of Social Studies, who was among those who compiled the data. \u201cExamples are the ultra-low scores of Australia (135), New Zealand (168) and the UK (169), and the high ranks of Thailand (8) and Tunisia (17),\u201d she said. Australia has dropped from 19 last year to 135 because of the poor treatment of refugee and migrant children, as well as Aboriginal young people who were found to be discriminated against in ways that affected their rights to education and health. Dullaert said: \u201cIt is really sad to see that recent welfare reforms have pushed more children into poverty in a rich country like the UK. We are also concerned about children in detention who, because of the indirect impact of Covid-19, are effectively in solitary confinement and have nearly no contact with family or the outside world.\u201d The Kidsrights Foundation said the fallout from measures taken by governments to reduce the spread of Covid-19 would have lasting effects on children globally. School closures in 188 countries affect 1.5 billion children, leaving them vulnerable to child labour, child marriage and teenage pregnancy. \u201cMillions of children were out of school for a long period and we see especially in developing countries that, even after the easing of lockdown, there is an enormous drop-off rate, with large numbers of children failing to return to school again,\u201d said Dullaert. \u201cAs with the Ebola crisis, this will result in more children being put into work and early marriages for girls.\u201d",

Especially with me being a past healthcare worker. He just showed complete disregard for the rules. The most ridiculous thing that sticks in my mind is how he did a 60-mile round trip to Barnard Castle with his wife and child in the car to test his eyesight. I wonder what the DVLA will think about that? I don\u2019t like that and I think Boris [Johnson] is a complete idiot for sticking by him.</p> <p>I\u2019ve got a grandchild we\u2019ve not seen since lockdown and he was only born on 1 January. I\u2019d love to be there and get hold of him, but we follow the rules, we do the right thing, we stay away. They said you shouldn\u2019t go to your second home, well me and my wife Jacqueline, a diabetes nurse, we were actually at our second home, a caravan up in Yorkshire, on the Sunday, the day before the lockdown, and they came around on the Sunday and asked people to leave. We\u2019ve not been able to go back and check on the caravan because it wouldn\u2019t be right to. Yet here\u2019s a guy who works for the government who can do whatever the hell he wants.</p> <p>To be perfectly honest, I\u2019ve never had much regard for him. His manner, his attitude, his dress. You wouldn\u2019t expect somebody to turn up at No 10 in bloody tracksuit bottoms and a T-shirt. What does that portray to the rest of the world?</p> <p>Our next-door neighbour but one died of Covid. He was cremated last week. He was the same age as me, 67. We used to share a desk at school. We were very close and yet we couldn\u2019t go to the crematorium \u2013 then you see someone like Dominic Cummings doing that kind of thing.</p> <p>I still think Boris is the right person at the moment and I don\u2019t like people trying to make political mileage about the crisis because we should all stick together. But Cummings should have fallen on his sword.</p> <h2>Catherine Guest, 60, retired cook</h2> <p>I think it is very silly that Dominic Cummings put other people at risk, as well as his own family. Especially given his position in government. It\u2019s a bit ridiculous. And yet it\u2019s what I expect now. People aren\u2019t sticking to the rules, are they heck. You should see what it\u2019s like around here, people meeting in the streets, playing football. They have no idea what it\u2019s like not being able to breathe. I do. I have emphysema and had throat cancer five or six years ago and had to have a tracheostomy so I know how scary it is, how frightening and painful to have your lungs fill up.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t left the house for 10 weeks, not once, since well before Boris Johnson announced lockdown. I\u2019ve not seen my grandchildren, nobody. I think Cummings should be made to pay. He shouldn\u2019t be able to get away with it. Mind you, nobody should.</p> <h2>Andrew Twentyman, 51, owns Twentymans pizzeria and bakery in Leigh</h2> <p>I\u2019m more annoyed with the BBC and newspaper reporters than I am with Dominic Cummings. I don\u2019t like people in close proximity at the best of times \u2013 we have screens up at the restaurant so that people can\u2019t get too close when they come in for takeaways. But the media have hounded him. The BBC in particular should be setting an example. I\u2019ve had to stop watching it. I watch RT now (Russia Today), and get news from all around the world instead.</p> <p>He should\u2019t have done it, should he? He\u2019s gone to Durham and he shouldn\u2019t have. I think his cocksure attitude and white shirt yesterday might have lost him a whole load of people. He\u2019s not sympathetic, is he? He doesn\u2019t do himself any favours. I do think Boris has lost some credibility. Cogs are turning in one direction and the masterplan has to continue in that direction. If Cummings is a key figure in that, then he\u2019s got to stay, but longterm he\u2019s got to go. You wouldn\u2019t want to get someone off your main board because they made a mistake if they are a key decision maker.</p> <h2>Declan Flannery, 24, works for gas company</h2> <p>I am not really bothered about what Dominic Cummings did. Maybe I had my Tory blinkers on, but the thing that wound me up was seeing all the reporters outside his house really close together. Pot, kettle, black springs to mind. I had his press conference on but I wasn\u2019t really listening to it because I was playing on my PlayStation, but I don\u2019t get people who say it\u2019s one rule for him and another for everyone else: people can go and see loved ones, they just have to stay apart. Did he come into contact with anyone when he went to Durham? I think it\u2019s ridiculous calling for him to resign, wishing for someone to lose their job for what is basically a mistake, isn\u2019t it?<br></p> <p><br></p>",

      "body": "<p>Perhaps on Sunday you watched the entire nation being lectured on what constitutes fatherly responsibility by Boris Johnson, a man who won\u2019t even say how many children he has, and leaves women to bring up an unspecified number of them. Perhaps on Monday you watched the Guardian\u2019s Rowena Mason being lectured in journalism by Johnson, a man sacked from a newspaper for fabricating quotes from his own godfather, and who blithely discussed helping a friend to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/14/black-eyes-boris-johnson-plot-attack-reporter-darius-guppy\">have another journalist beaten up</a>. Perhaps today, you heard Michael Gove tell LBC he has \u201con occasion\u201d driven a car to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7JO-mcIrH8\">check his eyesight.</a></p> <p>If you <em>did</em> see these things, I can only direct you to the slogan flyposted all over Paris during the 1968 civil unrest. \u201cDO NOT ADJUST YOUR MIND \u2013 THERE IS A FAULT WITH REALITY.\u201d The term \u201cgaslighting\u201d is much overused, but let\u2019s break the glass on it for the events of the past few days. As for \u201cindefensible\u201d\u2026 well, I don\u2019t think that word means <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3sLhnDJJn0\">what you thought</a> it meant.</p> <p>Anyway. I see the latest science Dominic Cummings knows more about than you is optometry. Half an hour late on Monday afternoon \u2013 like he\u2019s Mariah Carey and not some spad in inside-out pants \u2013 the Islington-dwelling humanities graduate took to Downing Street\u2019s rose garden. There, he delivered the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/i-think-i-behaved-reasonably-dominic-cummings-defends-actions-in-lockdown-row\">most preposterous address</a> to a nation since <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA7ty2LQwc0\">Tiger Woods stood in front of an audience</a>, including his mother, and apologised to his wife and sponsors. The difference is that Woods had a problem with cocktail waitresses, while Cummings fucks entire public health messages in the middle of a deadly pandemic. Also, he\u2019s not remotely sorry.</p> <p>By now, you may be dimly aware that his wife showing coronavirus symptoms saw Cummings first return to Downing Street, then embark on what we might call an Odyssean project: a heroic 260-mile quest all the way to County Durham, breaking the spirit and letter of lockdown rules he helped to write. I guess he just wanted to be a rule-maker, not a rule-taker. Then, he explained, he embarked on a 60-mile round trip to Barnard Castle, with his child in the car, to see if his eyes were so banjaxed that it was unsafe for him to drive. Which is \u2026 but no. I\u2019m sorry, I just can\u2019t with that one. Maybe later. Hopefully he\u2019s at least nuked his car insurance premium.</p> <p>Apologies for having to get tough with a guy who has always cultivated an image of himself as the Roy Keane of Westminster, even if that is like being the Clint Eastwood of the DVLA. But if Cummings and his wife didn\u2019t know what they\u2019d done was wrong, why would they choose to <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/getting-coronavirus-does-not-bring-clarity\">write a lengthy article last month</a> about their virus experience \u2013 full of personal family information \u2013 which omitted all of these dramas, all of these material facts. Or as Cummings addressed these questions of what is <a href=\"http://www.davidgorman.com/4quartets/1-norton.htm\">unredeemable in the rose garden</a>: \u201cI stress to people that they should not believe everything in the newspapers.\u201d And I stress to people that by far the most inaccurate account of the period in question was in the Spectator, bylined Mary Wakefield and Dominic Cummings.

He\u2019s certainly washing his hands of it all. All populists secretly hate their people, and Johnson is no different. But that \u201csecretly\u201d is key.

The thing about Johnson is that he desperately wanted to become prime minister, and he desperately wanted to have been prime minister. It\u2019s just the bit in between he struggles with.

      "bodyText": "Perhaps on Sunday you watched the entire nation being lectured on what constitutes fatherly responsibility by Boris Johnson, a man who won\u2019t even say how many children he has, and leaves women to bring up an unspecified number of them. Perhaps on Monday you watched the Guardian\u2019s Rowena Mason being lectured in journalism by Johnson, a man sacked from a newspaper for fabricating quotes from his own godfather, and who blithely discussed helping a friend to have another journalist beaten up. Perhaps today, you heard Michael Gove tell LBC he has \u201con occasion\u201d driven a car to check his eyesight. If you did see these things, I can only direct you to the slogan flyposted all over Paris during the 1968 civil unrest. \u201cDO NOT ADJUST YOUR MIND \u2013 THERE IS A FAULT WITH REALITY.\u201d The term \u201cgaslighting\u201d is much overused, but let\u2019s break the glass on it for the events of the past few days. As for \u201cindefensible\u201d\u2026 well, I don\u2019t think that word means what you thought it meant. Anyway. I see the latest science Dominic Cummings knows more about than you is optometry. Half an hour late on Monday afternoon \u2013 like he\u2019s Mariah Carey and not some spad in inside-out pants \u2013 the Islington-dwelling humanities graduate took to Downing Street\u2019s rose garden. There, he delivered the most preposterous address to a nation since Tiger Woods stood in front of an audience, including his mother, and apologised to his wife and sponsors. The difference is that Woods had a problem with cocktail waitresses, while Cummings fucks entire public health messages in the middle of a deadly pandemic. Also, he\u2019s not remotely sorry. By now, you may be dimly aware that his wife showing coronavirus symptoms saw Cummings first return to Downing Street, then embark on what we might call an Odyssean project: a heroic 260-mile quest all the way to County Durham, breaking the spirit and letter of lockdown rules he helped to write. I guess he just wanted to be a rule-maker, not a rule-taker. Then, he explained, he embarked on a 60-mile round trip to Barnard Castle, with his child in the car, to see if his eyes were so banjaxed that it was unsafe for him to drive. Which is \u2026 but no. I\u2019m sorry, I just can\u2019t with that one. Maybe later. Hopefully he\u2019s at least nuked his car insurance premium. Apologies for having to get tough with a guy who has always cultivated an image of himself as the Roy Keane of Westminster, even if that is like being the Clint Eastwood of the DVLA. But if Cummings and his wife didn\u2019t know what they\u2019d done was wrong, why would they choose to write a lengthy article last month about their virus experience \u2013 full of personal family information \u2013 which omitted all of these dramas, all of these material facts. Or as Cummings addressed these questions of what is unredeemable in the rose garden: \u201cI stress to people that they should not believe everything in the newspapers.\u201d And I stress to people that by far the most inaccurate account of the period in question was in the Spectator, bylined Mary Wakefield and Dominic Cummings. As for his querulous domestic exceptionalism, you\u2019d think they were the first parents ever to get properly ill in possession of children. Or child, in this case. God knows, it\u2019s not much fun. But, dare millions of us say, it is kind of what you sign up for \u2013 a reality not lost on the ICU nurse couple I heard on the radio, explaining about both of them being hard hit by Covid-19, and having to isolate with their own three children without help.

There\u2019s a pandemic on, remember?</p> <p><strong>So what would be the point of going to Barnard Castle?</strong> You can still have a lovely stroll through the town, or a dry cough by the river.</p> <p><strong>And it\u2019s only 30 minutes from Durham?</strong> That\u2019s all \u2013 a quick day trip, as well as a great rehearsal for a longer journey to somewhere more exciting.</p> <p><strong>Like where?</strong> Like London!</p> <p><strong>I don\u2019t think I should be making unnecessary car journeys just now. </strong>Yes, you carry on obeying the rules \u2013 they apply to you, after all.</p> <p><strong>They apply to everyone, don\u2019t they? </strong>It certainly can\u2019t hurt for you to believe that.</p> <p><strong>Sorry, but you\u2019re being really confusing and contradictory.</strong> I know \u2013 I\u2019m trying to reflect government policy in the wake of No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings\u2019 admission that he drove from Durham to Barnard Castle after he was spotted there by members of the public.</p> <p><strong>Why did he do that?</strong> He said he was testing to see if his eyesight was good enough to make it all the way to London.</p> <p><strong>He drove 60 miles to check that he could see well enough to drive?</strong> Yes, but the good news is: he could! </p> <p><strong>Should he not have gone to Specsavers?</strong> There\u2019s a branch in the town, but there\u2019s no evidence he dropped in. After his admission, TripAdvisor was deluged with spoof reviews for Barnard Castle, many purportedly from Cummings.</p> <p><strong>What did they say?</strong> They\u2019ve all been taken down now, because they \u201cdo not describe a firsthand experience\u201d.</p> <p><strong>At least non-firsthand reviews </strong><strong>can\u2019t be accused of </strong><strong>violat</strong><strong>ing either</strong><strong> the letter </strong><strong>or the spirit of the government\u2019s pandemic restrictions. </strong>True.</p> <p><strong>Is it wrong to say that I\u2019m furious, but that I also really want to see that automated</strong><strong> swan?</strong> I think your feelings mirror popular opinion in this case.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> \u201cRemember the rule \u2013 never apologise, over-explain.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t say:</strong> \u201cCome to Barnard Castle \u2013 if you can read the road signs to find it.\u201d</p>",

The castle itself is a popular tourist destination. I guess it\u2019s closed now, thanks to coronavirus. Yes, it is. Normally, there\u2019s plenty to see in Barnard Castle, if your eyesight is up to it. Such as? There\u2019s the Bowes Museum, which has an amazing silver swan automaton that preens itself. Is the museum open? Of course not. There\u2019s a pandemic on, remember? So what would be the point of going to Barnard Castle? You can still have a lovely stroll through the town, or a dry cough by the river. And it\u2019s only 30 minutes from Durham? That\u2019s all \u2013 a quick day trip, as well as a great rehearsal for a longer journey to somewhere more exciting. Like where? Like London! I don\u2019t think I should be making unnecessary car journeys just now. Yes, you carry on obeying the rules \u2013 they apply to you, after all. They apply to everyone, don\u2019t they? It certainly can\u2019t hurt for you to believe that. Sorry, but you\u2019re being really confusing and contradictory. I know \u2013 I\u2019m trying to reflect government policy in the wake of No 10 adviser Dominic Cummings\u2019 admission that he drove from Durham to Barnard Castle after he was spotted there by members of the public. Why did he do that? He said he was testing to see if his eyesight was good enough to make it all the way to London. He drove 60 miles to check that he could see well enough to drive? Yes, but the good news is: he could! Should he not have gone to Specsavers? There\u2019s a branch in the town, but there\u2019s no evidence he dropped in. After his admission, TripAdvisor was deluged with spoof reviews for Barnard Castle, many purportedly from Cummings. What did they say? They\u2019ve all been taken down now, because they \u201cdo not describe a firsthand experience\u201d. At least non-firsthand reviews can\u2019t be accused of violating either the letter or the spirit of the government\u2019s pandemic restrictions. True. Is it wrong to say that I\u2019m furious, but that I also really want to see that automated swan? I think your feelings mirror popular opinion in this case. Do say: \u201cRemember the rule \u2013 never apologise, over-explain.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cCome to Barnard Castle \u2013 if you can read the road signs to find it.\u201d",

Because of shielding we have not left the house or garden in the best part of eight weeks and all our fitness and health has suffered because of it.\u201d Moore believes shielding will end up lasting longer than the original planned three months and says provision is going to be needed to support disabled people through it. \u201cThe ability to exercise and the mental need for space and fresh air has been deemed essential for the general population from day one, but what about the shielded?\u201d In Bristol, Milner thinks the government should start to develop measures to help \u2013 such as mandating an hour in which only people who are shielding can go outside, which other countries are modelling. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see other people have more freedom, which effectively means the world will move on without us,\u201d she says. \u201cBoris Johnson didn\u2019t mention us in his speech at all. It feels like I\u2019m an afterthought.\u201d Additional reporting by Paul Campbell *Some names have been changed",

Hayley Turner was also expected to take part, a year after finally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/10/hayley-turner-ascot-shergar-cup-top-jockey-horse-racing-tips\">winning the Silver Saddle</a> for top rider at the meeting, which she described as \u201ca massive thrill\u201d.</p> \n<p>While Ascot hope to press ahead with the Royal meeting behind closed doors next month, the Shergar Cup would be much less likely to succeed in such a format, even if an appropriate collection of jockeys could be assembled.</p> \n<p>Its appeal is mainly to those present in the grandstands; purist followers of the sport have not warmed to it in great numbers, while its programme of 10-runner handicaps featuring unfamiliar riders means it is of only limited appeal to punters.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m absolutely gutted,\u201d Turner said. \u201cI understand why it has to be this way but the Shergar Cup is always the highlight of the year for me. It\u2019s good fun and it\u2019s nice to get together with the international riders. But we can\u2019t grumble, can we?

      "bodyText": "This year\u2019s Shergar Cup, the competition involving jockeys representing regions of the world along with an international women\u2019s team, has had to be cancelled. The Ascot event, scheduled for its usual early-August slot, was perhaps the race day most vulnerable to the coronavirus crisis, since it requires the presence of jockeys drawn from all around the world performing in front of a family-based crowd of up to 30,000. Nick Smith, Ascot\u2019s director of racing, said: \u201cRegrettably, given the complexities of flying jockeys around the world and uncertainty over what governmental regulations will be in place at the time, the Shergar Cup won\u2019t take place this year.\u201d Guy Henderson, Ascot\u2019s chief executive, added: \u201cWe decided that this event, even if logistically possible, wouldn\u2019t be the same without crowds and that the best option was to plan ahead to return with the event in 2021.\u201d Ascot will work with the British Horseracing Authority to devise a replacement programme of races for the day. The event would have featured the return to Ascot of Emma-Jayne Wilson, the swaggering Canadian rider whose cheerful volubility made her a crowd favourite and a staple at the event for several years until her most recent appearance in 2017. Hayley Turner was also expected to take part, a year after finally winning the Silver Saddle for top rider at the meeting, which she described as \u201ca massive thrill\u201d. While Ascot hope to press ahead with the Royal meeting behind closed doors next month, the Shergar Cup would be much less likely to succeed in such a format, even if an appropriate collection of jockeys could be assembled. Its appeal is mainly to those present in the grandstands; purist followers of the sport have not warmed to it in great numbers, while its programme of 10-runner handicaps featuring unfamiliar riders means it is of only limited appeal to punters. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely gutted,\u201d Turner said. \u201cI understand why it has to be this way but the Shergar Cup is always the highlight of the year for me. It\u2019s good fun and it\u2019s nice to get together with the international riders. But we can\u2019t grumble, can we? There\u2019s a lot worse things going on.\u201d Meanwhile, Andrew Balding has enthused about the Qipco 2,000 Guineas prospects of Kameko, fourth in the betting for the Classic a week on Saturday. Balding sent his stable star, a Group One winner when last seen in November, to Kempton for a gallop last week and liked what he saw. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier with him,\u201d the Hampshire trainer said on Tuesday. \u201cHe had a gallop at Kempton last week and Oisin [Murphy] rode him. He looks magnificent. He\u2019s a lovely horse to have anything to do with and we\u2019re all very excited.\u201d Murphy had also been \u201creally pleased\u201d with the colt. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do anything silly. It was important that he went away and had a good blowout but nothing too crazy. He has a lovely turn of foot, as we all saw last year, but he\u2019s also very relaxed and you can put him anywhere [in a race]. From a jockey\u2019s point of view, that\u2019s exciting.

You just hope one horse has improved more than the other from two years to three.\u201d Balding added that soft ground would be a concern for Kameko but weeks of dry weather in Newmarket makes that seem a remote possibility for now. Wednesday\u2019s best bets An all-dirt card at Sha Tin is something new as The Guardian continues to learn about Hong Kong racing. Fans of Joao Moreira will be disappointed to learn that he\u2019s suspended, so his title rival, Zac Purton, is gifted this chance to build a lead. Purton has a fair chance in the opener on Coolceleb (11.45) and the pair scored in July the only previous time they combined on this dirt track. Coolceleb is available at 5-1 because the market is excited by Winning Brew, who has some run some excellent trials but is still likely to benefit from this introduction to racing. The ex-John Gosden Kings Shield (1.15), fifth in the St James\u2019s Palace a couple of years ago, has a clear chance on a track where his form figures are 124. He beat Buddies handily last June and again when they were placed in April, but is better off at the weights with that rival because of a turf success by Buddies a fornight ago.

The FTSE 100 edged towards highs last seen at the end of April. Travel stocks had a notable rally as lockdowns eased and Germany agreed to a \u20ac9bn bailout for airline Lufthansa. Traders returned to the NYSE trading floor today for a partial re-opening of one of the last remaining open outcry floors in the business. Extra precautions include temperature checks, masks and only 25% of regular traders coming back to the site. The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane has said that the central bank is not even remotely close to making a decision on whether to cut rates below zero. The CBI retail survey out this morning showed that retail sales volumes remained \u201cdeeply depressed\u201d in the year to May The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has said that more airlines may fail due to an increase in debt taken on during the Covid-19 crisis. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow from 8am. Stay safe. -KM The John Lewis Partnership is the latest retailer to confirm when it will open its doors, following the UK government\u2019s planned easing of lockdown measures on non-essential retailers over the coming weeks. John Lewis said its department stores will re-open from 15 June on a \u201cphased basis\u201d. Meanwhile, clothing retailer Next said it will re-open 25 stores on 15 June. It\u2019s just a fraction of the 500 stores that it usually trades from across the UK and Ireland, which shut on 23 March. Investors will be cautiously celebrating another milestone this morning on Wall Street. The S&amp;P 500 has pushed above 3,000 points and is also above the 200-day moving average for the first time since 5 March this year, according to Reuters. Traders have officially re-entered the physical trading floor at the New York Stock Exchange this afternoon(albeit with precautions) after staying away for two months during the global pandemic. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo rang the opening bell, in what would have looked like an apocalyptic scene less than six months ago Meanwhile, major US indices jumped at the open: Nasdaq is up 1.8% S&amp;P 500 is up 2.1% Dow Jones is up 2.4% Here were some of the scenes around the New York Stock Exchange this morning as traders prepared to enter the live trading floor for the first time in two months. Checking back in with European shares, the FTSE 100 has pared some of its gains but is still up around 1.1% at 6,060 points. The more domestically-focused FTSE 250 is rallying, up around 3.2%, with TUI up a whopping 45%. Like the blue chip index, the FTSE 250 is edging closer to intraday highs last seen at the end of April. On the continent, the French Cac 40 is up 1.2% while the German DDax is up 0.9%. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB is up 1.5%. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has said that more airlines may fail due to an increase in debt taken on during the Covid-19 crisis. The organisation said that airlines will exit the crisis with around $120bn worth of debt and only around $30bn in new equity. In total, it said governments worldwide have given $123m in support to airlines during this period, mainly in the US and western Europe. However, it took a swipe at some government travel restrictions, saying that tit-for-tat quarantine measures are unacceptable and that border measures should be driven by science, Reuters reported. The travel industry has hit out at measures introduced by the UK, which will require incoming travellers to quarantine for 14 days or face a \u00a31000 fine. With just over an hour to the US open, futures suggest American stocks will extend the gains seen across Asia and Europe today: Dow Jones futures are up 1.9% S&amp;P 500 futures are up 1.7% Nasdaq futures are up 1.5% We now have the official response from McLaren on those 1,200 job cuts. The company says that it has been \u201cseverely affected by the current pandemic\u201d and that the cancellation of motorsport events, suspension of manufacturing and retail, and a drop in demand for tech have impacted its revenue streams. Executive chairman Paul Walsh added that: It is a course of action we have worked hard to avoid, having already undertaken dramatic cost-saving measures across all areas of the business. But we now have no other choice but to reduce the size of our workforce. This is undoubtedly a challenging time for our company, and particularly our people, but we plan to emerge as an efficient, sustainable business with a clear course for returning to growth. The peri-peri restaurant chain Nando\u2019s has today announced the reopening of 54 restaurants for delivery and click and collection across the UK and Ireland, with 40 more due to reopen tomorrow. All delivery orders placed through the Nando\u2019s website can earn \u2018chillies\u2019, or reward points, through Nando\u2019s loyalty scheme which can be redeemed when the restaurants open their doors for a full dine-in service later in the year. The menu will be reduced to help the team maintain social distancing in the kitchen and food preparation areas, but Nando\u2019s favourites such as peri-peri chicken wings, butterfly chicken, halloumi sticks and peri-peri chips will now be available to enjoy at home. Each restaurant is working under strict government guidelines on top of existing health and safety procedures, Nando\u2019s said. Every member of the team has been washing their hands more frequently and PPE is available for all staff to wear. Designated waiting areas have been set up for drivers and collect customers and order volumes will be monitored to avoid queues building up. The full list of restaurants reopening is here. Supercar maker McLaren is set to cut 1,200 jobs or around 25% of its 4,000-strong workforce, according to Sky News. The Surrey-based company is expected to partially blame the F1 cost cap for prompting its restructuring plans, which come as the firm tries to raise \u00a3275m from investors. McLaren\u2019s executive chairman Paul Walsh said it was \u201cundoubtedly a challenging time for our company, and particularly our people, but especially those whose jobs may be affected\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between [takeaway] delivery and going to a restaurant, where you can look at the menu and talk to the waiter about the specials,\u201d floor trader Steve Grasso told the Washington Post last month. \u201cYou get your food either way. But you get an inferior experience if you don\u2019t go to the restaurant.\u201d My colleague Simon Goodley dives into the significance of the NYSE\u2019s trading floor re-opening today. You can read more here: The New York Stock Exchange will re-open its trading floor this afternoon after closing for nearly two months due to the Covid-19 outbreak. However, the return of open outcry trading at the NYSE will not be business as usual. Safety concerns mean only 25% of the normal numbers of brokers will be back on the floor, and they will have to wear masks and follow strict physical distancing rules. Everyone on the trading floor has also been told to avoid public transport. All visitors will also be screened and and have their temperatures taken as they enter the building. Those that don\u2019t pass won\u2019t be allowed to enter until they they test negative for Covid-19 or self quarantine under federal guidelines. There will also be a daily cleaning and sanitisation schedule across the trading floor. A few more points to highlight from the CBI retail survey: On jobs: 53% of retailers have temporarily laid off staff, an increase from April The proportion of job cuts remained unchanged at 8%, but headcount is expected to fall at a similar pace next month Overall employment growth dropped at the fastest pace in a decade in the year to May On supply disruptions worsening since April: 58% reported shortages of some goods 64% reported increased cost pressures 44% reported shipping delays CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said: The retail sector is at the sharp end of a crisis, with many businesses up against it. The government\u2019s support packages are making a real difference, with more shops reporting that jobs have been furloughed, rather than lost. The furlough system will need to adapt as more businesses open their doors in the months ahead. As we gradually reopen the economy, retailers may yet need more support from the government if demand falters. Ensuring safety in the workplace remains the top priority, as more firms look to bring staff back to work. Many challenges remain in managing supply chains and costs in a tough environment. Dataflash: The CBI retail survey out this morning shows that retail sales volumes remained \u201cdeeply depressed\u201d in the year to May with a balance of -50%. However, that is a slightly slower decline than in April, when volumes fell to -55%. Volumes are also expected to fall at a slightly slower, \u201cbut historically fast\u201d pace next month, the survey showed. Some other findings include: The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane has said that the central bank is not even remotely close to making a decision on whether to cut rates below zero. Speaking as part of a webinar organised by the Confederation of British Industry, he explained that the Bank would have to take key issues into consideration, including the consequences on the financial sector (with banks relying on income from interest) and confidence in the economy. Haldane also said that the UK economy likely shrank by more than 20% in the second quarter, but that data was coming in just a shade better than the Bank of England scenario, according to Reuters. He pointed to surveys showing some stabilisation and a very modest recovery in spending and business sentiment, yet warned that there would be a period of prolonged caution by individuals and companies coming out of the lockdown. Newsflash: Accounting watchdog the Financial Reporting Council has launched an investigation into KPMG and PwC over the audits of haulage firm Eddie Stobart. The FRC said it was linked to audits for the years ending 30 November 2017 (conducted by KPMG) and 30 November 2018 (which were done by PwC). The investigations will be led by the FRC\u2019s Enforcement Division under the Audit Enforcement Procedure, it added. Last summer, Eddie Stobart shares were suspended trading of its shares after an accounting investigation found its profits were overstated by \u00a32m in 2018. Months later, it was bailed out by its former owners, saving it from potential bankruptcy right before Christmas. US futures are pointing to another strong start for stocks on Wall Street. Most notably, S&amp;P 500 futures are up 1.8% and pushing above 3,000 points for the first time since early March. Confirming reports out yesterday, luxury carmaker Aston Martin said this morning that it had sacked CEO Andy Palmer as part of a wider board overhaul. It follows collapse in its share price and a slump in sales due to the coronavirus pandemic. My colleague Joanna Partridge reports: Palmer\u2019s replacement, Tobias Moers, will join on 1 August from Mercedes-AMG, where he is currently the boss of the German carmaker\u2019s high-performance division. Palmer had served as Aston Martin\u2019s chief executive since 2014, and the company confirmed his departure following reports over the weekend. Palmer left the company, James Bond\u2019s favourite car marque, on Monday. The company\u2019s share price collapsed 98% from its \u00a319 float price in October 2018 to just 35p on Friday, giving it a market value of about \u00a3540m, compared with \u00a34bn when it floated. Shares jumped 27% to 45p on Tuesday after Palmer\u2019s departure was announced. Newsflash: Singapore has unveiled its fourth economic stimulus package in response to the Covid-19 crisis this morning. The package is worth 33bn Singapore dollars (about \u00a319bn), bringing the total stimulus to 100bn Singapore dollars which represents around 20% of the island nation\u2019s GDP. The announcement, unveiled by Singapore\u2019s finance minister Heng Swee Keat came just hours after the release of its Q1 GDP figures (which weren\u2019t as bad as expected) and full year 2020 forecasts. The country is now expecting the economy to contract between -4% to -7% compared to earlier forecasts of a -1% or -4% drop. The money is part of what Singapore is dubbed the \u201cFortitude Budget\u201d. Consumer stocks have also been boosted by Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s announcement yesterday that non-essential retailers will start re-opening over the coming weeks. As my colleague Rowena Mason reports, outdoor markets and car showrooms will be allowed to reopen in England from Monday next week, while other non-essential retail premises will be allowed to open in three weeks\u2019 time. The prime minister set out a timeline for the reopening of outdoor retail settings first from 1 June, saying the risk of transmission of the virus was lower in open spaces. High street shops, department stores and shopping centres will all be allowed to open from 15 June as long as they can show they are \u201cCovid secure\u201d, he added. You can read the full story here: Consumer and travel stocks are surging ahead in Europe, and are among the best performers on the FTSE 100 this morning. Investors seem to be warming back up to companies like British Airways owner IAG and cruise ship operator Carnival, following news that Germany had agreed to a \u20ac9bn bailout for airline Lufthansa. Here are the biggest risers on the London index: Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says the Lufthansa bailout is likely to come with string attached, but that won\u2019t stop bosses like Ryanair\u2019s Michael O\u2019Leary from crying foul over the deal: The deal still needs to get the nod from the European Commission, who might impose a number of conditions in return for its approval, including the surrender of key flight slots. These types of rescue usually come with strings attached as UK bank Royal Bank of Scotland found when it was bailed out by the UK government in 2008. The bank was forced to sell a number of assets at fire sale prices including Worldpay, Direct Line, as well as spending years to try and sell off Williams and Glyns branches at a significant cost. The EU Commission will certainly feel the heat from Ryanair CEO Michael O\u2019Leary if they do wave this bailout through without extracting a heavy price from Lufthansa, which has been badly run for several years now. The FTSE 100 is pushing ahead at 6,130 points. If it manages to hold above these levels we will reach a one-month high at the close. But with 4:30pm still a long way off, we\u2019ll have to stick to intra-day levels, which were still higher at 6,151 points on 30 April. With the FTSE 100 trading at around 6,107 points, the blue chip index is nearing a one-month high. (The previous high came on 29 April when the FTSE 100 rose above the 6,115 mark) However, we\u2019re still a long way off before we get anywhere close to pre-Covid levels: And, we\u2019re off! Major indices across Europe are all higher as markets open for trading: FTSE 100 up 2.1% French Cac 40 up 1.2% Spain\u2019s IBEX up 1.3% Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB up 1.1% Asian and Australian stocks have set the tone for a strong start in Europe: Japan\u2019s Nikkei up 2.5% Australia\u2019s ASX up 2% Shanghai\u2019s SSE Composite up 0.9% Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. UK and US stock markets are back in action today after being closed for the bank holiday Monday. Major indices in both countries are expected to rise, taking their cue from Asia where stocks are climbing thanks to the easing of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions across the world and some better-than-expected economic data out of Singapore. Singapore reported a 0.7% contraction in first quarter GDP compared to a year ago, which was better than preliminary estimates of a 2.2% drop. Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at AxiCorp, explains: Singapore is among the world\u2019s most open economies and is viewed as a bellwether on the economic front. And while the market was positioning for more pain, the GDP contraction was much less than expected. It will be received quite favourably in the global context since Singapore\u2019s economy is only now emerging from lockdown status. In Europe, the German Dax and French Cac 40 are expected to log further gains after a strong start to the week on Monday. They were helped news of a rescue package for German airline Lufthansa and a potential lifeline for French carmaker Renault, but were also buoyed by further relaxing of lockdown measures across Europe. It seems as if investors are ignoring some of the unrest that erupted in Hong Kong over the weekend over Beijing\u2019s plan to impose national security laws on the semi-autonomous region - at least for now. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: Asia markets have continued in this vein, rising sharply on reports that Japan is also easing its remaining emergency measures, while news that American firm Novavax is set to start its first human studies of its experimental coronavirus vaccine also provided a boost. With UK markets set to play catch-up this morning we can expect to see a very strong open for the FTSE100, with other markets in Europe also set to open higher and build on the gains made yesterday.

      "body": "<p>During his rose garden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-refuses-to-resign-or-apologise-for-lockdown-breach\">press conference</a>, Dominic Cummings was asked if his trip to Durham had undermined government public health messaging. I hope not, he replied. Later, Boris Johnson was asked the same question. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/25/boris-johnson-says-people-should-make-up-own-minds-on-dominic-cummings-video\">His response</a> was more definitive: no one in No 10 has undermined the messaging. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/26/dominic-cummings-coronavirus-scientific-boris-johnson-adviser-game-theory\">I hope they are right</a>. For this matters. If people stop listening to what the government asks them to do and if they stop adhering to coronavirus measures then the number of infections will rise and more people will die.</p> <p>But I cannot be as certain or as optimistic as the prime minister and his adviser. All that we know about adherence (knowledge that behavioural scientists have <a href=\"https://jech.bmj.com/content/jech/early/2020/05/12/jech-2020-214290.full.pdf\">repeatedly stressed</a> to the government during the pandemic) suggests that damage has been done.</p> <p>First, for all the complexities of Cummings\u2019 story, the bottom line is very simple. While millions of people up and down the land faced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/24/lockdown-missed-brothers-funeral-dominic-cummings-ashamed\">agonising personal circumstances</a> and decided to stick with lockdown, Cummings did not. He went to Durham at the very time his government was insisting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/boris-johnson-orders-uk-lockdown-to-be-enforced-by-police\">\u201cstay at home, don\u2019t travel</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/boris-johnson-orders-uk-lockdown-to-be-enforced-by-police\">\u201d</a>. He went to a beauty spot at the very time his government was insisting we avoid them. And nothing has happened to him. Instead, his actions have been endorsed. At the very least, that gives the appearance of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/24/dominic-cummings-coronavirus-covid-19-stay-at-home\">\u201cone rule for them, another for us\u201d</a> (possibly the best way of corroding trust in authority and adherence to the rules). And Cummings more than anyone else understands the importance of appearance in politics.</p> <p>Second, the one thing that has carried us through the pandemic so far has been an emergent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/community-spirit-when-it-matters-most\">sense of community</a>. This \u201cwe\u201d feeling <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/lockdown-social-norms/\">has been critical</a> in getting people to adhere to the restrictions, even when they personally were not at risk. It has been critical to all the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/26/uk-volunteering-coronavirus-crisis-community-lockdown\">volunteering and neighbourhood support</a> that has helped us through hardship. It is the most valuable asset we have in a crisis. But the most notable thing about Cummings\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/the-guardian-view-on-dominic-cummings-time-to-go\">rose garden performance</a> was that \u201cwe\u201d was nowhere to be found. It was all about \u201cI\u201d.</p> <p>His explanation was entirely about his judgments as an individual, his decisions, his personal concerns. At no point was there any thought to the impact of his actions on others. Still worse, in his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/boris-johnson-defence-dominic-cummings-anger-from-allies-and-opponents-alike\">defence of Cummings on Sunday</a>, the prime minister seemed to endorse the idea that, when the going gets tough, it is fine to rely on your own judgments \u2013 and fine to follow your individual \u201cinstincts\u201d.</p> <p>In effect, Johnson\u2019s defence of Cummings turned an issue of communal responsibility into an issue of individual preference. Had everyone done that \u2013 had we all put so much energy into thinking about loopholes that served our personal circumstances rather than thinking about the impact of our actions on others \u2013 then lockdown would not have worked, the infection would still be raging and the NHS would have been overwhelmed.</p> <p>As we come out of lockdown these issues become, if anything, <a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/policy-institute/assets/Coronavirus-in-the-UK-cluster-analysis.pdf\">even more important</a>. It isn\u2019t that the infection has gone away. Rather we are now in a position, due to past sacrifices by the many, to use more targeted strategies against coronavirus. But these are dependent on us all maintaining physical distancing, increasing hygiene standards, revealing our contacts if infected and observing quarantine if contacted.

      "bodyText": "During his rose garden press conference, Dominic Cummings was asked if his trip to Durham had undermined government public health messaging. I hope not, he replied. Later, Boris Johnson was asked the same question. His response was more definitive: no one in No 10 has undermined the messaging. I hope they are right. For this matters. If people stop listening to what the government asks them to do and if they stop adhering to coronavirus measures then the number of infections will rise and more people will die. But I cannot be as certain or as optimistic as the prime minister and his adviser. All that we know about adherence (knowledge that behavioural scientists have repeatedly stressed to the government during the pandemic) suggests that damage has been done. First, for all the complexities of Cummings\u2019 story, the bottom line is very simple. While millions of people up and down the land faced agonising personal circumstances and decided to stick with lockdown, Cummings did not. He went to Durham at the very time his government was insisting \u201cstay at home, don\u2019t travel\u201d. He went to a beauty spot at the very time his government was insisting we avoid them. And nothing has happened to him. Instead, his actions have been endorsed. At the very least, that gives the appearance of \u201cone rule for them, another for us\u201d (possibly the best way of corroding trust in authority and adherence to the rules). And Cummings more than anyone else understands the importance of appearance in politics. Second, the one thing that has carried us through the pandemic so far has been an emergent sense of community. This \u201cwe\u201d feeling has been critical in getting people to adhere to the restrictions, even when they personally were not at risk. It has been critical to all the volunteering and neighbourhood support that has helped us through hardship. It is the most valuable asset we have in a crisis. But the most notable thing about Cummings\u2019 rose garden performance was that \u201cwe\u201d was nowhere to be found. It was all about \u201cI\u201d. His explanation was entirely about his judgments as an individual, his decisions, his personal concerns. At no point was there any thought to the impact of his actions on others. Still worse, in his defence of Cummings on Sunday, the prime minister seemed to endorse the idea that, when the going gets tough, it is fine to rely on your own judgments \u2013 and fine to follow your individual \u201cinstincts\u201d. In effect, Johnson\u2019s defence of Cummings turned an issue of communal responsibility into an issue of individual preference. Had everyone done that \u2013 had we all put so much energy into thinking about loopholes that served our personal circumstances rather than thinking about the impact of our actions on others \u2013 then lockdown would not have worked, the infection would still be raging and the NHS would have been overwhelmed. As we come out of lockdown these issues become, if anything, even more important. It isn\u2019t that the infection has gone away. Rather we are now in a position, due to past sacrifices by the many, to use more targeted strategies against coronavirus. But these are dependent on us all maintaining physical distancing, increasing hygiene standards, revealing our contacts if infected and observing quarantine if contacted. All of these measures are personally inconvenient. Often it will be easier to ignore them. They will only work if we continue to act together and for each other. I hope this will happen. I hope people will continue to demonstrate the remarkable solidarity they have shown so far. I hope the collective spirit won\u2019t be damaged. But this sorry affair doesn\u2019t help, and the more they defend themselves, the more our top politician and his top adviser demonstrate that they don\u2019t even appreciate what the problems are. \u2022 Stephen Reicher is a member of the Sage subcommittee advising on behavioural science, an adviser to the UK and Scottish governments on coronavirus and professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews",

Just as the US has prioritised the rallying call of \u201cfreedom\u201d over common sense gun control, it looks set to prioritise \u201cfreedom\u201d over public health. Looking at images from the crowded pool parties in Missouri over the weekend, looking at Trump\u2019s calls for schools to reopen \u201cASAP\u201d, it seems as if that is exactly what\u2019s happening. But here\u2019s the thing the US might soon find out about its highly individualistic freedom fetish: it doesn\u2019t travel well.",

Many of us, including myself, have lost people in our lives and haven\u2019t been able to see family and friends. It\u2019s been incredibly tough for everyone \u2026</p> \n<p>\u201cAlthough I believe his [Cummings\u2019] actions were motivated by a father\u2019s desire to do what he felt was necessary to protect his family in exceptional circumstances, if placed in the same situation I wouldn\u2019t have made the same decisions and would have since considered my position.\u201d</p> \n<p>And Jupp\u2019s Tory colleague William Wragg, who chairs parliament\u2019s public administration and constitutional affairs select committee, tweeted: \u201cWe cannot throw away valuable public and political good will any longer. It\u2019s humiliating and degrading to their office to see ministers put out agreed lines in defence of an adviser. This is a time of national emergency and our focus must be unrelenting. We owe it to the nation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, said he thought Johnson should order an independent investigation into Cummings\u2019 conduct.</p> \n<p>The Tory backbencher Peter Bone told the Guardian he still believed Cummings should resign. \u201cThe rose garden interview just confirmed to me that he had driven up to Durham when we were in a strict lockdown. He absolutely should resign,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have 400 emails from people and I\u2019m sitting here with my colleague going through every one, and we\u2019d rather be doing some case work but we just have so many people to reply to.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think more ministers will resign. None of this is organised. This is individual MPs making up their own minds. There\u2019s no orchestration \u2013 this is MPs looking at their constituents\u2019 comments and deciding what to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>Another Tory MP said they expected more junior ministers to quit over Cummings\u2019 lockdown breaches.</p> \n<p>\u201cI would expect it to happen because MPs are being asked to defend something they know is wrong and they still don\u2019t know the full facts on. I fully expect more people to stand down. A lot of cabinet ministers owe their jobs to Dominic Cummings but I would expect to see people resign at the junior minister level,\u201d they said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe pressure from constituents is immense and Douglas Ross\u2019s resignation is very understandable given how thin his majority is, and it\u2019s the same in England and in the red wall in particular.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, Johnson has rallied behind his senior aide \u2013 a key architect of Brexit and the prime minister\u2019s election victory \u2013 and marshalled top cabinet ministers, including Rishi Sunak and Matt Hancock, to do the same.</p> \n<p>Michael Gove, a Cabinet Office minister, insisted on Tuesday that \u201cfair-minded people\u201d would have to make up their own minds.</p> \n<p>The longtime ally of Cummings was sent out to defend him in broadcast interviews the day after the aide gave a statement explaining why he drove 264 miles from London to Durham during the lockdown and risked spreading coronavirus.Police, medics and scientists continued to say that Cummings\u2019 actions risked undermining the lockdown and public health advice.</p> \n<p>Sir Peter Fahy, the former chief constable of Greater Manchester police, said officers were frustrated by the case, which made it difficult to see the future role of the police in controlling lockdown.</p> \n<p>He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of confusion and it feels like there\u2019s quite a gap between the public narrative and narrative of ministers about the lockdown and what\u2019s happening on the street.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s quite hard to see the role the police have in the future \u2013 the rules about the reasons for travel are now very confused, when you see the crowds on Bournemouth and Southend beaches and other places yesterday, it\u2019s hard to see what role the police have in trying to control that.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Niall Dickson, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS organisations, told the same programme: \u201cBecause of the way this story has unfolded there is certainly concern among our members, health leaders, that it could damage staff and public confidence in official guidance.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-press-conference-leaves-questions-unanswered\">Key contradictions about Cummings\u2019</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-press-conference-leaves-questions-unanswered\"> story remain</a>, with Gove pressed to explain how the government can continue to claim that the adviser acted within the rules.</p> \n<p>In a round of broadcast interviews, Gove was asked:</p> \n<p>\u2022 Why Cummings went back to work in No 10 after suspecting that his wife could have contracted coronavirus, risking spreading the virus further among colleagues. Gove said she was unwell but did not have official coronavirus symptoms of a cough or fever at that time.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Why the aide decided that same night to drive 264 miles to Durham to stay on his parents\u2019 estate because of concerns that he and his wife had coronavirus, despite government instructions to self-isolate at home. Gove said he had been acting out of concern that they would be unable to care for their child, despite neither of them having classic coronavirus symptoms at that point.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Whether it was acceptable for them to have risked spreading coronavirus from the hotspot of London to rural Durham where there were few cases, given their son later needed hospital treatment in the north-east. Gove said his actions had been appropriate.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Why people should accept his explanation that he needed to make a 60-mile round trip to a beauty spot with his family to test his eyesight before travelling back to London. Gove said it was safe for him to have driven and that Cummings had been \u201cpreparing for work\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Why the aide needed to seek help with possible backup childcare in the north-east when long-time friends in London could have helped, including Gove himself. Gove said he would not have expected Cummings to have turned to him instead of close family.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"71e506b5-3441-4d9e-906a-bd28c6d42d2d\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/irRjqXe9Epg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Tory MPs suggesting Cummings should go</strong></p> \n<h2>S<strong>ince </strong><strong>Monday\u2019s press conference (24):</strong></h2> \n<p>Douglas Ross<br>Harriett Baldwin<br>Roger Gale<br>Martin Vickers<br>Peter Bone<br>Robert Goodwill<br>Paul Maynard<br>Mark Pawsey<br>Robert Syms<br>Tim Loughton<br>Jason McCartney<br>Peter Aldous<br>John Stevenson<br>Caroline Nokes<br>Damian Colins<br>Philip Davies<br>Julian Sturdy<br>Alec Shelbrooke<br>Mark Harper<br>William Wragg<br>Stephen Hammond<br>Simon Hoare<br>Simon Jupp</p> \n<p><strong>Before </strong><strong>Monday\u2019s press conference (7):<br></strong>George Freeman<br>Andrew Jones<br>David Warburton<br>James Gray<br>Craig Whittaker<br>Steve Baker</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Conservative revolt over Dominic Cummings\u2019 decision to drive across England during the lockdown has grown, as a government minister resigned and the leader of the Scottish Tories joined 24 Conservative MPs in calling for Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser to consider his position. Douglas Ross, the MP for Moray, stepped down as a Scotland Office minister, saying he accepted Cummings felt he had acted in the best interests of his family when fearing he had coronavirus but these were \u201cdecisions others felt were not available to them\u201d. \u201cWhile the intentions may have been well meaning, the reaction to this news shows that Mr Cummings\u2019 interpretation of the government advice was not shared by the vast majority of people who have done as the government asked,\u201d he said on Tuesday. \u201cI have constituents who didn\u2019t get to say goodbye to loved ones; families who could not mourn together; people who didn\u2019t visit sick relatives because they followed the guidance of the government. I cannot in good faith tell them they were all wrong and one senior adviser to the government was right.\u201d In a sign of growing unrest among Tories in Scotland, Jackson Carlaw, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, told the BBC Cummings should consider his position. The developments deepened the crisis engulfing No 10, with at least 24 backbench Tory MPs calling on Cummings to resign because of his actions and the damage to the government following his attempt to explain himself on Monday. A further seven Conservatives MPs previously suggested over the bank holiday weekend that he should resign but have not made clear whether his press conference from the Downing Street rose garden was enough to change that view. Tory MPs began to speak out as initial polling suggested public support has drained away from Johnson because of his backing for Cummings. A SavantaComRes survey showed the prime minister\u2019s net approval rating had fallen 20 points, down from 19 to -1, over the course of four days during the Cummings crisis. Polling for YouGov found 71% of people said Cummings did break lockdown rules, slightly up from 68% when asked on Saturday. It found this was the majority view across voters from all major parties and among both leavers and remainers. Among those to break their silence on Tuesday to call for Cummings to go were Harriett Baldwin, a former Treasury minister, Mark Harper, a former chief whip, and Stephen Hammond, a former transport minister. One of the new intake of MPs, Simon Jupp, also went public on Tuesday, saying he felt \u201canger, disappointment and frustration\u201d at Cummings\u2019 actions and that the adviser should resign. The MP for East Devon, wrote on his Facebook page: \u201cWe are all making significant sacrifices and coping with situations we couldn\u2019t imagine just a few months ago. Many of us, including myself, have lost people in our lives and haven\u2019t been able to see family and friends. It\u2019s been incredibly tough for everyone \u2026 \u201cAlthough I believe his [Cummings\u2019] actions were motivated by a father\u2019s desire to do what he felt was necessary to protect his family in exceptional circumstances, if placed in the same situation I wouldn\u2019t have made the same decisions and would have since considered my position.\u201d And Jupp\u2019s Tory colleague William Wragg, who chairs parliament\u2019s public administration and constitutional affairs select committee, tweeted: \u201cWe cannot throw away valuable public and political good will any longer. It\u2019s humiliating and degrading to their office to see ministers put out agreed lines in defence of an adviser. This is a time of national emergency and our focus must be unrelenting. We owe it to the nation.\u201d Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, said he thought Johnson should order an independent investigation into Cummings\u2019 conduct. The Tory backbencher Peter Bone told the Guardian he still believed Cummings should resign. \u201cThe rose garden interview just confirmed to me that he had driven up to Durham when we were in a strict lockdown. He absolutely should resign,\u201d he said. \u201cI have 400 emails from people and I\u2019m sitting here with my colleague going through every one, and we\u2019d rather be doing some case work but we just have so many people to reply to. \u201cI think more ministers will resign. None of this is organised. This is individual MPs making up their own minds. There\u2019s no orchestration \u2013 this is MPs looking at their constituents\u2019 comments and deciding what to do.\u201d Another Tory MP said they expected more junior ministers to quit over Cummings\u2019 lockdown breaches. \u201cI would expect it to happen because MPs are being asked to defend something they know is wrong and they still don\u2019t know the full facts on. I fully expect more people to stand down. A lot of cabinet ministers owe their jobs to Dominic Cummings but I would expect to see people resign at the junior minister level,\u201d they said. \u201cThe pressure from constituents is immense and Douglas Ross\u2019s resignation is very understandable given how thin his majority is, and it\u2019s the same in England and in the red wall in particular.\u201d However, Johnson has rallied behind his senior aide \u2013 a key architect of Brexit and the prime minister\u2019s election victory \u2013 and marshalled top cabinet ministers, including Rishi Sunak and Matt Hancock, to do the same. Michael Gove, a Cabinet Office minister, insisted on Tuesday that \u201cfair-minded people\u201d would have to make up their own minds. The longtime ally of Cummings was sent out to defend him in broadcast interviews the day after the aide gave a statement explaining why he drove 264 miles from London to Durham during the lockdown and risked spreading coronavirus.Police, medics and scientists continued to say that Cummings\u2019 actions risked undermining the lockdown and public health advice. Sir Peter Fahy, the former chief constable of Greater Manchester police, said officers were frustrated by the case, which made it difficult to see the future role of the police in controlling lockdown. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of confusion and it feels like there\u2019s quite a gap between the public narrative and narrative of ministers about the lockdown and what\u2019s happening on the street. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite hard to see the role the police have in the future \u2013 the rules about the reasons for travel are now very confused, when you see the crowds on Bournemouth and Southend beaches and other places yesterday, it\u2019s hard to see what role the police have in trying to control that.\u201d Niall Dickson, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS organisations, told the same programme: \u201cBecause of the way this story has unfolded there is certainly concern among our members, health leaders, that it could damage staff and public confidence in official guidance. Key contradictions about Cummings\u2019 story remain, with Gove pressed to explain how the government can continue to claim that the adviser acted within the rules. In a round of broadcast interviews, Gove was asked: \u2022 Why Cummings went back to work in No 10 after suspecting that his wife could have contracted coronavirus, risking spreading the virus further among colleagues. Gove said she was unwell but did not have official coronavirus symptoms of a cough or fever at that time. \u2022 Why the aide decided that same night to drive 264 miles to Durham to stay on his parents\u2019 estate because of concerns that he and his wife had coronavirus, despite government instructions to self-isolate at home. Gove said he had been acting out of concern that they would be unable to care for their child, despite neither of them having classic coronavirus symptoms at that point. \u2022 Whether it was acceptable for them to have risked spreading coronavirus from the hotspot of London to rural Durham where there were few cases, given their son later needed hospital treatment in the north-east. Gove said his actions had been appropriate. \u2022 Why people should accept his explanation that he needed to make a 60-mile round trip to a beauty spot with his family to test his eyesight before travelling back to London. Gove said it was safe for him to have driven and that Cummings had been \u201cpreparing for work\u201d. \u2022 Why the aide needed to seek help with possible backup childcare in the north-east when long-time friends in London could have helped, including Gove himself. Gove said he would not have expected Cummings to have turned to him instead of close family.

Her colleagues, the bishops of Worcester and Newcastle, said they had received similar messages.</p> <p>For Cummings to face the cameras and give his account was \u201coverall a good thing,\u201d said the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulbayes/status/1264961924539789316\">Rt Rev Paul Bayes, </a>the bishop of Liverpool. \u201cIt implies that it\u2019s time to tell the truth, which is always good, although the questions from reporters made pretty clear he didn\u2019t entirely convince people.\u201d</p> <p>Whether Cummings was sacked or resigned was not the point. \u201cThe point is do we trust the government? In particular, if the government start to give us clear advice on lifting of lockdown, are people going to trust it, or just wait to see what Dominic Cummings does?\u201d Bayes said.</p> <p>\u201cIf they had said \u2018we\u2019re so sorry, it was a mistake to have hidden the truth for so long, it was unfortunate that the guy felt the need to do this and he regrets it very much\u2019, if we had heard stuff like that I think the credibility of the government going forward would have been greater.</p> <p>\u201cRather, what we got was \u2018 I don\u2019t regret anything.

      "bodyText": "Church leaders have lamented Dominic Cummings\u2019 lack of apology and fear that his forced public explanation over why he left London for Durham during lockdown will not be enough to restore full confidence in the government. It came as police said they were investigating hate mail, including a death threat against the bishop of Ripon. Her colleagues, the bishops of Worcester and Newcastle, said they had received similar messages. For Cummings to face the cameras and give his account was \u201coverall a good thing,\u201d said the Rt Rev Paul Bayes, the bishop of Liverpool. \u201cIt implies that it\u2019s time to tell the truth, which is always good, although the questions from reporters made pretty clear he didn\u2019t entirely convince people.\u201d Whether Cummings was sacked or resigned was not the point. \u201cThe point is do we trust the government? In particular, if the government start to give us clear advice on lifting of lockdown, are people going to trust it, or just wait to see what Dominic Cummings does?\u201d Bayes said. \u201cIf they had said \u2018we\u2019re so sorry, it was a mistake to have hidden the truth for so long, it was unfortunate that the guy felt the need to do this and he regrets it very much\u2019, if we had heard stuff like that I think the credibility of the government going forward would have been greater. \u201cRather, what we got was \u2018 I don\u2019t regret anything. I\u2019m clever enough to read the small print and you\u2019re not\u2019. That kind of message I don\u2019t think gives us confidence going forward\u201d, said Bayes. He added that the bishops who had been openly critical of Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser were speaking as individuals, \u201cas is our perfect right\u201d, and that those who felt they ought not to express opinions had missed the distinction between commenting on politics and commenting on public life. Several bishops tweeted they had received hate mail, included death threats, after criticism of the government over the Cummings affair. Police are investigating an email to the bishop of Ripon, Rt Rev Helen-Ann Hartley, which read: \u201cStay out of politics or it will be the death of you\u201d The bishop of Worcester, the Rt Rev John Inge, received an email that read: \u201cKeep out of politics or we will kill you\u201d. He said: \u201cI see this not as a matter of politics, but of life and death,\u201d adding if trust in government advice was not restored, a second spike in the virus could lead to thousands of people losing their lives. Christine Hardman, the bishop of Newcastle, wrote: \u201cI too received such an email.

But like England, whose 18 red-ball bowlers returned to individual training last week before a wider international training group are named on Friday, West Indies\u2019 preparation for their defence of the Wisden Trophy has already begun. Seven Barbados cricketers \u2013 the captain, Jason Holder, Shane Dowrich, Shamarh Brooks, Kraigg Brathwaite, Shai Hope and Raymon Reifer \u2013 trained in two separate groups at the Kensington Oval on Monday, with a further six also using the facilities in the lead up to their departure.

It\u2019s a must-see clash, all right, so don\u2019t forget to take your nearest and dearest for a cross-country spin beforehand to make sure your eyes are working well enough to watch the action.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/may/25/bundesliga-der-klassiker-returns-bayern-munich-borussia-dortmund\">Der Klassiker returns with Bayern and Dortmund's rivalry perfectly poised | Andy Brassell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Fiver has been doing its research in the usual manner so can reveal that the lads down The Glug for Inspiration reckon Dortmund have a real chance of doing a number on their aristocratic visitors. It\u2019s not clear whether that just means keeping the score dignified \u2013 as opposed to the last three late-season league showdowns between the pair, which Bayern won <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/apr/08/rb-leipzig-yussuf-poulsen-bayer-leverkusen-pressure-bayern-munich\">4-1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2018/mar/31/bayern-munich-v-borussia-dortmund-bundesliga-live\">6-0</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/06/bayern-munich-borussia-dortmund-bundesliga-match-report\">5-0</a> \u2013 or actually winning the game and igniting a title race by closing the gap at the top of the table to one point. What is certain is that even if no fans will are allowed to attend, the combination of top talent, high stakes and grandmother-based barbs could produce the sort of fireworks seldom seen outside of a Rammstein jamboree.</p> \n<p>Mind you, it\u2019ll have to go some to surpass the entertainment of the sides\u2019 1999 tryst, a 2-2 draw, when Mary Shelley\u2019s Oliver Kahn went all Harald Schumacher on one Dortmund attacker, St\u00e9phane Chapuisat, before going all Hannibal Lecter on another, Heiko Herrlich. Now that was a classic!</p> \n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a prophet to know we have to win if we are to have any chance of winning the title,\u201d boomed Dortmund sporting director, Michael Zorc, ahead of Tuesday\u2019s rumpus. \u201cYes,\u201d Erling Haaland probably would have added if we\u2019d asked.

      "bodyText": "WIN OF CHANGE The Fiver has no idea who this Derk Lassiker bloke is but apparently he\u2019s going to be at Tuesday\u2019s big match in Germany, which pits Bayern Munich against the butlers who occasionally nick their silverware, Borussia Dortmund. It\u2019s a must-see clash, all right, so don\u2019t forget to take your nearest and dearest for a cross-country spin beforehand to make sure your eyes are working well enough to watch the action. The Fiver has been doing its research in the usual manner so can reveal that the lads down The Glug for Inspiration reckon Dortmund have a real chance of doing a number on their aristocratic visitors. It\u2019s not clear whether that just means keeping the score dignified \u2013 as opposed to the last three late-season league showdowns between the pair, which Bayern won 4-1, 6-0 and 5-0 \u2013 or actually winning the game and igniting a title race by closing the gap at the top of the table to one point. What is certain is that even if no fans will are allowed to attend, the combination of top talent, high stakes and grandmother-based barbs could produce the sort of fireworks seldom seen outside of a Rammstein jamboree. Mind you, it\u2019ll have to go some to surpass the entertainment of the sides\u2019 1999 tryst, a 2-2 draw, when Mary Shelley\u2019s Oliver Kahn went all Harald Schumacher on one Dortmund attacker, St\u00e9phane Chapuisat, before going all Hannibal Lecter on another, Heiko Herrlich. Now that was a classic! \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be a prophet to know we have to win if we are to have any chance of winning the title,\u201d boomed Dortmund sporting director, Michael Zorc, ahead of Tuesday\u2019s rumpus. \u201cYes,\u201d Erling Haaland probably would have added if we\u2019d asked. The young striker tends to do his best talking on the pitch, and if Bayern keep him quiet, they\u2019ll be well on the way to title number 673. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Rob Smyth for piping hot MBM action of Dortmund 2-2 Bayern, which starts at 5.30pm BST, probably well after your trusty Fiver has landed in your inbox. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cThere would be rough periods but nothing could touch that inner core belief: I know I\u2019m good and I know I can do great things. But that last spring at Chelsea really got to me deep down inside. I started to doubt myself for the first time\u201d \u2013 Wolfsburg\u2019s Hedvig Lindahl talks to Suzanne Wrack about the #TogetherAgainstCorona campaign and how she rediscovered her confidence to become one of the best goalkeepers in the world.

After the guidelines were imposed in March to counteract the Covid-19 outbreak, a clause was subsequently added to provide protective measures for women and children stuck in domestic abuse households: the lockdown could be broken in these exceptional circumstances, where vulnerable people were in danger.

      "bodyText": "During Dominic Cummings\u2019 bolshy defence of his cross-country tour to Durham, breaking lockdown regulations, he centred on his \u201cexceptional\u201d need for childcare. This led him to drive 260 miles to his parents\u2019 farm after his wife started to feel ill. In cobbling together this narrative during yesterday\u2019s lengthy press conference, the prime minister\u2019s senior adviser seemed to rely on a loophole in the government\u2019s quarantine laws. After the guidelines were imposed in March to counteract the Covid-19 outbreak, a clause was subsequently added to provide protective measures for women and children stuck in domestic abuse households: the lockdown could be broken in these exceptional circumstances, where vulnerable people were in danger. Cummings, the chief strategist in the government that devised this rule, surely knew that safeguarding women and children from abuse and neglect was the intention. For thousands of women and children, the government\u2019s \u201cstay at home\u201d slogan never meant staying safe. It\u2019s tough to think of how many people tuned in to yesterday\u2019s press conference from their personal prisons with abusers close by, to watch Cummings slalom through his account, refusing to apologise for any actions and justifying \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d that saw him act on \u201cinstinct\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Durham police have begun their investigation into Dominic Cummings\u2019 alleged breaking of lockdown rules, the Guardian and Daily Mirror have learned. A witness has been interviewed by detectives, while the officers also have access to software to track the movement of a vehicle used by the prime minister\u2019s top aide. The developments came after Cummings denied any wrongdoing. It also follows police being asked on Monday to establish the facts by Steve White, the acting police, crime and victims\u2019 commissioner for Durham, who oversees the force. By Monday evening, two detectives from Durham police visited the man who blew the whistle on the trip Cummings made to Barnard Castle, 30 miles from his family\u2019s farm near Durham, as part of a police investigation into alleged breaches of the lockdown rules. They visited Robin Lees, a retired chemistry teacher, at 7.30pm on Monday, two hours after Cummings\u2019 Downing Street press conference. The detectives took testimony about what Lees had seen on 12 April, when Cummings visited the County Durham beauty spot of Barnard Castle with his family on his wife\u2019s birthday. The aide said he had driven there to test his eyesight, which he said had been affected by the coronavirus, before a planned drive back to London the following day. On Monday, Cummings admitted to reports, first made in the Guardian and Mirror, that he had driven with his family to the town. He got out of the car near the River Tees for up to 15 minutes, he told the press conference. Lees\u2019 30-minute discussion with the police was conducted at a physical distance in an outside area bordering the Tees. Lees said: \u201cThey were very thorough, asking every detail of what I saw. They were not in uniform. \u201cThey asked me a lot about my background. They wanted to know exactly what time it was. They wanted to know if it was a clear day and did I know what Cummings looked like.\u201d Officers have access to automatic number plate recognition software to check if cameras have caught a vehicle linked to Cummings during the 260-mile journey from London to Durham on 27 March. Durham police face competing pressures. They are concerned not to be drawn into politics and also that their actions are proportionate \u2013 at worst, breaches of lockdown laws carry a small fine if paid quickly. The expectation is that the investigation will be completed quickly. Durham police said on Monday: \u201cWe can confirm that, over the last few days, Durham constabulary has received further information and complaints from members of the public and we are reviewing and examining that information.\u201d Durham\u2019s chief constable, Jo Farrell, received a letter from White asking her to look at all the claims about Cummings\u2019 time in Durham. White wrote: \u201cI have today written to the chief constable, asking her to establish the facts concerning any potential breach of the law or regulations in this matter at any juncture.\u201d Lees also said that in his local area he could see clear signs of more people venturing out. He said he feared that Cummings\u2019 behaviour had undermined the government\u2019s \u201cstay alert\u201d message. \u201cInterestingly, for the first time ever since lockdown, there were a number of groups not socially distanced there,\u201d he said.",

This prediction came as IHS Markit said its composite index \u2013 measuring activity in the dominant services sector and in manufacturing \u2013 rose to 28.9 in May\u2019s preliminary from 13.8 in April\u2019s final reading, revealing a stronger bounce back in business confidence than earlier estimates. PMIs below 50 represent a decline in activity. Speaking at a CBI webinar on Tuesday, Haldane also played down the prospect of an emergency cut in interest rates to below zero as a way to support the economy through the coronavirus crisis. It followed comments last week by Bank of England governor that the central bank would consider pushing borrowing costs below zero if it considered that the policy would help businesses stay afloat. Haldane said the key factors for the Bank to consider were the consequences of negative interest rates for Britain\u2019s banks and lenders, which would trigger a squeeze on margins, and how such a move would affect confidence in the broader economy. \u201cThose are the aspects that we will look at. To be clear, reviewing and doing are different things, and currently we are in the review phase and have not reached a view remotely yet on the doing.\u201d",

A junior minister resigns, while the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, a former chief whip and a former attorney general are among the Tory MPs to publicly call for Cummings to leave his Downing Street post. Putin claims Russia past peak despite highest daily death toll Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, says the country has passed its peak of infections on the same day the country records its highest daily death toll. After peaking in mid-May at more than 11,000 new cases a day, the number of daily infections in Russia has dropped to fewer than 9,000. On Tuesday, the country reported its highest daily death toll of 174 \u2013 a number still far lower than in countries with similar rates of infections. Excess UK deaths in Covid-19 outbreak approach 60,000 The number of excess deaths registered in the UK during the Covid-19 outbreak is almost 60,000, figures show, underlining Britain\u2019s status as one of the worst-hit countries in Europe. The Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday there had been 53,960 excess deaths in England and Wales from the start of the outbreak to 15 May. There were 4,210 deaths involving Covid-19 registered in England and Wales in the week ending 15 May, the fewest since the week ending 3 April.

Flags will be flown at half-mast in more than 14,000 public buildings across the country and on Spanish naval vessels until 5 June. Merkel losing control of Germany\u2019s lockdown Control over Germany\u2019s lockdown measures is increasingly slipping from Angela Merkel\u2019s grasp as more federal states announce unilateral steps to loosen restrictions, creating a patchwork of wildly varying rules on social distancing within the country. Winfried Kretschmann, the premier of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, announces his state will allow seated public events with up to 100 people from 1 June, adding that there are no plans for further talks on coordinating the responses of Germany\u2019s 16 states. Hungary plans to end PM\u2019s rule by decree A state of emergency introduced in Hungary to tackle its epidemic is to be lifted on 20 June, the country\u2019s justice minister says, potentially bringing to an end Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s controversial power to rule by decree. In late March, Hungary\u2019s parliament gave Orb\u00e1n, the country\u2019s rightwing prime minister, the right to rule by decree indefinitely as part of a package of measures aimed at fighting the epidemic. Spain seeks greatest possible amount from EU emergency fund Spain will ask for the maximum in transfers from the European Union\u2019s pandemic emergency funds, a spokeswoman for its government, says. \u201cWe will keep fighting so that the transfers are the largest possible and so it doesn\u2019t mean debt for Spain\u2019s government,\u201d Maria Jes\u00fas Montero tells a news conference following the weekly cabinet meeting.

The NYSE now says it has consulted with public health and elected officials to develop a protocol that will allow the floor to be open with precautionary measures. \u201cThe virus will remain a stubborn reality but we can\u2019t keep the country closed indefinitely,\u201d wrote Stacey Cunningham, president of the NYSE, in a column for the Wall Street Journal this month. Most employees will continue to work remotely. The small group of traders who are allowed to return will be required to wear face masks and practice social distancing. Anyone entering the building must be screened and undergo a temperature check. Traders must also sign a waiver that acknowledges being on the floor puts them at risk of \u201ccontracting Covid-19, respiratory failure, death and transmitting Covid-19 to family or household members and others who may also suffer these effects\u201d, the Journal reported. The paper also said Intercontinental Exchange had asked firms, including major banks, who employ traders on the floor to agree to provide compensation if any lawsuits arise. Traders on the floor must also avoid taking public transportation, a ban that has proved controversial. Transportation news site Streetsblog said the policy was a sign of a potential \u201ccarpocalypse\u201d \u2013 a rapid rise in cars driving into Manhattan as commuters attempt to avoid public transportation in the wake of the virus. Margaret Chin, a city council member, wrote to New York mayor Bill de Blasio, outlining \u201cdeep concerns about the precedent [the ban] sets for other companies who are eager to reopen\u201d.",

He explained some 1,000 businesses had made unintentional reporting errors in their enrolments for the jobkeeper program. A large number with just one employee apparently put 1,500 in the box asking for how many employees they expected to claim for. This was the dollar amount they intended to claim, not the number of employees.</p> \n<p>But that doesn\u2019t really explain how an error of this scale went unnoticed or why Treasury\u2019s original forecast of $130bn made on March 30 was so far out of the ballpark.</p> \n<p>\u201cNo money that shouldn\u2019t have been paid has been paid,\u201d the treasurer said. Instead, it was the estimates that were wrong and the errors were picked up when employers made their actual claims and provided names and tax file numbers of employees, he said.</p> \n<p>The hugely embarrassing mistake shows the danger of policy on the run. But it also provides an opportunity to fine tune the jobkeeper scheme, the centrepiece of the government\u2019s labour support program, and work towards an exit strategy for the expensive program.</p> \n<p>When the news broke on Friday, Frydenberg appeared to rule out extending jobkeeper to other groups. \u201cThis revision is not an invitation to spend more money. All of the money that the government is spending during the coronavirus period is borrowed money,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>On Monday the treasurer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/25/frydenberg-rules-out-wholesale-changes-to-jobkeeper-despite-60bn-underspend#maincontent\">confirmed no \u201cwholesale changes\u201d to the scheme were in the government\u2019s thinking</a>, while leaving the door open to amendments in some sectors, such as tourism. </p> \n<p>But there are clearly some inequities that need to be addressed as well as a compelling economic need to plan what happens when jobkeeper abruptly finishes in September.</p> \n<p>First, a little about what jobkeeper is and isn\u2019t.</p> \n<p>Although it\u2019s billed as a wage replacement or wage supplement, it\u2019s actually paid to businesses that have seen a fall in their turnover of 30%, or 50% if their turnover is more than $1bn.</p> \n<p>Businesses receive $1,500 for each eligible employee, which they must pass on in full to the employee. But eligibility is related to business turnover, which makes the payment more like a business subsidy.</p> \n<p>There is no requirement to show that the employee would have lost their job without the payment. Under the scheme, employees can also be asked to take leave by their employers if they have more than two weeks accumulated.</p> \n<p>This is very different to the UK scheme, where businesses nominate furloughed workers who are not needed at the business in order to qualify for support for that worker which is 80% of their wage, up to a cap of \u00a32,500 pounds.</p> \n<p>This percentage approach obviously avoids the problem of the uni student getting more than they did before.</p> \n<p>It also provides, unlike the Australian scheme, a way to wind back the support as business picks up. From August, UK employers can start bringing furloughed employees back part-time and start \u201csharing in the cost of the scheme\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Australian scheme however has some serious problems in the recovery phase.</p> \n<p>The 30 or 50% fall in turnover \u2013 the threshold for eligibility \u2013 was calculated at the start of the pandemic.</p> \n<p>A business had to demonstrate fall in GST turnover by comparing either a month or three months revenue to the same period in 2019 to show a 30 or 50% decline.</p> \n<p>For some that was easy. Restaurants and bars had immediately shut. Some retail chains also chose to close as malls became deserted.</p> \n<p>But as people emerge from isolation, and shops, pubs and restaurants reopen, there\u2019s no ability for the government to reassess whether these businesses still need jobkeeper. Most probably do but the payment increasingly becomes a subsidy to the business, not a wage replacement, as the businesses start earning again and can pay their workers.</p> \n<p>There is also anecdotal evidence that industries with lumpy cashflow, such as trades and construction, have been able to engineer a 30% fall in a month, by postponing invoicing clients, in order to qualify for jobkeeper.</p> \n<p>Some of these sectors, notably the housing sector, might start feeling real pain as the jobkeeper payment runs out.</p> \n<p>Work by Deloitte Access Economics shows that the recovery will be very uneven and that some jobs may disappear permanently, raising questions about what will happen after September.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"747d7e6a-15d0-47fa-8084-24575975fcad\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(June 1, 2020)</i>&nbsp;<strong>What's due to end?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>28 June \u2013 Free childcare: government pays 50% of usual support plus jobkeeper to centres. <b>Cost: $1.6bn over three months, or roughly $131m a week</b></p>\n    <p>30 June \u2013 Instant asset write-off (must buy the asset and take delivery by 30 June). <b>Unknown cost</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(July 1, 2020)</i>&nbsp;<strong>What's due?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>13 July \u2013 Second (and currently last) economic support payment of $750 to 6.5m pensioners who do not receive extra Covid support under jobseeker. <b>Cost: $8bn</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>(September 1, 2020)</i>&nbsp;<strong>What's due to end?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>25 September \u2013 Moratorium on bankruptcy, insolvency applications.</p>\n    <p>27 September \u2013 Jobkeeper. <b>Cost: $70bn</b>.

      "bodyText": "Since Australia\u2019s jobkeeper scheme was announced there have been almost daily reports of its simultaneous unfairness and generosity. Casual workers and contract workers who had been employed for less than 12 months \u2013 an employment pattern common in the arts and entertainments sector \u2013 missed out. So too did thousands of workers in Australia on temporary visas and workers employed by firms owned by foreign governments, such as airline catering company, Dnata. Universities \u2013 which continued functioning for Australian students, but had lost up to 40% of their revenues from foreign students \u2013 missed out because they hadn\u2019t lost enough revenue to qualify and were not included in the less stringent thresholds for charities, even though they too are not-for-profits. And foreign students who had made it to Australia for their studies got nothing even though their part-time jobs largely evaporated. But Australian university students working casually in bars and doing a couple of shifts were getting the full $1500, provided they had been with their employers for more than 12 months. Then came the most astounding development, that demonstrated the dangers of designing major policy quickly. On Friday, Treasury announced there had been a massive reporting error, and the jobkeeper scheme was costing not $130bn, as originally forecast, but only $70bn, and was supporting 3.5m, not 6m, workers. An embarrassed treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, attempted to shift the blame. He explained some 1,000 businesses had made unintentional reporting errors in their enrolments for the jobkeeper program. A large number with just one employee apparently put 1,500 in the box asking for how many employees they expected to claim for. This was the dollar amount they intended to claim, not the number of employees. But that doesn\u2019t really explain how an error of this scale went unnoticed or why Treasury\u2019s original forecast of $130bn made on March 30 was so far out of the ballpark. \u201cNo money that shouldn\u2019t have been paid has been paid,\u201d the treasurer said. Instead, it was the estimates that were wrong and the errors were picked up when employers made their actual claims and provided names and tax file numbers of employees, he said. The hugely embarrassing mistake shows the danger of policy on the run. But it also provides an opportunity to fine tune the jobkeeper scheme, the centrepiece of the government\u2019s labour support program, and work towards an exit strategy for the expensive program. When the news broke on Friday, Frydenberg appeared to rule out extending jobkeeper to other groups. \u201cThis revision is not an invitation to spend more money. All of the money that the government is spending during the coronavirus period is borrowed money,\u201d he said. On Monday the treasurer confirmed no \u201cwholesale changes\u201d to the scheme were in the government\u2019s thinking, while leaving the door open to amendments in some sectors, such as tourism. But there are clearly some inequities that need to be addressed as well as a compelling economic need to plan what happens when jobkeeper abruptly finishes in September. First, a little about what jobkeeper is and isn\u2019t. Although it\u2019s billed as a wage replacement or wage supplement, it\u2019s actually paid to businesses that have seen a fall in their turnover of 30%, or 50% if their turnover is more than $1bn. Businesses receive $1,500 for each eligible employee, which they must pass on in full to the employee. But eligibility is related to business turnover, which makes the payment more like a business subsidy. There is no requirement to show that the employee would have lost their job without the payment. Under the scheme, employees can also be asked to take leave by their employers if they have more than two weeks accumulated. This is very different to the UK scheme, where businesses nominate furloughed workers who are not needed at the business in order to qualify for support for that worker which is 80% of their wage, up to a cap of \u00a32,500 pounds. This percentage approach obviously avoids the problem of the uni student getting more than they did before. It also provides, unlike the Australian scheme, a way to wind back the support as business picks up. From August, UK employers can start bringing furloughed employees back part-time and start \u201csharing in the cost of the scheme\u201d. The Australian scheme however has some serious problems in the recovery phase. The 30 or 50% fall in turnover \u2013 the threshold for eligibility \u2013 was calculated at the start of the pandemic. A business had to demonstrate fall in GST turnover by comparing either a month or three months revenue to the same period in 2019 to show a 30 or 50% decline. For some that was easy. Restaurants and bars had immediately shut. Some retail chains also chose to close as malls became deserted. But as people emerge from isolation, and shops, pubs and restaurants reopen, there\u2019s no ability for the government to reassess whether these businesses still need jobkeeper. Most probably do but the payment increasingly becomes a subsidy to the business, not a wage replacement, as the businesses start earning again and can pay their workers. There is also anecdotal evidence that industries with lumpy cashflow, such as trades and construction, have been able to engineer a 30% fall in a month, by postponing invoicing clients, in order to qualify for jobkeeper. Some of these sectors, notably the housing sector, might start feeling real pain as the jobkeeper payment runs out. Work by Deloitte Access Economics shows that the recovery will be very uneven and that some jobs may disappear permanently, raising questions about what will happen after September. At a broad industry level, the key losers in terms of jobs in the short term (seeing greater than 50% declines) are expected to be accommodation, arts, recreation and other services \u2013 and they may take five or six years to recover all the job losses seen, Deloitte reported last week. \u201cSectors such as property and professional services, education and telecommunications are less impacted now, and may be back in a solid growth phase by early 2022,\u201d Deloitte notes. \u201cHowever, a couple of sectors have a moderate decline now, but may take an extended period to return to early 2020 employment levels.\u201d Deloitte singles out the finance sector, which will feel the affect of accumulated bad loans from the Covid-19 crisis and lower demand for credit. Other jobs in farming and manufacturing might disappear altogether as employers adapt their processes, Deloitte said. At this stage, the plan beyond September is for jobseeker recipients to revert to Newstart payments at $489.70 per fortnight and for jobkeeper to be scrapped. Pradeep Philip, head of Deloitte Access Economics, said the numbers on jobseeker would continue to increase in next month\u2019s figures as people take time to claim. If jobKeeper ends, there will be another large group move onto unemployment benefits, and at the Newstart rate, which is half the jobseeker rate. \u201cIf growth doesn\u2019t pick up, if the jobkeeper wage subsidy doesn\u2019t continue, then they will then move onto unemployment benefits. When jobseeker payments fall [back to Newstart levels] it will affect growth further,\u201d he said. \u201cIn previous crises we have tried to give money to people who need it and who will spend it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the conundrum the government needs to sort out. It needs to find a transition pathway.\u201d In the meantime, there are plenty of changes that could be made to the existing jobkeeper payment to make it fairer. The small business ombudsman, Kate Carnell, says she is particularly concerned about small businesses that operate as partnerships, a common legal structure for family business and services. Under the jobkeeper rules, only one partner can get jobkeeper while the other partner or partners must apply for jobseeker, which is $300 a fortnight less. Yet if the enterprise was incorporated they would be able to apply for jobkeeper for all eligible employees, Carnell said. \u201cThis is dumb stuff and I hope the government will look at it.\u201d \u201cBut generally, jobkeeper has been a lifeline and the feedback we get from business is that they say: \u2018I don\u2019t know what I would have done without it\u2019. More than 75% of business is trading,\u201d she said. The universities sector is also calling on the government to use the $60bn miscalculation to revisit their sector\u2019s exclusion from the scheme. The Universities Australia chief executive, Catriona Jackson, said the sector faces the loss of 21,000 jobs in the next six months if nothing is done. \u201cWe were disappointed that government has changed the regulations on a number of occasions to effectively exclude universities. We call on them to reconsider.\u201d So too does the United Workers\u2019 Union, which represents many of the casual and visa workers who been left out of the scheme. \u201cThe scheme needs to continue to invest in the economy beyond the arbitrary government deadline,\u201d the national secretary, Tim Kennedy said. \u201cAnd it needs to be amended to include all workers, and not exclude the millions of casual workers, visa workers in low-paid sectors such as cleaning, early childhood education, hospitality, food processing and fresh food.\u201d He also wants to see it extended to arts and cultural workers and workers in higher education. \u201cThe treasurer has the power to expand the coverage of the scheme now and to restore the original promise of the federal government that jobkeeper would be a lifeline to every Australian worker,\u201d he said. A final issue for the government is the misfire of an early measure designed to keep apprentices employed. Only $146m of the $1.3bn budgeted to pay 50% of apprentice wages has been taken up so far. That\u2019s because most employers opted for the more generous jobkeeper scheme. The National Australian Apprenticeships Association says that while government measures have stopped wholesale shedding of apprentices, businesses have stopped hiring new ones, with commencements down 60%. \u201cThe real impact will be further down the track,\u201d the peak body\u2019s chief executive, Ben Bardon, said. The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union has warned that the hiring freeze now could affect Australia\u2019s economic recovery. \u201cThe government is talking a big game about a manufacturing-led recovery, but we are are not seeing the investment in skills that would make that possible,\u201d the union\u2019s national secretary, Paul Bastian, said. On Tuesday the prime minister, Scott Morrison, made apprenticeships and training a priority for national cabinet. He highlighted different fees paid in different jurisdictions for the same courses. Getting skills and training right in the recovery phase will be an important part of the response, but it also involves having a clear vision of where the jobs of the future will be and helping businesses recognise the importance of apprenticeships as they grapple with the recovery.",

But experts say there is no evidence any such problem exists. Labor also slammed the move for undermining confidence in the markets. The change, which followed heavy lobbying by industry groups, is supposed to last for six months, but there are already calls for it to be made permanent. It drew immediate fire from class-action lawyers, who described it as \u201ccronyism\u201d and a \u201cgreen light for company directors to hide information from the people who actually own a company\u201d. Louise Davidson, the chief executive of the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, the members of which collectively control $2.2tn in retirement savings, said that lowering disclosure standards, \u201ceven for a short period, comes at a cost\u201d. \u201cWe would be concerned if these changes undermine market integrity at a time when investor confidence will be integral to support a recovery,\u201d she said.

He said the Australian market had not frozen over during the pandemic but had instead been the second-most active in the world, after New York, with $17.86bn raised by companies. The new laws were of particular concern because they replaced an existing objective test of whether disclosure was reasonable with a subjective one that would require directors to know information was important and be reckless or negligent in failing to disclose it, he said. Paatsch said this subjective element created the possibility of an \u201chonest idiot\u201d defence. \u201cThe nightmare scenario is that a spiv will come up and raise money on the basis of the honest idiot defence that they\u2019ve put in there,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will shoot Australia\u2019s equity capital markets regime in the foot. \u201cMy concern really is the economic consequences.

If RA is unable to deliver a sustainable broadcast deal, more and more players will leave, not just a few Queenslanders, placing enormous pressure on the shape and structure of Australian rugby. The clock is ticking.",

In other developments on Tuesday: Coronavirus has infected nearly 5,530,350 people worldwide and killed more than 347,000, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. A 27-year-old South Korean man was jailed for four months for twice breaking quarantine rules, the country\u2019s first such prison sentence. Indonesia said it was deploying 340,000 troops, including in the capital, Jakarta, to clamp down on rampant physical-distancing violations. Thailand extended its sweeping state of emergency laws for another month until the end of June as the country starts to gradually reopen businesses.",

      "bodyText": "A leading teaching union has warned the prime minister that plans to reopen schools more widely next month fail to address that coronavirus poses a greater risk to black and minority ethnic pupils and staff. Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT, called on Boris Johnson to ensure that the government\u2019s approach to reopening state education will address the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on BAME people. In his letter, the union leader requested urgent clarification from ministers that they would fulfil their legal duties under the Equality Act \u201cto prevent further discriminatory impacts related to the transmission of the coronavirus\u201d. Early figures on the incidence of Covid-19 showed that 35% of almost 2,000 patients in intensive care units were black or from another minority ethnic background, despite BAME people making up only 14% of the population, according to the last census. Roach said the higher transmission and mortality rates have provoked \u201ca real sense of anxiety and fear among many BAME teachers\u201d. He also criticised the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) for its failure to address ethnicity in their recently published analysis of the risks posed by reopening schools. \u201cWe can\u2019t have a colourblind approach to the relaxation of the current rules to protect against this major public health crisis,\u201d said Roach. The leaders of Birmingham city council wrote to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, last week calling for \u201cfurther guidance \u2026 for schools with large BAME communities on the implications of reopening\u201d. The council leader, Ian Ward, and the cabinet member for education, skills and culture, Jayne Francis, wrote: \u201cThe vast majority [of BAME parents] have stated that they will not be returning their children to school on 1 June [due to] their concerns on the disproportional impact on them as black parents if their child were to contract the virus and bring it home.\u201d Jackie, a black British teacher at a school in south-east London which is due to reopen next month, said she felt like she was in limbo due to the lack of government advice on the specific risks the virus posed to BAME pupils and staff. \u201cThey have not addressed it properly,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019re not being told what the risk is.

Matt Hancock on Tuesday welcomed the authorisation of the experimental antiviral drug remdesivir, which has been shown to reduce recovery time for patients in hospital with Covid-19 from 15 days to 11 days. Made by the US company Gilead Sciences, and initially pioneered for the treatment of the Ebola virus, the drug was granted emergency authorisation for Covid-19 by the US and Japan early this month. Now the UK has followed suit. The drug is to be made available to carefully selected NHS patients through the Early Access to Medicines Scheme, a programme that allows medicines to be used in emergency situations before they have been licensed, the drugs provided free by the company. Remdesivir has been the subject of trials around the world in treating Covid-19, with mixed results.

More promising was an international trial, which found it reduced the median recovery period of patients in hospital with Covid-19 from 15 days to 11 days. Hancock told the Downing Street press briefing that the drug had given promising early results and that if the UK trials were successful health officials would be prioritising the use of the treatment where it would provide the greatest benefit. He warned that only very early steps had been taken in the trial but added: \u201cThis is probably the biggest step forward in the treatment of coronavirus since the crisis began.\u201d Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that the NHS had secured the drug on a provisional licence lasting a year, unless renewed, and that it meant the drug could be accessed legally while unlicensed.

Retail accounts for about a third of consumer spending in Britain. With much of the high street closed and the economy slumping into the worst recession since 1706, Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to reopen non-essential shops from 15 June is key to limiting the hit to jobs and growth. Such is the importance of consumption to the UK\u2019s economic model, that overall household expenditure, which adds total retail spending together with bills, rent, mortgage payments and other outgoings, accounts for almost two-thirds of national output. About three million people work in retail, roughly one in 10 of all jobs in Britain, and it is the largest single private sector for employment. Millions more working in public transport, warehouses, restaurants and elsewhere depend on the high street and online sales to thrive. Retailers have been battered during the lockdown period. Sales fell by almost a fifth in April as shoppers stayed at home, the biggest slump since records began in the late 1980s. Wiping out 15 years of growth, sales volumes fell back to their 2005 level. The impact, however, has not been uniform. While restaurants and pubs have closed, food sales have proven resilient and spending on alcohol has surged. Fashion retailers and departments stores have had their high street business completely wiped out, although online trade has risen from about a fifth of sales to almost a third. A rebound across the board will depend on consumer confidence in two things: their personal finances and whether they feel safe on the high street. With rising job losses, the continued risk of infection and mixed government messaging, reopening retail is no guarantee of rebound. Unemployment is expected to more than double by the summer as companies buckle. There are concerns job losses could rise further as the government scales back its furlough scheme. There are, though, some positive pointers.

Britain\u2019s retailers were struggling before Covid-19 struck, with the potential death of the high street a key issue at the 2019 election, after a wave of high-profile shop closures. According to the consultancy Retail Economics, pretax profit margins at the UK\u2019s top 150 retailers have halved over the last decade, dented by the rising minimum wage and business rates. Since at least the 1960s, British households have increasingly spent on services and activities rather than objects, while the shift to online spending is presenting ever bigger challenges to bricks-and-mortar retailers.

      "body": "<p>As Governor Andrew Cuomo faced a spirited challenge in his bid to win New York\u2019s 2018 Democratic primary, his political apparatus got a last-minute boost: a powerful healthcare industry group suddenly poured more than $1m into a Democratic committee <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/10/nyregion/cynthia-nixon-cuomo-anti-semitism-mailer.html?auth=login-email&amp;login=email\">backing</a> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2018/03/12/new-york-democrats-launch-gun-ad-campaign-featuring-cuomo-310558\">his campaign</a>.</p> <p>Less than two years after that flood of cash from the Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA), Cuomo signed legislation last month quietly shielding hospital and nursing home executives from the threat of lawsuits stemming from the coronavirus outbreak. The provision, inserted into an annual budget bill by Cuomo\u2019s aides, created one of the nation\u2019s most explicit immunity protections for healthcare industry officials, according to legal experts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/new-york-contact-tracing-coronavirus\">New York enlists 'army' of contact tracers to beat coronavirus \u2013 but will it work?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Critics say Cuomo removed a key deterrent against nursing home and hospital corporations cutting corners in ways that jeopardize lives. As those critics now try to repeal the provision during this final week of Albany\u2019s legislative session, they assert that data prove such immunity is correlating to higher nursing home death rates during the pandemic \u2013 both in New York and in other states enacting similar immunity policies.</p> <p>New York has become one of the globe\u2019s major pandemic hotspots \u2013 and the center of the state\u2019s outbreak has been nursing homes, where <a href=\"https://abc7ny.com/nursing-home-deaths-cuomo-criticized-in-new-york/6168676/\">more than </a><a href=\"https://abc7ny.com/nursing-home-deaths-cuomo-criticized-in-new-york/6168676/\">5,000 New Yorkers have died</a>, according to Associated Press data.</p> <p>Those deaths have occurred as Cuomo\u2019s critics say he has taken a hands-off approach to regulating the healthcare industry interests that helped bankroll his election campaign. In <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200328184542/https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/system/files/documents/2020/03/doh_covid19-_nhadmissionsreadmissions_-032520.pdf\">March</a>, Cuomo\u2019s administration issued an order that allowed nursing homes to readmit sick patients without testing them for Covid-19. Amid <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/05/16/nursing-home-coronavirus-deaths-dont-match-official-ny-state-tallies/\">allegations</a> of undercounted casualties, the governor also <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/04/21/nursing-homes-responsible-for-coronavirus-case-reporting-cuomo/\">pushed back</a> against pressure to have state regulators more stringently record and report death rates in nursing homes.</p> <p>And then came <a href=\"https://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?default_fld=%0D%0A&amp;leg_video=&amp;bn=A9506&amp;term=0&amp;Summary=Y&amp;Actions=Y&amp;Memo=Y&amp;Text=Y\">Cuomo\u2019s annual budget</a> \u2013 which included a little-noticed passage shielding corporate officials who run New York hospitals, nursing homes and other healthcare facilities from liability for Covid-related deaths and injuries.</p> <p>GNYHA \u2013 a lobbying group for hospital systems, including some that own nursing homes \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.gnyha.org/news/gnyha-secures-immunity-for-hospitals-and-workers-from-liability-in-connection-with-the-covid-19-emergency/\">said</a> it \u201cdrafted and aggressively advocated for\u201d the immunity provision. The new law declares that top officials at hospital and nursing home companies \u201cshall have immunity from any liability, civil or criminal, for any harm or damages alleged to have been sustained as a result of an act or omission in the course of arranging for or providing healthcare services\u201d to address the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> <p>Prior to the budget language, Cuomo had already temporarily <a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-20210-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-modification-laws-relating-disaster-emergency\">granted</a> limited legal immunity to doctors and nurses serving on the medical frontlines. But the carefully sculpted passage buried in the state\u2019s annual spending bill expanded that by <a href=\"https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/PBH/3081\">offering</a> extensive immunity to any \u201chealthcare facility administrator, executive, supervisor, board member, trustee or other person responsible for directing, supervising or managing a healthcare facility and its personnel or other individual in a comparable role\u201d.</p> <p>New York is now one of just two states to shield those corporate officials from both civil lawsuits and some forms of criminal prosecution by the government, according to <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6927790-Kohn-Roberts-Chart-05-25-20.html\">an analysis</a> by Syracuse University law professor Nina Kohn and the University of Houston\u2019s Jessica L Roberts.</p> <p>\u201cNew York is an outlier and has the most explicit and sweeping immunity language,\u201d Kohn said.</p> <p>Cuomo\u2019s administration said the new immunity provision \u2013 which is a narrow version of a broader proposal <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-05-06/business-groups-lobby-congress-to-ease-their-liability-to-corornavirus\">championed</a> by the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell \u2013 is necessary.</p> <p>\u201cThis pandemic remains an unprecedented public health crisis and we had to realign New York\u2019s entire healthcare system, using every type of facility to prepare for the surge, and recruiting more than 96,000 volunteers \u2013 25,000 from out of state, to help fight this virus,\u201d said Cuomo\u2019s senior adviser Rich Azzopardi in an emailed statement. \u201cThese volunteers are good samaritans and what was passed by 111 members of the legislature was an expansion of the existing Good Samaritan Law to apply to the emergency that coronavirus created. If we had not done this, these volunteers wouldn\u2019t have been accepted and we never would have had enough frontline healthcare workers.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>New York is an outlier and has the most explicit and sweeping immunity language</p> <footer> <cite>Nina Kohn</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Democratic assemblyman Ron Kim said that \u201cthe language of the [immunity] bill and the entire proposal was drafted, submitted, and negotiated into law by Governor Andrew Cuomo and his staff\u201d. He is leading 14 New York lawmakers in pushing <a href=\"https://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?bn=A10427\">legislation</a> to repeal the language \u2013 and some of them assert that the immunity provisions are linked to higher death rates in nursing homes.</p> <p>\u201cIt is now apparent that negligence by administrators and executives of nursing homes has occurred at an extraordinary degree,\u201d proponents of the legislation argued in a <a href=\"https://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?default_fld=&amp;leg_video=&amp;bn=A10427&amp;term=0&amp;Summary=Y&amp;Actions=Y&amp;Memo=Y&amp;Text=Y\">memo</a> accompanying the bill. \u201c[The immunity law] egregiously uses severe liability standards as a means to insulate healthcare facilities and specifically, administrators and executives of such facilities, from any civil or criminal liability for negligence. Repealing this article is a much-needed step to holding healthcare administrators accountable and doing everything possible to stop even more preventable deaths from happening.\u201d</p> <p>GNYHA has framed its push for liability protections as an effort to defend workers. In a <a href=\"https://www.gnyha.org/news/gnyha-secures-immunity-for-hospitals-and-workers-from-liability-in-connection-with-the-covid-19-emergency/\">2 April </a><a href=\"https://www.gnyha.org/news/gnyha-secures-immunity-for-hospitals-and-workers-from-liability-in-connection-with-the-covid-19-emergency/\"> memo</a> to its members, the association wrote: \u201cYou and your heroic workers have enough to agonize over without having to worry about liability for decisions and actions made under extraordinarily challenging circumstances.\u201d</p> <p>By contrast, opponents of the legislation contend that Cuomo\u2019s language immunizing executives from civil and criminal litigation is designed to make it easier for nursing home corporations to profit off unsafe business practices.</p> <p>\u201cThe reason why neglect happens in nursing homes is executives make business decisions that result in the frontline workers not having the tools \u2013 in nursing homes, the manpower \u2013 to deliver the services those workers are trained to deliver,\u201d said plaintiffs\u2019 attorney Andrew G Finkelstein, a managing partner at Jacoby &amp; Meyers.</p> <p>\u201cThese executives choose how much staffing will be in a nursing home and they know the more staffing that they put in, the more safe the nursing home will be \u2013 but the less profits they will make,\u201d Finkelstein said. \u201cWhen you remove their liability from that choice, the net effect will be less and less staffing and more and more neglect in nursing homes, because those decision-makers will know there will be no legal consequences for the decisions they make.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Immunity </strong><strong>followed $2.3m in </strong><strong>campaign </strong><strong>cash</strong></h2> <p>The immunity provision in Cuomo\u2019s budget came 18 months after the GNYHA <a href=\"https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?dt=1&amp;y=2018,2017,2016,2015&amp;f-fc=2,3&amp;pt-eid=4904&amp;d-eid=1145#[%7B1%7Cgro=pt-typ,d-id,pt-pt\">delivered</a> <a href=\"https://cfapp.elections.ny.gov/reports/rwservlet?cmdkey=efs_sch_report+p_filer_id=A00816+p_e_year=2018+p_freport_id=K+p_transaction_code=P\">$1.25m</a> to the Cuomo-controlled New York State Democratic committee that was <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2018/08/20/new-york-democratic-party-bankrolling-cuomo-ads-over-nixon/\">supporting</a> the governor\u2019s re-election bid. The money went to the committee\u2019s so-called housekeeping account.

Three of the hospital association\u2019s top officials separately gave more than $150,000 to Cuomo\u2019s campaign between 2015 and 2018.</p> <p>In all, during the governor\u2019s second term, <a href=\"https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?dt=1&amp;y=2018&amp;f-fc=2,3&amp;c-t-eid=6466806&amp;d-et=3&amp;d-cci=66#[%7B1%7Cgro=d-id\">Cuomo\u2019s campaign</a> and his <a href=\"https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?dt=1&amp;y=2018,2017,2016,2015&amp;f-fc=2,3&amp;pt-eid=4904&amp;d-et=3&amp;d-cci=66#[%7B1%7Cgro=\">state party committee</a> raked in more than $2.3m from hospital and nursing home industry donors and their lobbying firms, according to data compiled by the National Institute on Money in Politics.</p> <p>Azzopardi said the Cuomo administration\u2019s decision to insert the language into the budget was not a reflection of lobbyists\u2019 influence.</p> <p>\u201cThis law was intended to increase capacity and provide quality care, and any suggestion otherwise is simply outrageous,\u201d he said.</p> <h2><strong>Big </strong><strong>lobbying </strong><strong>contracts</strong></h2> <p>GNYHA <a href=\"https://webapps.jcope.ny.gov/public/ViewFiling/BIMO/MTA3Njkw0\">paid</a> $60,000 to the MirRam Group in March and April, according to the firm\u2019s <a href=\"https://webapps.jcope.ny.gov/public/ViewFiling/BIMO/MTA3Njkw0\">report</a>.

New York \u2013 unlike many other states \u2013 explicitly extended the immunity to company executives and corporate board members who are not on the frontlines, but who are making key budget and staffing decisions that affect workers and patients.</p> <p>Kim says that the expansion beyond healthcare workers is not an accident \u2013 he said it deliberately \u201cdiscourages medical staff and frontline workers in nursing homes from safely coming out against malpractices they might observe from executive leadership\u201d.</p> <p>That assertion was echoed by University of Wyoming law professor <a href=\"http://www.uwyo.edu/law/directory/mike-duff.html\">Michael Duff</a>, one of the nation\u2019s leading experts on workplace law. He said that while the change does not modify traditional workers\u2019 compensation protections for hospital or nursing home employees, it could reduce the legal rights of contract workers to demand better safety protections at precisely the moment that healthcare facilities are outsourcing work to third-party staffing firms.</p> <p>\u201cOften medical personnel in operating rooms and emergency areas are contracted out [and] the same often goes for groups like janitorial services,\u201d said Duff, a former National Labor Relations Board investigator. \u201cOrdinarily, employees of the institutions would be unable to sue because of workers\u2019 compensation exclusive remedy rule. But independent contractors aren\u2019t bound by that rule. They could sue but now because of this immunity they cannot.\u201d</p> <p>For its part, the Cuomo administration has struck a defiant tone.

      "bodyText": "As Governor Andrew Cuomo faced a spirited challenge in his bid to win New York\u2019s 2018 Democratic primary, his political apparatus got a last-minute boost: a powerful healthcare industry group suddenly poured more than $1m into a Democratic committee backing his campaign. Less than two years after that flood of cash from the Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA), Cuomo signed legislation last month quietly shielding hospital and nursing home executives from the threat of lawsuits stemming from the coronavirus outbreak. The provision, inserted into an annual budget bill by Cuomo\u2019s aides, created one of the nation\u2019s most explicit immunity protections for healthcare industry officials, according to legal experts. Critics say Cuomo removed a key deterrent against nursing home and hospital corporations cutting corners in ways that jeopardize lives. As those critics now try to repeal the provision during this final week of Albany\u2019s legislative session, they assert that data prove such immunity is correlating to higher nursing home death rates during the pandemic \u2013 both in New York and in other states enacting similar immunity policies. New York has become one of the globe\u2019s major pandemic hotspots \u2013 and the center of the state\u2019s outbreak has been nursing homes, where more than 5,000 New Yorkers have died, according to Associated Press data. Those deaths have occurred as Cuomo\u2019s critics say he has taken a hands-off approach to regulating the healthcare industry interests that helped bankroll his election campaign. In March, Cuomo\u2019s administration issued an order that allowed nursing homes to readmit sick patients without testing them for Covid-19. Amid allegations of undercounted casualties, the governor also pushed back against pressure to have state regulators more stringently record and report death rates in nursing homes. And then came Cuomo\u2019s annual budget \u2013 which included a little-noticed passage shielding corporate officials who run New York hospitals, nursing homes and other healthcare facilities from liability for Covid-related deaths and injuries. GNYHA \u2013 a lobbying group for hospital systems, including some that own nursing homes \u2013 said it \u201cdrafted and aggressively advocated for\u201d the immunity provision. The new law declares that top officials at hospital and nursing home companies \u201cshall have immunity from any liability, civil or criminal, for any harm or damages alleged to have been sustained as a result of an act or omission in the course of arranging for or providing healthcare services\u201d to address the Covid-19 outbreak. Prior to the budget language, Cuomo had already temporarily granted limited legal immunity to doctors and nurses serving on the medical frontlines. But the carefully sculpted passage buried in the state\u2019s annual spending bill expanded that by offering extensive immunity to any \u201chealthcare facility administrator, executive, supervisor, board member, trustee or other person responsible for directing, supervising or managing a healthcare facility and its personnel or other individual in a comparable role\u201d. New York is now one of just two states to shield those corporate officials from both civil lawsuits and some forms of criminal prosecution by the government, according to an analysis by Syracuse University law professor Nina Kohn and the University of Houston\u2019s Jessica L Roberts. \u201cNew York is an outlier and has the most explicit and sweeping immunity language,\u201d Kohn said. Cuomo\u2019s administration said the new immunity provision \u2013 which is a narrow version of a broader proposal championed by the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell \u2013 is necessary. \u201cThis pandemic remains an unprecedented public health crisis and we had to realign New York\u2019s entire healthcare system, using every type of facility to prepare for the surge, and recruiting more than 96,000 volunteers \u2013 25,000 from out of state, to help fight this virus,\u201d said Cuomo\u2019s senior adviser Rich Azzopardi in an emailed statement. \u201cThese volunteers are good samaritans and what was passed by 111 members of the legislature was an expansion of the existing Good Samaritan Law to apply to the emergency that coronavirus created. If we had not done this, these volunteers wouldn\u2019t have been accepted and we never would have had enough frontline healthcare workers.\u201d Democratic assemblyman Ron Kim said that \u201cthe language of the [immunity] bill and the entire proposal was drafted, submitted, and negotiated into law by Governor Andrew Cuomo and his staff\u201d. He is leading 14 New York lawmakers in pushing legislation to repeal the language \u2013 and some of them assert that the immunity provisions are linked to higher death rates in nursing homes. \u201cIt is now apparent that negligence by administrators and executives of nursing homes has occurred at an extraordinary degree,\u201d proponents of the legislation argued in a memo accompanying the bill. \u201c[The immunity law] egregiously uses severe liability standards as a means to insulate healthcare facilities and specifically, administrators and executives of such facilities, from any civil or criminal liability for negligence. Repealing this article is a much-needed step to holding healthcare administrators accountable and doing everything possible to stop even more preventable deaths from happening.\u201d GNYHA has framed its push for liability protections as an effort to defend workers. In a 2 April memo to its members, the association wrote: \u201cYou and your heroic workers have enough to agonize over without having to worry about liability for decisions and actions made under extraordinarily challenging circumstances.\u201d By contrast, opponents of the legislation contend that Cuomo\u2019s language immunizing executives from civil and criminal litigation is designed to make it easier for nursing home corporations to profit off unsafe business practices. \u201cThe reason why neglect happens in nursing homes is executives make business decisions that result in the frontline workers not having the tools \u2013 in nursing homes, the manpower \u2013 to deliver the services those workers are trained to deliver,\u201d said plaintiffs\u2019 attorney Andrew G Finkelstein, a managing partner at Jacoby &amp; Meyers. \u201cThese executives choose how much staffing will be in a nursing home and they know the more staffing that they put in, the more safe the nursing home will be \u2013 but the less profits they will make,\u201d Finkelstein said. \u201cWhen you remove their liability from that choice, the net effect will be less and less staffing and more and more neglect in nursing homes, because those decision-makers will know there will be no legal consequences for the decisions they make.\u201d Immunity followed $2.3m in campaign cash The immunity provision in Cuomo\u2019s budget came 18 months after the GNYHA delivered $1.25m to the Cuomo-controlled New York State Democratic committee that was supporting the governor\u2019s re-election bid. The money went to the committee\u2019s so-called housekeeping account. The account, which can accept unlimited donations, is meant to support general party activities but has also been used to promote Cuomo and his agenda in television ads, including in his 2018 re-election campaign. The GNYHA donations \u2013 which were a huge increase from prior years \u2013 made the group one of the New York Democratic party\u2019s largest contributors during Cuomo\u2019s campaign. Three of the hospital association\u2019s top officials separately gave more than $150,000 to Cuomo\u2019s campaign between 2015 and 2018. In all, during the governor\u2019s second term, Cuomo\u2019s campaign and his state party committee raked in more than $2.3m from hospital and nursing home industry donors and their lobbying firms, according to data compiled by the National Institute on Money in Politics. Azzopardi said the Cuomo administration\u2019s decision to insert the language into the budget was not a reflection of lobbyists\u2019 influence. \u201cThis law was intended to increase capacity and provide quality care, and any suggestion otherwise is simply outrageous,\u201d he said. Big lobbying contracts GNYHA paid $60,000 to the MirRam Group in March and April, according to the firm\u2019s report. John Emrick, a lobbyist at the firm who previously served as the chief of staff for the controversial Independent Democratic Conference state senate caucus, disclosed lobbying the Senate majority leader\u2019s office on \u201csafe staffing\u201d and \u201cmedical malpractice\u201d. Another GNYHA lobby firm is Bolton-St Johns, which gave Cuomo\u2019s campaign $40,000 during his 2018 re-election. That firm employs Giorgio DeRosa, Joseph DeRosa, and Jessica Davos \u2013 the father, brother and sister of Cuomo\u2019s top aide, Melissa DeRosa, who is secretary to the governor. Giorgio DeRosa is described on Bolton\u2019s website as a partner and the firm\u2019s \u201cchief Albany lobbyist\u201d. GNYHA pays the firm $24,000 a month to lobby on \u201cbudget/appropriations\u201d issues, according to state records. The governor\u2019s office has said Melissa DeRosa has been \u201cstrategizing with hospital leadership and business executives across the state to ensure frontline workers have the resources they need\u201d. While Azzopardi acknowledged in an email that Giorgio DeRosa\u2019s firm lobbies for GNYHA, he said: \u201cThis law was intended to increase capacity and provide quality care, and any suggestion otherwise is simply outrageous. Also: Melissa did not negotiate this bill, nor did anyone at that firm lobby on it.\u201d Giorgio and Joseph DeRosa were listed as lobbyists in GNYHA state disclosures for many years, including when Melissa DeRosa was serving as Cuomo\u2019s chief of staff. As of mid-2017, the DeRosas have no longer been listed as lobbyists on the association\u2019s disclosure forms. Bolton-St Johns spokesperson Justin Berhaupt said in an emailed statement that \u201cGiorgio DeRosa has never worked on issues related to GNYHA. \u201cHistorically, Bolton St Johns registered all of its lobbyists for all of its clients,\u201d Berhaupt explained. \u201cUpon Ms DeRosa becoming secretary to the governor, Bolton St Johns changed its policy and only registered Bolton St Johns\u2019 lobbyists for the specific clients they served.\u201d GNYHA spokesperson Brian Conway said in an emailed statement: \u201cGNYHA does not lobby on behalf of nursing homes.\u201d He added: \u201cWhen GNYHA lobbied for Covid-19-related immunity for hospitals and their workforce, we did not involve Bolton-St Johns.\u201d Since receiving large hospital and nursing home campaign donations, Cuomo has supported other legislation backed by those industries. His administration backed New York\u2019s first increase of Medicaid reimbursement rates in more than a decade, which is expected to deliver a windfall to private healthcare facilities. During his re-election campaign, Cuomo promised that he would support requiring hospitals and nursing homes to spend more on staffing, which proponents said would improve healthcare and safety, but could also reduce corporate profit margins. The governor subsequently only initiated a study of the issue \u2013 a move that the nursing home industry\u2019s lobbying group lauded. People are 7.5 times more likely to die from Covid-19 in states with corporate legal immunity As New York\u2019s state legislative session draws to a close this week, 14 Democratic legislators in Albany are sponsoring a bill to repeal Cuomo\u2019s corporate immunity law. In pushing for a vote on the legislation, bill author Kim is circulating a report to other lawmakers that he says shows that liability shields are linked to higher nursing home death rates. To date, 19 states have enacted some form of immunity for hospitals and nursing homes during the pandemic. Based on data reported by the New York Times, Kim\u2019s analysis asserts that more than three-quarters of total nursing home deaths from Covid-19 come from states that have granted corporate immunity to healthcare facilities. The analysis found that \u201cof the 10 states with the highest fatality rates, eight have corporate immunity and represent 93% of all fatalities, or 63,187 deaths\u201d. The report also says the data show that \u201cstates with corporate immunity saw more than three times the absolute number of fatalities than states without such immunity. The average rate of death per state is 7.5 times higher in states with corporate immunity than states with no immunity for corporations.\u201d In all, the report concludes: \u201c77% of total deaths come from states that gave immunity to corporations who owned nursing homes and healthcare facilities; moreover, 76% of total nursing home deaths come from states that have legal immunity status for these facilities.\u201d \u201cSimply put, people are 7.5 times more likely to die from Covid-19 in states with corporate legal immunity,\u201d Kim said. \u201cGiving immunity to corporations in care work before the apex of a pandemic leads to higher fatalities. It is clear that businesses, especially nursing homes that interface with Covid-19 positive individuals, are less compelled to implement proper procedures that save lives.\u201d Azzopardi disputed the report\u2019s findings, calling it a \u201cflaming hot pile of bad math and inaccurate, skewed metrics\u201d. He said the report initially overstated the per-capita death rate in the state\u2019s nursing homes, and he questioned whether it accounts for the fact that other states may share less information than New York. \u201cThe reality is the states cited happened to also be mainly those hardest hit east coast states that received the 3 million travelers from Europe, which brought the virus here for weeks after travel from China was blocked, greatly helping the west coast,\u201d Azzopardi said. \u2018The industry gets caught with its pants down \u2026 we\u2019re now telling them they don\u2019t have to wear pants\u2019 Azzopardi asserted that the new immunity law \u201cbuilds on NY Good Samaritan laws which say that if you provide medical help to someone at the scene of an accident in an emergency you are immune from suit\u201d. But some legal experts counter that the new provision represents a significant departure from the state\u2019s longstanding laws. Prior to the change, New York statutes went out of their way to declare that nursing home companies and their executives are liable for corporate misconduct. In one high-profile class action case in central New York last year, a judge denied James Square nursing home\u2019s motion to shield owners and shareholders from liability over allegations that the company\u2019s cost-cutting measures endangered patients. \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem with giving frontline workers immunity, it is the people who make the business decisions that kill people \u2013 they are the ones who have to be held personally responsible,\u201d said attorney Jeremiah Frei-Pearson, who represented James Square residents in their successful suit, which ultimately forced the company to spend more money to increase staffing at the facility. \u201cMany of the corporate owners are just trying to make money \u2013 they don\u2019t care about the elderly people in their custody, and if you take them off the hook, they are going to do the absolute minimum, which risks lives.\u201d Under Cuomo\u2019s new liability shield law, that kind of ruling may be harder to secure at a time when the Trump administration has been reducing fines against nursing home operators and is now suspending safety enforcement during the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a longstanding problem holding nursing homes responsible, because if you look at government enforcement, it\u2019s typically a slap on the wrist. A private lawsuit is often all you have left to hold a nursing home accountable,\u201d said Syracuse University\u2019s Kohn. \u201cGranting immunity sends a terrible message for the future. The industry gets caught with its pants down during the crisis, and we\u2019re now telling them they don\u2019t have to wear pants.\u201d They could sue but now because of this immunity they cannot As they push to expand immunity laws across the country, the hospital and nursing home industries have continued to cast their campaign as a necessary defense of medical workers. \u201cAs our care providers make these difficult decisions, they need to know they will not be prosecuted or persecuted,\u201d said an emblematic letter from industry groups pressing California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, to issue an executive order shielding them from legal liability. And yet Kohn\u2019s research shows that 16 out of the 19 states that created liability protections extended immunity to both individual workers and nursing home facilities as a whole. New York \u2013 unlike many other states \u2013 explicitly extended the immunity to company executives and corporate board members who are not on the frontlines, but who are making key budget and staffing decisions that affect workers and patients. Kim says that the expansion beyond healthcare workers is not an accident \u2013 he said it deliberately \u201cdiscourages medical staff and frontline workers in nursing homes from safely coming out against malpractices they might observe from executive leadership\u201d. That assertion was echoed by University of Wyoming law professor Michael Duff, one of the nation\u2019s leading experts on workplace law. He said that while the change does not modify traditional workers\u2019 compensation protections for hospital or nursing home employees, it could reduce the legal rights of contract workers to demand better safety protections at precisely the moment that healthcare facilities are outsourcing work to third-party staffing firms. \u201cOften medical personnel in operating rooms and emergency areas are contracted out [and] the same often goes for groups like janitorial services,\u201d said Duff, a former National Labor Relations Board investigator. \u201cOrdinarily, employees of the institutions would be unable to sue because of workers\u2019 compensation exclusive remedy rule. But independent contractors aren\u2019t bound by that rule. They could sue but now because of this immunity they cannot.\u201d For its part, the Cuomo administration has struck a defiant tone. During a televised press conference this weekend, DeRosa suggested that New York\u2019s nursing-home casualty rates are not anomalously high \u2013 and she argued that the state\u2019s \u201cconfirmed\u201d death rates are in line with other states, though others have asserted that the state has been undercounting nursing home casualties. Meanwhile, Cuomo has enlisted titans to lead a 15-member commission focused on \u201creimagining\u201d New York and its public policies. Among the panel members is Northwell Health\u2019s CEO, Michael Dowling, whose company operates two New York nursing homes where there have been Covid-related deaths. Northwell Health is a member of the hospital association that lobbied for the immunity provisions, and Dowling is a Cuomo donor. This story was reported by David Sirota for Jacobin magazine",

Ross said the way that Cummings had interpreted the lockdown rules was at odds with the vast majority of the public who followed them. The prime minister\u2019s key aide was defended this morning by the Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and at the daily press briefing by the health secretary Matt Hancock, who maintained his explanation had shown that he acted within the guidelines. A growing number of Tory MPs, however, disagree and have revolted against the government, calling for Cummings to either resign or be sacked.</li> \n   <li><strong>Westminster Opposition parties, bar Labour, penned a joint letter to the prime minister calling for Cummings to go</strong><em><strong>.</strong> </em>The leaders said in the letter, which was also sent to Patrick Vallance who chairs Sage, that the issue transcended politics and Cumming\u2019s behaviour is \u201ca matter of public health\u201d. The letter urged Boris Johnson to restore trust and clarity to public health messaging by sacking his key adviser. </li> \n   <li><strong>Matt Hancock said the government would review the fines imposed on families travelling during lockdown for childcare purposes.</strong> The pledge was made following a question from a member of the public at the daily press conference, which put Hancock on the spot.

Scottish Tory MSPs in particular are deeply vexed by the Cummings row, all too aware how it plays to Scottish voters in terms of entitlement of distant London elites, and no doubt missing their former leader Ruth Davidson\u2019s talent for distancing her group from Westminster clusterbourachs.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s worth remembering that these politicians face re-election next May, and are looking at Ipsos Mori polling for the BBC this morning that found 82% of Scots think <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> has handled the coronavirus crisis well, in contrast to 30% saying the same thing about Boris Johnson.</p> \n  <p>Plus, Ross, who unseated the SNP\u2019s then Westminster leader, Angus Robertson, in Moray in 2017, has a majority of little over 500, which can only sharpen his response to the outrage of constituents that he detailed in his resignation statement. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T10:44:55.300Z\">at 11.44am

It was more than 14 days after he had first shown symptoms of the virus. It was important, he believed, that he returned to work and, certainly, it\u2019s the case that his dedication to work is phenomenal. He wanted to make sure that before he took the journey down the A1 that he was safe to drive and, of course, during the course of that journey he confirmed to himself that he was safe to drive.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When highlighted that driving when your eyesight is not good enough is an offence under the Road Traffic Act, Gove replied: \u201cDominic\u2019s eyesight was good enough, that was the whole point of the journey, to determine that he could drive safely.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Pressed again over whether he was entirely happy with Cummings\u2019 explanation \u2013 especially given the trip to Barnard Castle was on his wife\u2019s birthday \u2013 Gove replied: \u201cYes, but, to my mind I can\u2019t see the relevance of that. He drove to Barnard Castle, the family stopped, he walked a few yards, sat on a bench for a short period of time, then walked back to the car and then drove back to his home. So, I think the fact that it also happens was Easter Sunday was immaterial.\u201d </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T08:53:47.849Z\">at 9.53am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eccb6f98f0886ce4f5da4fa\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/simon-murphy\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T06:30:23.686Z\">7.30am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Cummings continues to be under pressure over refusal to apologise for 264-mile lockdown trip</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good morning, readers. Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s UK coronavirus live blog.</p> \n  <p><strong>Dominic Cummings</strong>, the prime minister\u2019s most senior advisor, continues to be under fire over accusations he breached Covid-19 lockdown rules after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-refuses-to-resign-or-apologise-for-lockdown-breach\">refusing to apologise </a>and saying he does not regret his actions during an extraordinary press conference in Downing Street\u2019s Rose Garden. <br></p> \n  <p>It follows mounting pressure about the revelations \u2013 first revealed in a joint <strong>Guardian</strong> and <strong>Daily Mirror</strong> investigation \u2013 that he travelled 264 miles across the country from London to his parents\u2019 estate in Durham during lockdown despite suspecting that both he and his wife had coronavirus. Cummings also admitted he drove to a local beauty spot, Barnard Castle, 30 miles from Durham, which he claimed was necessary to check his eyesight was good enough for the longer drive back to London.</p> \n  <p>At least 20 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/fury-and-frustration-among-tory-mps-as-cummings-fights-on\">Tory MPs called for him to quit</a> and senior scientists accused him of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-durham-test-and-trace-coronavirus-self-isolate\">undermining public health advice</a>.

Thank you so much to everybody who got in touch throughout the day with tips and comments, and to everyone who thanked the Guardian for its coverage. It\u2019s safe to say my inbox has never been so ram packed as it\u2019s been today and, while it\u2019s impossible to reply to everyone, it\u2019s clear how much recent events have resonated with you and every message is hugely appreciated. I hope you\u2019ll join us again tomorrow as we continue to cover these important stories. In the meantime, you can follow the Guardian\u2019s worldwide coverage of the pandemic on the global live blog. A government minister has resigned and nearly 40 Conservative MPs, including the former attorney general Jeremy Wright, as well as the Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw, have called for Dominic Cummings to go, as pressure continues to mount on the top adviser to resign. The junior Scottish minister, Douglas Ross resigned from the government over its continued support for Cummings. Ross said the way that Cummings had interpreted the lockdown rules was at odds with the vast majority of the public who followed them. The prime minister\u2019s key aide was defended this morning by the Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and at the daily press briefing by the health secretary Matt Hancock, who maintained his explanation had shown that he acted within the guidelines. A growing number of Tory MPs, however, disagree and have revolted against the government, calling for Cummings to either resign or be sacked. Westminster Opposition parties, bar Labour, penned a joint letter to the prime minister calling for Cummings to go. The leaders said in the letter, which was also sent to Patrick Vallance who chairs Sage, that the issue transcended politics and Cumming\u2019s behaviour is \u201ca matter of public health\u201d. The letter urged Boris Johnson to restore trust and clarity to public health messaging by sacking his key adviser. Matt Hancock said the government would review the fines imposed on families travelling during lockdown for childcare purposes. The pledge was made following a question from a member of the public at the daily press conference, which put Hancock on the spot. The government then said Hancock had not announced a review, but that he had said he would pass on the concerns to colleagues. Matt Hancock described a new trial of the Remdesivir drug as \u201cthe biggest step forward\u201d in treatment since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis. The anti-viral drug was used during the Ebola outbreak, and the health secretary said early data suggests it can shorten recovery time from Covid-19 by four days. The UK\u2019s death toll passed 37,000, rising by 134 to 37,048. The ONS figure, however, which includes all deaths where Covid-19 is mentioned on the death certificate \u2013 so, both confirmed or suspected cases \u2013 is 42,173 deaths involving coronavirus in England and Wales were recorded to 15 May (registered up to 23 May). That is more than 30% higher than the DHSC total, which only includes deaths where a person has tested positive. There are nearly 300 more confirmed cases of Covid-19 among prison staff than previously thought, the Ministry of Justice has revealed. Due to a change in reporting of cases among prison staff, and an additional evaluation, there were 873 workers who had tested positive for the coronavirus as of 1pm on Tuesday, compared to 573 recorded as positive in the last update as of 5pm Thursday. There are now confirmed Covid-19 cases among staff at 104 prisons, nearly 90% of the 117 jails in England and Wales. The previous update revealed cases in 77 jails. The figures do not represent live cases and the MoJ said the higher figure should not be interpreted as a rise in the previous total provided, adding that the overall declining trend in new cases continues. The number of confirmed cases of the virus among prisoners is 445 across 77 prisons, a nearly 2% rise in five days. The number of cases and deaths in prisons have been much lower than expected in part due to the highly restrictive regime introduced in March, which means prisoners are spending less than an hour of their day out of their cells. Q. Cumbria is among the hardest hit areas, what tools will you give local authorities to deal with any future regional or local flare-ups? Q. How will you ensure healthcare staff don\u2019t face future risk as a result of PPE that was not fit-tested? Hancock says on second checking, some PPE items that were put in the stockpile had to be withdrawn as they didn\u2019t meet requirements. He says he\u2019s told that clinicians said the risk was low in those settings. Newton adds there are national resources, eg the contact tracing system and the app, as well as regional and local ones, eg councils. The whole of civic society needs to be involved as we\u2019re all affected by it, he says. Q. Can you ask people/families with no symptoms to self-isolate when the people giving the orders aren\u2019t following them? Hancock says it\u2019s important people play their part in the test and trace programme. People are doing this for their loved ones, he says. If you\u2019re phoned up and asked to self-isolate because you\u2019ve been in close contact with someone who\u2019s tested positive, it\u2019s your civic duty to then self-isolate for yourself, your community and your family, he says. This will allow us to start lifting blanket measures, he adds. Q. How important is it to the success of the test and trace project that people obey the instructions they\u2019re given to the letter and to the spirit? Q. Can people follow their instincts to interpret the guidance given to them by contact tracers? Hancock says the programme will be incredibly important in trying to move to a system of more targeted lockdown, e.g. local lockdowns if there are flare-ups, isolating individuals. Newton says it\u2019s very important but it must work alongside physical distancing measures and basic hygiene. Clear instructions will be given \u2013 they will phrased as instructions, rather than advice \u2013 and we do expect people to follow them, he adds. Q. According to a poll conducted after that press conference, 71% of the public believe Dominic Cummings broke the lockdown. Are you saying they misunderstood those rules and if so, does that mean you failed drafting them? Q. Would you now advise people to use that discretion or is that discretion just for people who work in Downing Street? Hancock says it\u2019s incredibly important that people follow the guidelines. He says the guidelines say that if you have adults who are unable to look after a child that is an exceptional circumstance. Therefore, Cummings\u2019 explanation was within the guidelines, though reasonable people may disagree, he says. He moves swiftly on with no follow-up. Q. 71% of people disagree with you and think Dominic Cummings did break the rules and confidence in the government has plummeted 20 points in four days. How much does this loss of confidence worry you? Q. What do you say to people who think you are risking people\u2019s health to save one adviser? Hancock says he understands and regrets the anger that people feel, and that Cummings has said he should have got the facts out earlier. He says it\u2019s entirely reasonable for people to disagree with what happened. He\u2019s here to focus on and drive forward all the other important things that need to be done, he says. He moves swiftly on without allowing a follow-up. Q. You and your wife both tested positive for Covid-19 and you have three young children. What\u2019s the relevant difference between you and Dominic Cummings? Hancock says he had childcare readily available at home; Cummings didn\u2019t. He moves swiftly on with no follow-up given. They are taking questions from journalists now. Q. Nearly 40 of your colleagues believe the PM\u2019s top adviser let the country down. Do you feel that way, or at least see why they do? Hancock says Cummings set out all the details on this yesterday. What he did was within the guidelines, though he can understand why reasonable people would disagree, he says. The guidelines allow for exceptional circumstances in the case of a small child, he says, so he acted within the guidelines. Q. Do you accept that it\u2019s damaging the government\u2019s credibility and undermining the message? Hancock says it\u2019s incredibly important people keep their resolve and play their part by acting responsibly both for themselves and for their community. Ellie from Kent asks if people can start to shop for non-essential items and kids can return to school, why can\u2019t we visit another household who we know have been self-isolating. Hancock says he understands people\u2019s yearning to see loved ones, but it\u2019s difficult to know where the virus has passed from and to. They are looking at how to do this in a safe way, he says. Newton says if social distancing measures are being implemented properly, the risk of transmission is low. Whereas, the risk within households is highest, he says, so the advice has to be different. The gradual increase in contact will get us all back to normal, but everything has risk attached to it, he adds. They are taking questions from members of the public now. Martin from Brighton asks whether the government will review all penalty fines imposed on families travelling for childcare purposes during lockdown. It\u2019s a very good question, Hancock says. They understand the impact and need for adequate childcare, one of the significant concerns they\u2019ve had during this time, he says. He says he will discuss with Treasury colleagues and write to Martin with a full answer and commits to making an announcement on this topic. Prof Newton is going through the slides now. There is a small trend upwards in car use, commensurate with the gradual easing of lockdown, he says. The numbers of tests are fluctuating on a day-to-day basis as is expected, he says. The seven-day rolling average in confirmed cases is trending downwards, which is promising, he says. The number of admissions to hospital with Covid-19 is 471, down from 639, the lowest number since this data started being collected on 20 March, Newton says. The number of patients on mechanical ventilators is also falling steadily, he says. There is a steady, although slow, decline being seen all over the country, he says. The numbers of registered deaths with confirmed or suspected coronavirus are falling, he says, and 23% of Covid-related deaths have occurred in care homes. R&amp;D into treatments taking place across the UK is leading the world, Hancock says. Not every project will bear fruit but every possible avenue will be explored, he says. Hancock announces a new trial for selected NHS patients of an anti-viral drug called remdesivir. There have already been some promising early results on coronavirus patients, with early data indicating it can shorten recovery time by around four days, he says. Use of this treatment will be prioritised where it can give the greatest benefit, he adds. This is the biggest step forward in treatment since the crisis began, he says. He will provide an update on PPE and treatments, Hancock says. Contracts have now been signed to manufacture 2m items of PPE in the UK, he says. Around the world, deals have been signed with more than 100 suppliers, he adds. There\u2019s a long way to go but this is significant progress, he says. Today\u2019s figures from the ONS show the lowest levels of deaths from coronavirus in six weeks, Hancock says. We can\u2019t let up on this, he says. The number of deaths is falling. We must keep our resolve. The health secretary is speaking now. He is joined by Prof John Newton, the government\u2019s test and trace coordinator. Hancock goes over the daily figures: For the first time since the 18 March, yesterday there were no deaths from coronavirus recorded in Northern Ireland, Hancock says. He pays tribute to the efforts of the public and health authorities in achieving this. As the government grapples with a ministerial resignation and a growing Tory revolt \u2013 with more than 30 of its own MPs now calling for Dominic Cummings to resign \u2013 the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, will front this afternoon\u2019s press conference, which is due to begin shortly. All pupils in Scotland will return to schools on 11 August, to begin a new model of \u201cblended\u201d learning in school and at home, Scotland\u2019s education secretary, John Swinney, has told the Holyrood parliament this afternoon. He added that councils will be asked to expand the school estate by using community facilities and vacant office accommodation, to allow children to spend as much time with their friends as possible. He also acknowledged the difficulty of enforcing physical distancing between younger children, which would likewise be helped by offering more indoor space. Recognising the difficulties faced by parents, Swinney said employers were being encouraged to allow working from home wherever possible \u2013 but didn\u2019t really address how parents are expected to carry on long-term semi-home schooling alongside their own working commitments. He confirmed that the Scottish government has ordered 25,000 laptops for disadvantaged children to support them with home-learning. At this stage in the day, this has already been pointed out by many but I thought it should still make the blog. The saying \u201cCome, come! That\u2019s Barney Castle!\u201d is old Durham slang for \u201can expression often uttered when a person is heard making a bad excuse in a still worse cause\u201d. In other words, a pathetic excuse for their actions. Do with that what you will. The Tory former attorney general Jeremy Wright QC has added his name to the growing list of Tory MPs calling for Dominic Cummings to go. The Kenilworth and Southam MP wrote on his website that it could be argued that Cummings did not technically breach the lockdown laws, although he did call for further explanation. However, in determining what should happen now, technical compliance cannot be the only consideration. Our continued success in combating the virus may well rely on more of that and Mr Cummings\u2019 actions and his justification of them will, in my judgment, make it less likely that others will continue to interpret those exceptional circumstances clauses restrictively. This is more important than the position of any individual in Downing Street and therefore, fairly or unfairly, I have concluded that it would be better for Mr Cummings to leave his position at Downing Street. Philip Davies, the Shipley MP, has called on Dominic Cummings to \u201cdo the honourable thing and resign\u201d, according to the Telegraph and Argus. In his statement, he added that the prime minister\u2019s key aide \u201cno longer has trust of the overwhelming majority of the public\u201d and that Cummings should repay Boris Johnson\u2019s loyalty to him by resigning. The Conservative rebellion continues to grow, with the former minister Harriett Baldwin calling for Dominic Cummings to resign. The MP for West Worcestershire said: While I have every human sympathy with Dominic Cummings, I think there is a higher bar for members of the government. If the government wants people to follow the public health advice in order to protect our NHS and save lives, then members of the government giving that advice, including the prime minister\u2019s adviser, need to follow it too. The government relies on moral authority to receive the consent of the people to such draconian reductions in their freedoms. Therefore, for the sake of future adherence to public health guidelines, I believe he should resign. The Tory MP Christian Wakeford said Dominic Cummings should have been \u201creprimanded\u201d for his actions which broke the \u201cspirit \u2013 if not the letter \u2013 of the guidance\u201d. The Bury South MP said: We cannot give the impression there is one rule for some and another for the rest. Writing on Facebook, Wakeford said: In my opinion he has broken the spirit \u2013 if not the letter \u2013 of the guidance designed to limit the spread of coronavirus. He should now have the courage to admit his judgment was questionable, and should be reprimanded. He has undermined the essence of the government\u2019s key stay at home messaging and has muddied the messaging moving forward when we need clarity more than ever.

Your thoughts are always welcome and apologies in advance if I can\u2019t reply to everyone. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ Conservative MP and former health secretary Jeremy Hunt has said he does think Dominic Cummings breached lockdown rules, but doesn\u2019t think he should resign. In a letter to a constituent, seen by the Guardian, Hunt said: Having watched the broadcast yesterday, my own view is that what he did was a clear breach of the lockdown rules - coming back into work when he had been with his wife who was ill, driving to Durham instead of staying at home and visiting Barnard Castle. These were clearly mistakes - both in terms of the guidance which was crystal clear, and in terms of the signal it would potentially give out to others as someone who was at the centre of government. However, he said he will not add his voices to the list of those calling for Cummings to resign, adding that \u201cas someone who has been at the centre of media storms with a young family, I know you do make mistakes in these situations\u201d. I am also not convinced that politics gains much from the spectacle of scalp-hunting even though I recognise that accountability is central to our democracy and sometimes people do need to resign. He concluded by saying it was more important to hold the government to account on \u201cwhether we really are going to follow global best practice and introduce Korean/German track and trace so we kill off a second wave of the virus and get the economy back on its feet.\u201d \u201cI will be questioning the Prime Minister about this at the Liaison Committee on Wednesday,\u201d he said. \u201cI actually think this matters far more than Dominic Cummings although I am sure he will get plenty of questions on that too.\u201d Three people were arrested after an illegal rave was held at a nature reserve near the centre of Leeds, police have said. Local groups have claimed that up to 200 people were involved in the party at the Kirkstall Valley nature reserve, on the banks of the River Aire on Monday evening. West Yorkshire police said young people were seen wading across the river to get to the party and officers were called at 6.37pm. A spokesman said: There were also concerns for the safety of individuals attending, as a shallow part of the river was being used as a crossing. Officers attended alongside other emergency services and three arrests were made. Sound equipment was also seized. Supt Chris Bowen said: \u201cWe would urge people to consider their own safety and the safety of others, particularly during the warmer weather and the ongoing period of lockdown.\u201d Members of a Kirkstall community group on Facebook expressed their anger about the damage to the reserve. A post read: Well the fine youth of Leeds ONCE AGAIN show NO RESPECT for wildlife in bird breeding season never mind lockdown. Once again on the Kirkstall Valley Nature Reserve, youths, people have a full blown amped up music rave on the nature reserve last night from approx 9pm. Not content with the damage they caused at the last one in 2018 burning down meadows full of moths and butterflies and causing disturbance to waterfowl wildlife. This time it was on the protected nature reserve island. The group said bird life will have been scared away from their nests by the ravers, and chicks and nests will have been abandoned or trodden on. They wrote: \u201cWe are left heart broken for the likely damage to birds nests and their young and to other species breeding at this time of year. \u201cWe are DISGUSTED with the LITTLE RESPECT people show for wildlife thinking only of themselves and where they can get the next high from.\u201d The Scottish conservative leader, Jackson Carlaw, has finally called for Dominic Cummings to resign, after coming under intense pressure while a number of his own MSPs expressed their strong support for their colleague Douglas Ross, who resigned as a UK government minister earlier today in protest at the Cummings row. After an earlier equivocal statement, in which he said that \u201cthis is a difficult situation for many, and people will arrive at different judgments,\u201d Carlaw told STV this afternoon: It is absolutely a matter for the prime minister himself who serves him and for how long they serve but given the furore, given the distraction we are now in, given the distraction to the prime minister onto this issue if I were Mr Cummings I would be considering my position. A number of the Scottish Conservative MSP group called directly for Cummings to quit as they expressed their solidarity with Ross. Adam Tomkins described Ross\u2019s resignation as \u201ca disaster\u201d, stating: \u201cHis was one of clearest voices for the union in government. It shows exactly why Cummings should be sacked.\u201d A number of senior Holyrood colleagues followed suit, privately expressing frustration at Carlaw\u2019s weak initial statement. With Holyrood elections only 12 months away, Scottish Tories are all too aware of how this plays to Scottish voters in terms of the apparent entitlement of distant London elites. The leaders of opposition parties (excluding Labour) have sent a joint letter to the prime minister, urging him to sack Dominic Cummings over his lockdown breaches. The letter, which was also forwarded to Sir Patrick Vallance, chair of Sage, reads: It is now a matter of record that Mr Dominic Cummings broke multiple lockdown rules. He is yet to express any apology or contrition for these actions. There cannot be one rule for those involved in formulating public health advice and another for the rest of us. This is an issue that transcends politics. It has united people of every party and political persuasion, who believe strongly that it is now your responsibility as Prime Minister to return clarity and trust in public health messaging. We are clear that this can now only be achieved by removing Dominic Cummings from his post without further delay. The letter was signed by: Ian Blackford, SNP Sir Ed Davey, Liberal Democrats Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru Colum Eastwood, Social Democratic and Labour party Caroline Lucas, Green party Stephen Farry, Alliance party Scots should wear face coverings whenever travelling on public transport, other than ferries, the Scottish government\u2019s transport secretary has announced, as he published further travel guidance in advance of the easing of lockdown restrictions across the country on Thursday. Michael Matheson told the Holyrood chamber: Even with the measures being put in place by transport operators, it may be difficult for people to maintain physical distancing throughout their journey in some forms of public transport. I know these are real concerns of the travelling public, operators and transport staff. For that reason, people should, and are expected to, wear face coverings as an additional measure when using public transport and as a consideration to staff and fellow passengers. Matheson urged the public and employers to \u201cadapt to a new environment which has flexible and remote working at its core\u201d as he revealed that transport operators estimate capacity will be between 10% and 25% of normal availability even with full services resumed. He said that there remains a need to reduce demand for transport, and encouraged employers to show as much flexibility as possible, allowing later or earlier starting times as well as encouraging home working in order to flatten peak travel demand. He said there would be a strong focus on active travel \u2013 like walking and cycling - through a range of schemes, including the national cycle training scheme for schoolchildren. Charity shops are expecting a large volume of donations when they reopen and plan to isolate items for 72 hours before they go on sale as part of measures to ensure the safety of customers. The government said charity shops are among retailers that can resume trading from 15 June, but at least one charity is saying it will only commit to reopening once it is \u201csafe to do so\u201d. Charities are asking people who have spent time decluttering their homes during lockdown not to leave donations outside shops and to be \u201cthoughtful\u201d about when they donate. The government is also being urged to give more \u201cdefinitive\u201d guidelines regarding how long items should be left before being put out on sale. Oxfam said it was working on a \u201cdetailed plan\u201d to enable its shops to reopen but does not currently have a confirmed date, and pointed out that many of its 20,000 shop volunteers are elderly people. The charity said in a statement: We are following government advice and are taking comprehensive steps to create a safe environment, including ensuring social distancing within the shops, providing personal protective equipment, regular cleaning of all surfaces, doors and equipment, and the isolation of donated items for 72 hours prior to listing for sale. Traid (Textile Reuse and International Development) is planning a phased reopening of its charity shops around 18 June, beginning with the most spacious stores in Dalston, Kilburn, Peckham and Shepherd\u2019s Bush. Chief executive Maria Chenoweth said: Currently, the Charity Retail Association recommends quarantining clothes and textile donations for 72 hours, which we are able to do. However, Traid is keen for something more definitive from the government regarding how long clothes and textile donations should be left before putting on sale. The British Heart Foundation said \u201ca small number\u201d of its shops will reopen from mid-June, with the rest to reopen over the following weeks once safety measures are established. Hi everyone, this is Jessica Murray, I\u2019ll be steering the blog for the next hour. Feel free to get in touch with your comments and story suggestions. Email: jessica.murray@theguardian.com Twitter: @journojess_ Across all settings, the number of confirmed reported deaths in the UK has risen to 37,048, the Department of Health and Social Care said. That is an increase of 134. Another Tory MP, Mark Harper, has said Dominic Cummings should have offered to resign. The Forest of Dean MP said in a statement shared on Twitter that Cummings\u2019 decision to travel to Durham \u201cis certainly not the conclusion I would have reached, given the sacrifices many are having to make in the interests of the nation\u2019s health\u201d. More damningly, he wrote: As for the trip to Barnard Castle on 12 April, there is no credible justification for this. In these circumstances, as an absolute minimum, an apology should have been made and level of regret expressed. I am disappointed that Mr Cummings did neither. Artists in rural and urban locations across the world have been invited to create temporary light installations in their homes at dusk over the weekend of Friday 29 \u2013 Sunday 31 May as part of the online art project Lockdown and Light. The project has been developed by Suffolk-based artists David Campbell Baldry and Jane Watt as part of the ongoing biennial series Landscape and Light. They hope the installations will be visible to neighbours and passersby. To take part, participants are asked to upload still or moving images of their installations to Instagram and tag with #lockdownandlight and @lockdownandlight. People in England could be allowed to socialise in larger groups in gardens or parks, Michael Gove has confirmed, but visiting family and friends indoors still appears some way off, my colleague Rowena Mason reports. Speaking to broadcast media this morning, Gove signalled the possibility of more outdoor meetings \u2013 discussed at cabinet \u2013 could pave the way for barbecues, garden parties and other forms of socialising, although it is likely the physical distancing rules would still apply. However, the prime minister gave no update about this on Sunday or Monday when he spoke at the daily press conference, while Gove talked only about bigger outdoor meetings being allowed \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d. Gove also suggested it would be some time before pubs, restaurants, cafes and bars would return to normal. There have been zero new deaths from coronavirus reported today in Northern Ireland by the Department of Health. The overall total according to the department remains at 514. Public Health Wales said a further eight people have died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths in Wales to 1,282. Another 141 people have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 13,556. The Tory former minister Stephen Hammond told his constituents in Wimbledon that Dominic Cummings\u2019 actions may have undermined efforts to protect people from coronavirus, and he should have quit. He said: Whilst one might have some sympathy with his motives and his concern for his family, I am angry that so many have sacrificed so much for public safety and yet this man has decided his interpretation of \u2018doing the right thing\u2019 overrode the clear instruction of stay at home. It is clear to me that Mr Cummings has broken some of the guidelines which we all were instructed to follow. He added: Public adherence to the rules is achieved by consent in this country and that is made much harder if people feel it is one rule for them and another for senior government advisers. A threatening email sent to the bishop of Ripon is being investigated by North Yorkshire police, the force has confirmed. Rev Helen-Ann Hartley said she had received a message on Sunday saying, \u201cStay out of politics or it will be the death of you\u201d, following her criticism of the government over the Dominic Cummings row. Hartley said she was following up the hate email with police, and the North Yorkshire force said in a statement: A complaint has been made to North Yorkshire police and inquiries are ongoing into the matter. The bishop previously said in a Twitter post that the government lacked \u201cintegrity, trust and leadership\u201d in response to Boris Johnson\u2019s press conference defending Cummings on Sunday. She added she missed her father\u2019s birthday during the lockdown as he recovered from radiotherapy. Tenants could face eviction without any legal representation when the coronavirus crisis freeze on home repossessions is lifted next month, according to warning letters sent out by county courts in London. The letter detailing \u201carrangements for listing possession claims\u201d at Brentford and Uxbridge county courts was circulated to organisations and lawyers involved in housing cases. It said hearings would restart from 29 June after the temporary suspension of mortgage and tenancy home repossession cases is lifted. Initially many cases will have to be heard over video links while social distancing requirements remain in place. \u201cThe result is likely to be that, at least until the autumn, most possession hearings will take place remotely ie not by way of a face-to-face hearing in our court building,\u201d the official communication states. There \u201cwill be no physical presence of the parties or their representatives at the court building\u201d and consequently staff will have to \u201cencourage the taking of early legal aid assistance by defendants, point out that there will almost certainly be no \u2018duty solicitor\u2019 scheme in operation [and] stress will have to file and serve in advance of the hearing a witness statement/bundle with all the evidence needed ...\u201d Sue James of Hammersmith and Fulham Law Centre, a solicitor specialising in housing cases, questioned whether those in danger of losing their homes would all have the necessary technology to participate in remote hearings to enable them to prevent evictions or ability to consult lawyers in advance. Other courts around the country are preparing a variety of approaches. \u201cThere should be a uniform policy,\u201d James said. \u201cYou can\u2019t start from the premise that there will be no duty solicitors. At court you normally talk to the tenant and landlord before the hearing. Tenants may not have computers to access the court remotely or have sufficient credit on their phones. Remote hearings for repossession cases are not workable.\u201d Following his press conference, 59% of Britons think Dominic Cummings should resign from his role as Boris Johnson\u2019s senior adviser over his conduct during lockdown, a poll suggests. The YouGov poll found 27% of those surveyed believe Cummings should not resign while 14% answered \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d. The data showed 52% of those surveyed who voted leave in the 2016 EU referendum want Cummings to resign, with 38% answering \u201cshould not resign\u201d and 10% \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d. YouGov said it surveyed 1,160 adults on Tuesday. At her daily press briefing, Nicola Sturgeon set out further detail of the Scottish government\u2019s new test and protect strategy, which will go live across all of Scotland\u2019s health board areas on Thursday, the same day as the country\u2019s lockdown restrictions are due to be eased. The first minister said the required capacity of more than 15,000 tests a day was now in place, and around 700 contact tracers will be needed in the early phase, although by the end of the month there will be a pool of around 2,000 to draw on. From Thursday, if people develop coronavirus symptoms they must book a test immediately and isolate themselves. If the test is positive, they will then hear from a tracer who will ask them about recent contacts in the community. Sturgeon emphasised that people\u2019s data would be secure and only available to NHS Scotland. She said that, like lockdown measures, the test and protect system was a \u201ccollective national endeavour\u201d. She stressed that it should not be considered optional, with everyone needing to play their part to ensure its success. Here are some key points from this afternoon\u2019s lobby briefing, as Downing Street continues to grapple with the row over Dominic Cummings. No 10 has reiterated its support for Dominic Cummings over allegations he breached the lockdown. The PM\u2019s official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: From the prime minister\u2019s point of view, he has set out that he believes Dominic Cummings acted reasonably, legally and with integrity and with care for his family and for others. Downing Street declined to answer numerous queries that remain unresolved after Cummings\u2019 response to allegations he breached the lockdown, saying the adviser had \u201canswered questions extensively\u201d. The spokesman said: I can\u2019t be a spokesman for special advisers, that\u2019s not my job. If you have questions in that regard they\u2019ll have to go elsewhere I\u2019m afraid. The PM asked Dominic Cummings to set out his explanation in public and he did that last night, he answered questions extensively. Downing Street defended having previously told journalists Dominic Cummings was isolating at home during the lockdown. The spokesman said he did not know the aide\u2019s actual location at the time but had been pointing out he was not working in No 10. Asked if he meant Cummings was in London, the spokesman said: No, and the context of my answer was pointing out he wasn\u2019t at work. Asked if he knew where Mr Cummings was at the time, the spokesman said: No. As in he wasn\u2019t at work, I simply meant it in that context. Downing Street was unable to explain why it said in a statement on Saturday that Dominic Cummings\u2019 wife had been infected with suspected coronavirus, which the aide later contradicted. The spokesman said: He set out his account of what had happened yesterday. I think it was a very full and detailed account and there\u2019s nothing for me to add to it. This is from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby, highlighting more inconsistencies between Cummings\u2019 rose garden statement and his wife Mary Wakefield\u2019s piece in the Spectator. Asked about her reaction to the resignation of Scotland office minister Douglas Ross (see 9.31am.), the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said \u201cfair play to him\u201d. She added that while she had already made clear her views on the handling of the row and the \u201cretrospective rewriting of the rules\u201d, she believed Ross had taken a \u201cprincipled position\u201d. An NHS doctor has launched a legal challenge against the government for \u201cthe lack of protection provided by our ministers\u201d. Dr Meenal Viz said: I\u2019ve seen many of my colleagues suffer and die due to the lack of protection provided by our ministers. It was one death that hit home, the death of pregnant nurse Mary Agyapong - I held a one-woman protest outside Downing Street to show our ministers that we won\u2019t stay silent and watch our colleagues die. I attended her funeral last week and saw the true depth of the grief that families are now going through. Viz, who is also pregnant and has launched the legal action with her husband, said the government needed to be held accountable for its mistakes and had to \u201cstep up for all the doctors across the country\u201d to protect all healthcare workers. The peri-peri chicken restaurant chain Nando\u2019s has announced the reopening of a further 54 outlets for delivery and collection across the UK and Ireland, with 40 more due to reopen on Wednesday. In a carefully monitored trial, it has until now only reopened a handful for delivery only. All delivery orders placed through the Nando\u2019s website can earn reward points which can be redeemed when the restaurants eventually open their doors for a full dine-in service. The menu will be reduced to help staff maintain physical distancing in the kitchen and food preparation areas. Each restaurant was working under strict government guidelines on top of existing health and safety procedures, Nando\u2019s said. Every staff member was washing their hands more frequently and PPE was available for all staff to wear. Designated waiting areas had been set up for drivers and collection customers, and order volumes would be monitored to avoid queues building up. The full list of restaurants reopening is here. A total of 1,200 patients are in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon said. That represents a total decrease of 69 from yesterday, including a decrease of 16 in the number of confirmed cases. The first minister confirmed 36 people last night were in intensive care with confirmed or suspected Covid-19. That is a decrease of four since yesterday. Since 5 March, 3,589 patients who had tested positive and required hospitalisation had been able to leave hospital. And in the past 24 hours, 18 deaths have been registered of patients who had tested positive for the virus. That takes the total number of deaths in Scotland under that measurement to 2,291. The supercar maker McLaren Group has announced that 1,200 jobs will be lost across its operations, representing around a quarter of its workforce. The Surrey-based firm said in a statement: Like many businesses, McLaren has been severely affected by the current pandemic. The cancellation of motorsport events, the suspension of manufacturing and retail activities around the world and reduced demand for technology solutions have all led to a sudden impact on the group\u2019s revenue-generating activities. McLaren said the new annual spending cap for Formula One teams also led to the job losses. For some, lockdown has felt like an eternity, but many key workers have continued to go to work through unprecedented circumstances. In this video, Owen Jones asked four people \u2013 a postal worker, a cycle courier, a care home worker and a security guard \u2013 to give insight to their working life during the pandemic, and whether enough has been done to protect them from Covid-19. The Welsh health minister, Vaughan Gething, has said he would no longer be in his position if he had been caught in a similar situation to Dominic Cummings. He told BBC Radio Wales: If it was me, and say my mum lived in Barmouth and I had driven from just outside Cardiff to Barmouth, because I was worried about my son, and I\u2019d stayed on the edge of her property to do so, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have lasted the end of the day once that story had broken. Asked if he would have resigned, Gething said: I think I\u2019d have had to, or the first minister would have told me that my time was up anyway, because I think for a minister, I don\u2019t see how I could possibly have stayed in office. He added: I\u2019ve got real sympathy for lots of other families who have made difficult choices to follow the rules, and that\u2019s the problem here, isn\u2019t it? With the number of Tory MPs going public with their outrage over Dominic Cummings still climbing, this morning\u2019s London Playbook highlighted that Cummings\u2019 rose garden address has also angered members of the cabinet. This piece in the Times (paywall) reveals that some senior ministers are furious that he hasn\u2019t been dismissed, though nobody else in the government has yet followed the junior minister Douglas Ross in resigning in protest (see 9:31am.). One told the Times: My jaw continues to drop. He\u2019s saying he\u2019s so much more important than us plebs. I think we\u2019re in big trouble, we can\u2019t campaign our way out of this. We\u2019re losing trust and confidence \u2014 it\u2019s draining away before our eyes. The fact he didn\u2019t apologise speaks volumes. Another said: If people really start to think that senior people in government aren\u2019t following their own rules, that will be catastrophic. The article also reveals that ministers whipped into tweeting support for Cummings when the story broke on Friday \u201cprivately admit to feeling demeaned\u201d. What we can only assume added to that feeling is the revelation that the cabinet wasn\u2019t even told that the rose garden press conference was happening. This is from ITV\u2019s Paul Brand Indeed it wouldn\u2019t take long to scroll through Twitter to find examples of anecdotal evidence over the weekend of Cummings\u2019 name cited in excuses for ignoring the lockdown. Just one example from LBC\u2019s Iain Dale, who tweeted on Sunday: A friend just asked when I\u2019m coming to visit, and another told me he\u2019s got his haircut. When I declined the first one cos you\u2019re not allowed and queried whether the second was allowed, both independently said if D Cummings can do it so can they. Another Tory MP, Mark Pawsey, has come out saying that Dominic Cummings \u201cacted against the spirit of the lockdown\u201d and called for Boris Johnson to sack him. Here is an extract: I believe that it is wrong that Mr Cummings remains in an important post in government. I had hoped he that would tender his resignation of his own accord. As he has failed to do so, I now believe it is right for the prime minister to ask for his resignation. In another muted response from a senior Scottish Tory to the resignation of Douglas Ross (see 9:31am.), the Scotland secretary, Alister Jack, has thanked Ross for his contribution to the Scotland Office, adding: I know he will continue to be a dedicated and hardworking constituency MP for Moray. Meanwhile, Douglas Cameron MSP has joined his Holyrood colleague Adam Tomkins in publicly backing the stand that Ross has taken. While others have simply retweeted Ross\u2019s statement or remained silent \u2013 for now \u2013 this speaks volumes in contrast to the tepid statement of the Scottish Tory leader, Jackson Carlaw earlier. And in private, Scottish Tory MSPs in particular are deeply vexed by the Cummings row, all too aware how it plays to Scottish voters in terms of entitlement of distant London elites, and no doubt missing their former leader Ruth Davidson\u2019s talent for distancing her group from Westminster clusterbourachs. It\u2019s worth remembering that these politicians face re-election next May, and are looking at Ipsos Mori polling for the BBC this morning that found 82% of Scots think Nicola Sturgeon has handled the coronavirus crisis well, in contrast to 30% saying the same thing about Boris Johnson. Plus, Ross, who unseated the SNP\u2019s then Westminster leader, Angus Robertson, in Moray in 2017, has a majority of little over 500, which can only sharpen his response to the outrage of constituents that he detailed in his resignation statement. During that press conference on Monday, Dominic Cummings claimed that he had been worried about a pandemic for some time and that last year he had written about the possible threat of coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning. However, Jens Wiechers, a data scientist, put Cummings\u2019 blogpost mentioning coronaviruses through the Wayback Machine \u2013 a digital archive \u2013 and found that the relevant paragraphs had been added on 14 April \u2013 the day Cummings returned to work after the trip to Durham. The BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam\u2019s thread has more on this story: The veteran Tory MP Sir Roger Gale said the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee should make it clear to Boris Johnson that Dominic Cummings should go. Sir Roger, who has been an MP for almost four decades, said: The time I think has come for Mr Cummings to resign or for the PM to dispense of his services. The North Thanet MP told the PA news agency: There are people on the 1922 executive who are courageous, and that\u2019s their job. They are elected to tell the PM what he needs to hear, not what he wants to hear. Gale was one of the first wave of Tory MPs to say publicly that Cummings\u2019 position was \u201cuntenable\u201d and he needed to go. He told Sky News on Sunday: How can I go on asking people to show self restraint when a very senior member of the government isn\u2019t? Good morning. I\u2019m Lucy Campbell, taking over the live blog for the rest of the day. Please do get in touch with news tips, ideas, comments and suggestions. Your thoughts are always welcome! Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ Tory MP William Wragg, chairman of the influential Commons public administration and constitutional affairs select committee, has added his name to a growing list of Conservatives revolting against Dominic Cummings. He has tweeted this morning: The MP had previously retweeted Steve Baker\u2019s call for Cummings to go. Here\u2019s some more detail on the Office for National Statistics figures released earlier about the Covid-19 death toll. There were 42,173 deaths involving Covid-19 in England and Wales up to May 15 (and which were registered up to May 23), according to the ONS. This compares with 31,944 deaths of people testing positive for Covid-19 reported by the Department of Health and Social Care for the same period. The ONS total is 32% higher than the Department of Health total. PA reports this is because the ONS figures include all mentions of Covid-19 on a death certificate, including suspected Covid-19, and are based on the date that deaths occurred. The Department of Health figures are based on when deaths were reported, and are for deaths where a person has tested positive for Covid-19. There are signs of tensions within Scottish Tory ranks after the resignation of the Scotland Office minister Douglas Ross. Adam Tomkins MSP, the Scottish Tory constitution spokesperson, described the resignation as a \u201cdisaster\u201d, saying that it underlined why Cummings should be sacked. This came in contrast to Scottish Conservative leader, Jackson Carlaw, who on Sunday offered a fairly lukewarm response to Boris Johnson\u2019s backing of Cummings, saying it was \u201ca situation for him to judge\u201d. Carlaw issued a similarly brief statement saying that he \u201crespects\u201d the decision of Ross to resign over the ongoing row, and describing it as a \u201chuge loss to government\u201d. Carlaw said: I accept Douglas\u2019s position and respect the decision he has come to. This is a difficult situation for many, and people will arrive at different judgments. Douglas will be a huge loss to government and I thank him for all he\u2019s done at the Scotland Office. I am in no doubt that he will continue to serve his Moray constituents with diligence and commitment, as he has done since first being elected.\u201d Meanwhile, the former Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson expressed her own sadness at the resignation, describing Ross as a \u201ctalented minister\u201d. Away from Westminster, it has emerged that this year\u2019s Turner Prize has been cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Ten one-off bursaries of \u00a310,000 will be awarded to artists instead, with awardees picked by this year\u2019s jury and announced in June. Director of Tate Britain and chair of the Turner Prize jury, Alex Farquharson, said: \u201cGallery closures and social distancing measures are vitally important, but they are also causing huge disruption to the lives and livelihoods of artists. \u201cThe practicalities of organising a Turner Prize exhibition are impossible in the current circumstances, so we have decided to help support even more artists during this exceptionally difficult time.\u201d The Scottish National party and Liberal Democrats have both seized on Douglas Ross\u2019s ministerial resignation, renewing calls for Dominic Cummings to go. The SNP\u2019s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, tweeted: This will have been a difficult decision to make and I respect Douglas Ross for taking it. This issue transcends politics. It is about protecting trust and confidence in the public health advice. The prime minister must remove Dominic Cummings from his post without further delay. Acting Liberal Democrats leader, Sir Ed Davey, tweeted: This must have been a difficult decision for Douglas. But he\u2019s surely right. I hope other Conservative MPs consult their consciences, recognise what\u2019s right to restore public confidence and trust &amp; join other Conservatives in calling for Cummings to go. Two other Conservative politicians have rounded on Dominic Cummings this morning, joining a growing revolt in the party. The BBC reports that the Tory MP for West Worcestershire, Harriet Baldwin, has called for Cummings to resign, saying that members of the government and advisers should be \u201csubject to a higher bar\u201d. Meanwhile, the Tory MSP Adam Tomkins said the ministerial resignation of Douglas Ross \u201cshows exactly why Cummings should be sacked\u201d, adding: \u201cI suspect others will follow where Douglas has led.\u201d Another Tory MP has come out against Dominic Cummings, saying if he had been in the adviser\u2019s shoes he would have considered his position over his actions in making a 264-mile lockdown trip. Simon Jupp, who represents East Devon, explained he had been contacted by hundreds of people in response to Cummings\u2019 actions, saying he has \u201cfelt a mixture of anger, disappointment and frustration in recent days\u201d over the revelations. Writing on his Facebook page, Jupp said: \u201cAlthough I believe his actions were motivated by a father\u2019s desire to do what he felt was necessary to protect his family in exceptional circumstances, if placed in the same situation I wouldn\u2019t have made the same decisions and would have since considered my position.\u201d The number of deaths involving Covid-19 in the UK has topped 47,000, according to the latest available data. The total includes new figures published on Tuesday by the Office for National Statistics which show that 42,173 deaths involving coronavirus occurred in England and Wales up to May 15 (and had been registered up to May 23). Meanwhile, the latest figures from the National Records of Scotland, published last week, showed 3,546 deaths involving Covid-19 had been registered in Scotland up to May 17. And the latest figures from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, also published last week, showed 664 deaths involving Covid-19 had been registered in Northern Ireland up to May 20. Together these figures mean that so far 46,383 deaths have been registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, including suspected cases. A further 964 hospital patients in England who had tested positive for Covid-19 died between May 16 and May 24, according to figures published on Monday by NHS England. PA reports that, together with the total figure of 46,383 registered deaths, this indicates the overall death toll for the UK is now just over 47,300. Here\u2019s some snap reaction to Douglas Ross\u2019 ministerial resignation in protest at Dominic Cummings\u2019 264-mile lockdown trip across the country. Sky News political editor, Beth Rigby writes: ITV political editor, Robert Peston: Liberal Democrat London mayoral candidate Siobhan Benita: LBC political editor, Theo Usherwood: FT\u2019s Whitehall correspondent, Sebastian Payne: Sky News\u2019 political correspondent, Kate McCann: In his resignation statement, Douglas Ross, a junior minister in Boris Johnson\u2019s government, wrote: \u201cI have never met Dominic Cummings so my judgement on this matter has always been open and I accept his statement on Monday afternoon clarified the actions he took in what he felt were the best interests of his family. However, these were decisions many others felt were not available to them. As a father myself, my instinct is to always do what is best for my son and wife. We have been fortunate not to have caught this awful virus but if we did, we are prepared to follow the government advice and stay at home to contain this virus. While the intentions may have been well meaning, the reaction to this news shows that Mr Cummings interpretation of the government advice was not shared by the vast majority of people who have done as the government asked. \u201cI have constituents who didn\u2019t get to say goodbye to loved ones; families who didn\u2019t visit sick relatives because they followed the guidance of the government. I cannot in good faith tell them they were all wrong and one senior adviser to the government was right.\u201d Downing Street has suffered its first ministerial resignation in protest at the defence of claims Dominic Cummings broke lockdown rules by travelling 264 miles across the country. Douglas Ross, the minister for Scotland, has announced: \u201cI haven\u2019t commented publicly on the situation with Dominic Cummings as I have waited to hear the full details. I welcome the statement to clarify matters, but there remains aspects of the explanation which I have trouble with. As a result I have resigned as a government minister.\u201d Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of the government\u2019s advisory group on behavioural science, said Boris Johnson\u2019s defence of Dominic Cummings over his 264-mile lockdown trip risks undermining a sense of community needed to cope with the pandemic. Prof Reicher told Sky News\u2019 Kay Burley: \u201cOne of the central messages that we gave to government, one of the central points that we made was that the way we have gotten through this pandemic to date is by acting together, by thinking in terms of \u2018we\u2019, of what\u2019s good for the community. Millions of people up and down the country have done precisely that in very difficult circumstances, agonising circumstances around their families and thought \u2018What is good for us as a community?\u2019 I think the real problem here is that not simply in what Mr Cummings did but in the messaging that the prime minister put out. The lesson was, forget about the \u2018we\u2019, it\u2019s about \u2018I\u2019.\u201d He added: \u201cThe thing that really concerned me yesterday was everything was about \u2018I\u2019, everything was about what it means for me, there was no consideration at all of what it means to the community. \u201cNow, thank God, the public at large didn\u2019t take that attitude, the public at large, as I say, made those major sacrifices, but it threatens to undermine that sense of community if a figure as prominent as Dominic Cummings and if the prime minister himself starts undermining that \u2018we\u2019 message and starts talking about \u2018I\u2019.\u201d Michael Gove has faced a grilling from Kay Burley, as the minister continued to back Dominic Cummings over his 264-mile lockdown trip. In reference to Cummings\u2019 claim that while he was in the north-east he took a drive with his family to Barnard Castle, 30 miles from Durham, to test his eyesight, on Sky News Burley asked: \u201cIf you\u2019re struggling with Covid-19 and you think you\u2019ve got a problem with your eyesight, what is the government advice?\u201d Gove: \u201cWell, I think that different people will take different steps in order to ensure that their eyesight is properly addressed.\u201d Burley: \u201cWhat\u2019s the government advice?\u201d Gove: \u201cWell, we advise people obviously to seek medical advice.\u201d Burley: \u201cSo it\u2019s not to get in a car and drive half an hour with your four-year-old strapped in the back?\u201d Gove: \u201cWell, as we know Dominic [Cummings], and I know you\u2019re alluding to Dominic, was given the all-clear by the medics, he was told that it was safe for him to return to work. He wanted to make sure before he did return to work that he was in a good condition in order to drive the long journey back down the A1 so he took a short journey, that short one that was consistent with the medical advice, consistent with medical guidance\u2026\u201d Burley: \u201c... are you telling me that doctors told him to take that drive, he was following medical advice?\u201d Gove: \u201cI\u2019m saying that doctors cleared him to be able to return to work and he was able to return to work ... and he did take medical advice and was told he could return to work and indeed he could drive safely as well.\u201d The SNP\u2019s Westminster leader Ian Blackford has renewed his party\u2019s calls for Dominic Cummings to resign, arguing that crucial public health messages have been undermined by the adviser\u2019s behaviour and by the fact that the prime minister has stood by him. Blackford told BBC Radio Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland programme: \u201cThis is now about Boris Johnson\u2019s leadership because he needs to recognise what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong and quite simply this man should go.\u201d He has called a meeting with other opposition leaders this morning to discuss the matter, and described the circumstances as \u201cunprecedented\u201d. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us can remember a time when an official in government is giving a press conference ... he has become the story and he has deflected attention away from what we should be doing which is keeping people safe throughout this crisis.\u201d Blackford said Cummings\u2019 explanations yesterday \u201cdidn\u2019t stack up\u201d. He said: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he examine what childcare was available ... the fact that he drove to a hospital when he thought he might have Covid-19, the fact that he drove when he was worried about his eyesight .... this does get to the heart of trust in government.\u201d Dominic Cummings did not break the law or rules over his 264-mile lockdown trip to Durham, claims Michael Gove. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Gove said: \u201cDominic was not engaging in flouting of social distancing rules or anything like that \u2026\u201d Highlighting that people will make their own minds up on the aide\u2019s actions, Gove added: \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that he didn\u2019t break the law, he didn\u2019t break the rules, he sought to protect his family and he also sought to ensure that the risk of anyone in his family infecting anyone else was absolutely minimised.\u201d Some of the Church of England\u2019s most senior bishops have reported receiving hate mail and death threats after speaking out about accusations Dominic Cummings broke lockdown rules. It comes after the Guardian reported that bishops fired a volley of unprecedented criticism at Boris Johnson over his defence of actions taken by his chief aide, Cummings, who drove 265 miles to Durham during lockdown. Bishop of Worcester John Inge revealed that he received an email warning \u201cstay out of politics or we\u2019ll kill you\u201d after he criticised Boris Johnson\u2019s \u201crisible defence\u201d of Cummings on Sunday night. Helen-Ann Hartley, the bishop of Ripon, reported a similar threat, posting: \u201c\u2019Stay out of politics or it will be the death of you\u2019 was one of the emails I received today. Thank you to those who have sent supportive messages.\u201d The bishop had earlier written about missing her father\u2019s birthday during the lockdown as he recovered from radiotherapy. Rev Hartley said she was \u201cfollowing up\u201d the hate email with police. Christine Hardman, bishop of Newcastle, wrote: \u201cI too received such an email. I feel concern for the person who sent it and will hold him or her in prayer.\u201d The previous night she had posted that she was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d by the prime minister\u2019s defence of his adviser. \u201cWe can forgive mistakes and poor judgement and can understand and admire loyalty but forgiveness and understanding need openness and we did not see this tonight,\u201d she wrote. Paul Bayes, the bishop of Liverpool, added that he had also received abuse, writing: \u201cPublic life in Britain today. Many of us have received this sort of message. It doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Shoppers will have to \u201cexercise restraint\u201d by not trying on clothing and testing goods when stores reopen next month, Michael Gove said. Speaking about plans announced yesterday by Boris Johnson to reopen non-essential shops in June, Gove explained that shopping habits will have to change. He told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday: It\u2019s also the case that we need to ensure that some of the shopping habits people may have grown used to in the pre-Covid days are habits that we exercise a degree of restraint on. \u201cSo when it comes to touching and testing goods, when it comes to trying on clothing, when it comes to trying make-up and so on, that all of us exercise restraint in not doing that and recognising that as these stores reopen, it is a new normal, but it will allow us to ensure there are a wider range of goods and will also ensure the economy can return to a new normal, that is absolutely vital for people\u2019s jobs.\u201d Dominic Cummings acted reasonably in making a 264-mile lockdown trip to Durham, according to Michael Gove, who also defended the aide\u2019s claim that a separate drive to a local beauty spot was to test his eyesight. Asked why Cummings did not apologise during his press conference yesterday, Gove told BBC Breakfast: \u201cI think Dominic completely understands the concern people felt as the story broke. I think the account that he gave yesterday was exhaustive, it was detailed, it was verifiable and I think that people will make their own mind up as they listened to Dominic\u2019s account or they read about it subsequently. And I think most people will understand he was someone who was under pressure, who sought to put the health of his wife and his son first and who took care to ensure, as a unit, as a family unit, were not in danger of infecting other people.\u201d Gove, who said he was not aware of Cummings being in Durham until the story broke, added: \u201cAs people will have had the chance to hear yesterday, they will know from his own account that he was acting in a way that sought to safeguard his family, sought to \u2026 reduce the risk of infection to anyone else and which took account of a range of circumstances. People will make their own mind up, and as Dominic Cummings himself said, there will be many people who will think his actions were wrong or mistaken but, looking at it in the round, I think his actions were reasonable.\u201d Challenged on Cummings\u2019 explanation that he drove to Barnard Castle, a local beauty spot 30 miles from Durham, to test his eyesight out on his wife\u2019s birthday, Gove said: First thing to say is that Dominic had received medical advice, senior medical advice, saying that he was safe to return to work at that point. It was more than 14 days after he had first shown symptoms of the virus. It was important, he believed, that he returned to work and, certainly, it\u2019s the case that his dedication to work is phenomenal. He wanted to make sure that before he took the journey down the A1 that he was safe to drive and, of course, during the course of that journey he confirmed to himself that he was safe to drive.\u201d When highlighted that driving when your eyesight is not good enough is an offence under the Road Traffic Act, Gove replied: \u201cDominic\u2019s eyesight was good enough, that was the whole point of the journey, to determine that he could drive safely.\u201d Pressed again over whether he was entirely happy with Cummings\u2019 explanation \u2013 especially given the trip to Barnard Castle was on his wife\u2019s birthday \u2013 Gove replied: \u201cYes, but, to my mind I can\u2019t see the relevance of that. He drove to Barnard Castle, the family stopped, he walked a few yards, sat on a bench for a short period of time, then walked back to the car and then drove back to his home. So, I think the fact that it also happens was Easter Sunday was immaterial.\u201d Good morning, readers. Welcome to the Guardian\u2019s UK coronavirus live blog. Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s most senior advisor, continues to be under fire over accusations he breached Covid-19 lockdown rules after refusing to apologise and saying he does not regret his actions during an extraordinary press conference in Downing Street\u2019s Rose Garden. It follows mounting pressure about the revelations \u2013 first revealed in a joint Guardian and Daily Mirror investigation \u2013 that he travelled 264 miles across the country from London to his parents\u2019 estate in Durham during lockdown despite suspecting that both he and his wife had coronavirus. Cummings also admitted he drove to a local beauty spot, Barnard Castle, 30 miles from Durham, which he claimed was necessary to check his eyesight was good enough for the longer drive back to London. At least 20 Tory MPs called for him to quit and senior scientists accused him of undermining public health advice. The front pages will make grim reading in Downing Street this morning: Minister Michael Gove \u2013 who has followed Boris Johnson\u2019s lead in publicly backing Cummings \u2013 is doing the media rounds this morning with interviews on the BBC and Sky News. At 9.30am, the Office for National Statistics is set to release death figures for week ending 15 May for England and Wales and survey of social impact on regions. Meanwhile, opposition leaders will also meet online this morning. I\u2019m Simon Murphy and I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest developments in the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK this morning.

He said he saw the dog \u201ctearing through the plantings\u201d and told the owner dogs should be leashed at all times, noting: \u201cThe sign is right there.\u201d After an exchange of remarks, he began recording.</p> \n<p>The video starts with the woman, who is wearing a face mask, saying: \u201cSir, I\u2019m asking you to stop.\u201d</p> \n<p>She approaches him, dragging the struggling dog by its collar.

      "bodyText": "Footage of a confrontation between a black birdwatcher and a white dog walker in Central Park in New York has gone viral, reigniting national debate over everyday racism and a social media storm. The incident follows other infamous instances of white people calling the police after coming upon black people doing everyday things such as jogging, being in the park or the street, having a swim, holding a barbecue or merely gardening. In the latest incident, which happened at around 8.30am on Monday, the Memorial Day holiday, an African American man, Christian Cooper, was in a patch of dense trees and shrubs known as the Ramble, which is popular with bird watchers and where signs say dogs must be kept on a leash. When Cooper asked a woman to leash her exuberant dog, she said she would call the police. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell them there\u2019s an African American man threatening my life,\u201d she said. As the woman became agitated, Cooper remained calm and recorded part of the incident. Posted to Twitter by his sister, Melody Cooper, the footage was viewed more than 20m times. Christian Cooper described the beginning of the encounter, which was not recorded, in a post on Facebook. He said he saw the dog \u201ctearing through the plantings\u201d and told the owner dogs should be leashed at all times, noting: \u201cThe sign is right there.\u201d After an exchange of remarks, he began recording. The video starts with the woman, who is wearing a face mask, saying: \u201cSir, I\u2019m asking you to stop.\u201d She approaches him, dragging the struggling dog by its collar. He says: \u201cPlease don\u2019t come close to me.\u201d New York City is still under stay-at-home and social distancing orders amid the coronavirus crisis. The woman, later identified as Amy Cooper, asks the man to turn his phone off, then says: \u201cI\u2019m calling the cops.\u201d Christian Cooper responds: \u201cPlease call the cops.\u201d The woman says: \u201cI\u2019m going to tell them there\u2019s an African American man threatening my life.\u201d He says: \u201cTell them whatever you like.\u201d Apparently reaching an operator, Amy Cooper says: \u201cThere is a man, African American, he has a bicycle helmet, he is recording me and threatening me and my dog.\u201d She wrestles the dog, which struggles and appears to be having difficulty breathing. Raising her voice, she backs away. Christian Cooper remains still. In an agitated voice, Amy Cooper says: \u201cI am being threatened by a man in the Ramble, please send the cops immediately.\u201d She then fixes a leash to the dog\u2019s collar. Christian Cooper says \u201cThank you\u201d and ends the recording. On Tuesday morning, Cooper spoke to the Washington Post, which described him as a 57-year-old science editor. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s an African American person in America who hasn\u2019t experienced something like this at some point,\u201d he said. Cooper said he often asks dog owners to put the leash on in the Ramble. \u201cI don\u2019t shy away from confronting the scofflaw when I see it,\u201d he said, using a local term for someone who ignores laws which are hard to enforce. \u201cOtherwise, the park would be unusable \u2013 not just to us birders but to anybody who enjoys the beauty.\u201d Asked about the woman\u2019s decision to call the police, he said: \u201cI can be racially intimidated and kowtow to her [but] I\u2019m not going to participate in my own dehumanization.\u201d Police officers attended the call but said no summonses or arrests were made over what the New York police department called \u201ca verbal dispute\u201d. Amy Cooper was put on administrative leave by her employer on Monday, the investment firm Franklin Templeton, which said it was investigating. \u201cWe take these matters very seriously,\u201d the firm said, \u201cand we do not condone racism of any kind.\u201d By Tuesday afternoon she had been fired. The incident stoked a fierce backlash on social media. Franklin Leonard, a film executive and founder of The Black List, which ranks the most popular screenplays of the year that Hollywood fails to turn into films, saw insidious racial bias at work. \u201cHow many times has Amy Cooper said behind closed doors that a black co-worker \u2018wasn\u2019t a team player, \u2018isn\u2019t one of us, \u2018made her uncomfortable\u2019,\u201d he asked. \u201cHow many times has she just not been able to put her finger on it, but just doesn\u2019t think they\u2019re the right candidate for the job?

The study is based on interviews with medical professionals in five Venezuelan states \u2013 Anzo\u00e1tegui, Barinas, Bol\u00edvar, Lara and Zulia \u2013 and the capital, Caracas. Page said Venezuela\u2019s already collapsed health system was utterly unprepared for the coronavirus. When Covid-19 arrived in Venezuela, research showed: A third of hospitals had no water supply and two-thirds only an intermittent supply. 60% of hospitals reported shortages of gloves and face masks. 76% of hospitals suffered soap shortages and 90% shortages of sanitizing gel. \u201cUnder those conditions it is impossible to follow the basic guidelines to prevent hospital-acquired infections, which is hand-washing,\u201d Page warned. She added: \u201cThis is truly a critical situation that has profound implications for Venezuelans, for Venezuelan healthcare workers and really for the community at large because as we know, migration to and from Venezuelan continues to occur.\u201d Since Venezuela\u2019s economic collapse began to accelerate in 2013, at least 4.5 million of its citizens have fled overseas, although a small number have started returning home because of mass unemployment caused by lockdowns in countries such as Colombia. Tamara Taraciuk Broner, Human Rights Watch\u2019s deputy regional director, said she feared the political implications of the pandemic as well as its health impact. \u201cCovid has been the perfect excuse for the Venezuelan regime to crack down,\u201d Taraciuk said. \u201cWhat we are seeing now \u2026 is the detention and harassment of doctors, nurses, journalists.\u201d She claimed the coronavirus was helping to accelerate Venezuela\u2019s transformation into \u201csomething like a police state\u201d. Human Rights Watch called on the international community to fund UN humanitarian efforts in order to help Venezuelans through their latest crisis.",

The total number of cases of Covid-19 infection across the region stands at 292, an increase of 15 since last week, the majority of which were in Guam. The economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic looms larger and larger in the region as fears of widespread infection subside. This week, Fiji Airways delivered termination letters to 758 staff, including all of its cabin crews. Covid-19 was cited as the cause. Staff will be asked to reapply for their positions should they become open again. In Tonga, the prime minister has recommended that parliamentarians take a 20% pay cut due to the massive budget hole facing the country. The virus crisis is fuelling a drive by many Pacific island countries to reduce their reliance on tourism, replacing it with output from other sectors, including the creative economy. What has happened this week? West Papua: RNZ reports that the region has seen more than 65 new cases in just days, bringing the total to roughly 685 confirmed cases. PNG authorities are expressing increasing concern about spillover across their very porous border. Gunmen accused by a local military commander of being independence fighters attacked two health workers in the restive area. Guam: With 166 confirmed cases, Guam remains the hardest-hit Pacific nation. A recently announced new case has given pause to the government, which had been prepared to begin loosening restrictions. The person reported having recently travelled from the continental United States. CNMI: A new case has been reported, bringing the total to 22, with two deaths. Nonetheless, the government has gone ahead with easing some of the restrictions in place. Papua New Guinea: The country is steady at eight cases, all of whom have recovered. But that number may drop with the revelation that the first confirmed case has tested negative for virus antibodies, suggesting she may never have had the virus. All eyes are now on the border with Indonesia, where new case numbers appear to be spiralling out of control. French Pacific territories: Cases in French Polynesia and New Caledonia remain stable, with 60 and 18 respectively. Fiji: The number of confirmed cases is stable at 18 and it has been more than a month since the last new case was reported. Schools were scheduled to reopen on 15 June, but the prime minister has confirmed they will stay closed until there are no Covid-19 cases in the country. Solomon Islands: The country is now able to do testing in-country, thanks to donations of equipment from Australia and China. Repatriation of citizens from Australia, Fiji and Vanuatu began this week. All returning citizens and residents will be required to undergo mandatory quarantine on arrival into Honiara. Vanuatu: The country remains virus-free. The first repatriation flight is expected this week, originating in Solomon Islands, which is also virus-free. The announcement came just days after the public health director announced that the country\u2019s new quarantine and treatment unit was ready for use. Marshall Islands: After weeks of negotiations and preparations, United Airlines was able to land an \u201cisland hopper\u201d flight at Majuro. Essential supplies were carried on the plane, including cash for the Bank of Guam, which was brought by a courier.

To date, slightly fewer than 3,000 tests have been conducted on a population of nearly 9 million. Fiji: Economy minister Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum was accused by Pacific island neighbours of trying to jump the queue when he made a direct pitch to the governments of Australia and New Zealand to include Fiji in a proposed regional travel bubble. The move was supported by Australian officials. Solomon Islands: Prime minister Manasseh Sogavare pushed back against claims that his government was using the pandemic to ignore the constitution, saying that the constitutionality of state-of-emergency provisions is a matter for the courts. For reasons not entirely made clear, the government announced a three-day practice lockdown of the capital last week. Vanuatu: The government\u2019s new chair of the citizenship commission has cited the nation\u2019s passport sale program as the primary reason the country has been able to afford one of the most lavish bailout packages in the Pacific. This, he says, is reason enough to consider expanding the program even further. The sale of passports has been the subject of considerable controversy since its inception, but it is also responsible for the country\u2019s cash reserves. Samoa: Uncertainty still reigns over the isolation and quarantine requirements for a group of six VIPs, including the nation\u2019s new chief justice, who arrived recently in Apia. Further repatriation flights are expected but it is not known when they will occur. The prime minister has indicated that returning citizens and residents may be required to contribute to the costs of their quarantine on arrival in the country. Australia and New Zealand Australia\u2019s total of Covid-19 infections stands at just over 7,100, with 102 deaths. New Zealand has seen just over 1,500 cases and 21 deaths. Jacinda Ardern announced that from Friday, gatherings of up to 100 people would be permitted, allowing for larger weddings, funerals and religious services. Talks are ongoing between Australian and New Zealand officials about a \u201ctrans-Tasman bubble\u201d. There are mixed messages as to how Pacific island countries may be able to be part of this. To date, Pacific island officials have not been invited to be part of these conversations, even though a number of leaders have indicated they would like to be included. What did they say? To date, there are no deaths in the country and therefore our health team and the security forces are on the ground ensuring that this Covid-19 transmission must not take place. \u2013 Paison Dakulala, Papua New Guinea\u2019s deputy minister for health, on the threat posed by increased infections in West Papua Good news Locals in tourism destinations such as Samoa, Fiji and Vanuatu are benefiting from deals and offers as operators look to domestic tourism to keep their businesses ticking over until international tourists can return.",

Yemen humanitarian work near breaking point, says UN The UN refugee agency says Covid-19 has pushed its humanitarian work to near \u201cbreaking point\u201d in Yemen, a country devastated by five years of war. It says a growing number of families have resorted to begging, child labour and marrying of children to survive. A separate UN agency says it had only received around 15% of the funding required for the $3.38bn (\u00a32.74bn) aid package for Yemen this year. UK PM faces increasing pressure from allies to sack aide Dozens of MPs from the ruling Conservative party demand the removal of the prime minister\u2019s chief aide, Dominic Cummings, after he insisted he did not regret breaching the government-ordered lockdown. A junior minister resigns, while the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, a former chief whip and a former attorney general are among the Tory MPs to publicly call for Cummings to leave his Downing Street post. Putin claims Russia past peak despite highest daily death toll Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, says the country has passed its peak of infections on the same day the country records its highest daily death toll. After peaking in mid-May at more than 11,000 new cases a day, the number of daily infections in Russia has dropped to fewer than 9,000. On Tuesday, the country reported its highest daily death toll of 174 \u2013 a number still far lower than in countries with similar rates of infections. Spain declares 10 days of mourning The Spanish government declares 10 days of mourning starting on Wednesday for the nearly 27,000 people who have died in the country. It is the longest official mourning period in the country\u2019s four-decade-old democracy. Flags will be flown at half-mast in more than 14,000 public buildings across the country and on Spanish naval vessels until 5 June. Merkel losing control of Germany\u2019s lockdown Control over Germany\u2019s lockdown measures is increasingly slipping from Angela Merkel\u2019s grasp as more federal states announce unilateral steps to loosen restrictions, creating a patchwork of wildly varying rules on social distancing within the country. Winfried Kretschmann, the premier of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, announces his state will allow seated public events with up to 100 people from 1 June, adding that there are no plans for further talks on coordinating the responses of Germany\u2019s 16 states.",

This is necessary to remove the menace to marine life, but methods of preventing plastic waste from reaching the ocean in the first place must also take priority, according to the report published on Wednesday.

Twitter added a fact check feature to some of the president\u2019s recent misleading tweets about mail-in ballots. Trump said he thought it was \u201cvery unusual\u201d that Joe Biden wore a face mask yesterday while attending a Memorial Day ceremony. The president has resisted wearing a mask in public, even though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that Americans cover their faces while out in public and around other people. Biden called Trump a \u201cfool\u201d for discouraging citizens from wearing masks and changed his Twitter avatar to a picture of himself wearing a mask and aviators. Trump will meet with New York governor Andrew Cuomo in Washington tomorrow. Cuomo said he and the president would discuss his proposal to ramp up infrastructure spending to get more New Yorkers back to work amid the coronavirus crisis. The Pentagon\u2019s deputy inspector general resigned. Recently, the president effectively removed Glenn Fine from his role leading a coronavirus relief spending oversight committee, and the defense department official has now become the latest inspector general to step down in recent weeks. The trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange was reopened after two months. Cuomo rang the opening bell to cheers from traders, who will still have to wear masks and stay six feet apart from each other when they\u2019re on the floor. Fact checks: Voter fraud In a series of misleading tweets, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany presented misleading tweets about mail-in ballots. Above McEnany is linking to a story about a 2019 settlement between California election officials and a conservative legal group that resulted in LA officials to remove the inactive records of voters who hadn\u2019t voted in repeated elections and were not part of active voter rolls. There was no admission of wrongdoing int he settlement, but the county agreed to update old records. At the time, Paul Mitchell of the nonpartisan research firm Political Data Inc. told the. AP that this was an insignificant case because it involved inactive voters who \u201care not getting voting materials, they are not casting ballots, they are not showing up in precincts.\u201d In Philly, a former judge of elections pleaded guilty to conspiracy to deprive Philadelphia voters of their civil rights by stuffing the ballot boxes for certain judicial candidates. This had nothing to do with mail-in voting. The former judge conducted voter fraud at the voting booth, not through the mail. He \u201cfraudulently stuffed the ballot box by literally standing in a voting booth and voting over and over, as fast as he could, while he thought the coast was clear,\u201d US attorney William McSwain said in a statement. The Trump campaign has responded to Twitter adding fact checks to the president\u2019s false tweets about mail-in voting by attacking the social media company. \u201cWe always knew that Silicon Valley would pull out all the stops to obstruct and interfere with President Trump getting his message through to voters,\u201d Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale said. \u201cThere are many reasons the Trump campaign pulled all our advertising from Twitter months ago, and their clear political bias is one of them.\u201c It is important to note here that Twitter Inc. banned political ads in October 2019 \u2014 necessitating that the Trump campaign pull all its advertising from Twitter months ago. The US is nearing the bleak milestone of 100,000 confirmed coronavirus deaths. But the actual death toll will probably have hit that figure days before the official tallies reflect it. And despite scientists\u2019 best efforts, that date may forever go unmarked. Coronavirus was probably spreading through the US before the Trump administration restricted travel from China, before the US had a reliable supply of diagnostic tests, and before the disease caused by the virus was even named. Models of the Covid-19 outbreak estimate that the virus was making its way through America\u2019s major cities, undetected, weeks before a California woman in early February became the first American known to have died of related causes. Researchers are now doing detective work, revisiting autopsies from early this year and studying how the virus has subtly evolved to try to trace when Covid-19 may have first sickened and killed people in the US. Infectious disease experts caution, however, that finding a \u201cpatient zero\u201d, or even figuring out exactly how many Americans were infected and died before testing was available, will be nearly impossible. Joe Biden has a new Twitter avatar, in which he\u2019s wearing a face mask. The change came shortly after Biden called Trump a \u201cfool\u201d for discouraging citizens from wearing masks. \u201cPresidents are supposed to lead, not engage in folly and be falsely masculine,\u201d Biden said in an interview with CNN. Meanwhile, New Mexico will begin allowing restaurants to serve customers at outdoor seating areas, at a reduced capacity. California is expanding its reopening criteria to include barber shops and hair salons for certain counties, governor Gavin Newsom announced today. The Guardian\u2019s Vivian Ho reports: A quick reminder for how it all works in the incredibly large and varied state of California: there is a statewide guidance that applies to all 58 counties and modifies the statewide stay-at-home order for everyone. That went into place 8 May, and allowed for retailers to offer curbside pickup. The statewide guidance allows for regional variance because parts of California were harder hit by the virus than others. Some counties, like San Francisco and Alameda, home of the Tesla factory, kept stricter restrictions than the rest of the state, much to the dismay of Elon Musk. Later, Newsom allowed for counties that had not been as affectedby the virus to apply for looser restrictions, such as the go-ahead to reopen some offices, schools and dine-in restaurants. These counties have to meet criteria such as a rate of 8% positive tests over seven days and a hospitalization rate below 5%. Newsom said Monday that 47 counties have self-attested. These 47 counties will now be allowed to get haircuts, following certain modifications such as wearing face coverings while in the salon and certain sanitation guidelines. \u201cWe\u2019re making progress, we\u2019re moving forward, we\u2019re not looking back, but we are walking into the unknown, the untested, literally and figuratively, and we have to be guided by the data that brought us to this place in the first place,\u201d Newsom warned. Newsom made the hair salon announcement amid jokes that three of his four children, the oldest age 10, had helped cut his hair this weekend in \u201ca family effort to remove what was described by my wife as, forgive me, a mullet.\u201d California is now reporting 97,206 positive cases, and 3,777 deaths, but in the last 14 days, the state has seen a 6.7% decline in hospitalizations. A church in California has asked the Supreme Court to stop enforcement of the state\u2019s social distancing policies. The South Bay United Pentecostal Church, represented by the Thomas More Society \u2014conservative, pro-life law firm based in Chicago \u2014 filed a petition over the weekend, saying that the governor\u2019s shelter-in-place guidelines \u201carbitrarily discriminate against places of worship in violation of their right to the Free Exercise of Religion under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\u201d Yesterday, governor Gavin Newsom said houses of worship would be allowed to re-open at 25% capacity. The Supreme Court has not formally accepted the petition. Gavin Newsom, California\u2019s governor, did not hold back when asked at his daily briefing on Tuesday about Donald Trump\u2019s comments on mail-in ballots. The Guardian\u2019s Vivian Ho reports from San Francisco: Earlier this month, California became the first state to authorize sending every registered voter a mail-in ballot in the upcoming elections, a move that Newsom is calling a matter of public health, not politics. He started Tuesday citing three studies that essentially found that the cases of voter fraud were few and far between. He noted that there should be sanctions for people that are doing the wrong thing, but the reality is, the overwhelming majority of people are doing the right thing.\u201d \u201cUtah, hardly a bastion of progressive politics, has been doing mail-only ballots for a number of years,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cColorado, as well as Oregon, Washington, other states, for years and years. The state of California has been doing it for decades. Many other states across this country have been using absentee ballots, for servicemen and women overseas, using absentee ballots in a secure, safe and honorable manner. It doesn\u2019t skew Democratic, it doesn\u2019t skew Republican.\u201d He pointed out that by the time the November election rolls around, it will be flu season and \u201cpotentially the next Covid-19 season.\u201d \u201cThe last thing we want to do is deny you your fundamental, hard-fought right,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to deny you that right because of public health and that is what this option and the ability to have an architecture of in-person voting options does in the state of California,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think it is a noble cause, I think it is an appropriate cause and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s political in any way, shape or form and I say that from the core of my being. I don\u2019t just say that as a democratic governor of a large blue state, I say that as an American citizen, I say that as someone who believes deeply in democracy and believes in the cause of encouraging people to exercise their right, their privilege, their freedom to vote, for or against, pro/con, whatever one chooses to do, but to do it in a safe manner.\u201d Fact check: Mail-in ballots Trump also lied while criticizing voting by mail. \u201cPeople that aren\u2019t citizens, illegals -- anybody that walks in California is going to get a ballot,\u201d he said of the state\u2019s plan to expand voting options. This is not true: in California, ballots are being mailed only to registered voters. The president has often repeated baseless claims about voting by mail, to the. point that Twitter has added a fact-check to the president\u2019s false tweets about the process. Fact check: Presidential authority The constitution does not allow the president authority to override state governors\u2019 responses to the pandemic. As University of Texas law professor Steve Vladeck has explained before: \u201cThe president has no formal legal authority to categorically override local or state shelter-in-place orders or to reopen schools and small businesses. No statute delegates to him such power; no constitutional provision invests him with such authority.\u201d In the federal government, Congress the power to \u201cregulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states\u201d \u2014 but not the president. And it\u2019s unclear that houses of worship have any impact on interstate commerce. Hi there, it\u2019s Maanvi Singh, blogging from the West Coast. Moments ago, Trump said he has the authority to overrule state governors that refuse to reopen places of worship. \u201cAnd we have many different ways where I can override them,\u201d the president said. Trump does not have the authority to override state governors. The president has just concluded his Rose Garden event, and that\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands: Trump said he thought it was \u201cvery unusual\u201d that Joe Biden wore a face mask yesterday while attending a Memorial Day ceremony. The president has resisted wearing a mask in public, even though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that Americans cover their faces while out in public and around other people. Trump will meet with New York governor Andrew Cuomo in Washington tomorrow. Cuomo said he and the president would discuss his proposal to ramp up infrastructure spending to get more New Yorkers back to work amid the coronavirus crisis. The Pentagon\u2019s deputy inspector general resigned. Recently, the president effectively removed Glenn Fine from his role leading a coronavirus relief spending oversight committee, and the defense department official has now become the latest inspector general to step down in recent weeks. The trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange was reopened after two months. Cuomo rang the opening bell to cheers from traders, who will still have to wear masks and stay six feet apart from each other when they\u2019re on the floor. Trump again criticized vote by mail, repeating baseless claims that the mailed-in ballots would be particularly vulnerable to voter fraud, which is very rare. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Trump once again refused to denounce a debunked conspiracy theory that alleges MSNBC host Joe Scarborough was involved in the 2001 death of his former staff, Lori Klausutis. Trump said Klausutis\u2019 death, which was ruled an accident by local Florida police and the medical examiner involved in the case, was \u201ca very suspicious situation.\u201d When Trump was pressed on the fact that Klausutis\u2019 widower has asked Twitter to remove the president\u2019s tweets on the matter, he said of Klausutis\u2019 family, \u201cI\u2019m sure that ultimately they want to get to the bottom of it.\u201d The president insisted it would be a \u201cvery good thing\u201d to \u201cget to the bottom of it.\u201d But Klausutis\u2019 widower said Trump \u201chas taken something that does not belong him \u2014 the memory of my dead wife \u2014 and perverted it for perceived political gain.\u201d Trump said he thought it was \u201cvery unusual\u201d that Joe Biden chose to wear a mask yesterday while attending a Memorial Day ceremony. \u201cBiden can wear a mask,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe was standing outside with his wife, perfect conditions, perfect weather \u2013 when they\u2019re inside they don\u2019t wear masks. And so I thought it was very unusual he had one on.\u201d The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended the use of face masks when Americans are in public and in close proximity to other people, but masks are not considered necessary when people are in their own homes. Trump denied that he was criticizing Biden when he retweeted a Fox News commentator who had questioned the former vice president\u2019s use of the mask. \u201cI wasn\u2019t criticizing him at all,\u201d Trump said. The infamously combative president added, \u201cWhy would I ever do a thing like that?\u201d Trump also tried to convince a reporter to remove his mask to ask his question. When the reporter chose not to do so, Trump said, \u201cOkay, good, you want to be politically correct.\u201d Echoing comments from Trump and White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany earlier today, the vice-president boasted about the current coronavirus death rate in the country. Mike Pence noted that \u201cjust 505 Americans succumbed to the coronavirus\u201d yesterday, saying the country has not seen that daily death toll since March. \u201cWe\u2019re getting there, America,\u201d Pence said. When the vice-president finished speaking, Trump echoed his comments, saying his administration had acted \u201cquickly and smartly\u201d and thus prevented a much higher death toll. The US coronavirus death toll is expected to reach 100,000 in the coming days, while Trump said last month that he expected 50,000 to 60,000 Americans to die of the virus. Trump mused about whether he should use insulin while delivering remarks on protecting seniors with diabetes amid the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI don\u2019t use insulin. Should I be? Huh?\u201d the president said of the diabetes medication. \u201cI never thought about it. But I know a lot of people are very badly affected, right? Unbelievable.\u201d The comment (or maybe it was a joke?) comes just after Trump said he has concluded his regimen of hydroxychloroquine, which he was using to prevent coronavirus, despite the FDA\u2019s guidance that the drug should only be used in a hospital setting. The AFL-CIO, the largest US federation of unions, has endorsed Joe Biden\u2019s presidential bid, an unsurprising development considering the group has been a staunch Democratic ally. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka applauded Biden as a champion of the labor movement who would be a valuable ally if he wins the White House. \u201cThe path to the presidency runs through the labor movement,\u201d Trumka said. \u201cAnd with the full force and unmatched reach of our political program, we are ready to pave that road for our friend Joe Biden.\u201d The group similarly endorsed Hillary Clinton in her 2016 race against Trump. The justice department is reportedly closing investigations into three senators over insider-trader allegations, but the investigation into senator Richard Burr remains active. The Wall Street Journal reports: Prosecutors on Tuesday are alerting defense attorneys for Republicans Kelly Loeffler of Georgia and James Inhofe of Oklahoma as well as Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California, that they are closing investigations into their trading, the people said. But the investigation into Burr, who has had his cell phone seized and has temporarily stepped down as chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, remains ongoing. Burr avoided a significant financial loss earlier this year by selling stocks that later nosedived due to the coronavirus pandemic, raising concerns that he had profited off information from closed briefings. George Conway, who is married to senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, mocked Trump for his Twitter activity today. The president spent part of his morning tweeting about a debunked conspiracy theory involving Joe Scarborough and his unsubstantiated claim that vote by mail leads to voter fraud. Trump also suggested it was a success that the US coronavirus death toll was 100,000 rather than a million or more. Conway responded to a summary of those tweets by saying, \u201cWe call this Tuesday.\u201d Conway has become a frequent critic of the president, and he is one of the leaders of the Lincoln Project, a group made up of former Republicans looking to defeat Trump in November. Joe Biden\u2019s campaign has named a national voter protection director, as concerns intensify over how the coronavirus pandemic will affect voting access. The AP reports: The campaign said Rachana Desai Martin will join its legal team, serving also as senior counsel. Martin, who has a strong background in voter protection work, previously worked as chief operating officer of the Democratic National Committee and the DNC\u2019s director of civic engagement and voter protection. Some states have pushed to expand absentee voting options, including vote by mail, in light of concerns about spreading coronavirus at in-person polling places. But Trump has repeatedly criticized vote by mail, claiming mailed-in ballots are particularly susceptible to voter fraud, even though vote fraud is very rare. As the US coronavirus death toll approaches 100,000, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany praised Trump\u2019s response to the pandemic, saying the death toll could have been much higher. McEnany repeatedly cited a scientific report suggesting up to 2.2 million Americans could die of coronavirus if the government did not take action to limit the spread of the virus. \u201cThe president made the very hard choice of shutting down the economy, so we avoided that extraordinary number,\u201d McEnany said. \u201cWe are far below 2.2 million dead Americans because of the actions of President Trump.\u201d The president himself made a similar argument in a tweet today, saying, \u201cFor all of the political hacks out there, if I hadn\u2019t done my job well, &amp; early, we would have lost 1 1/2 to 2 Million People, as opposed to the 100,000 plus that looks like will be the number. That\u2019s 15 to 20 times more than we will lose.\u201d But Trump suggested last month that the country\u2019s death toll would be 50,000 to 60,000, so the figure is already twice that of what he predicted just weeks ago. The number may also continue to steadily climb if states move to quickly reopen their economies, as Trump has encouraged them to do. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany tried to deflect questions about Trump pushing a debunked conspiracy theory about Joe Scarborough. The president has suggested the MSNBC host, who has been a frequent Trump critic, may be responsible for the 2001 death of Lori Klausutis, who died as the result of a fall while employed as a staffer to then-congressman Scarborough. McEnany repeated the president\u2019s tweet this morning that the conspiracy theory, which was been debunked by local Florida police and the medical examiner who was involved in the case, was \u201cnot an original Trump thought,\u201d even though the president has repeatedly shared the theory with his 80 million Twitter followers. The press secretary then tried to turn the situation back on Scarborough and his co-host Mika Brzezinski, saying they should be \u201cheld to account for their falsehoods.\u201d She specifically criticized Scarborough for saying people would die by taking hydroxychloroquine, a drug that has been linked to a higher death rate when used to treat coronavirus. When pressed on the fact that Klausutis\u2019 widower wrote to the CEO of Twitter asking for Trump\u2019s tweets to be removed, McEnany again deflected and tried to shift focus away from her boss. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany dodged a question about Trump retweeting criticism of Joe Biden for wearing a face mask in public, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends. \u201cThe president\u2019s excited to see that Joe emerged from the basement,\u201d McEnany said sarcastically, highlighting that it was Biden\u2019s first public appearance since the start of the coronavirus crisis. She added, \u201cIt is a bit peculiar, though, that in his basement right next to his wife, he\u2019s not wearing a mask, but he\u2019s wearing one outdoors, when he\u2019s socially distanced. So I think that there was a discrepancy there.\u201d When a reporter noted that Biden was thus following the CDC guidance, McEnany said wearing a mask was \u201crecommended\u201d but not \u201crequired.\u201d Trump has resisted wearing a mask in public, and face coverings have become a political issue despite public health experts\u2019 guidance to use them. Joe Biden participated in a socially distant interview with CNN host Dana Bash today, which will air on the network at 5 pm ET. The presumptive Democratic nominee has been largely confined to his Delaware home since the start of the coronavirus crisis. This weekend marked his first public appearance in months, as he and Jill Biden laid a wreath at a Memorial Day ceremony in Delaware, with both Bidens wearing face masks. Trump, on the other hand, did not wear a mask during Memorial Day ceremonies yesterday, and the president later retweeted criticism of Biden for wearing a mask, even though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends doing so. Glenn Fine, the defense department\u2019s deputy inspector general, has resigned from his role, just weeks after Trump effectively removed him as the chairman of an oversight committee meant to review coronavirus relief funding. CNN reports: One Pentagon official told CNN that [Fine] was not told to resign and did so on his own accord. Still, Trump replaced Fine as the Pentagon\u2019s acting inspector general last month rather than allowing him to remain in the job until a nominee for the permanent role was confirmed, a move that was viewed as an effort to thwart his leadership of the coronavirus accountability review. Fine\u2019s resignation takes effect June 1st, according to DOD IG spokesperson Dwrena Allen. Fine\u2019s resignation is the latest in a series of departures of inspectors general, raising concerns that the president is attempting to sideline oversight officials. Dozens of House members have designated a proxy to vote for them this week, after the chamber voted earlier this month to allow remote voting during the pandemic. At least 34 members have designated proxies, according to a list from the Office of the Clerk. No Republican member appears to have designated a proxy yet, after the caucus expressed opposition to the remote voting proposal. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has suggested he may not consider votes taken by proxy to be valid, but House majority leader Steny Hoyer pushed back against that today. \u201cThey use proxy voting in the Senate all the time,\u201d Hoyer said, referring to recent measures passed by unanimous consent. \u201cWhat that means is, two people vote for the 100.\u201d Republican governors are racing to offer their states to potentially replace North Carolina as the site of the Republican convention, after Trump demanded a \u201cguarantee\u201d from North Carolina\u2019s governor that the convention would be able to take place at \u201cfull attendance.\u201d \u201cFlorida would love to have the RNC,\u201d Florida governor Ron DeSantis said. \u201cHeck, I\u2019m a Republican -- it would be great to have the DNC.\u201d DeSantis said hosting a convention would help his state\u2019s economic outlook. Brian Kemp, the Republican governor of Georgia, made a similar offer in a tweet this morning. Again, it is unrealistic for any state to offer Trump such a \u201cguarantee\u201d at this point because it\u2019s unclear what restrictions will be necessary over the summer to limit the spread of coronavirus. It\u2019s also unclear how many people would choose to attend the convention in person because of the global pandemic, so hosting the event may not bring the same economic boost it has provided cities in past years. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: New York governor Andrew Cuomo will meet with Trump in Washington tomorrow. Cuomo said he and Trump would discuss ramping up infrastructure projects to help get more New Yorkers back to work amid the coronavirus crisis. The trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange was reopened after two months. Cuomo rang the opening bell to cheers from traders, who will still have to wear masks and stay six feet apart from each other when they\u2019re on the floor. Trump again criticized vote by mail, repeating baseless claims that the mailed-in ballots would be very vulnerable to voter fraud, which is extremely rare. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Congressman Jim Clyburn said he \u201ccringed\u201d when he heard Joe Biden say African American voters \u201cain\u2019t black\u201d if they are still deciding between him and Trump. But Clyburn, whose endorsement was crucial to helping Biden win the South Carolina primary, said Biden was still the far better alternative to Trump. \u201cIn this instance, Joe did not do as well as I hoped in responding, but I will say this, I go about my business every day comparing Joe Biden, to the alternative, not the Almighty,\u201d Clyburn told \u201cThe View.\u201d \u201cHe is not a perfect person. None of us are. So what my decision now is to determine who I feel should be the next president of the United States, and I do that by comparing the candidates to each other, not to the Almighty.\u201d Biden apologized for the comment on Friday, saying he may have been \u201cmuch too cavalier\u201d in his earlier interview. Katie Miller, the vice president\u2019s press secretary, announced she has recovered from coronavirus and is back at work at the White House. Miller, who tested positive earlier this month, said she was allowed to return to work at the White House after three negative coronavirus tests. Miller also announced she and her husband, senior White House adviser Stephen Miller, are expecting a baby. The pair married in February. Trump and New York governor Andrew Cuomo met in person last month to discuss coronavirus testing and relief funding. After the meeting, Cuomo said they had had a \u201ca very good conversation,\u201d despite past spats between the two leaders. \u201cWe have a tremendous job that we have to get done and put everything else aside and do the job. And that was the tone of the conversation, was very functional and effective,\u201d the Democratic governor told MSNBC at the time. Cuomo said he would discuss ramping up infrastructure projects when he meets with Trump tomorrow, but Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell may be the bigger roadblock in getting infrastructure funding approved. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he would meet with Trump tomorrow in Washington to discuss, among other things, ramping up infrastructure projects to help the economy. The Democratic governor argued this was the perfect time to advance long-ignored infrastructure needs in order to get more New Yorkers back to work and cause minimal disruption, as many residents in the state continue to work from home. \u201cThere is no better time to build than right now,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cNow is the time to do it.\u201d Congressional Democrats have similarly pushed for a heavy investment in infrastructure, and the president has voiced interest in the idea, but Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has largely dismissed those efforts. Coronavirus claimed the lives of 73 New Yorkers yesterday, marking the lowest one-day death toll in two months, governor Andrew Cuomo announced at his daily briefing. Cuomo noted that hospitalizations and intubations are also down, as the state continues to see a steady decline in coronavirus infections. The governor said Long Island would be able to start its reopening tomorrow as long as it did not see an increase in hospitalizations and deaths today. Cuomo also once again underscored the need for New Yorkers to wear masks as their regions start to reopen in order to limit the spread of the virus. \u201cWearing a mask is officially cool,\u201d the Democratic governor joked. He added, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to have a boring mask like my mask. I\u2019m a boring guy.\u201d The Trump campaign has announced a pair of promotions, as the president falls behind Joe Biden in polling from key battleground states. The campaign announced in a statement that Bill Stepien, previously serving as a senior political adviser, will become deputy campaign manager, and Stephanie Alexander, who had been a regional political director, will become the campaign\u2019s chief of staff. There has been speculation in recent weeks that Trump may push out campaign manager Brad Parscale, who the president reportedly threatened to sue over his sliding poll numbers and criticism tied to the coronavirus response. But Stepien\u2019s statement about his promotion indicated he would be working alongside Parscale as they try to help Trump win a second term. \u201cI will continue to support Brad Parscale as he leads the campaign, working with all of our partners in states across the country, and helping to coordinate all of our efforts to ensure the President is re-elected,\u201d Stepien said. Washington, DC, reported zero coronavirus deaths for the first time since late March, raising hopes that the nation\u2019s capital may soon be able to start easing social distancing restrictions. DC mayor Muriel Bowser initially said the city would not be able to start its reopening process until June 8 due to concern about the climbing number of coronavirus cases. But Bowser has since revised that, saying the District could start its reopening later this week if the city continues to see a decline in community spread. The Democratic mayor is expected to announce a decision on starting the reopening tomorrow. Georgia\u2019s governor offered up the state as a potential host of the Republican convention after Trump lashed out against the Democratic governor of North Carolina, where the event is currently set to take place. \u201cI love the Great State of North Carolina, so much so that I insisted on having the Republican National Convention in Charlotte at the end of August,\u201d Trump said in a series of tweets yesterday. \u201cUnfortunately, Democrat Governor, @RoyCooperNC is still in Shutdown mood &amp; unable to guarantee that by August we will be allowed full attendance in the Arena.\u201d Brian Kemp, the Republican governor of Georgia, has now weighed in, saying he would be \u201chonored to safely host the Republican National Convention.\u201d But the president\u2019s demands for a \u201cguarantee\u201d of being able to host tens of thousands of people in a convention center ignores the uncertainty surrounding what coronavirus restrictions will be needed into the summer. Realistically, no state can make such a \u201cguarantee\u201d at this point in time, and Cooper\u2019s office said in a statement, \u201cNorth Carolina is relying on data and science to protect our state\u2019s public health and safety.\u201d Mick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s former acting chief of staff, said this morning that he thinks the country has \u201coverreacted\u201d in its response to coronavirus. Mulvaney said he flew on an airplane this weekend, and he insisted he \u201cwould be completely comfortable sitting in a center seat of an airplane\u201d as long as flyers were consistently wearing face masks. \u201cI think we\u2019ve sort of lost perspective on this a little bit,\u201d Mulvaney said. \u201cWe\u2019ve overreacted a little bit.\u201d The former White House official went on to note the tens of thousands of people who die from the flu every year, but medical experts have warned against drawing comparisons between the two illnesses and underscored that coronavirus has a much higher death rate. Twitter has said it will not remove tweets from Trump pushing a baseless conspiracy theory involving Joe Scarborough, despite a plea from the widower of Lori Klausutis to do so. Timothy J Klausutis wrote a letter to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey asking him to remove the tweets out of consideration for his wife, who died from a fall in 2001. Trump has suggested Scarborough may be responsible for her death, even though that conspiracy theory has been thoroughly debunked. \u201cWe are deeply sorry about the pain these statements, and the attention they are drawing, are causing the family,\u201d a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working to expand existing product features and policies so we can more effectively address things like this going forward, and we hope to have those changes in place shortly.\u201d The spokesperson did not elaborate on what those changes would be or how they might account for the \u201cconstant barrage of falsehoods, half-truths, innuendo and conspiracy theories\u201d about Klausutis, as her husband wrote in his letter to Dorsey. The trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange was reopened after two months of closure, another sign of how New York is slowly easing coronavirus restrictions as the city\u2019s death rate slows. Governor Andrew Cuomo, who has become one of the most recognizable faces in the US response to coronavirus, rang the opening bell to cheers from traders. However, those on the floor will still have to observe guidelines to help limit the spread of the virus, including wearing a mask and staying six feet apart from each other. Trump\u2019s tweet pushing a baseless conspiracy theory involving Joe Scarborough comes as the widower of Lori Klausutis has writted to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to implore him to remove the president\u2019s tweets about her death. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to intervene in this instance because the President of the United States has taken something that does not belong him \u2014 the memory of my dead wife \u2014 and perverted it for perceived political gain,\u201d Timothy J. Klausutis wrote in his letter, which was first reported on by the New York Times. \u201cI have mourned my wife every day since her passing. I have tried to honor her memory and our marriage,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs her husband, I feel that one of my marital obligations is to protect her memory as I would have protected her in life.\u201d Klausutis said the tweets were a clear violation of Twitter\u2019s community rules and terms and services and argued any other user would be banished from the platform for sending the same tweets. Twitter has previously been hesitant to go after Trump for his often false and misleading tweets, although the company said earlier this month that it would label misleading tweets about the coronavirus pandemic, even if they came from the president. This is Joan Greve, taking over for Martin Pengelly. Trump has been quite active on Twitter this morning, now highlighting a conspiracy theory about MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, who has been a frequent target of the president\u2019s ire. \u201cThe opening of a Cold Case against Psycho Joe Scarborough was not a Donald Trump original thought, this has been going on for years, long before I joined the chorus,\u201d Trump wrote in a two-part tweet thread. \u201cIn 2016 when Joe &amp; his wacky future ex-wife, Mika, would endlessly interview me, I would always be thinking ... about whether or not Joe could have done such a horrible thing? Maybe or maybe not, but I find Joe to be a total Nut Job, and I knew him well, far better than most. So many unanswered &amp; obvious questions, but I won\u2019t bring them up now! Law enforcement eventually will?\u201d The \u201cCold Case\u201d Trump is referring to is related to the 2001 death of Lori Klausutis, a former staffer to then-congressman Scarborough who died from a fall caused by a previously unknown heart condition. That conclusion has been confirmed by both the local Florida police and the medical examiner who investigated Klausutis\u2019 death. The president is kicking up a baseless conspiracy theory that has already been thoroughly debunked in order to suggest that one of his foes might be guilty of murder. More from the president, who really doesn\u2019t like mail-in voting: There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged &amp; even illegally printed out &amp; fraudulently signed. \u201cThe Governor of California is sending Ballots to millions of people, anyone living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get one. That will be followed up with professionals telling all of these people, many of whom have never even thought of voting before, how, and for whom, to vote. This will be a Rigged Election. No way!\u201d The Republican National Committee is suing to try to stop Gavin Newsom\u2019s attempt to mail ballots to all voters ahead of November\u2019s election, and Trump has been to the well before to express the way he feels. Today\u2019s example is not quite the \u201csaying the quiet part loud\u201d of past Trump remarks about mail-in voting but the bolded lines in the second paragraph above seem to suggest that the president of the US doesn\u2019t like, well, functioning representative democracy. It\u2019s hard to know quite where to start when Trump gets on to mail-in voting and how it is bad and rigged against him. It isn\u2019t, in short, as many fact-checkers and media outlets will tell you. So indeed will state Republican parties seeking to organise for an election bound to be fought at the very least in the shadow of the coronavirus outbreak and possibly in the middle of a lethal autumn resurgence. Here\u2019s an image from a Pennsylvania Republican party email, sent to me by a correspondent\u2026 The New York Times\u2019 decision to devote its front page on Sunday to a list of around 1,000 names of the dead is still reverberating around political and non-political America. Here\u2019s David Leonhardt, in the Times\u2019 morning email: Sometime in the next few days, the official coronavirus death count will likely exceed 100,000. The true count is even higher \u2013 probably closer to 130,000. This larger number includes people who had the virus but weren\u2019t diagnosed, as well as those who died for indirect reasons, such as delaying medical treatment for other illnesses. \u2026On Sunday, The Times devoted its entire front page and a few inside pages to the names of virus victims\u2026 the idea came from Simone Landon, an editor on the Graphics desk, who wanted to find a way to note both the scale of the tragedy and the humanity of those lost. \u2026To list all of the Americans who had died from the virus would have required every page of the Sunday paper \u2014 and the paper would have needed to be more than twice as thick as usual. A former top economic aide to Barack Obama has been advising the Joe Biden campaign that the economy could post a record recovery in the run-up to the November election. Some Obama alumni are concerned that a temporary economic surge could boost Donald Trump, who currently trails Biden in national polling, to reelection, according to an unnamed source quoted by Politico. But Jason Furman, a former Obama adviser and now Harvard economics professor, has predicted that \u201cWe are about to see the best economic data we\u2019ve seen in the history of this country,\u201d Politico reported. That prediction dovetails with White House forecasts of a \u201cV-shaped\u201d economic recovery, with businesses reopening this summer and fall and furloughed workers flooding back into old jobs and resuming spending patterns. Biden said last week that an economic recovery \u201cis a long way away as I see it right now\u201d. Thousands of US businesses closed in March and April to combat the spread of coronavirus and consumer spending took a nosedive. The official unemployment rate in the US rose to 14.7% in April, the worst since records began. Top Trump economics adviser Kevin Hassett said at the weekend that unemployment is likely to crest 20%. But he also said a sudden economic recovery is possible, because \u201cour human capital stock\u201d \u2013 workers \u2013 remains intact. \u201cOur capital stock hasn\u2019t been destroyed, our human capital stock is ready to get back to work, and so there are lots of reasons to believe that we can get going way faster than we have in previous crises,\u201d Hassett told CNN\u2019s State of the Union. The US workforce has been devastated in the last 10 weeks by loss of income and in many cases health insurance. Food banks across the country have reported record demand while workers deemed essential have gone on strike to protest a lack of protective gear. The country is approaching a death toll of 100,000 from the virus \u2013 the highest in the world. \u201cAll the signs of economic recovery are going to be raging everywhere,\u201d Hassett said, though he also warned that unemployment could remain in double digits through the November election: The Shining is 40, so in tribute, Heeeeeeere\u2019s Donny\u2026 The president\u2019s first tweet of the day is an attack on his presumptive opponent at the polls in November which of course does not cite which \u201cpolls on the matter\u201d he means. Trump likes to attack Biden and Barack Obama over H1N1, or the swine flu, which hit the US in 2009. Here\u2019s more on the matter from factcheck.org, a project from the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania which, as it happens, is Trump\u2019s alma mater: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were about 60.8 million cases of infection with the novel type of influenza virus in the US between April 2009 and April 2010, with a total of approximately 274,304 hospitalizations and 12,469 deaths. While that death toll may sound high, it\u2019s over an entire year and, in fact, ended up being far lower than was initially expected. The CDC currently puts cases of the novel coronavirus in the US since the turn of the year at more than 1.6m and there have been nearly 100,000 deaths. Most observers suggest stronger and swifter action by the Trump administration could have lessened that toll significantly. There\u2019s a press briefing on the White House schedule today, with Kayleigh McEnany in the Brady Briefing Room at 2pm. Trump\u2019s fourth press secretary is at loggerheads with some reporters already. On Friday, McEnany pushed back at questions about Trump\u2019s attempt to order states to reopen houses of worship. On Sunday Fox News host Chris Wallace, not one of the president\u2019s favourites, said: \u201cI spent six years in the White House briefing room covering Ronald Reagan. I have to say, I never \u2013 and in the years since too, I never saw a White House press secretary act like that.\u201d Jonah Goldberg, editor of The Dispatch, added: \u201cWhat Donald Trump wants in a press secretary is a Twitter troll who goes on attack. Doesn\u2019t actually care about doing the job they have, and instead wants to impress really an audience of one and make another part of official Washington another one of these essentially cable news and Twitter gladiatorial arenas.\u201d For schadenfreude fans, here\u2019s our report on something else that happened in the briefing room on Friday: At 4pm today, meanwhile, Trump is due to deliver remarks in the Rose Garden, \u201con Protecting Seniors with Diabetes\u201d. To be minorly and possibly inappropriately facetious, it\u2019s not yet clear if he thinks hydroxychloroquine can help. At lunchtime, meanwhile, Trump will carry out the swearing-in of John Ratcliffe, the former Republican congressman who is his new Director of National Intelligence and whose confirmation to the role, in the Senate, was \u2026 not exactly bipartisan. \u2026and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus outbreak in the US, and the politics around it. The death toll is still inching towards 100,000. After demanding that churches be allowed to reopen, Donald Trump spent Saturday and Sunday of the Memorial Day weekend playing golf and raging at his enemies on Twitter. Among many other things, some absurdly offensive, he threatened to move the Republican convention from North Carolina if the governor does not reopen the state and allow a packed arena. Others took note. The New York Times calculates that the pandemic has been a much deadlier problem in blue, Democratic states than red, Republican ones. Masks are becoming a political issue: Trump didn\u2019t wear one in public on Memorial Day, Joe Biden did. Trump retweeted criticism of Biden by a Fox News personality. \u201cThis might help explain why Trump doesn\u2019t like to wear a mask in public,\u201d Brit Hume wrote, accompanying a picture of Biden in a mask and sunglasses. Elsewhere, the Republican governor of North Dakota was near tears as he pleaded with people not to shame people who do wear them. In Virginia, a Democratic governor who said masks save lives went to the beach \u2026 without one. The push to reopen the economy goes on, of course, as summer begins and public health experts keep on warning that reopening too soon could contribute to a deadly second wave of the virus. The Wall Street Journal reports: \u201cWe\u2019re past the trough in terms of peak damage.\u201d But Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett told CNN on Sunday unemployment was headed past 20% and would likely be in double figures still come the election in November. Hassett also referred to America\u2019s \u201chuman capital stock\u201d being ready to go back to work, which didn\u2019t go down too well on Twitter. Plus, polling shows even red states are reluctant to reopen too soon, however their governors, pushed by Trump, continue to push the pace. A Washington Post headline: \u201cIn crucial Florida, some senior voters cast a skeptical eye toward Trump\u2019s re-election.\u201d Another thing: this morning\u2019s Politico Playbook email, an essential item for politics tragics everywhere, is headlined: \u201cWhen powerful people think the rules aren\u2019t for them\u201d. But the travails of Dominic Cummings, aide to British prime minister Boris Johnson, are only its second item. The first is Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s husband reportedly \u201cpulling the \u2018don\u2019t-you-know-who-I-am\u2019 card with a vacation boat dock worker in the middle of a pandemic that has killed thousands of people in his state\u201d. The state is Michigan and Whitmer is on Joe Biden\u2019s running mate short list. So that part of the campaign has begun. Here\u2019s Lauren Gambino on how it gets dirty from here\u2026",
