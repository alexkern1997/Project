The service began with a scripture reading and a prayer urging healing, and saw the Rev Al Sharpton deliver a powerful eulogy calling for white America to \u201cget off our necks\u201d. Floyd\u2019s family wept openly and wiped their eyes as people raised their arms in the air and a singer broke into Amazing Grace. In a eulogy packed with passion, anger and the promise of hope, alongside a stab at Donald Trump, Sharpton said the knee pressing down on Floyd\u2019s neck was the story of black Americans for generations. \u201cThe reason we could never be who we wanted and dreamed of being is you kept your knee on our neck,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us to stand up in George\u2019s name and say: get your knee off our necks.\u201d Amid the fury of Sharpton\u2019s demands and the heart-rending glimpses into Floyd\u2019s life offered by his family, it was the nearly nine minutes of standing in silence that tested the mourners. Each second dragging by served as a reminder to stunned relatives and friends of what seemed a near eternity that a police officer\u2019s knee pressed down on Floyd\u2019s neck, squeezing the life out of him. Sharpton had warned how difficult these eight minutes and 46 seconds were going to be. \u201cAs you go through these long eight minutes, think about what George was going through, laying there for those eight minutes, begging for his own life ...\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t let this go. We can\u2019t keep living like this,\u201d he said. Other mourners at North Central University in Minneapolis, where the memorial was held, stared up at a brightly lit replica of the mural of Floyd painted on a wall at the site of his death and hanging behind his golden coffin. Since Floyd was killed by police on 25 May, crowds have gathered day and night in Minneapolis for huge protests \u2013 marred by bouts of violent unrest and looting \u2013 and to pay tribute at the site where Floyd was pinned to the street during an arrest attempt. North Central University announced a George Floyd scholarship for young black Americans and called for other universities to do likewise. Floyd\u2019s family had filed in to the service to the emotional pull of a gospel choir as they passed a golden coffin piled high with flowers. A photo of Floyd wearing a black and gold striped hoodie was propped next to the casket. His family sat behind their masks in the centre of the sanctuary at the campus in downtown Minneapolis, accompanied by a sprinkling of civil rights activists including Martin Luther King III and Jesse Jackson, the actor Kevin Hart, and Minnesota\u2019s leading politicians including US senators, Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith. The family\u2019s lawyer, Benjamin Crump, set the tone for much of the service as he described the scenes playing out on the video of police officer Derek Chauvin killing Floyd as \u201ctorture and evil\u201d. On Thursday, it was revealed that Floyd had tested positive for coronavirus in April but Crump said that wasn\u2019t what killed him. \u201cIt was that other pandemic that we\u2019re far too familiar with in America, that pandemic of racism and discrimination that killed George Floyd,\u201d he thundered.

The Australian\u2019s foreign editor, Greg Sheridan, a regular guest on ABC programs including Insiders and The Drum, boldly told Sky News the Floyd murder was a one-off and there was no systemic racism in the States. \u201cMost African Americans are middle class, and they don\u2019t suffer daily, shocking racism,\u201d Sheridan said. \u201cI myself have lived in the United States on four separate occasions. And I never saw any racial confrontation. I never heard anyone make a racist remark.\u201d \u201cThe very fact that America is convulsed over this shocking incident shows that it is not an America in which racial violence against blacks is normalised or accepted, you know, carried out by official agencies or by private private individuals.\u201d Sheridan was invited back on Insiders despite attacking the ABC\u2019s reporting on George Pell and falsely claiming that the the broadcaster had produced Tim Minchin\u2019s Come Back Cardinal Pell song. Andrew Bolt scorns \u2018supposed racism here\u2019 An incomprehensible cartoon in the Australian by John Spooner was also dismissive of the Black Lives Matter protests, portraying a black protester kneeling on the neck of the Statue of Liberty. But it was Andrew Bolt who managed to use the tragic events in the US to attack Indigenous women Linda Burney and Brooke Boney and to accuse the ABC of fanning the flames of race resentment. Bolt said by inviting the Labor MP to discuss black deaths in custody in Australia on RN Breakfast, the ABC was urging Australians \u201cto not just feel rage at the killing in Minneapolis of a black man, George Floyd, by a white police officer, but to rage at supposed racism here\u201d. He also took aim at Boney, the Today show\u2019s entertainment editor, for daring to point out that Australians condemn the savagery in the US but \u201csit idly by while the oldest continuing culture in the world is dismantled before our eyes\u201d. Bolt called on Boney to apologise for her column about the parallels in the Sydney Morning Herald. \u201cIt\u2019s a fraud,\u201d he wrote. \u201cShame on them for so wilfully playing with the fires of race resentment. \u201cWill the Sydney Morning Herald do the responsible thing tomorrow and publish an article just as prominent as that from Boney that sets out the full facts of this case? Or is it happy to risk encouraging race riots? \u201cAnd will Boney apologise?\u201d News Corp cuts continue Speaking of the Murdochs, Weekly Beast understands both Al Jazeera English and the ABC\u2019s Four Corners are working on documentaries about Rupert Murdoch and his influence in Australia. The News Corp global company lost US$1bn in the three months to the end of March and is making massive cuts to its Australian businesses, including this week shutting down two more brands: the horribly named whimn.com.au and Stellar, the Sunday magazine inserted in the papers. Whimn, or \u201cwith her in mind\u201d, aimed to take on Mamamia and be \u201cthe number one female news and information source in this country\u201d when it launched in 2016. All women\u2019s content will now appear under the Body + Soul brand to create a \u201cpremium weekend women\u2019s product\u201d, staff were told. News Corp refused to say how many journalists were laid off when it gutted its local and regional newspapers but the union estimates the figure is 204, and sources say the staffing for the remaining digital-only mastheads that remain is very low. The former Media Watch host Jonathan Holmes is reporting the Murdoch story for Four Corners. ABC triumphs online again It\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that News Corp Australia attacks the ABC almost daily, given that the public broadcaster now has a far bigger audience for its online news than any of the Murdoch mastheads. For the fourth month in a row ABC News is No 1 in the Nielsen digital content ratings and news.com.au has surprisingly plummeted from No 2 to No 6, after spending most of 2019 at No 1. Which brings us to the Australian and its gold medal performance in the spin category this week. According to a report in the Australian, audiences are \u201crushing\u201d to the broadsheet, \u201cwhich is the best-performing newspaper in the country\u201d. As the only other national newspaper is the Australian Financial Review it\u2019s a very small field. In the Nielsen digital stakes the picture for the Oz is not so bright. In March, which saw a huge spike in news across the board, the Oz managed to enter the top 10 digital news sites for the first time since 2018 but in April it dropped out again. With the Oz a no-show there is now only one News Corp masthead \u2013 news.com.au \u2013 in the top 10 news brands in the country. Saturation coverage The Nielsen data for news sites showed a big drop across all publishers in April as interest in the coronavirus waned after a big spike in interest in March. The protests in the US and the return of live sport has seen coverage of coronavirus drop below 50% of all news articles for the first time in nearly three months, according to data from Streem media monitoring. The Covid-19 media saturation peaked on 24 March when the virus was mentioned in 81% of stories published that day. In January there was a peak of 36% for the bushfire coverage.

After NSW police asked the court to call off the Black Lives Matter protest, scheduled to meet at Town Hall in Sydney on Saturday, Justice Desmond Fagan ruled there would be a public safety risk in allowing the protest \u2013 which expects 5,000 attendees \u2013 to go ahead during the Covid-19 pandemic. Relying in part on an affidavit from the NSW chief health officer, Kerry Chant, Fagan ultimately decided that giving the green light for the protest to proceed would be in \u201cdefiance\u201d of the decisions made by ministers and the advice of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee to stop the spread of Covid-19. Lawyers representing the protest organisers argued protesters would attend the planned rally regardless of the legal outcome, and because of this, it should be given legal support so police could close roads to allow for attendees to socially distance, rather than forcing them onto footpaths where distancing was harder to observe.

In South Australia, the police commissioner, Grant Stevens, allowed protests to go ahead, and granted an exemption to the state\u2019s coronavirus restrictions. In Sydney, the mother of David Dungay, an Indigenous man who said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 12 times before he died in jail in 2015, said she would march on Saturday regardless. \u201cI\u2019m marching for my son ... the nurses and doctors put my son under ground, and I\u2019m going to walk on it,\u201d Leetona Dungay said. Morrison told those thinking of attending protests to not \u201cmisuse\u201d their liberty as the risk of Covid-19 remains real. Andrews urged people to stay home from the Melbourne event. \u201cThis is serious \u2013 big events are not allowed, big events are not safe, big events will do nothing but spread this virus,\u201d he said.

In other coronavirus developments: Turkey will impose a two-day weekend lockdown in 15 cities as part of efforts to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, the interior ministry said early on Friday. In a statement, the ministry said bakeries and certain shops could operate during the lockdown. China reported five new Covid-19 cases and three new asymptomatic infections the national health commission said on Friday, adding that all of the cases were imported. New Zealand is tiptoeing towards eliminating the virus, with 14 consecutive days of no new cases. The Lancet paper that halted global trials of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 because of fears of increased deaths has been retracted after a Guardian investigation found inconsistencies in the data. Japan\u2019s household spending slumped in April, falling 11.1% from a year earlier, government data showed on Friday, as the world\u2019s third-largest economy struggled with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Australian authorities are taking legal action to try stop a Black Lives Matter protest scheduled to take place in Sydney on Saturday, citing the risk of an outbreak of Covid-19 given the large numbers expected to attend. Argentina extended a mandatory lockdown in the capital, Buenos Aires, and some other parts of the country from 7 June to 28 June, as confirmed coronavirus cases 20,000.",

      "bodyText": "Scout troops are being paired with hundreds of care homes across the UK as the 112-year-old movement attempts to shape a new role in post-pandemic Britain by focusing on intergenerational solidarity with the most vulnerable. Cubs and scouts have continued meeting online during the coronavirus crisis \u2013 wearing woggles and scarves, and reciting their \u201cdo my best\u201d promises over video link. And they have decided to direct their community work towards helping the hard-hit care sector. Units are being linked with local care homes in an effort to create an intergenerational bridge to isolated residents. Loneliness and mental health problems brought on by a lack of visits is increasingly being recognised as contributory factor to the Covid-19 crisis in care homes, many of which have suffered outbreaks of the virus. Scouts themselves decided to target residential care, switching from an earlier priority of child mental health. It is a sign of rising public concern about the predicament of hundreds of thousands of people in UK care facilities where about 15,000 residents have died from Covid-19. \u201cMaybe at the moment everyone is thinking about not seeing their grans and grandads so maybe people are more aware,\u201d said Terry O\u2019Neill, the Scouts\u2019 district commissioner for Rosyth, Fife, who has facilitated contacts with care home residents in Billingry, Cowdenbeath and Dalgety Bay over the last fortnight. They have been sending cards to residents containing a tea bag with the idea they can have a cup of tea and read, or be read to, the scout\u2019s message. Six out of 10 care homes have had coronavirus outbreaks in Scotland and by the end of May more people there had died in care homes from Covid-19 than in hospital \u2013 1,818 v 1,815. By contrast, in 2018, half as many people died in care homes than hospitals in Scotland. \u201cPictures and letters have been cheering up my Nanny and Grandad while I can\u2019t see them to give them a hug,\u201d said James Thorp, a six-year-old beaver scout in Enfield, north London. \u201cI wanted to start doing the same for other people.\u201d Nadra Ahmed, the executive chair of the National Care Association, which represents facilities taking part, said: \u201cLittle acts of kindness can make a huge difference to the generation who have served their country enabling our youth to live a life based on freedom. Intergenerational support brings mutual advantages and we hope this is the start of a long-standing alliance.\u201d Scout meetings were cancelled with the lockdown but leaders have been continuing weekly sessions via video link. Zoom, the company which offers one of the most well-used platforms, has now donated free access to the movement amid uncertainty about when in-person meetings can resume. The virtual alternative has already had some benefits, with scouts in Australia and Denmark joining sessions run by Lynn Milner, leader of East Sheen scouts in south-west London. Her troop has been completing their navigator badges, playing map sign bingo and coming fully dressed and equipped for a hike so show they can be prepared. Attendance has been running at about 75%, with meetings run at the same time as physical meetings. Scouts are asked to wear their uniform shirts and scarves, but Millar said she was sure not to run meetings too strictly so the scouts would have time to catch up with each other. \u201cI think a lot of the young people are struggling far more than people realise,\u201d said Millar. \u201cThey are missing their friends.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Masks compulsory on public transport from 15 June Morning everyone. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this morning. Britain\u2019s test-and-trace system could take another four months before it is working properly, the Guardian has learned, raising concerns about how the country might cope with a second wave of coronavirus infections. Tony Prestedge, a banker drafted in to run the NHS scheme, told staff that the programme would be \u201cimperfect\u201d at launch and won\u2019t be world class until September or October. Boris Johnson had said the \u201cworld-beating\u201d scheme would be in place by 1 June. Official figures showed that there were 83% more deaths from dementia than usual in April as charities warned that reduced care and family visits during the crisis meant that sufferers were \u201cjust switching off\u201d. A hospital doctor has resigned over Dominic Cummings refusal to quit as Johnson\u2019s senior adviser over his lockdown car trip to Durham. As the nation edges out of lockdown, face masks will be compulsory on all public transport in England from 15 June, which is the same day non-essential shops are likely to reopen. Passengers will also be able to receive alerts about congestion on trains and stations so that they can delay their journeys if possible. You can follow all the last coronavirus developments at our live blog or at a glance. There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * \u2018Get off our necks\u2019 \u2013 The streets of American cities may have become calmer but the battleground over the death of George Floyd looks set to move to the courts after civil rights groups said they would sue Donald Trump over the use of teargas to clear protesters for his Washington church photo op. The veteran black pastor Rev Al Sharpton delivered a powerful address at a memorial for Floyd in Minneapolis, saying he was killed by a \u201cpandemic of racism\u201d and warning white America to \u201cget off our necks\u201d. Floyd\u2019s family wept as people raised their arms in the air and a singer broke into Amazing Grace. The New York Times says an opinion piece by Republican senator Tom Cotton which advocated for the deployment of the military against protesters \u201cdid not meet editorial standards\u201d. In Washington state, the death of a black man in police custody in March has been ruled as murder, while in California police responding to reports of alleged looting shot dead a man who was on his knees with his hands in the air. Follow all the developments in the US protests story at our live blog here. * * * McCann hope \u2013 Police in Britain, Germany and Portugal have issued appeals for information about the strongest suspect ever identified in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in 2007. Circumstantial evidence has convinced detectives that a 43-year-old German child sex offender and rapist is their prime suspect. He has been known to police for years, and was convicted in Germany last year of the rape of a 72-year-old American woman in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in 2005, two years before Madeleine was snatched from a hotel room the same area. He is also known to have committed hotel break-ins. The breakthrough brings hope to Madeleine\u2019s parents in their 13-year quest to find out what happened to their daughter. * * * Given out \u2013 Geoffrey Boycott has been dropped from the commentary team for Test Match Special in what appears to signal the end of the controversial former England opener\u2019s career at the BBC. Boycott, who was discarded by the BBC after assaulting his girlfriend in 1998 before being reinstated in 2005, has been left out of the TMS team for 2020 in a year which will see the corporation screen Test highlights fronted by England women\u2019s player Isa Guha. * * * Maritime heritage \u2013 The wreck of a German warship that sank off the coast of Kent in 1878 has been given heritage protection. The SMS Grosser Kurf\u00fcrst sank \u201cwithin minutes\u201d with the loss of 284 men after it collided with another ironclad German ship while on a training exercise. The decision means the wreck, which is upside down on the sea bed, can be visited by divers but its contents will be protected. Coronavirus extra The outbreak in Brazil continues to worsen with another 1,300 deaths recorded yesterday. The country now has the third highest death toll behind the US and the UK, while cases in South Africa almost doubled on Thursday. The worldwide total is now nearly 390,000 with 6.6 million cases and the pandemic has prompted a leading economist and the UN\u2019s environment chief to warn that it is an \u201cSOS\u201d signal for the human race. Astra Zeneca says it has doubled its capacity for producing a possible vaccine to 2bn doses and an Australian government taskforce has endorsed the anti-Ebola drug remdesivir for treatment against Covid-19. New Zealand could declare itself virus-free as early as next week after 14 days in a row without registering any new cases. Today in Focus podcast Guardian US reporter Kenya Evelyn looks back at the 11 days of protest that started in Minneapolis over the killing of George Floyd, but quickly spread across the rest of America and then the world Lunchtime read: \u2018Ed Sheeran is piggybacking on grime,\u2019 says Wiley He\u2019s said it before, but this time he\u2019s serious. Wiley, the godfather of grime, is retiring with what he says will be his final album because at 41 he can\u2019t \u201cfit in with kids\u201d any more. After a tumultuous year, he explains his beef with Drake, Stormzy and \u201cEngland\u2019s golden boy\u201d Ed Sheeran. Sport The way is clear for the Premier League to restart after the release of a provisional fixture list for the first three full match rounds of Project Restart. England\u2019s leading rugby players face the increasing prospect of wage cuts and summer rugby as the sport battles to avoid financial meltdown because of the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Chelsea are close to signing Timo Werner after holding productive talks with the RB Leipzig forward, who is set to disappoint Liverpool by moving to Stamford Bridge for \u00a353m. The NBA is set to become the first major North American sports league to resume play after the league\u2019s board of governors approved a 22-team format for restarting the season in late July at the Disney campus near Orlando, Florida. But the all-female W Series, which was to have provided support races at two Formula One grands prix this season, has been cancelled because of the pandemic. Business The European Central Bank has ramped up its response to the pandemic by pumping another \u20ac600bn (\u00a3539.5bn) of emergency financial support into the eurozone economy.

Lars (Ferrell) and Sigrit (McAdams) face off against rivals as they pursue their dream of triumphing at the titular music competition. To get a snifter of the sort of silliness in store, check out the music video Volcano Man \u2013 featuring the pair jamming on keyboards, running in front of icy waterfalls and performing starfishes in the snow. Moonlight Film, USA, 2017 \u2013 out now Writer/director Barry Jenkins\u2019 Oscar-winning triptych explores three periods in the life of protagonist Chiron, played by Alex Hibbert, Ashton Sanders and Trevante Rhodes. Jenkins uses water throughout the film as a symbol of rebirth and transformation \u2013 including in a memorable scene in which Chiron, as a boy, is taught to swim, held in a baptism-like embrace by an older role model played by Mahershala Ali. The symbolism of water returns later in a moment capturing Chiron\u2019s first sexual encounter, shared with another boy, transpiring on the sand at a beach. With the kind of beautiful camerawork that motivated critics such as myself to lunge to the keyboard and bang out descriptors such as \u201cmeditative\u201d and \u201cvisual poetry\u201d, the aura of this exquisite drama is almost magically humane: as if the film itself exists beneath a cloud, in the glow of moonlight. Reality Z TV, Brazil, 2020 \u2013 out 10 June A bunch of reality TV contestants holed up in a TV studio while a zombie outbreak causes bedlam outside is exactly the kind of premise the late George Romero \u2013 director of Night of the Living Dead and the founding father of the modern zombie movie \u2013 would have found irresistible. One of the contestants in Reality Z, a Brazilian production set in Rio de Janeiro, reacts to the news of a zombie outbreak by questioning whether the flesh-chewing epidemic is actually happening (maybe it\u2019s a trick by the studio?) while another talks of an idyllic, self-sustaining off-the-grid place to hide out in. Generally speaking, reality TV participants are not exactly known for their intelligence, which puts this series in a good position to fulfil Romero\u2019s stipulation that a good zombie story \u201cis not fun without a bunch of stupid people running around and observing how they fail to handle the situation\u201d.

The action scenes have a cartoon kind of largesse, with the ridiculously entertaining Abu Dhabi-set double skyscraper jump marking the film\u2019s zenith as a stupidly entertaining spectacle. It was also a surprisingly respectful, even emotional send-off to the character played by Paul Walker, who died midway through production.

      "body": "<p>It was the moment the scientists veered off script. As ministers moved to ease the lockdown in late May, a handful of the government\u2019s advisers from Sage (the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) went public with their fears. The virus was still a present danger, infecting thousands of people a day, they warned: now was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/covid-19-spreading-too-fast-to-lift-uk-lockdown-sage-adviser\">not the time to lift the lockdown</a>.</p> <p>As others <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/health-officials-make-last-minute-plea-to-stop-lockdown-easing-happy-monday\">came out in support</a> of the experts, it seemed most scientists were of one voice. But that is not the case. Sunetra Gupta, a professor of theoretical epidemiology at Oxford University, believes \u2013 somewhat controversially \u2013 that the lockdown should be lifted faster. In the rush to drive infections down, she fears the poorest have been brushed aside.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s becoming clear that a lot of people have been exposed to the virus and that the death rate in people under 65 is not something you would lock down the economy for,\u201d she says. \u201cWe can\u2019t just think about those who are vulnerable to the disease. We have to think about those who are vulnerable to lockdown too. The costs of lockdown are too high at this point.\u201d</p> <p>Gupta is not one of the scientists whom the epidemic has made a household name. But on 26 March, the day the lockdown came into effect, she <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.24.20042291v1\">intervened with research</a> that made instant headlines. Her team at Oxford used a simple susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model to produce a best-case scenario for the outbreak as a counterpoint to the government\u2019s worst-case scenario.</p> <p>The worst case, adopted by government, was that left unchecked, the virus was so dangerous the epidemic could claim 500,000 lives. The best case, set out by Gupta, is not currently borne out by scientific data \u2013 but she insists it is an important consideration and counterbalance.</p> <p>Gupta\u2019s model showed that if the virus had arrived in Britain a month earlier than thought \u2013 in December rather than January \u2013 it might have spread far wider than anyone appreciated, and infected half the population. If that was the case, the risk of dying would be a fraction of the 1% it is generally believed to be, and infections would soon wane through \u201cherd immunity\u201d \u2013 achieved when more than two-thirds have acquired immunity to the virus.</p> <p>\u201cBecause lockdown is such a drastic measure, I thought it was important to point out that the opposite extreme could match the data,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt I needed to get involved because I am really worried about the consequences of lockdown, particularly on underprivileged people, not only in this country but globally.\u201d</p> <p>Lockdown inflicts damage in more insidious ways than the virus, but the result can be the same, Gupta believes. Those in comfortable jobs who can work from home are largely insulated against the financial and mental stress of life in a pandemic. \u201cMy primary concern is that the lockdown is affecting a lot of people very adversely and it is causing deaths and will cause more deaths,\u201d she says.</p> <p>So far, the scientific data do not support Gupta\u2019s best-case scenario. Blood tests performed by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) on nearly 1,000 people in England suggest that less than 10% of the population has been exposed to the virus. The figures are in line with other surveys, though regional differences exist. Last month, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said that about 17% of Londoners might have had the virus, against nearer 5% in the rest of the country.</p> <p>But Gupta believes the test data may substantially underestimate the number of people who have fought off the virus. She suspects that while physical distancing and the lockdown have helped suppress the epidemic, infections may have waned because of people\u2019s natural resistance to the infection, for example through antibodies that fight related coronaviruses which cause common colds \u2013 but which would not necessarily show up in Covid-19 antibody tests.</p> <p>\u201cThe epidemic has in many places displayed a pattern which suggests it\u2019s been brought down by natural processes, which does not just include acquired immunity, but perhaps cross-protection from having other related viruses, and possibly some innate level of resistance to start with,\u201d she says.</p> <p>With best- and worst-case scenarios, reality often lies somewhere in between. But regardless of whether the pandemic has run its course or not, Gupta argues that a blanket lockdown is a drastic response to any infectious disease outbreak. It should have been more targeted from the start, she believes, and should become more targeted now.</p> <p>\u201cOne possibility could have been to protect the vulnerable people and monitor the epidemic for longer and if we\u2019d started to see deaths creep up in the younger population, among those who don\u2019t obviously have co-morbidities, then lock down at that point, or lock down for a couple of weeks, which the economy can endure, and try and analyse the data globally to see what\u2019s going on,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cShould we be lifting the lockdown faster? Yes. I don\u2019t think the halfway house situation is helpful. It\u2019s already underscoring the inequalities that exist and those are going to get worse and worse.\u201d She favours shielding the vulnerable but releasing the rest, while keeping physical distancing and hand hygiene measures in place.</p> <p>Speaking in a personal capacity, Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Edinburgh University, who sits on the Sage modelling subgroup, says scientists have no doubt that releasing all population-wide physical distancing measures would spark a resurgence of infections and a second wave. But he agrees that a more nuanced approach is needed to control the epidemic.</p> <p>In the UK, the over-75s are 10,000 times more likely to die from Covid-19 than the under-15s, he points out. \u201cThat is a massive, massive difference. When you see something like that as a public health scientist, you don\u2019t think of a blanket lockdown. This disease is massively concentrated in the older age group. We need to concentrate efforts where they are needed most and where we really need attention is in the care homes.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt is not clear to me that population-wide measures were ever actually the right way to go with this. I actively supported the lockdown specifically on the understanding that it was a temporary, time-limited emergency measure. I was not thinking of something that would drag on for months. I was expecting that we would develop a more nuanced strategy once we realised some groups were 10,000 times more at risk than others, that we would adjust our strategy accordingly. And that is only just starting to happen now. It\u2019s not what I signed up for.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 June 2020 to remove incorrect details about Gupta\u2019s personal life.</p>",

Two sources close to the family of Princess Basmah bint Saud bin Abdulaziz al-Saud say the senior royal, known as an outspoken advocate for reform, is in a life-threatening condition inside al-Ha\u2019ir prison south of Riyadh.

He added that his uncle, a doctor, was denied diabetes and other medication, and in 2018 he passed out in court and was hospitalised. Rights groups say that al-Ha\u2019ir has long been associated with physical abuse. \u201cThe general criminal area of the prison is even worse in terms of overcrowding and poor sanitation,\u201d said Josh Cooper of the Saudi rights group Al Qst. \u201cThere\u2019s an extreme risk now in light of Covid-19 that the prison is overcrowded and lacks basic services.\u201d Cooper added that denial of medical treatment is used as a punishment, as well as the temporary transfer of political prisoners into the overcrowded general criminal prison.",

Initially, I really missed the cadence of the Saturday afternoon \u2013&nbsp;the results, the analysis and the narrative that went with it. As time went on, I missed it a lot less and realised that trying to keep up was tiring. I\u2019ll be a lot more selective about what I watch when it returns. I\u2019ve completely fallen out of love with the Premier League and its feelings of self-importance. I couldn\u2019t care whether the league comes back or not given that people are dying from a pandemic. This has been an overdue awakening for how important football really is. <em>Neil Tween, 36</em></p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m definitely missing the distraction\u2019</h2> <p>What have I missed most was the chance for my ailing 90-year-old grandfather to see Liverpool lift the league trophy one last time. Sadly, he caught coronavirus in his care home and died in April. You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone was played at his funeral. With two deaths in the family, we\u2019ve had other things on our minds, but I\u2019m definitely missing the distraction. <em>Matt Dickinson, 31</em></p> <h2>\u2018I will watch sport when it returns, but more sparingly\u2019</h2> <p>I have not missed it nearly as much as I thought I would, especially the hype and endless coverage about very little. So much of it is exhausting and uninteresting. Sport has become a mass distraction from the properly important things, designed to relieve us of as much money as possible. I\u2019ve not missed the shouty marketing, the obscene amounts of cash, the racism, intolerance, tribalism. I do miss the skill from sportspeople at the top of their game and will watch when it returns, but more sparingly. <em>Stephen Price, 58</em></p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019ve been editing Wikipedia pages of football seasons\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019ve missed it a lot. Late at night, I have been editing Wikipedia pages of seasons gone by \u2013&nbsp;I\u2019m lots of fun at parties. I\u2019m a Liverpool season ticket holder, but have even found myself watching videos from Middlesbrough\u2019s Uefa Cup run in 2005-06. I go to Liverpool games with my dad and it is the only thing we have in common. I had threatened to hug him and anyone else who wanted one (I\u2019m not usually a hugger) when we saw them win the league, but that\u2019s not going to happen now. <em>Dave, 31</em></p> <h2>\u2018Absence makes the heart grow fonder\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m a QPR fan and I miss the season-ticket holders I\u2019ve gotten to know over the last decades. I miss buying a new pin-badge from the lady in the pub on Uxbridge Road and letting linesmen know exactly how I feel about their eyesight. The absence of sport has made me realise how much I love it and how invested I am in the human stories it creates. Triumph, disaster, glory and failure are all such vivid aspects of the human condition \u2013&nbsp;extremes of emotion that echo through communities. <em>Tom McFarland, 31</em></p> <h2>\u2018I have spent my time on more important things\u2019</h2> <p>I haven\u2019t missed it as much as I expected. I have spent my time on more important things, such as my daughter! When sport returns, I don\u2019t think I will be as passionate as before \u2013&nbsp;but, who knows, this is football and its magic may charm me again instantly.<em> Mert Ezic, 38</em></p> <h2>\u2018It\u2019s good to know I can get by without it\u2019</h2> <p>I was concerned at the prospect of months without the distraction, but soon found other ways of passing the time. I picked up my guitar for the first time in years, made some ropey attempts at home curing and started writing. It\u2019s good to know I can get by without sport. <em>Tom Hurles, 40</em></p> <h2>\u2018I miss the routine of going to games with my family\u2019</h2> <p>I have been going to Wolves games for 50 years and I miss that routine terribly: the weekly pre-game analysis with my dad and godsons about our chances and tactics \u2013&nbsp;as if our decisions will have a critical outcome on the game. The tension going up on the train, the pre-game pint and pork scratchings, the frantic texts on finding out the team, the game itself and the post-match analysis during the two-hour journey home. It\u2019s brilliant. Lockdown has taught me the importance of deep relationships with family, friends, and ... Wolverhampton Wanderers. <em>Gary Fisher, 60</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ab079dd97247b4ca6527702805ef30fb7bcfb432\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab079dd97247b4ca6527702805ef30fb7bcfb432/0_0_3500_2197/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wolves fans outside Molineux before the match against Liverpool in January 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"628\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wolves fans outside Molineux before the match against Liverpool in January 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Sport is great entertainment, but that is all it is\u2019</h2> <p>The highs and lows of sport are perfectly captured at this time of year: the end-of-season drama, trophies, finals and play-offs. However, I have enjoyed a different rhythm of life and being less of a slave to the TV and radio. The focus of the last two months has been on the health crisis and NHS response, which has given me a wider focus on things that really matter. Sport is great entertainment and drama, but that\u2019s all it is. <em>Gareth Clark, 52</em></p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019ll be getting worked up as soon as the first whistle goes\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"56a00abd58156981ffb9fb4d3273285ccbfab013\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/56a00abd58156981ffb9fb4d3273285ccbfab013/716_48_1298_1623/800.jpg\" alt=\"Peep Peep Peep!

Michael Oliver blows his whistle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s all very well talking about perspective, but you can\u2019t spend the rest of your life not getting worked up about anything ever again, can you? As soon as the first whistle goes I\u2019ll probably be getting worked up about the ref. That said, the idea of Premier League games behind closed doors seems a bit farcical to me. Most of the fun is going to the ground and informing the opposing fans that your town is in fact superior in both footballing and cultural stature. <em>Ed Evans, 40</em></p> <h2>\u2018Without sport on, you\u2019re left with the brutal realities of the real world\u2019</h2> <p>The worst thing is not having anything to discuss with friends. It is perfect for anything from a casual chat to a fiery debate, safe in the knowledge it isn\u2019t the end of the world if you\u2019re wrong. Without sport, you are often left with the brutal realities of the real world. Arguing over the Premier League is more fun than Brexit or Covid-19. <em>Duncan Brown, 27</em></p> <h2>\u2018I was wasting my time\u2019</h2> <p>I used to watch football every weekend, but have not missed it at all. I have taken up new hobbies and am no longer prepared to timetable my weekends around matches. I was wasting time on something as meaningless as Coronation Street. <em>Tim Gunn, 59</em></p> <h2>\u2018I will be more passionate when sport returns\u2019</h2> <p>I used to wonder what life would be like without football. Now that I\u2019ve experienced it, I never want to go through this again! I tend to organise my week around the fixture list. I will be more passionate when sport returns. It is very easy to take things for granted. The extreme highs and lows of being a football fan make life more colourful. I can\u2019t wait until we get it back. <em>Paul Bellamy, 46</em></p> <h2>\u2018Sport acts as a marker in my life\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019ve missed sport immensely as the background music to my life. As someone with a personal struggle with mental health, it helps me to orientate my day, my week, my month. I suppose it acts as a marker and I\u2019m indebted to sport for being a brilliant companion for so long now. <em>John Barnes, 42</em></p> <h2>\u2018I miss the tension, the pain, the fear, the release\u2019</h2> <p>My life is: 1) my wife 2) music 3) Manchester City. I fell in love with football in 1966 and miss it hugely. Some people have religion. My congregation dresses in sky blue and have forged a strong bond over the last five decades. I miss the tension, the pain, the elation, the fear, the disappointment and the release. The past three months have felt surreal, empty, like a limbo. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got til it\u2019s gone,\u201d sang Joni Mitchell. Too bloody right! <em>Andy Price, 62</em></p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m spending more time outside and hope that will continue\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019m a pretty diehard sports fan but I am not missing it as much as I thought I would. We are spending more of our evenings outside, going for walks or playing in our yard or at the playground, rather than being glued to the couch watching games. I hope that continues. However, I know myself and I will be drawn back in. <em>Alex Howe, 31</em></p> <h2>\u2018The absence of sport has allowed me to relish other pleasures\u2019</h2> <p>I am surprised by how little I miss it. I\u2019m relishing the relative peace of lockdown. I don\u2019t miss the anxieties of constantly checking scores or the mood swings brought on by nothing more than a goal scored or missed. The break has allowed me to relish other pleasures, my enjoyment unspoilt by the false emotions sport can bring on. I will still watch, but I hopefully with the knowledge that sport should be fun, a relaxation, a diversion \u2013 but not the real world. <em>Jim Priest, 70</em></p> <h2>\u2018They don\u2019t give a stuff about fans\u2019</h2> <p>I was a season-ticket holder at Old Trafford for nearly 40 years but I haven\u2019t missed football at all. Their eagerness to complete the season without me confirms they don\u2019t give a stuff about fans. The whole sport could do with a sabbatical to reflect. It\u2019s the endless self-regard of Premier League clubs and their perception they are somehow indispensable to the course of human happiness. They are willing to risk players, take my tax money for their staff and then charge for cardboard cutouts of fans. My love of football was slowly dying, but this has finished it off. <em>Chris Mills, 50s</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0273d3bfa368f96ddceae822927bab42edb0c7b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0273d3bfa368f96ddceae822927bab42edb0c7b3/1785_27_2114_2642/800.jpg\" alt=\"You can\u2019t beat a pint in a flimsy plastic cup.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You can\u2019t beat a pint in a flimsy plastic cup.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robin Aron/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018I\u2019m desperate for an overpriced beer in a flimsy plastic cup\u2019</h2> <p>I\u2019ve missed the experience of watching live sport in crowds: the sound of rows of folded plastic seats batting against each other at Craven Cottage as the crowd stands up to watch a winger make a run into the box, the sight of floodlights on a pitch and even the smell of the grass. I\u2019m desperate even to hold an overpriced beer in a flimsy plastic cup at half-time again. <em>Rob Picheta, 27</em></p> <h2>\u2018Football is just a massive money-making exercise\u2019</h2> <p>I have been a Spurs supporter for 50 years \u2013&nbsp;my first game was Jimmy Greaves\u2019 last appearance at White Hart Lane in February 1970 \u2013&nbsp;but I have not missed football one bit. It is no longer a sport. It is a massive money-making exercise. The only reason there such determination to finish the season is because of TV money. I hope I no longer pay any attention to football when it returns. Although old habits die hard. <em>Bobby Colvill, 57</em></p> <h2>\u2018Why did I waste so many hours watching sports?\u2019</h2> <p>I have wondered many times in recent weeks why I wasted so many hours over the years watching these essentially meaningless sports. I am keen to do more things with my weekends! Of course, I say that now... <em>Simon Macklin, 44</em></p> <h2>\u2018Sport\u2019s absence has reaffirmed my love for it\u2019</h2> <p>The lockdown strangely coincided with a commitment to myself to watch less sport. I thought that I should be filling my time with something much more productive. However, the lack of sport has actually had the opposite effect. If anything, its absence has reaffirmed my love for sport and made me appreciate the role it plays in the emotions and rhythms of my life. <em>Jon Bartlett, 47</em></p> <h2>\u2018I miss watching my son play\u2019</h2> <p>Football is a massive part of family life, especially watching my son Jamie\u2019s U15 team play in the Sussex Premier league. That\u2019s what I really miss. It\u2019s a great club with good support and they have been promoted three times in a row, so watching them progress has been brilliant. It is more about the togetherness and belonging than the football itself. <em>Allan Robinson, 52</em></p> <h2>\u2018We have to find a way of staging the Olympics in 2021\u2019</h2> <p>I structure my year around sporting events. Wimbledon fortnight is redolent of childhood sunshine as I recall the gentle pick-pock and polite cheering on my mother\u2019s radio as she prepared tea and I played in the garden. Sunday afternoons during F1 season were always a time to hunker down and whisper, so as not to spoil my dad\u2019s enjoyment of the motor racing on TV. My life has been punctuated by the Olympics \u2013&nbsp;I remember the excitement of watching the 1968 Games on TV. We have to find a way of staging the Tokyo Games in 2021. It would be a loss to humanity not to come together in some way to celebrate what humans can achieve in the sporting realm. <em>Elizabeth Booth, 60</em></p>",

Tom Hurles, 40 \u2018I miss the routine of going to games with my family\u2019 I have been going to Wolves games for 50 years and I miss that routine terribly: the weekly pre-game analysis with my dad and godsons about our chances and tactics \u2013 as if our decisions will have a critical outcome on the game. The tension going up on the train, the pre-game pint and pork scratchings, the frantic texts on finding out the team, the game itself and the post-match analysis during the two-hour journey home. It\u2019s brilliant. Lockdown has taught me the importance of deep relationships with family, friends, and ... Wolverhampton Wanderers. Gary Fisher, 60 \u2018Sport is great entertainment, but that is all it is\u2019 The highs and lows of sport are perfectly captured at this time of year: the end-of-season drama, trophies, finals and play-offs. However, I have enjoyed a different rhythm of life and being less of a slave to the TV and radio. The focus of the last two months has been on the health crisis and NHS response, which has given me a wider focus on things that really matter. Sport is great entertainment and drama, but that\u2019s all it is. Gareth Clark, 52 \u2018I\u2019ll be getting worked up as soon as the first whistle goes\u2019 It\u2019s all very well talking about perspective, but you can\u2019t spend the rest of your life not getting worked up about anything ever again, can you? As soon as the first whistle goes I\u2019ll probably be getting worked up about the ref. That said, the idea of Premier League games behind closed doors seems a bit farcical to me. Most of the fun is going to the ground and informing the opposing fans that your town is in fact superior in both footballing and cultural stature. Ed Evans, 40 \u2018Without sport on, you\u2019re left with the brutal realities of the real world\u2019 The worst thing is not having anything to discuss with friends. It is perfect for anything from a casual chat to a fiery debate, safe in the knowledge it isn\u2019t the end of the world if you\u2019re wrong. Without sport, you are often left with the brutal realities of the real world. Arguing over the Premier League is more fun than Brexit or Covid-19. Duncan Brown, 27 \u2018I was wasting my time\u2019 I used to watch football every weekend, but have not missed it at all. I have taken up new hobbies and am no longer prepared to timetable my weekends around matches. I was wasting time on something as meaningless as Coronation Street. Tim Gunn, 59 \u2018I will be more passionate when sport returns\u2019 I used to wonder what life would be like without football. Now that I\u2019ve experienced it, I never want to go through this again! I tend to organise my week around the fixture list. I will be more passionate when sport returns. It is very easy to take things for granted. The extreme highs and lows of being a football fan make life more colourful. I can\u2019t wait until we get it back. Paul Bellamy, 46 \u2018Sport acts as a marker in my life\u2019 I\u2019ve missed sport immensely as the background music to my life. As someone with a personal struggle with mental health, it helps me to orientate my day, my week, my month. I suppose it acts as a marker and I\u2019m indebted to sport for being a brilliant companion for so long now. John Barnes, 42 \u2018I miss the tension, the pain, the fear, the release\u2019 My life is: 1) my wife 2) music 3) Manchester City. I fell in love with football in 1966 and miss it hugely. Some people have religion. My congregation dresses in sky blue and have forged a strong bond over the last five decades. I miss the tension, the pain, the elation, the fear, the disappointment and the release. The past three months have felt surreal, empty, like a limbo. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got til it\u2019s gone,\u201d sang Joni Mitchell. Too bloody right! Andy Price, 62 \u2018I\u2019m spending more time outside and hope that will continue\u2019 I\u2019m a pretty diehard sports fan but I am not missing it as much as I thought I would. We are spending more of our evenings outside, going for walks or playing in our yard or at the playground, rather than being glued to the couch watching games. I hope that continues. However, I know myself and I will be drawn back in. Alex Howe, 31 \u2018The absence of sport has allowed me to relish other pleasures\u2019 I am surprised by how little I miss it. I\u2019m relishing the relative peace of lockdown. I don\u2019t miss the anxieties of constantly checking scores or the mood swings brought on by nothing more than a goal scored or missed. The break has allowed me to relish other pleasures, my enjoyment unspoilt by the false emotions sport can bring on. I will still watch, but I hopefully with the knowledge that sport should be fun, a relaxation, a diversion \u2013 but not the real world. Jim Priest, 70 \u2018They don\u2019t give a stuff about fans\u2019 I was a season-ticket holder at Old Trafford for nearly 40 years but I haven\u2019t missed football at all. Their eagerness to complete the season without me confirms they don\u2019t give a stuff about fans. The whole sport could do with a sabbatical to reflect. It\u2019s the endless self-regard of Premier League clubs and their perception they are somehow indispensable to the course of human happiness. They are willing to risk players, take my tax money for their staff and then charge for cardboard cutouts of fans. My love of football was slowly dying, but this has finished it off. Chris Mills, 50s \u2018I\u2019m desperate for an overpriced beer in a flimsy plastic cup\u2019 I\u2019ve missed the experience of watching live sport in crowds: the sound of rows of folded plastic seats batting against each other at Craven Cottage as the crowd stands up to watch a winger make a run into the box, the sight of floodlights on a pitch and even the smell of the grass. I\u2019m desperate even to hold an overpriced beer in a flimsy plastic cup at half-time again. Rob Picheta, 27 \u2018Football is just a massive money-making exercise\u2019 I have been a Spurs supporter for 50 years \u2013 my first game was Jimmy Greaves\u2019 last appearance at White Hart Lane in February 1970 \u2013 but I have not missed football one bit. It is no longer a sport. It is a massive money-making exercise. The only reason there such determination to finish the season is because of TV money. I hope I no longer pay any attention to football when it returns. Although old habits die hard. Bobby Colvill, 57 \u2018Why did I waste so many hours watching sports?\u2019 I have wondered many times in recent weeks why I wasted so many hours over the years watching these essentially meaningless sports. I am keen to do more things with my weekends! Of course, I say that now... Simon Macklin, 44 \u2018Sport\u2019s absence has reaffirmed my love for it\u2019 The lockdown strangely coincided with a commitment to myself to watch less sport. I thought that I should be filling my time with something much more productive. However, the lack of sport has actually had the opposite effect. If anything, its absence has reaffirmed my love for sport and made me appreciate the role it plays in the emotions and rhythms of my life. Jon Bartlett, 47 \u2018I miss watching my son play\u2019 Football is a massive part of family life, especially watching my son Jamie\u2019s U15 team play in the Sussex Premier league. That\u2019s what I really miss. It\u2019s a great club with good support and they have been promoted three times in a row, so watching them progress has been brilliant. It is more about the togetherness and belonging than the football itself. Allan Robinson, 52 \u2018We have to find a way of staging the Olympics in 2021\u2019 I structure my year around sporting events. Wimbledon fortnight is redolent of childhood sunshine as I recall the gentle pick-pock and polite cheering on my mother\u2019s radio as she prepared tea and I played in the garden. Sunday afternoons during F1 season were always a time to hunker down and whisper, so as not to spoil my dad\u2019s enjoyment of the motor racing on TV. My life has been punctuated by the Olympics \u2013 I remember the excitement of watching the 1968 Games on TV. We have to find a way of staging the Tokyo Games in 2021. It would be a loss to humanity not to come together in some way to celebrate what humans can achieve in the sporting realm. Elizabeth Booth, 60",

British Airways, EasyJet, Wizz Air and Ryanair are among the 53 companies revealed on Thursday afternoon as beneficiaries from the Bank of England\u2019s Covid Corporate Financing Facility. These companies alone have taken \u00a31.8bn in lending from the scheme so far. Other companies include carmakers Honda, Nissan and Toyota, borrowing more than \u00a31bn among them, alongside engine-maker Rolls-Royce, which is taking a \u00a3300m bailout. Baker Hughes and Schlumberger, both oilfield services companies, are taking \u00a3600m and \u00a3150m respectively.

      "body": "<p>As the coronavirus lockdown continues, the Guardian\u2019s music desk thought you might be in need of a distraction \u2013 something to send you down memory lane, or to divert the annoyance at your housemates or children on to us. We present to you a ranking of the 100 greatest UK No 1 singles since the charts began in 1952.</p> <h2>The rules</h2> <p>We\u2019ll be counting this down over six weeks \u2013 for the first two weeks, we\u2019ll spend Monday to Thursday counting down 10 at a time. That takes us up to the Top 20, and from Monday to Friday for four weeks we\u2019ll have standalone celebrations of each remaining song by our team of critics.</p> <p>This list, and the songs\u2019 order, was compiled via a politely raging video call between me, chief rock and pop critic Alexis Petridis and deputy music editor Laura Snapes. The ranking isn\u2019t based on sales or longevity, it\u2019s<strong> </strong>the fruit of that discussion: what we as critics, fans and lifetime listeners think are the most brilliant songs to top the UK charts, and, of those, which are more brilliant than others. The only rule was that an artist could only feature once.</p> <p>As such, it is very much open to discussion, which we heartily encourage in the comments section. We\u2019d love to hear what you think of our choices \u2013 whether in agreement or outrage \u2013 and hear your fond or not-so-fond memories of these singles. After we\u2019ve reached No 1, we\u2019ll ask what you think we unforgivably missed out from the overall list, and then publish highlights from your selections. Also, note that dates listed are the dates the songs reached No 1.</p> <p>Enjoy!</p> <p><em>Ben Beaumont-Thomas, music editor</em></p> <h2><strong>100</strong></h2> <h2>Bill Haley and His Comets \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eJOJhwgluE\">Rock Around the Clock</a> (1955)</h2> <p>You could spend years arguing about what constitutes the first rock\u2019n\u2019roll record. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/15/observer-archive-rock-around-the-clock-16-september-1956\">Rock Around the Clock</a> patently isn\u2019t it, but it was, incontrovertibly, the record that brought rock\u2019n\u2019roll to mainstream attention in the UK: two minutes of music that sounded infinitely more feral than its avuncular artist looked and that changed pop music for ever. <strong>AP</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0e3d2d025c017f4ca07dac5371a7783905e20286\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e3d2d025c017f4ca07dac5371a7783905e20286/0_0_4096_2731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Zealand singer Lorde, AKA Ella Yelich-O\u2019Connor, in 2013.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Generational bellwether \u2026 New Zealand singer Lorde, AKA Ella Yelich-O\u2019Connor, in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Will/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>99</strong></h2> <h2>Lorde \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFasFq4GJYM\">Royals</a> (2013)</h2> <p>By disavowing the hollow opulence and bloated scale of pop\u2019s reigning class, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/10/lorde-just-freak-royals-pure-heroine\">Lorde accidentally ushered in a brand new one</a>: there would be no Billie Eilish if not for her conspiratorial incantations.

Are You Ready for Love? runs the gamut of emotions as he tries to win someone over: he\u2019s casually cool about devotion yet awed by it; grandiose in his overtures, then almost manically overcome by fear that this person might not, in fact, be ready for love. The Thom Bell-assisted Philly soul production festoons John with strings, hand percussion, wah-wah guitar, key changes \u2013 in a sense perfectly echoing the maximalist, hasty approach to seduction that John has said he practised at the peak of his career.

With I Heard It Through the Grapevine, we find him stepping out into his independence, all potential buoyed on by the force of his first creation. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/25/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s-no-10-marvin-gaye-i-heard-it-through-the-grapevine\">Read our full review here</a>.<strong> Ammar Kalia</strong></p> <h2><strong>9</strong></h2> <h2>Abba \u2013 Dancing Queen (1976)</h2> <p>It takes 18 seconds for Dancing Queen to drop into one of the greatest moments in pop. It speaks volumes that the 18 seconds preceding it are pretty wonderful too: that song bursting into life on that impossibly joyous piano glissando, before eight bars of sparkling, effortless mid-tempo pop. Dancing Queen reminds us that having the time of our lives is something that\u2019s always there, and that\u2019s always possible. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/26/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s-no-9-abba-dancing-queen\">Read our full review here</a>.<strong> Jude Rogers</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05d2e9e38dd7c01ecab7c39e0d93bbe74248952d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05d2e9e38dd7c01ecab7c39e0d93bbe74248952d/0_208_2912_1748/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keith Flint performing with the Prodigy in 1996.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keith Flint performing with the Prodigy in 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Rasic/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>8</strong></h2> <h2>The Prodigy \u2013 Firestarter (1996)</h2> <p>Firestarter proved that the Prodigy was a squirming, sweating, flesh-bound beast \u2013 the very opposite of the futuristic \u201cbraindance\u201d coming from the electronic vanguard. It was pure boiling animus, doused in petrol and set off to ruin someone\u2019s birthday party. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/27/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s-no-8-the-prodigy-firestarter\">Read our full review here</a>. <strong>Chal Ravens</strong></p> <h2><strong>7</strong></h2> <h2>The Human League \u2013&nbsp;Don\u2019t You Want Me (1981)</h2> <p>Don\u2019t You Want Me stands as a shining example of what can happen when a bunch of relative amateurs with a point to prove and a keen aesthetic eye get down to work. And after all, part of the charm of the Human League and the moment they encapsulated, the experimentalism of post-punk meeting the new possibilities of electronic music technology, is that it was so refreshingly carefree, the sound of synth-pop coming in from the cold. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/28/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s-no-7-the-human-league-dont-you-want-me\">Read our full review here</a>. <strong>Luke Turner</strong></p> <h2><strong>6</strong></h2> <h2>Michael Jackson \u2013&nbsp;Billie Jean (1983)</h2> <p>Billie Jean reeks with the paranoia that came to dominate Jackson\u2019s career. It is a hunted, haunted song about a paternity claim, which forsakes the lushness of his earlier work for stark, neurotic future-funk. While Thriller\u2019s title track is cartoonishly scary, Billie Jean is authentically <em>scared</em>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/29/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s-no-6-michael-jackson-billie-jean\">Read our full review here</a>. <strong>Dorian Lynskey</strong></p> <h2><strong>5</strong></h2> <h2>Dead or Alive \u2013 You Spin Me Round (Like a Record) (1984)</h2> <p>You Spin Me Round (Like a Record) was secretly recorded while they were meant to be working on other songs. By the end of the 14-day session, the band and producers were reportedly \u201cready to murder\u201d each other. It took a 36-hour cocaine-fuelled marathon to finish the song, and 17 weeks for it to journey from No 79 to No 1. But there\u2019s a merciless, exacting energy to You Spin Me Round that would have got it over the line one way or another: it is taut, alien and utterly majestic. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/01/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s-no-5-dead-or-alive-you-spin-me-round-like-a-record\">Read our full review here</a>. <strong>Ben Beaumont-Thomas</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a2c1a1b5a73e1d7aee63c0b4d5fbd71b13724666\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2c1a1b5a73e1d7aee63c0b4d5fbd71b13724666/0_209_2755_1653/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donna Summer singing in 1974.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Changed the face of club music \u2026 Donna Summer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pictorial Press/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>4</strong></h2> <h2>Donna Summer \u2013&nbsp;I Feel Love (1977)</h2> <p>Not only has I Feel Love never gone out of fashion, it has consistently jumped between genres in the intervening decades with incredible ease. In 1977, Brian Eno charged into the studio while David Bowie was recording, brandishing a copy of I Feel Love, and stated excitedly: \u201cThis is it, look no further. This is going to change the sound of club music for the next 15 years.\u201d His only mistake was one of gross under-exaggeration. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/02/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s-no-4-donna-summer-i-feel-love\">Read our full review here</a>. <strong>John Doran</strong></p> <h2><strong>3</strong></h2> <h2>The Beatles \u2013&nbsp;She Loves You (1963)</h2> <p>To hear She Loves You bursting out of a radio in the last week of August 1963 was to recognise a shout of triumph. Everything the Beatles had promised through the first half of the year found its focus in their fourth single, an explosion of exuberance that forced the world, not just their teenage fans, to acknowledge their existence. She Loves You presented an integrated whole, a sound of collective creativity that demolished the supremacy of solo artists, setting a trend that would dominate pop music for a generation. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/03/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s-no-3-the-beatles-she-loves-you\">Read our full review here</a>. <strong>Richard Williams</strong></p> <h2><strong>2</strong></h2> <h2>The Specials \u2013&nbsp;Ghost Town (1981)</h2> <p>It was the Specials\u2019 biggest hit and one of the biggest-selling singles of 1981. Its sound seems to presage a lot of subsequent music \u2013 you can hear its gloomy echoes everywhere from Massive Attack to Burial \u2013 but you almost never hear it on the radio or TV. Perhaps it\u2019s too bleak, too disturbing, its tone too hopeless: a reminder of something we\u2019d rather forget. It sits in the past, brooding and glowering at us, its remarkable, dark power undimmed. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/04/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s-no-2-the-specials-ghost-town\">Read our full review here</a>. <strong>Alexis Petridis</strong></p> <h2><strong>1</strong></h2> <h2>Pet Shop Boys \u2013 West End Girls</h2> <p>West End Girls is a lens on to a glamorous demimonde. Primped young women and hungry young men meet in a corner of London that is starting to gentrify, although still seedy enough to expose the transactions behind the flirtation. You can almost hear their egos rattle as they use each other for sex and drugs, second-hand cool and sly oneupmanship. The result is perfect pop equilibrium that almost made Dusty Springfield crash her car the first time she heard it. Thirty-six years on, their debut single still pulses with beguiling ambiguity \u2013 a heady rush of lust, naivety, disco and opaque references to Lenin.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/05/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s-no-1-pet-shop-boys-west-end-girls\">Read the full review here</a>.&nbsp;<strong>Laura Snapes</strong></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2>The playlist</h2> <p>This will be updated each day until the No 1 is announced.

We present to you a ranking of the 100 greatest UK No 1 singles since the charts began in 1952. The rules We\u2019ll be counting this down over six weeks \u2013 for the first two weeks, we\u2019ll spend Monday to Thursday counting down 10 at a time. That takes us up to the Top 20, and from Monday to Friday for four weeks we\u2019ll have standalone celebrations of each remaining song by our team of critics. This list, and the songs\u2019 order, was compiled via a politely raging video call between me, chief rock and pop critic Alexis Petridis and deputy music editor Laura Snapes. The ranking isn\u2019t based on sales or longevity, it\u2019s the fruit of that discussion: what we as critics, fans and lifetime listeners think are the most brilliant songs to top the UK charts, and, of those, which are more brilliant than others. The only rule was that an artist could only feature once. As such, it is very much open to discussion, which we heartily encourage in the comments section. We\u2019d love to hear what you think of our choices \u2013 whether in agreement or outrage \u2013 and hear your fond or not-so-fond memories of these singles. After we\u2019ve reached No 1, we\u2019ll ask what you think we unforgivably missed out from the overall list, and then publish highlights from your selections. Also, note that dates listed are the dates the songs reached No 1. Enjoy! Ben Beaumont-Thomas, music editor 100 Bill Haley and His Comets \u2013 Rock Around the Clock (1955) You could spend years arguing about what constitutes the first rock\u2019n\u2019roll record. Rock Around the Clock patently isn\u2019t it, but it was, incontrovertibly, the record that brought rock\u2019n\u2019roll to mainstream attention in the UK: two minutes of music that sounded infinitely more feral than its avuncular artist looked and that changed pop music for ever. AP 99 Lorde \u2013 Royals (2013) By disavowing the hollow opulence and bloated scale of pop\u2019s reigning class, Lorde accidentally ushered in a brand new one: there would be no Billie Eilish if not for her conspiratorial incantations. While she weathered accusations of appropriation for disavowing hip-hop cliches in her obviously rap-influenced delivery, she ultimately echoed the genre\u2019s own move towards unvarnished portrayals of teenage disaffection instigated by a parallel wave of SoundCloud upstarts. As much a generational bellwether as a pop classic. LS 98 Lieutenant Pigeon \u2013 Mouldy Old Dough (1972) Recorded in a Coventry front room, Mouldy Old Dough sounds like pop music made by people who have never actually heard pop music, but have had it described to them by someone who didn\u2019t really know what they were talking about: pub piano, growled vocals, a beat that recalls a drunk doggedly staggering home. The weirdness of 70s Britain in musical form. AP 97 Dave and Ansell Collins \u2013 Double Barrel (1971) If you wanted evidence of how far out, how unbound by the usual rules reggae was, you could find it at the top of the charts in early 1971: a piano line taken \u2013 sampled if you like \u2013 from Ramsey Lewis; a vocalist who largely grunted and bellowed incomprehensibly in the style of a Jamaican deejay: \u201cI am the magnificent W-O-O-O!\u201d It still sounds fantastic. AP 96 Roy Orbison \u2013 It\u2019s Over (1964) The pinnacle of Roy Orbison\u2019s career as rock\u2019s great tragedian: three astonishing, inconsolable minutes during which stars cry, rainbows weep, golden days are sorrowfully recalled and drums beat a leaden funeral march, before it all reaches a terrible climax, Orbison desperately repeating the title as if misery is a kind of catharsis. AP 95 The Buggles \u2013 Video Killed the Radio Star (1979) It won\u2019t be too much of a spoiler to reveal that this is the only No 1 single in this list that concerns how the brutally uncaring nature of new technology can paradoxically deepen nostalgia while rendering the past irrelevant. Trevor Horn and co turned this material into postmodern gold, building jingles, prog, orchestral pop and more into a screwball fantasy. That cold steady kick drum, meanwhile, is like techno kicking the door down to take over pop culture. BBT 94 Dua Lipa \u2013 New Rules (2017) After a fitfully successful start, this was the song to turn the Kosovan-British pop singer into a global star. You can almost feel her clamp a hand on your shoulder as she adopts a stern, schoolmarmish tone to dispense those rules for breakup survival: don\u2019t answer your ex\u2019s calls, let them pop round or even be their friend. She\u2019s not telling us or her mates, though, but rather herself, making for a powerful pop psychodrama. BBT 93 Del Shannon \u2013 Runaway (1961) Behind the simple, perky rock\u2019n\u2019roll facade \u2013 \u201cthe ultimate fairground anthem\u201d, as writer Bob Stanley put it \u2013 there\u2019s something disturbing about Del Shannon\u2019s biggest hit: an eeriness about the rumble of the opening guitar chords and the echoing keyboard solo, a sense the vocal is slightly too impassioned and pained. The result is as compelling a single as 1961 produced. AP 92 Nancy Sinatra \u2013 These Boots Are Made for Walkin\u2019 (1966) Had These Boots Are Made for Walkin\u2019 been sung by a man, as its author, Lee Hazlewood, had intended, it would just have been nasty. Sung with insouciant cool by the recently divorced Nancy Sinatra, however, it became something else entirely: camp but tough, funny but fierce, completely irresistible. AP 91 Whigfield \u2013 Saturday Night (1994) Saturday Night just pipped Gina G\u2019s Ooh Aah \u2026 Just a Little Bit to our 90s Eurobanger slot. First off, it\u2019s an actual Eurobanger (not an Aussie impersonator), and like the Village People\u2019s YMCA, it has a dance routine invented by fans that came to define the song. It\u2019s got an immediately iconic tag (\u201cdee dee da da da!\u201d), plus it was the victor in one of pop\u2019s funniest plagiarism cases: I want some of whatever the person who thinks this sounds like Lindisfarne\u2019s Fog on the Tyne was having. LS 90 Justin Bieber \u2013 What Do You Mean? (2015) There will be howls of protestation at Bieber being on this list, a man routinely cited as everything that is facile about pop and celebrity. Well, he\u2019s had his moments, but this is one of his equally frequent triumphs. Taking the Insta-filtered aesthetic of the then-popular tropical house sound and marrying it to a melody that flits like a bird of paradise always coming back to its perch, it has the melancholically fleeting beauty of a package holiday sunset. BBT 89 Sugababes \u2013 Freak Like Me (2002) Producer Richard X gets a lot of credit for the shuddering magnitude of invention behind the Sugababes\u2019 debut UK No 1 \u2013 the first legit single of the 2000s bootleg wave, bringing together Adina Howard and Tubeway Army \u2013 but not all of it. The newly minted trio of Mutya, Keisha and Heidi pull off a more convincing \u201cI\u2019m grown now\u201d transition than any of their American pop peers, thanks to the terrifying nonchalance innate to British teenage girls. It\u2019s got a classic belting \u201cmay-ee!\u201d (that\u2019s \u201cme\u201d in millennial pop terms) and without it, you wouldn\u2019t have Sound of the Underground \u2013 or, even, possibly, whisper it, Toxic. LS 88 Craig David \u2013 7 Days (2000) Like the Old Testament God, Craig chills on a Sunday, but unlike the Old Testament God, he spends Monday and Tuesday engineering sex and spends the rest of the days until the sabbath having it. We looked upon his creation and saw that it was good: his vocals, drilled in the dexterity of the garage rave, twine around delicate acoustic guitar lines like two lovers in Eden. BBT 87 Adamski \u2013 Killer (feat Seal) (1990) Every part of Adamski\u2019s production is perfectly designed: the sad chords, the funkily interrupted alien transmission of the synths, the prodding bassline with its edges almost imperceptibly corroded by acid. Most beautiful of all is Seal: half activist, half oracle. BBT 86 The Tornados \u2013 Telstar (1962) The product of producer Joe Meek\u2019s twin obsessions \u2013 space travel and the recording studio as an instrument in itself \u2013 Telstar is otherworldly and breathlessly exciting, piling on layer after layer of sounds so dense with effects it is impossible to work out what instrument is making them. It\u2019s like nothing else, before or since. AP 85 Estelle \u2013 American Boy (feat Kanye West) (2008) This will get you thinking, \u201cI miss the old Kanye\u201d \u2013 the rapper\u2019s touristic whirl through Ribena, wags and the epithet \u201crubbish\u201d is full of wit with just a touch of his incoming megalomania. Estelle is even better, perfectly capturing the mood of uncertain excitement at a potential American lover: \u201cLike the way he speaking, his confidence is peaking / Don\u2019t like his baggy jeans but I might like what\u2019s underneath them.\u201d The bump of will.i.am\u2019s cosmic funk production launches it into the transatlantic skies. BBT 84 Gloria Gaynor \u2013 I Will Survive (1979) Decades of ubiquity have dulled the impact of I Will Survive, but the song only became ubiquitous in the first place because it connected with so many people so directly. The strings soar, the lyrics project defiance in the face of a controlling ex-partner, who\u2019s tried chancing his arm again: \u201cI\u2019m not that chained up little person still in love with you.\u201d AP 83 Cher \u2013 Believe (1998) I Will Survive recast in hi-tech 90s dance-pop, complete with that notorious Auto-Tune wiggle to Cher\u2019s voice. The effect is actually used sparingly, and the song\u2019s wild success \u2013 11m copies sold worldwide \u2013 is not down to anything gimmicky. Rather, it\u2019s all very old-fashioned stuff that ensures Believe will be hollered in cheese nights for evermore: a powerhouse melody Cher uses to dispense a kind of den-mother wisdom. BBT 82 Robyn \u2013 With Every Heartbeat (feat Kleerup) (2007) \u201cBut I don\u2019t look back,\u201d Robyn insists over and over on her only UK chart-topper, though the racing arpeggiated synths, never resolving to the home key, tell a different story: one of someone doomed to the purgatory of heartbreak, or worse, revelling in it (a Greek chorus of strings charged with Kate Bush\u2019s DNA outlines the tragedy). \u201cAnd \u2013 it \u2013 hurts \u2013 with \u2013 ev \u2013 er \u2013 y \u2013 heart \u2013 beat,\u201d Robyn pants, and you feel it, each syllable landing like a tombstone. LS 81 Elton John \u2013 Are You Ready for Love? (2003) For someone who admits how hopeless he was at romance, Elton John couldn\u2019t half-sell a love song. Are You Ready for Love? runs the gamut of emotions as he tries to win someone over: he\u2019s casually cool about devotion yet awed by it; grandiose in his overtures, then almost manically overcome by fear that this person might not, in fact, be ready for love. The Thom Bell-assisted Philly soul production festoons John with strings, hand percussion, wah-wah guitar, key changes \u2013 in a sense perfectly echoing the maximalist, hasty approach to seduction that John has said he practised at the peak of his career. It\u2019s extraordinary that it took 24 years and a football advert to make it a hit. LS 80 Dave \u2013 Funky Friday (feat Fredo) (2018) This wasn\u2019t the stuff of high-speed swerving grime bars. Instead, Dave and Fredo use steady, perfectly calibrated flows to set themselves apart from the London MCs one generation above them, set to minimalist trap. The effect is of being told something extra clearly, as if you haven\u2019t understood: a brilliantly withering technique. Rap\u2019s status as a core part of British pop culture was consolidated. BBT 79 Jackie Trent \u2013 Where Are You Now (My Love) (1965) The pop charts were particularly dominated by sweeping, sentimental ballads until the mid-1960s, and there are PhDs to be written on the effect on pop music of a sexually repressed culture of manners. Anyway, many such ballads are suffocatingly schmaltzy, but this one is sublime. It was written by Trent with Tony Hatch, a somewhat forgotten genius of this period who shared Burt Bacharach\u2019s knack for orchestral drama. The pair had an affair, with Hatch leaving his wife and marrying Trent \u2013 this collaboration is full of that impetuous, untameable ardour. BBT 78 Thunderclap Newman \u2013 Something in the Air (1969) It\u2019s unclear whether Thunderclap Newman thought they were making a kind of eulogy for 60s counterculture, but that\u2019s how Something in the Air turned out. Its music is ineffably melancholy, its insistence that \u201cthe revolution\u2019s here\u201d, a year after the hippy dream had curdled, sounds desperate and hopeless. Intentional or not, it\u2019s really moving. AP 77 Enya \u2013 Orinoco Flow (1988) Perhaps it takes not having lived through the 80s heyday of new age, then its subsequent ubiquity and mockery to appreciate Orinoco Flow as the compositional marvel it is. Yes, the lyrics are incredibly silly \u2013 but the layered pizzicato shimmer transforms Enya\u2019s dippy travelogue into a true pop mirage, stoking its allure as her siren song constantly slips further out of reach. LS 76 Baby D \u2013 Let Me Be Your Fantasy (1994) The lyrics are essentially a QVC infomercial for the eroto-psychedelic effects of ecstasy \u2013 \u201cLotions of love flow through your hands / See visions, colours every day\u201d \u2013 and the music is shamelessly designed to intensify drug experiences. The junglist breakbeats keep the energy high, while the big piano chords and yearning vocals are like a head massage from some bloke you just met but nevertheless now feel a deeper kinship with than your immediate family. BBT 75 Procol Harum \u2013 A Whiter Shade of Pale (1967) Channelling Bach and the Beats, the trippy imagery of this 10m seller made it a fave of those turning on and tuning in during the Summer of Love. But the Hammond organ creates a valedictory mood as the drug epiphanies betray their lies \u2013 \u201cAlthough my eyes were open / They might have just as well\u2019ve been closed\u201d \u2013 and the entitlement and rapacity of the now widely hated Worst Generation becomes clear: \u201cI was feeling kinda seasick / But the crowd called out for more.\u201d A funeral hymn, then, but no less beautiful for it. BBT 74 Will Young \u2013 Leave Right Now (2003) You can imagine an older relative calling this \u201ca proper song\u201d \u2013 unfussy and instantly classic, where the quality of Eg White\u2019s composition gives it automatic promotion to a different league. Young negotiates the middle eight\u2019s key changes with the same sad certainty he negotiates his emotions, choosing self-preservation over a second chance at love. BBT 73 Chicago \u2013 If You Leave Me Now (1976) The softest of soft rock, If You Leave Me Now doesn\u2019t seem to play so much as glide along, wrapped in a blanket of French horns and strings, the drummer tapping so gently it sounds as if he\u2019s trying not to wake someone up. It\u2019s impossibly lush and beautifully written, but its sadness is pervasive and affecting. AP 72 Rage Against the Machine \u2013 Killing in the Name (2009) The heaviest, sweariest No 1 in UK history \u2013 with one of the best riffs, too \u2013 only reached No 25 when it was first released in 1992, but reached the top in 2009 after a grassroots campaign from people angry at a run of X Factor contestants dominating the Christmas No 1 race. Its \u201cFuck you, I won\u2019t do what you tell me\u201d climax, aimed at authority figures from the police to parents for years, was gleefully beamed at Simon Cowell in a great moment for British democracy. BBT 71 Spice Girls \u2013 Wannabe (1996) Almost 25 years down the line, Wannabe sounds so rinky-dink and innocent (save the \u201czig-a-zig-ah\u201d, which continues up a lineage of sexy pop nonsense started by Little Richard\u2019s \u201ca-wop-bop-a-loo-bop-a-lop-bam-boom!\u201d almost four decades prior) that it\u2019s almost inconceivable it was considered such a threat at the time. But it was: in two minutes, 53 seconds, these five women undid tween pop\u2019s raison d\u2019etre \u2013 seducing girls into a life of domesticity via parades of harmless male crushes \u2013 and rewrote it in their own chaotic, girls-first spirit. LS 70 Rui Da Silva \u2013 Touch Me (feat Cassandra) (2001) Dance music No 1s almost always bang, but this one pumps: a deep-house anthem of huge subtlety and power. The way the rhythm-guitar line insinuates itself, only to be subsumed by those cut-up strings, mirrors Cassandra\u2019s audible bafflement at being taken over by a love she doesn\u2019t understand. The confusing rush of ecstasy, in every sense, has never been so beautifully evoked. BBT 69 Snap! \u2013 Rhythm Is a Dancer (1992) Dance-pop in the 90s often traded in profound melancholy \u2013 Haddaway\u2019s What Is Love and Corona\u2019s Rhythm of the Night being other classic examples \u2013 and Rhythm Is a Dancer is one of the saddest of all. With its gospel vocals and cathedral-ready chords, it makes raving feel like a serious spiritual quest rather than something to do on a Friday. BBT 68 Dexys Midnight Runners \u2013 Come on Eileen (1982) Pop holds few greater pleasures than seeing a pop song about the power of pop songs take on that kind of lure itself. In Come on Eileen, Kevin Rowland reflects on the sad songs beloved by a downtrodden generation and promises his crush they\u2019ll hum a different tune. Come on Eileen became that song: a romp through wistfulness, bonhomie and knees-up antics that distils the riotous emotional arc of a night in an Irish pub into three-and-a-half perfect minutes. LS 67 Black Box \u2013 Ride on Time (1989) Matching disco diva Loleatta Holloway for lung power is near impossible but M People\u2019s Heather Small \u2013 working incognito after Italian producers Black Box were refused a Holloway sample \u2013 blows the house down, and her \u201clet me tell you, what you do to me\u201d is so sexily intense. This is a Terminator of a song, unstoppably delivering a payload of pure euphoria as Chicago house is spliced with Italo disco to create perfect pop. BBT 66 Eminem \u2013 Stan (feat Dido) (2000) It\u2019s testament to time\u2019s steady erosion that a song about an obsessive fan who murdered his pregnant girlfriend and killed himself because his favourite rapper didn\u2019t notice him has become a casual byword for effusive devotion. Coming full circle, Stan is worthy of it. It\u2019s the peak of Eminem\u2019s storytelling skill and \u2013 in spite of the clear misanthropy of the titular fan \u2013 profoundly empathetic, as Eminem tempers Stan\u2019s violence by understanding the desperation fuels it. LS 65 Kraftwerk \u2013 The Model (1982) A depressing economy of sex and power, observed with simmering beta-male jealousy, is sketched in just 12 lines over a melody that has the perfect symmetry of a model\u2019s face. Computer Love, the exquisite other half of this double A-side, is another portrait of loneliness but couldn\u2019t be more different: it is tender and naively yearning. BBT 64 Nena \u2013 99 Red Balloons (1984) Too often discarded as a novelty hit, 99 Red Balloons is the best pop song about cold war anxiety in a field full of try-hard duds, and a chart-topping coronation for the tough, peppy new wave sound being pioneered by the Go-Go\u2019s, the Bangles and the Waitresses. (The original German version is still the best, however.) LS 63 Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel \u2013 Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me) (1975) A fabulously bitchy kiss-off to the three members of Cockney Rebel who left the band after their 1974 album The Psychomodo, the genius of Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me) is to couch its screw-you message in the sunniest, most charming, irresistibly hook-laden music imaginable. AP 62 Elvis Presley \u2013 Jailhouse Rock (1958) Jailhouse Rock was intended as a joke by writers Leiber and Stoller, complete with a nudging reference to gay sex. Elvis, however, ignored the comic undercurrent, and sang it with such blazing intensity that the performance almost collapses at 1:14. If you want a No 1 that captures his early, feral power, this is it. AP 61 Arctic Monkeys \u2013 I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor (2005) Most mid-00s indie nostalgia is tinged with shame: the polka dots, bad fringes and herky-jerky dancing have not dated well. But Arctic Monkeys\u2019 debut single proper is something to look back on with pride \u2013 not because, as the NME of the era would have it, it represented any kind of jingoistic \u201cvictory\u201d for indie over pop, but because its rattling potency and Alex Turner\u2019s lyrics distil the pleasures of that era worth remembering: \u201cJust bangin\u2019 tunes and DJ sets and / Dirty dancefloors and dreams of naughtiness.\u201d LS 60 Ariana Grande \u2013 Thank U, Next (2018) After all that Ariana Grande had been through \u2013 the Manchester Arena bombing, the death of a beloved ex, a broken engagement \u2013 she could have released 10 minutes of primal screaming and still left critics saying: yeah, fair enough. Instead, she changed the game: after the more stateswomanly Sweetener album released earlier that year, surprise return Thank U, Next accelerated pop\u2019s processing speed (particularly liberating female pop stars in the process) and quashed the idea that empowerment is contingent on taking someone else down. Its nimbleness is the sound of Grande\u2019s freedom. LS 59 The Walker Brothers \u2013 Make It Easy on Yourself (1965) \u201cBreaking up is so very hard to do\u201d \u2013 this Burt Bacharach-penned ballad opens with a wry bit of understatement from Scott Walker, and he deals with things very magnanimously from here on out: a stiff upper lip in song. The way the choir, timpani, strings, horns, guitars and more all stay meringue-fluffy is arranger Ivor Raymonde just showing off, really. BBT 58 Rihanna \u2013 Umbrella (feat Jay-Z) (2007) Originally written for Britney Spears, although it\u2019s inconceivable to imagine her doing it. Umbrella needs swagger and Rihanna had it in spades, turning a stunted beat and a lyric that\u2019s pretty dorky on paper into one of pop\u2019s great come-ons. It\u2019s a skill that earned Rihanna a deserved place in the pantheon of pop icons. LS 57 10cc \u2013 I\u2019m Not in Love (1975) Eric Stewart wrote I\u2019m Not in Love after his wife, Gloria, complained that he didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you\u201d often enough \u2013 not out of petulance, but to express his depth of feeling for her beyond the cliche. After a labour-intensive recording process featuring endless harmonising and dozens of feet of tape loops, 10cc came away with this work of stubborn beauty: a sublime, shimmering evocation of the ineffable bond between two lovers. It endures in every sense: Stewart and Gloria have been married for more than 50 years. LS 56 Aaliyah \u2013 More Than a Woman (2002) A posthumous chart-topper after her death in a plane crash when she was 22, More Than a Woman is one of the trio of masterpiece singles she made with Timbaland, along with We Need a Resolution and Try Again. Into the producer\u2019s serpentine frameworks stepped a woman whose calm, exacting poise let you come to her rather than she to you. It never gets less wrenching to think what else she might have done. BBT 55 Daft Punk \u2013 Get Lucky (feat Pharrell Williams) (2013) Ah, the song of the summer. Its lustre has been dulled by it being played by every wedding band in the western hemisphere (and by Limmy\u2019s eternally funny tweet), but Get Lucky still shines underneath it all. Take it off the alcopop-splashed CDJs and back into headphones and you can newly appreciate its mastery, with the liveness of Nile Rodgers\u2019 guitar and Pharrell\u2019s conversational charm. BBT 54 tATu \u2013 All the Things She Said (2003) On one hand, All the Things She Said is the ne plus ultra of queerbaiting: two straight Russian teenagers cajoled into lesbian cosplay by some dodgy-sounding svengalis. But as ersatz as their ardour was, the duo\u2019s debut UK single was charged with a perfect evocation of the frantic emotional tumult that rages in every closeted, yearning teenager\u2019s head. An industrial cri de c\u0153ur with a brilliantly desperate synth climax, it was the greatest Trevor Horn banger since his mid-80s sweet spot. LS 53 Take That \u2013 Back for Good (1995) The boy band \u2013 well, Gary Barlow \u2013 had already shown they could do serious and affecting balladry with A Million Love Songs, and then they perfectly honed that skill for this classic breakup song. There\u2019s real poetry in the verses, which gives way to the devastating plainness of the chorus, like 100 red roses left at a doorstep. Barlow goes for total abasement, though \u2013 \u201cWhenever I\u2019m wrong / Just tell me the song and I\u2019ll sing it\u201d \u2013 so you don\u2019t really fancy his chances. BBT 52 Soft Cell \u2013 Tainted Love (1981) You might think using crisp drum machines and eerie synths to cover a northern soul anthem would make it more brittle, but Soft Cell\u2019s version of Gloria Jones\u2019s 1964 song actually has more swing and sensuality. There\u2019s something portentous about those insistent, fateful synth stabs, and Marc Almond adds to the sense of doom with his innate flair for drama. BBT 51 S-Express \u2013 Theme from S-Express (1988) To watch Top of the Pops as 1987 gives way to 1988 is to watch the freaks taking over the asylum: after MARRS and Bomb the Bass\u2019s earlier acid house hits, S-Express\u2019s sample-heavy track affirmed the sound\u2019s chart coronation, making the Stock Aitken Waterman stable look even more square, and stuck one in the eye of London\u2019s throttlingly cool club scene with its euphoric, queer collage. LS 50 Steve \u201cSilk\u201d Hurley \u2013 Jack Your Body (1987) It\u2019s hard to imagine now how strange and alien Jack Your Body sounded in 1987. Other early house hits had at least come with a song or a hook attached, but this had neither: it may be the most minimal No 1 of all time. It isn\u2019t by any stretch of the imagination the best Chicago had to offer in 1987: as a signal of a vast shift in the way pop music sounded, it\u2019s unbeatable. AP 49 Chemical Brothers \u2013 Setting Sun (feat Noel Gallagher) (1996) A half-cover of the Beatles\u2019 Tomorrow Never Knows but with that band\u2019s LSD juiced up with some kind of experimental steroid, Setting Sun still sounds extreme. Lighting up that breakbeat and demonically heaving harmonium riffs are rockets and catherine wheels of wild sound, with Noel Gallagher sounding as if he\u2019s being dragged out of sanity. BBT 48 So Solid Crew \u2013 21 Seconds (2001) A new high-water mark of commercial success for British rap was set by this incandescently brilliant wave of London MCs, each given 21 seconds of time on the mic. The energy stays permanently high, but is filtered through such distinct characters: Harvey\u2019s rave MC, Romeo\u2019s lascivious loverman, Kaish\u2019s jabbing boxer, Face\u2019s bug-eyed vampire and more. BBT 47 Suzi Quatro \u2013 Can the Can (1973) The first attempt to make Suzi Quatro a star, with the light pop of Rolling Stone, fell flat: second time around, with writers/producers Chinn and Chapman in control, everything clicked. From its opening wall of drums to Quatro\u2019s scream of \u201cscratch out her eyes\u201d to its lyrically baffling but indelible chorus, Can the Can is glam-pop perfection. AP 46 Queen \u2013 Bohemian Rhapsody (1975) Everyone with even a glancing interest in pop knows Bohemian Rhapsody, which means its sheer audacity is easy to overlook. It\u2019s a completely inexplicable, extraordinary single, a joke that got out of hand according to producer Roy Thomas Baker, a preposterous exercise in high camp with demented lyrics, that somehow still exerts a huge emotional pull. AP 45 Simon and Garfunkel \u2013 Bridge Over Troubled Water (1970) The charts in 1970 were rich with hymn-like songs solemnly marking the passing of the 60s \u2013 not least the Beatles\u2019 Let It Be \u2013 but Bridge Over Troubled Water was the blockbuster take: five minutes of booming, Phil Spector-inspired white gospel with a choirboy vocal and a simple, universal message beneath the sturm und drang. AP 44 Rick Astley \u2013 Never Gonna Give You Up (1987) More fool the person who thought up Rickrolling, believing chance exposure to Never Gonna Give You Up to be some kind of punishment: the Stock Aitken Waterman tea boy\u2019s star-making moment couldn\u2019t be less cool or more glorious, his good-boy Redcoat brogue the cheese to SAW\u2019s soulful, acid pickle. And, hey, if it was good enough for Larry Levan \u2026 LS 43 Tubeway Army \u2013 Are \u201cFriends\u201d Electric? (1979) The 80s began in British pop when the stately, epic Are \u201cFriends\u201d Electric? arrived on Top of the Pops in June 1979: two synth players, Gary Numan looking puzzled, as if he didn\u2019t understand how a song with no chorus had become a hit. He was six months early, but Numan was always ahead of his time: oft-mocked, his alienated-suburbanite-in-a-world-of-technology schtick now seems remarkably prescient. AP 42 Lady Gaga \u2013 Bad Romance (2009) Gaga\u2019s third UK No 1 outshines earlier hits Just Dance and Poker Face as the apex of her tectonic, Teutonic first-phase battering rams. While it\u2019s heavily indebted to Depeche Mode and Madonna, Gaga\u2019s weapons-grade persona turns a homage into a conquest, tagging everything in her wake with a lusty \u201cGaga, ooh la la.\u201d LS 41 East 17 \u2013 Stay Another Day (1994) One of the greatest Christmas No 1s of all time is a triumph of emotional candour. It resembles a breakup song with its talk of final kisses, but was written by Tony Mortimer after his brother killed himself. The pain of those sudden calls of \u201cstay now\u201d is so acute, voicing the suddenness of loss. BBT 40 The Four Tops \u2013 Reach Out (I\u2019ll Be There) (1966) Soaring above Reach Out\u2019s dramatic arrangement \u2013 which smashed through the boundaries of Motown\u2019s signature style, inspired by the Rolling Stones\u2019 Paint It Black, not that you\u2019d know \u2013 lead vocalist Levi Stubbs sounds as if he\u2019s close to tears, delivering the lyrics as if they\u2019re a matter of life or death. It remains an astonishingly intense way to spend three minutes. AP 39 The Jam \u2013 Going Underground (1980) A song in which disgust at Thatcher\u2019s Britain seems to meld with Paul Weller\u2019s increasing unease over the mod revival he\u2019d single-handedly started, Going Underground was also the perfect demonstration of what its author had learned studying taut, potent mid-60s pop: grab the listener from the start, don\u2019t let your grip slacken or a second go to waste. AP 38 Blondie \u2013 Heart of Glass (1979) There are plenty of arguments for Heart of Glass not really qualifying as the only UK No 1 punk single. While Blondie came from the genre\u2019s first wave in New York, their 1979 hit mainlined European electronic pioneers Kraftwerk and Heart of Glass in its brilliant, cycling riff, while Debbie Harry\u2019s rhapsodic vocals owed more to Donna Summer (whose I Feel Love the group had been covering), with a twist of downtown irony. It pissed off the punk purists back home \u2013 which is, incidentally, pretty much the most punk thing you could do by 1979. LS 37 Slade \u2013 Merry Xmas Everybody (1973) The production on Merry Xmas Everybody is fuzzy as tinsel (the result of recording in an echoey corridor), potent as plum pudding doused in brandy and appropriately poignant, straddling that late-December divide between nostalgia and optimism. Which is what, it\u2019s easy to imagine, gave it the edge over Wizzard\u2019s dementedly cheery I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday, the loser in what\u2019s now considered the original festive chart battle, though it cemented glam as the official sound of Christmas. LS 36 David Bowie \u2013 Let\u2019s Dance (1983) That opening crescendo, giving way to the Nile Rodgers-penned guitar funk riff, is one of the most breathtakingly exciting moments in Bowie\u2019s catalogue, and the croaky croon of \u201cput on your red shoes and dance the blues\u201d a few seconds later is one of the coolest. Let\u2019s Dance remains an irresistible command. BBT 35 The Pretenders \u2013 Brass in Pocket (1980) \u201cWe all just thought she was a groupie,\u201d noted the Damned\u2019s Rat Scabies of Chrissie Hynde when the Pretenders made it big, the kind of dismissive remark you suspect fuelled Brass in Pocket\u2019s surfeit of attitude: \u201cI\u2019m special.\u201d Brilliantly, it sets its narcissistic swagger to music that\u2019s languid and sensual rather than aggressive: perfect pop ensues. AP 34 Rod Stewart \u2013 Da Ya Think I\u2019m Sexy? (1978) Bear in mind Rod was asking this question when his hair\u2019s volume had been turned way beyond 11, and when he was giving an audible crotch-thrust at the opening of each chorus line. And yet, even though this song is utterly ridiculous, it is also utterly brilliant \u2013 the way the synth melody steps up before pirouetting down is eternally replayable, and Rod\u2019s charisma is, sorry, a bit sexy. BBT 33 Tom Jones \u2013 It\u2019s Not Unusual (1965) On his breakthrough single, Tom Jones exhibits the kind of determined perkiness that can only accompany truly desperate heartbreak. That double negative gives his confusion away as he tries to come to terms with seeing his girl out with another guy, but it\u2019s no use: \u201cI wanna die.\u201d In a Top 100 full of savagely unhappy yet upbeat songs, this is the most emotionally dissonant of all. BBT 32 Britney Spears \u2013 \u2026 Baby One More Time (1999) \u2026 Baby One More Time wasn\u2019t the first hit from Denniz Pop and Max Martin\u2019s Cheiron Studios \u2013 Backstreet Boys and Robyn predated Britney. But the Louisiana 16-year-old was to Cheiron what Kylie was to Stock Aitken Waterman: the first act with the personality to overwhelm the blueprint (Euro melodies, metal\u2019s impact and club-pop\u2019s sparkle) and make it her own. Rockists accuse Britney Spears of being an empty vessel, but it\u2019s her vocal DNA that shapes every single word of this song into a pop landmark. LS 31 Althea and Donna \u2013 Uptown Top Ranking (1977) \u201cNah pop nah style,\u201d sang Althea and Donna, and they had a point. What\u2019s striking about the greatest reggae No 1 of all is how unvarnished its repurposing of an old Alton Ellis it is, the lack of concession to white ears as Althea and Donna riff on the lyrics of Trinity\u2019s Three Piece Suit with blank-eyed teenage insouciance. AP 30 Madonna \u2013 Vogue (1990) Of Madonna\u2019s 13 No 1s, Vogue is her most poised, agile and sexually intoxicating. It is a portal into a world of glamour \u2013 the litany of classic Hollywood in the middle eight, but also the world of peacocking ballroom culture it was borne from \u2013 where you find Madonna herself presiding over the decadence with her commands and observations. Get up on the dancefloor, indeed. BBT 29 Whitney Houston \u2013 I Wanna Dance With Somebody (1987) A masterpiece of synthetic production: the gorgeously wrong approximations of horns, bass guitar and piano have their own delirious beauty. But, of course, it\u2019s Whitney who seals it. That final chorus line, \u201cwith somebody who loves me\u201d, is so emphatic in knowing she deserves happiness, creating a paradoxically euphoric song about being lonely. BBT 28 The Kinks \u2013 You Really Got Me (1964) The arrival of You Really Got Me amid the still relatively mild No 1s of the time must have been startling \u2013 it even makes the Beatles sound like squares. One of the all time great riffs, made from only two notes, powers the garage-band energy as the group\u2019s lust builds to a ferocious head. BBT 27 George Michael \u2013 Careless Whisper (1984) Just imagine this being the third song you\u2019d ever written as a band, turning a litany of silly teenage crushes into one of the all-time great ballads (and home to the most arresting sax solo since Gerry Rafferty\u2019s Baker Street). It wasn\u2019t Wham!\u2019s third single \u2013 George Michael astutely parcelled it out later, asserting his soulful, songwriterly bona fides after a raft of more cartoonish hits, and paving the way for a different shade of solo career. LS 26 The Rolling Stones \u2013 (I Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction (1965) Sneering attitude and glowering negativity \u2013 provoked by everything from radio DJs to TV advertising to a lady declining to have sex with Mick Jagger because she\u2019s on her period \u2013 aligned to the most famous guitar riff in history. Satisfaction is pissed off, provocative, dirty, thrilling; everything great about the mid-60s Rolling Stones condensed into 3 minutes and 45 seconds. AP 25 Bee Gees \u2013 Night Fever (1978) Fortysomething years on, the opprobrium occasioned by the late-70s Bee Gees seems utterly baffling: the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack sounds like a masterclass in pop songwriting, as evidenced by Night Fever\u2019s perfect evocation of pre-club anticipation: \u201cOn the waves of the air / There is dancing out there \u2026 We can steal it.\u201d AP 24 Freda Payne \u2013 Band of Gold (1970) Written by Motown brains trust Holland-Dozier-Holland, Band of Gold sees Payne sitting in a lonely bedroom, her wedding night gone disastrously unconsummated after some kind of freak-out by the groom. Although the exact details are tactfully veiled by Payne, it\u2019s an unforgettably specific scenario, its horror hammered into your mind with that unyielding snare rhythm and told via a wondrous vocal line. BBT 23 The KLF \u2013 3am Eternal (1991) Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond had already written a book on how to have a No 1 record, The Manual, after their novelty chart-topper Doctorin\u2019 the Tardis. As the KLF, they brought every one of their tricks to bear on this titanic piece of rave: hip-house rapping, gospel choirs, chants about an ancient race of people and a huge synthetic guitar riff. What on earth was it on about? The mystery was the final key to its success. BBT 22 George McCrae \u2013 Rock Your Baby (1974) Ostensibly the first disco No 1 and the product of songwriters Harry Casey and Richard Finch observing what worked on the dancefloors of Miami\u2019s clubs, in truth, Rock Your Baby carved out a shimmering, supple musical space entirely of its own: organ-led, Hi Records-esque Memphis soul, complete with imploring falsetto vocal, over the hissy ticking of a primitive drum machine. AP 21 T Rex \u2013 Get It On (1971) Any of T Rex\u2019s magisterial run of No 1 singles could be in this list, but Get It On just shades it, by dint of being the most imperious sounding of the lot: the earthy R&amp;B of Chuck Berry recast into a defiantly modern shape, sexually charged in a way no teen pop had previously been. AP 20 Carly Rae Jepsen \u2013 Call Me Maybe (2012) On first listen, the song seemed deceptively featherweight. The strings sound like ringtones; the guitar parts as though they were lifted from a PlayStation 2 game. But even the most synthetic production can\u2019t detract from songwriting this ironclad. It is telling that Call Me Maybe was intended as a folk song; it would be catchy played on a kazoo, or underwater. Read our full review here. Elle Hunt 19 Lil Nas X \u2013 Old Town Road (remix feat Billy Ray Cyrus) (2019) Old Town Road was unstoppable, with no apparent end to its appeal. Children rioted in their love for it. Its vast stable of remixes made it a genre-splicing Rosetta stone. But as much as the song is an urtext in how to go viral (until the rules change again), Old Town\u2019s Road\u2019s magic lies in its affirming faith that a sunnier future is just around the next bend, designer Stetson optional. Read our full review here. Owen Myers 18 Ian Dury &amp; the Blockheads \u2013 Hit Me With Your Rhythm Stick (1979) Dury told chatshow host Michael Parkinson that he wanted his success to dispel society\u2019s discomfort with and patronising attitudes to disability and provide hope to those for whom things hadn\u2019t turned out so well. Today, his best-known tune still sounds fresh and wonderfully off-kilter, a beacon of pop\u2019s ability to embrace oddity and celebrate the other. Read our full review here. Dave Simpson 17 Kylie Minogue \u2013 Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head (2001) This was always a Kylie classic in the making. Blessed with the perfect pop voice, she delivers each line with just enough blank space for the listener\u2019s own interpretations. Is it about a crush? A recent heartbreak? Does the person Minogue is singing about know about the obsession? What is the dark secret she is harbouring? Even those famous \u201cla, la, las\u201d take on several functions, catalysing an irresistible earworm, a delirious, dancefloor-ready singalong moment and a distraction mechanism for the recently brokenhearted. Read our full review here. Michael Cragg 16 Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 Crazy in Love (2003) The announcement of her arrival via those unforgettable blaring horns, sampled from the Chi-Lites\u2019 1970 hit Are You My Woman? (Tell Me So), erred on regal fanfare, inspiring endless struts across makeshift dancefloors-turned-catwalks to this day. Beyonc\u00e9 was auditioning for the part of pop\u2019s new reigning diva, a role she knew she had already secured. Read our full review here. Yomi Adegoke 15 Jerry Lee Lewis \u2013 Great Balls of Fire (1957) Jerry Lee still sounds more lascivious than almost anyone. The sensations simply spill out of him \u2013 not only his voice but also his piano playing, too, his right hand sliding down the keys in exhalations of delight. It was the devil\u2019s music, but Great Balls of Fire still sounds like an act of God. Read our full review here. Michael Hann 14 Kate Bush \u2013 Wuthering Heights (1978) The piano gently heralds the arrival of this haunted tale of lost love and longing, then that tight, high melody reels you in. It loops and lilts, ascending, descending, as Bush\u2019s vocal urges the story on, like Catherine striding across the moors. Wuthering Heights turned Bush into a pop star, the rules of which she continues to bend to her own will: her individuality was set in stone from the very beginning. Read our full review here. Rebecca Nicholson 13 Frankie Goes to Hollywood \u2013 Relax (1984) With not only its flagrant innuendo, but its wide-open synths, and swooning, psychedelic disco structure, the song was a complete wildcard \u2013 and the band performing it even more so. At a pivotal, deeply conservative time in Britain\u2019s history, their crowning glory was what they brought out of the shadows and thrust into the light. Read our full review here. Aimee Cliff 12 Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor \u2013 Nothing Compares 2 U (1990) By drawing out the emotional weight that eluded its creator, O\u2019Connor fashioned one of the all-time great cover versions. Time has only cemented Nothing Compares 2 U\u2019s place in the pop pantheon \u2013 three decades on, this haunting, heart-wrenching evocation of the grief of lost love remains peerless. Read our full review here. Rachel Aroesti 11 The Beach Boys \u2013 Good Vibrations (1966) Good Vibrations was at once the mumbled inarticulacy and heightened feelings of love, but also the sound of a culture changing \u2013 almost in real time. In this collision of sound and sentiment, Wilson and his bandmates succeeded in capturing the moment when everything we thought we knew about pop songs dissolved. Read our full review here. Laura Barton 10 Marvin Gaye \u2013 Heard It Through the Grapevine (1968) Here, Gaye would establish himself as the bad boy of Motown, both a figurehead for rising anti-Vietnam sentiment and archetype of the socially conscious songwriter. With I Heard It Through the Grapevine, we find him stepping out into his independence, all potential buoyed on by the force of his first creation. Read our full review here. Ammar Kalia 9 Abba \u2013 Dancing Queen (1976) It takes 18 seconds for Dancing Queen to drop into one of the greatest moments in pop. It speaks volumes that the 18 seconds preceding it are pretty wonderful too: that song bursting into life on that impossibly joyous piano glissando, before eight bars of sparkling, effortless mid-tempo pop. Dancing Queen reminds us that having the time of our lives is something that\u2019s always there, and that\u2019s always possible. Read our full review here. Jude Rogers 8 The Prodigy \u2013 Firestarter (1996) Firestarter proved that the Prodigy was a squirming, sweating, flesh-bound beast \u2013 the very opposite of the futuristic \u201cbraindance\u201d coming from the electronic vanguard. It was pure boiling animus, doused in petrol and set off to ruin someone\u2019s birthday party. Read our full review here. Chal Ravens 7 The Human League \u2013 Don\u2019t You Want Me (1981) Don\u2019t You Want Me stands as a shining example of what can happen when a bunch of relative amateurs with a point to prove and a keen aesthetic eye get down to work. And after all, part of the charm of the Human League and the moment they encapsulated, the experimentalism of post-punk meeting the new possibilities of electronic music technology, is that it was so refreshingly carefree, the sound of synth-pop coming in from the cold. Read our full review here. Luke Turner 6 Michael Jackson \u2013 Billie Jean (1983) Billie Jean reeks with the paranoia that came to dominate Jackson\u2019s career. It is a hunted, haunted song about a paternity claim, which forsakes the lushness of his earlier work for stark, neurotic future-funk. While Thriller\u2019s title track is cartoonishly scary, Billie Jean is authentically scared. Read our full review here. Dorian Lynskey 5 Dead or Alive \u2013 You Spin Me Round (Like a Record) (1984) You Spin Me Round (Like a Record) was secretly recorded while they were meant to be working on other songs. By the end of the 14-day session, the band and producers were reportedly \u201cready to murder\u201d each other. It took a 36-hour cocaine-fuelled marathon to finish the song, and 17 weeks for it to journey from No 79 to No 1. But there\u2019s a merciless, exacting energy to You Spin Me Round that would have got it over the line one way or another: it is taut, alien and utterly majestic. Read our full review here. Ben Beaumont-Thomas 4 Donna Summer \u2013 I Feel Love (1977) Not only has I Feel Love never gone out of fashion, it has consistently jumped between genres in the intervening decades with incredible ease. In 1977, Brian Eno charged into the studio while David Bowie was recording, brandishing a copy of I Feel Love, and stated excitedly: \u201cThis is it, look no further. This is going to change the sound of club music for the next 15 years.\u201d His only mistake was one of gross under-exaggeration. Read our full review here. John Doran 3 The Beatles \u2013 She Loves You (1963) To hear She Loves You bursting out of a radio in the last week of August 1963 was to recognise a shout of triumph. Everything the Beatles had promised through the first half of the year found its focus in their fourth single, an explosion of exuberance that forced the world, not just their teenage fans, to acknowledge their existence. She Loves You presented an integrated whole, a sound of collective creativity that demolished the supremacy of solo artists, setting a trend that would dominate pop music for a generation. Read our full review here. Richard Williams 2 The Specials \u2013 Ghost Town (1981) It was the Specials\u2019 biggest hit and one of the biggest-selling singles of 1981. Its sound seems to presage a lot of subsequent music \u2013 you can hear its gloomy echoes everywhere from Massive Attack to Burial \u2013 but you almost never hear it on the radio or TV. Perhaps it\u2019s too bleak, too disturbing, its tone too hopeless: a reminder of something we\u2019d rather forget. It sits in the past, brooding and glowering at us, its remarkable, dark power undimmed. Read our full review here. Alexis Petridis 1 Pet Shop Boys \u2013 West End Girls West End Girls is a lens on to a glamorous demimonde. Primped young women and hungry young men meet in a corner of London that is starting to gentrify, although still seedy enough to expose the transactions behind the flirtation. You can almost hear their egos rattle as they use each other for sex and drugs, second-hand cool and sly oneupmanship. The result is perfect pop equilibrium that almost made Dusty Springfield crash her car the first time she heard it. Thirty-six years on, their debut single still pulses with beguiling ambiguity \u2013 a heady rush of lust, naivety, disco and opaque references to Lenin. Read the full review here.

Turkish drones and armaments have turned the military tide against Haftar since March.</p> <p>Haftar\u2019s forces also retreated from Tarhuna overnight, it was reported, which has acted as a major focal point for supply lines for Haftar\u2019s key al-Jufra airbase in central Libya. At least 14 unmarked Russian jets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/us-says-russia-sent-warplanes-to-back-libyan-warlord\">were flown from Syria to </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/us-says-russia-sent-warplanes-to-back-libyan-warlord\">al-Jufra</a> at the end of May.</p> <p>Initial signs are that GNA forces want at minimum to capture the city of Tarhuna, south of Tripoli. Tarhuna has been the scene of many killings in the past year, and some GNA militia may want to exact revenge on the groups currently running the city.</p> <p>Hailing the GNA\u2019s restoration of control over Tripoli, Mustafa al-Majei, the spokesman for Operation Burkan Al-Ghadab, or Volcano of Rage, said: \u201cTripoli has been liberated and fully secured, and we have reached the administrative borders of the city of Tarhuna, south-east of the capital\u201d. The GNA said 25 members of its demining teams had been killed in the south of Tripoli in the past fortnight.</p> <p>Haftar has been backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and France. The arrival of Russian jets in Libya&nbsp;prompted the US military to warn of a new threat to Nato\u2019s southern flank. It also appears to have awoken previously dormant US diplomacy in the country.</p> <p>Explaining the recent change in the balance of military power, Wolfram Lacher, a senior associate at the German thinktank Stiftung Wissenschaft und&nbsp;Politik, said: \u201cTurkey only resumed its support after forcing the GNA into an agreement over maritime rights in November 2019.</p> <p>\u201cCon\u00adtrary to the covert foreign support for Haftar, Turkish intervention was overt, and it rapidly altered the balance of power after the fighting escalated in late March 2020. Covert UAE support in the form of drones and air defence systems proved ineffective in the face of Turkish military action.\u201d</p> <p>He said questions now arose about the future stability of both the GNA and Haftar alliances, the ability of Russia and Turkey to come to an agreement about spheres of influence in Libya, and any resumed production in Libya\u2019s oil fields, which are still controlled by Haftar allies.</p> <p>European policy had proved catastrophic, he said. In future \u201cEuropeans will only be able to act in unison if the French position shifts away from its relative tolerance for Russia and adversarial stance towards Turkey. Russia\u2019s military presence in Libya represents a far greater menace to Europe than Turkish interven\u00adtion.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>In his first overseas visit since the coronavirus outbreak, the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, flew to Rome to discuss the Libyan crisis with his Italian opposite number, . Le Drian has probably been the French politician most supportive of Haftar, seeing him as a potential source of stability against Islamist forces he says run the GNA.&nbsp;</p> <p>The escalation in fighting in&nbsp;Libya&nbsp;comes against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic. Libya&nbsp;has about 170 confirmed cases, but testing remains scarce. There are fears a large outbreak would have a severe impact, given the protracted conflict and the country\u2019s poor healthcare system.</p> <p>Libya slid into civil war following the removal and killing of the country\u2019s longtime dictator, Muammar Gaddafi, in 2011.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A 14 month-siege of Libya\u2019s capital Tripoli by the renegade general Khalifa Haftar ended in failure on Thursday when his forces retreated from the south of the city toward his heartlands in the south and the east of the country. The interior minister of the UN-recognised government of national accord (GNA), Fathi Bashagha, hailed \u201cthe beginning of the end of the entire dictatorship project\u201d, and urged cities under Haftar\u2019s control to rise up against him and spare themselves further conflict. The extent of Haftar\u2019s retreat may depend on the point at which newly arrived Russian fighter jets intervene to shore up his lines of defence. Western powers are urging forces loyal to the GNA not to exploit their new military advantage by pushing deep into the east, but instead to allow peace talks to resume to form a new government of national unity. In a sign of the new power brokers in Libya, however, the GNA prime minister travelled to Ankara to meet with his backer, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Turkish drones and armaments have turned the military tide against Haftar since March. Haftar\u2019s forces also retreated from Tarhuna overnight, it was reported, which has acted as a major focal point for supply lines for Haftar\u2019s key al-Jufra airbase in central Libya. At least 14 unmarked Russian jets were flown from Syria to al-Jufra at the end of May. Initial signs are that GNA forces want at minimum to capture the city of Tarhuna, south of Tripoli. Tarhuna has been the scene of many killings in the past year, and some GNA militia may want to exact revenge on the groups currently running the city. Hailing the GNA\u2019s restoration of control over Tripoli, Mustafa al-Majei, the spokesman for Operation Burkan Al-Ghadab, or Volcano of Rage, said: \u201cTripoli has been liberated and fully secured, and we have reached the administrative borders of the city of Tarhuna, south-east of the capital\u201d. The GNA said 25 members of its demining teams had been killed in the south of Tripoli in the past fortnight. Haftar has been backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and France. The arrival of Russian jets in Libya prompted the US military to warn of a new threat to Nato\u2019s southern flank. It also appears to have awoken previously dormant US diplomacy in the country. Explaining the recent change in the balance of military power, Wolfram Lacher, a senior associate at the German thinktank Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik, said: \u201cTurkey only resumed its support after forcing the GNA into an agreement over maritime rights in November 2019. \u201cContrary to the covert foreign support for Haftar, Turkish intervention was overt, and it rapidly altered the balance of power after the fighting escalated in late March 2020. Covert UAE support in the form of drones and air defence systems proved ineffective in the face of Turkish military action.\u201d He said questions now arose about the future stability of both the GNA and Haftar alliances, the ability of Russia and Turkey to come to an agreement about spheres of influence in Libya, and any resumed production in Libya\u2019s oil fields, which are still controlled by Haftar allies. European policy had proved catastrophic, he said. In future \u201cEuropeans will only be able to act in unison if the French position shifts away from its relative tolerance for Russia and adversarial stance towards Turkey. Russia\u2019s military presence in Libya represents a far greater menace to Europe than Turkish intervention.\u201d In his first overseas visit since the coronavirus outbreak, the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, flew to Rome to discuss the Libyan crisis with his Italian opposite number, . Le Drian has probably been the French politician most supportive of Haftar, seeing him as a potential source of stability against Islamist forces he says run the GNA. The escalation in fighting in Libya comes against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic. Libya has about 170 confirmed cases, but testing remains scarce. There are fears a large outbreak would have a severe impact, given the protracted conflict and the country\u2019s poor healthcare system. Libya slid into civil war following the removal and killing of the country\u2019s longtime dictator, Muammar Gaddafi, in 2011.",

But the unimpeachable truth is, Hamilton has kept this same energy his whole career. Where Woods runs from race, famously describing himself as \u201cCablinasian\u201d, Hamilton is unequivocal. \u201cI don\u2019t wrestle with race at all; I\u2019m black,\u201d Hamilton told me when <a href=\"https://www.si.com/racing/2015/10/29/lewis-hamilton-formula-one-champion\">I profiled him for Sports Illustrated</a> during the 2015 United States Grand Prix. \u201cWhen I arrive here, I don\u2019t feel different, but I know I am different.\u201d Where Jordan famously \u201cjoked\u201d that \u201cRepublicans buy sneakers, too\u201d as explanation for not publicly supporting a black mayor\u2019s historic Senate campaign in his home state of North Carolina, Hamilton never drives his Merc out of the paddock without first slipping on an outsize, over-colored helmet with the phrase \u201cStill I Rise\u201d scrawled on the back. I wondered, Was that a Maya Angelou shoutout? \u201cNah, bruv,\u201d he quipped, flashing that trademark gapped-tooth smirk. \u201cThat\u2019s Tupac.\u201d</p> <p>Where another black exemplar in a majority white stratum might be content to play the role of the prized token, Hamilton bucks any label that would cast his presence in F1 alone as change enough. He\u2019s too talented and too indispensable to the sport to be shouted down or cast out altogether. For nearly his entire career, Hamilton has been calling on F1 to become more racially, culturally and gender inclusive that it\u2019s a wonder his voice hasn\u2019t totally abandoned him. It\u2019s a theme he touched on again in his extended Instagram post. \u201cNot a sign from anybody in my industry, which of course is a white-dominated sport,\u201d he continued. \u201cI am one of the only people of color there yet I stand alone I would have thought by now you would see why this happens and say something about it but you can\u2019t stand alongside us. Just know I know who you are, and I see you.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>For me, the post brought back memories of a news conference during that \u201915 USGP, when another black reporter lobbed Hamilton a question about getting more black Americans into F1. (\u201cDon\u2019t ask me,\u201d Hamilton cracked, gesturing at the white drivers with him on the dais. \u201cAsk these guys first! I\u2019d love to hear what others think!\u201d) For as funny and awkward as that moment was, this time Hamilton made no effort to couch his frustrations. His dramatic shift in tone was enough to turn the nervous tittering that F1 drivers always produce when put on the spot into actually taking a stand this week. \u201cTo be completely honest, I felt out of place and uncomfortable sharing my thoughts,\u201d Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc tweeted. \u201cAnd I was completely wrong.\u201d McLaren\u2019s Lando Norris disseminated a Black Lives Matter engagement link. \u201cThis time,\u201d he wrote to his 427,000 Twitter followers, \u201cI ask you to do something and take action.\u201d Renault\u2019s Daniel Ricciardo was even more forceful, unpacking his thoughts underneath an Instagram mural that read: \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6b6408b116a5732d16d7feb17de92426ee408670\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b6408b116a5732d16d7feb17de92426ee408670/0_207_4403_2756/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lewis Hamilton\" width=\"1000\" height=\"626\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hamilton sports a helmet with the phrase \u201cStill I Rise\u201d stenciled on the back, a nod not to Maya Angelou but to Tupac Shakur.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boris Horvat/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The online chatter, whatever you make of it, might well be the most intense conversation about race that has ever bubbled up from within F1. Why it took until now to broach the subject isn\u2019t a mystery. It\u2019s history. The idea of a \u201cGrand Prize\u201d race owes its early momentum to young black chain gang workers in Savannah, Georgia, who were beaten and tortured and kept in makeshift slavery while hand carving and paving a 25-mile swath of dense wood and marshland for the inaugural showcase in 1908. Ferrari, the only F1 team that has been in the sport since its official inception in 1950, began as a plane engine builder for the fascist regime and proved so clutch that Benito Mussolini bestowed founder Enzo with the title of \u201cIl Commendatore\u201d \u2013 a title that became his nickname.</p> <p>Hamilton\u2019s own team, Mercedes, which not only reaped massive profits off the backs of 40,000 forced laborers during the Third Reich but also furnished Adolf Hitler\u2019s official coaches, was no better. Max Mosley, the barrister turned racing driver who presided over the governing body that oversaw F1 through boom times in the \u201990s and early aughts, is the younger son of 1930s fascist Sir Oswald Mosley and the socialite Diana Mitford; their secret wedding in October 1936 was held at the home of Joseph Goebbels and counted Hitler himself among the honored guests. From Michelin <a href=\"https://www.historytoday.com/archive/contrarian/belgiums-heart-darkness\">rubber</a> to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-28/shell-tries-to-come-clean-on-its-dirty-past-in-nigeria\">Shell gasoline</a>, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to name a feature of the modern Formula 1 spectacle that wasn\u2019t built on the complete subjugation and outright plundering of black and brown peoples. That the stars of the sport are now finally acknowledging their white supremacy is nice. But their sharp words alone won\u2019t be enough to cut into a 70-year head start.</p> <p>If the F1 is indeed serious about righting the scales of justice, the series could mandate that teams set aside a material chunk of their hundred-million dollar R&amp;D budgets to be invested in STEM programs that would provide non-white students onramps into the sport as engineers or aerodynamicists. John Malone and Greg Maffei, F1\u2019s American bosses and two of the biggest contributors to Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, would not only reinvest their fortunes in black communities that could extend the sport\u2019s reach, but also reserve extreme prejudice for the law enforcement types they pay handsomely to secure races. They\u2019d scrap plans for Grand Prix in Saudi Arabia and work on putting a Grand Prix in Ghana or Nigeria instead. Sure, most if not all of these broad proposals are likely to be met with some kind of resistance. But it pales in comparison to the kind of resistance that a black man could encounter if he\u2019s unfortunate enough to be pulled over while piloting&nbsp;their own Ferrari or a Mercedes SUV similar to the one George Floyd drove on the day of his unlawful demise.</p> <p>Whatever direction the sport takes on this new course, we can rest assured knowing that Hamilton is there to lead the way. What\u2019s more, he should draw a large measure of encouragement from having carried the global justice movement to a major turning point. Now when Hamilton decries what Martin Luther King would call \u201cthe silence of our friends\u201d, when Hamilton says, \u201cI see you\u201d, it isn\u2019t just F1\u2019s leading lights who hear him and shudder. We all do, and thus share responsibility with Hamilton, a true world champion, to hold these new allies and any more who come after them to their words.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Rail unions have threatened to strike over government plans for an \u201carmy\u201d of volunteers at transport hubs to remind travellers to wear a face covering.</p> \n<p>The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, announced the policy of using volunteers without consultation according to the RMT union,&nbsp;which condemned&nbsp;moves to put unpaid&nbsp;workers in \u201csafety critical roles\u201d.</p> \n<p>Face coverings will be mandatory on public transport in England from 15 June to help stop the transmission of coronavirus as more people go back to work,<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/face-masks-to-be-made-compulsory-on-public-transport-in-england\"> the government announced on Thursday</a>.</p> \n<p>Speaking on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Friday, Shapps said passengers would also be encouraged to cover their face when entering bus and train stations with the help of volunteer \u201cjourney makers\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are going to have thousands of people from the British Transport Police, Network Rail, Transport for London and actually a whole army of volunteers from a volunteer organisation who are going to be called journey makers, who will help to remind people. They will be wearing purple tabards and they will remind you to put your face covering on,\u201d he said, stressing that the legal requirement applied only when actually on a bus, train or tram.</p> \n<p>The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said the Department for Transport had \u201cdone a backroom deal to recruit unpaid and unskilled workers on our railway without even so much as conversation with rail unions,\u201d and the union would consider a strike ballot.</p> \n<p>While staff and unions have welcomed the moves to make face coverings mandatory, they remain concerned about implementation.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Cash said that, despite the use of the volunteers at stations reminding passengers, it was \u201cclear that the government and industry bosses are expecting our members to police this policy\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cThat will put overstretched rail workers right in the frontline once again and will leave them at risk of being abused, assaulted and spat at by aggressive passengers refusing to comply. This policy must be properly risk assessed, with staff fully protected.\u201d</p> \n<p>National rail operators appeared unsure of how it would be implemented. One industry figure said companies were concerned about how it would work on long-distance journeys, and at what point masks should be put on at stations or boarding trains. He suggested there could be reluctance among key workers who have travelled throughout lockdown without being obliged to wear a covering.</p> \n<p>Another train operator source said:&nbsp;\u201cAt the moment we need to digest the new rules and consider how enforcement will work.\u201d</p> \n<p>Finn Brennan, an Aslef district organiser with responsibility for London Underground, said the union had called for masks to be worn \u2013 but there needed to be more clarity and plans for enforcement.</p> \n<p>\u201cWill staff&nbsp;be expected to engage? Will there be confrontations? This should really be done as people come into stations, not as they get on to trains.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s all very well for [Network Rail chair] Peter Hendy and Shapps to compare it to the alcohol ban, but that\u2019s never been effectively enforced.\u201d</p> \n<p>Transport for London volunteers will also be handing out single-use face coverings for journeys over the next week before they become mandatory on public transport on 15 June.</p> \n<p>The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, told the BBC that there would be an \u201celement of discretion and good faith\u201d,&nbsp;with young children and people with breathing problems exempt, and the&nbsp;policy relying&nbsp;on \u201cpositive peer pressure\u201d. He said commuters should not \u201ctake the law into your own hands\u201d if they saw people without face coverings.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Face coverings were \u201cnot a panacea\u201d, said Shapps. \u201cHowever, on balance, because we know that from the 15th of this month, when non-essential retail will reopen and secondary schools, years 10 and 12, will go back, that public transport will for the first time be busier. And it\u2019s not been at this point used by more than about 5% of its usual numbers.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said face coverings would not have to be worn in shops because people would not be in close proximity to strangers for a prolonged period. \u201cThe big difference is in a shop you may well pass somebody and the guidance acknowledges you might be near somebody for a short period of time, but then you\u2019re going to move on. But the difference on public transport is that you could be next to somebody for 10, 20, 30 minutes.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Shapps also admitted that the government\u2019s track-and-trace app might not be ready until October. The Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/04/nhs-track-and-trace-system-not-expected-to-be-operating-fully-until-september-coronavirus\">revealed on Thursday</a> that Tony Prestedge, the chief operating officer of the NHS test-and-trace scheme, told staff the programme would be \u201cimperfect\u201d at launch, adding that he hoped it would be operational at a world-class level within three to four months.</p> \n<p>Prestedge was \u201cspecifically\u201d talking about the app, Shapps insisted: \u201cWhat he said was, as with any app, it gets released and anyone who downloads an app on their phone knows it\u2019s forever being updated and bugs squashed and all the rest of it. Apps are never completed in that sense.\u201d</p>",

The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, announced the policy of using volunteers without consultation according to the RMT union, which condemned moves to put unpaid workers in \u201csafety critical roles\u201d. Face coverings will be mandatory on public transport in England from 15 June to help stop the transmission of coronavirus as more people go back to work, the government announced on Thursday. Speaking on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Friday, Shapps said passengers would also be encouraged to cover their face when entering bus and train stations with the help of volunteer \u201cjourney makers\u201d. \u201cWe are going to have thousands of people from the British Transport Police, Network Rail, Transport for London and actually a whole army of volunteers from a volunteer organisation who are going to be called journey makers, who will help to remind people. They will be wearing purple tabards and they will remind you to put your face covering on,\u201d he said, stressing that the legal requirement applied only when actually on a bus, train or tram. The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said the Department for Transport had \u201cdone a backroom deal to recruit unpaid and unskilled workers on our railway without even so much as conversation with rail unions,\u201d and the union would consider a strike ballot. While staff and unions have welcomed the moves to make face coverings mandatory, they remain concerned about implementation. Cash said that, despite the use of the volunteers at stations reminding passengers, it was \u201cclear that the government and industry bosses are expecting our members to police this policy\u201d. He said: \u201cThat will put overstretched rail workers right in the frontline once again and will leave them at risk of being abused, assaulted and spat at by aggressive passengers refusing to comply. This policy must be properly risk assessed, with staff fully protected.\u201d National rail operators appeared unsure of how it would be implemented. One industry figure said companies were concerned about how it would work on long-distance journeys, and at what point masks should be put on at stations or boarding trains. He suggested there could be reluctance among key workers who have travelled throughout lockdown without being obliged to wear a covering. Another train operator source said: \u201cAt the moment we need to digest the new rules and consider how enforcement will work.\u201d Finn Brennan, an Aslef district organiser with responsibility for London Underground, said the union had called for masks to be worn \u2013 but there needed to be more clarity and plans for enforcement. \u201cWill staff be expected to engage? Will there be confrontations? This should really be done as people come into stations, not as they get on to trains. \u201cIt\u2019s all very well for [Network Rail chair] Peter Hendy and Shapps to compare it to the alcohol ban, but that\u2019s never been effectively enforced.\u201d Transport for London volunteers will also be handing out single-use face coverings for journeys over the next week before they become mandatory on public transport on 15 June. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, told the BBC that there would be an \u201celement of discretion and good faith\u201d, with young children and people with breathing problems exempt, and the policy relying on \u201cpositive peer pressure\u201d. He said commuters should not \u201ctake the law into your own hands\u201d if they saw people without face coverings. Face coverings were \u201cnot a panacea\u201d, said Shapps. \u201cHowever, on balance, because we know that from the 15th of this month, when non-essential retail will reopen and secondary schools, years 10 and 12, will go back, that public transport will for the first time be busier. And it\u2019s not been at this point used by more than about 5% of its usual numbers.\u201d He said face coverings would not have to be worn in shops because people would not be in close proximity to strangers for a prolonged period. \u201cThe big difference is in a shop you may well pass somebody and the guidance acknowledges you might be near somebody for a short period of time, but then you\u2019re going to move on. But the difference on public transport is that you could be next to somebody for 10, 20, 30 minutes.\u201d Shapps also admitted that the government\u2019s track-and-trace app might not be ready until October. The Guardian revealed on Thursday that Tony Prestedge, the chief operating officer of the NHS test-and-trace scheme, told staff the programme would be \u201cimperfect\u201d at launch, adding that he hoped it would be operational at a world-class level within three to four months. Prestedge was \u201cspecifically\u201d talking about the app, Shapps insisted: \u201cWhat he said was, as with any app, it gets released and anyone who downloads an app on their phone knows it\u2019s forever being updated and bugs squashed and all the rest of it. Apps are never completed in that sense.\u201d",

While the PM has said the scheme is not negotiable, backbenchers are lobbying the assistant treasurer, Michael Sukkar, to make sure the program does not extend beyond December. Covid scheme providing food to older Australians fails to deliver A government scheme to deliver a predicted 36,000 Covid food boxes to older people has fallen well short of that target. The fact that only 38 boxes were delivered, as revealed to the Covid Senate committee, was evidence that the elderly had been left to \u201cfall through the cracks\u201d, according to Labor. Although the Department of Health said \u201cdemand was low\u201d for the $9m program, seniors groups said the leftover money should be used on other programs that would assist older Australians, such home care packages. WA further loosens Covid restrictions The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, said full-contact competitive sport would be allowed again from tomorrow, while gyms were also given the green light to reopen. Restrictions will also be eased to allow galleries, museums, the TAB and zoos to begin operating again, while Rottnest Island will be able to welcome visitors. The state has a total of 30 active cases. Ebola drug endorsed as coronavirus treatment A national Covid taskforce has recommended the use of the antiviral drug remdesivir on coronavirus patients. The National Covid-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce said clinicians could start using the drug to treat adults who had moderate, severe or critical cases of Covid-19. It would help aid recovery times. The drug, which was first developed to treat Ebola, is now the first medication to be recommended for hospitalised patients who contract coronavirus.

But <strong>George Floyd</strong>\u2019s death has raised questions about whether Arradondo \u2014 or any chief \u2014 can fix the department. The city\u2019s own data going back to 2015 shows that when police officers use force, 60% of the time the person they\u2019re dealing with is black, though only 20% of the population is black.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI think the chief\u2019s heart is in the right place,\u201d <strong>City Council member Steve Fletcher</strong> said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think this department was ever going to let him get there. I think people understand he was in an impossible situation.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Fletcher argues that Arradondo was too lenient with discipline in his first year as chief as he worked to build department morale, which made getting rid of problem officers difficult later.</p> \n  <p>Arradondo\u2019s predecessor, <strong>Janee Harteau</strong>, was forced out over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/07/justine-damond-death-mohamed-noor-minneapolis\">the fatal shooting of <strong>Justine Ruszczyk Damond</strong></a>. She said she received push-back from the union when she was trying to implement reforms and this week she called on police union President Lt. <strong>Bob Kroll</strong> to resign after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/bob-kroll-george-floyd-minneapolis-police-union-chief\">his controversial comments</a>.</p> \n  <p>The Minnesota Department of Human Rights filed civil rights charges related to Floyd\u2019s death and will investigate the Minneapolis Police Department to determine if it has engaged in discriminatory practices, <strong>Governor Tim Walz</strong> said this week.</p> \n  <p>Fletcher said he wants to examine whether the police department should be disbanded, saying he believes it\u2019s \u201cso broken it can\u2019t be fixed.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI think we need to rebuild from the ground up,\u201d said Fletcher, vice chair of the city\u2019s public safety committee. <br></p> \n  <p>Bob Bennett, an attorney who said he has sued the department \u201chundreds\u201d of times over police misconduct allegations, said Arradondo probably did the best he could, but the union has more sway than chiefs do over police conduct.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI know he wants to reform the department as much as anyone I\u2019ve ever met or seen,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cHopefully this whole mess will bring about some change.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed9e4e68f0854eb54d99384\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-05T06:35:07.864Z\">7.35am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Today so far\u2026</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>\u201cWhat happened to Floyd happens every day in this country in education and health services and in every area of American life.

Bail would be lowered to $750,000 if they agreed to certain conditions, including forfeiting any personal firearms</p> \n  <p>Derek Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd\u2019s death, which happened on Memorial Day, 25 May. Witness video shows Chauvin kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck during an arrest, for almost nine minutes. Floyd pleads he cannot breathe, then stops moving.<br></p> \n  <p>Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-killing-derek-chauvin-charge-elevated-three-other-officers-charged\">announced the charges</a> against Thao, Lane and Kueng on Wednesday, also increasing the charge against Chauvin.</p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s the Associated Press:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Defense attorneys argued for lower bail. They told the court Chauvin was the training officer for Lane and Kueng, who had been on the job just four and three days respectively. Defendants don\u2019t normally enter pleas during their first appearances in Minnesota courts, which tend to be brief proceedings. Judge Paul Scoggin set their next court dates for 29 June.</p> \n   <p>If convicted, Chauvin faces a maximum of 40 years in prison on the murder count and 10 years for manslaughter. Under Minnesota law, aiding and abetting second-degree murder is tantamount a second-degree murder charge, so <strong>Thao, Lane and Kueng face the same potential penalties</strong> if convicted. A date for Chauvin\u2019s first court appearance has not been set.</p> \n   <p>The complaint against Lane, 37, notes that he asked about rolling Floyd on his side and wondered about delirium, but went on to say that Lane \u201ctook no actions to assist Mr Floyd, to change his position, or to reduce the force the officers were using against Mr Floyd.\u201d</p> \n   <p>The complaint against Kueng, 26, says he was positioned between Chauvin and Lane and could hear their comments. The complaint against Thao, 34, who was seen in the cellphone video standing near a crowd of bystanders, says the officer initially got a hobble restraint from the squad car, \u201cbut the officers decided not to use it and maintained their positions.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Governor Tim Walz and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights ordered a civil rights investigation of the police department to determine how to address its history of racial discrimination and find solutions for systemic change.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T20:10:07.371Z\">at 9.10pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed934288f0854eb54d98f62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T19:21:34.521Z\">8.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As Nick Confessore of the New York Times put it on Twitter today, \u201cTrump began his term promising to build a wall to protect America from the world.

Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He also compared Trump\u2019s behaviour to Nazi propaganda and called the president\u2019s stunt on Monday, ordering the gassing of peaceful protesters so he could stage a photo op outside St John\u2019s church, an \u201c<strong>abuse of executive authority</strong>\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1268347256748507136\">tweeted</a> back: \u201cProbably the only thing Barack Obama &amp; I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world\u2019s most overrated General.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Almost as inevitable as the abuse was the fact that the tweet contained a lie.

He did not ask for his resignation. <strong>The president has clearly forgotten how it actually happened or is confused</strong>. The president tweeted a very positive tweet about Jim until he started to see on Fox News their interpretation of his letter. Then he got nasty. Jim Mattis is a honorable man.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Unlike Mattis, Kelly has spoken out about Trump before, backing impeachment witness Lt Col Alexander Vindman and expressing quite wide disagreement. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/13/ex-white-house-chief-staff-john-kelly-speaks-out-against-trump\">Asked in February</a> why he went to work for Trump in 2017, Kelly said he had been \u201cfascinated \u2013 not necessarily in a good way \u2013 but fascinated as to what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">that election</a> meant to our country\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Kelly and Mattis have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/19/john-kelly-donald-trump-cliff-sims-book\">widely reported</a> to have been \u201cadults in the room\u201d in the first years of the Trump White House, willing to stand up to the president and obstruct his more dangerous impulses.

      "bodyText": "This live blog is now closing. You can follow our continuing coverage of the protests in our new live blog: Donald Trump loves boasting about his polling numbers when they are great for him. He might not be so keen on some numbers that have just come out from ABC News. For the second week since ABC News and Ipsos began polling on the coronavirus in mid-March, Trump\u2019s approval for his stewardship over the nation\u2019s response to the outbreak remains at a record low 39%. Six in 10 Americans disapprove of the president\u2019s handling of the virus. The company also polled US adults on whether they viewed George Floyd\u2019s death as an underlying racial injustice problem - and 74% of Americans polled did. Writing for ABC News, Kendall Karson observes that: This poll shows a more than 30-point increase in the belief that recent events reflect a broader issue over racial injustice from an ABC News/Washington Post poll from December 2014, four months after the shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year black man, by a white cop, and five months after the death of Eric Garner, a black man, who died after being put in a chokehold by a white officer. It possibly bears out what Barack Obama was saying earlier this week - that the people on the streets protesting racial injustice have been more ethnically and racially diverse than previous bouts of civil rights demonstrations. You can read the full details of the ABC News poll here: 74% of Americans view George Floyd\u2019s death as an underlying racial injustice problem The Age newspaper in Melbourne, Australia has issued an apology for its front page story this morning, which claimed without evidence that Black Lives Matter protesters had threatened \u201cpolice command with spitting, inflammatory chanting and other forms of physical abuse\u201d ahead of a demonstration planned for tomorrow. After significant backlash, the paper said in a \u201cclarification\u201d added to a re-written version of the story: The headline and opening paragraphs of the original version of this story reported concerns within the Victorian Government about the potential for some activists to provoke physical confrontation with police during planned protests. The story fell short of The Age\u2019s editorial values and standards and caused understandable offence to many members of the community. The claim that some activists had threatened police with spitting and abuse was not backed up beyond one unnamed senior government source. The story put undue emphasis on these claims. The main organisers of the rally, the Warriors of the Aboriginal Resistance, clearly stated that they had no knowledge of any threats to police. The Age apologises. Hydroxychloroquine is likely to be in the news agains today and it will be a surprise if Donald Trump doesn\u2019t mention it at some point. You may recall that Trump claimed he was taking it to ward off the coronavirus, despite at the time there being some warnings that it could actually be harmful. Then a major study in The Lancet suggested it was positively dangerous for Covid-19 patients, and experiments with using it to treat the new coronavirus were halted. The Lancet has now withdrawn that study after a Guardian investigation - and we can expect a chorus of Hydroxychloroquine backers to restart their campaign to get it tried out on patients. James Heathers has written for us on how on earth this can have happened. Peer review during a pandemic faces a brutal dilemma \u2013 the moral importance of releasing important information with planetary consequences quickly, versus the scientific importance of evaluating the presented work fully \u2013 while trying to recruit scientists, already busier than usual due to their disrupted lives, to review work for free. And, after this process is complete, publications face immediate scrutiny by a much larger group of engaged scientific readers than usual, who treat publications which affect the health of every living human being with the scrutiny they deserve. Read more here: The Lancet has made one of the biggest retractions in modern history. How could this happen? NFL players issued a powerful video statement overnight, which posed a challenge directly to the organisers to make a stronger explicit anti-racism message - and an apology for their past behaviour to players. The video message posted on social media includes Saquon Barkley, Patrick Mahomes, Michael Thomas, Odell Beckham Jr and Ezekiel Elliott among others. In the clip players take turns asking the question \u201cWhat if I was George Floyd?\u201d, and go on to name several black men and women who have recently been killed, including Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice and Trayvon Martin. They then tell the NFL that they want to hear the league condemn the systematic oppression of black people and admit they were wrong to silence the players\u2019 peaceful protests. The video also acts as a firm slap-down of Drew Brees, whose comments about NFL player protests have been described as both ignorant and dangerous. The NFL, which of course prohibited players from taking a knee to protest police brutality, did put out an anti-racist statement on 30 May, dismissed as \u201ctrash\u201d by Jacksonville Jaguars safety Peyton Thompson. One of the stories that is likely to develop further as the US wakes up is the suspension without pay of two police officers in Buffalo, New York after they were caught on film pushing a 75-year-old man to the ground. Buffalo mayor Byron Brown said he was \u201cdeeply distrubed\u201d by the video and New York state governor Andrew Cuomo said the incident was \u201cwholly unjustified and utterly disgraceful\u201d You can see the incident in this video clip - be warned you may find it distressing. The 75-year old man is reported to be in a stable but serious condition. The tenth night of protests and grief over the death of George Floyd continues to produce some strong images from the US and around the world. Here are a selection of some of the most striking from the last few hours. My colleagues on the sport desk have this morning published an open letter about racism to Donald Trump from former footballer Liam Rosenior, in which he thanks the US president for being so blatant in his attitude, in a way that presidents who came before him weren\u2019t These problems have been here throughout my lifetime and generations before me, and as a black man my biggest pain, anguish and dejection has come not only by witnessing these atrocities committed repeatedly against my people, but actually the lack of shock and vivid desensitisation built up over the years while hearing (and sadly believing) that \u201cthings won\u2019t change\u201d. Before you, we had presidents who turned a blind eye to this, who didn\u2019t do nearly enough and were too busy working to fulfil the wishes of corrupt corporations who had lobbied them into power. The difference is they were media savvy and clever enough to say the right thing in public and show just enough fake sympathy in response to these human rights violations to pacify the growing numbers of people who inherently knew there had to be change. You can read it in full here: This is just the beginning, I promise you: an open letter to Donald Trump While work continues on beefing up the security around the White House, Donald Trump will be out and about today with a planned visit to rural Maine. It is his first trip to Maine since taking office, and he is scheduled to visit Guilford, where he will be visiting Puritan Medical Products, one of only two major companies producing a special type of swab needed to ramp up coronavirus testing. The Trump administration is providing $75.5 million through the Defense Production Act for Puritan to double production to 40 million swabs a month, and the company plans to open a second production site by July 1. Trump is also scheduled to meet with members of the commercial fishing industry. He\u2019ll be flying in to Bangor, where he is also likely to encounter protest. And the local political ground isn\u2019t perhaps as welcoming as the president might hope - all four members of Maine\u2019s congressional delegation, including Republican Senator Susan Collins, have been critical of Trump\u2019s actions this week. Earlier this week she called his church and bible photo opportunity \u201cunsympathetic\u201d and \u201cinsensitive\u201d. Marie Follayttar, director of Mainers for Accountable Leadership, which is helping organise the demonstration today, simple says \u201cIt\u2019s not the right time for him to be coming to our state.\u201d There will inevitably be a huge focus on what happens now with the Minneapolis police force. Associated Press reporters Tammy Webber and Amy Forliti have been looking at the challenges faced by Medaria Arradondo, the city\u2019s first African American police chief. In his 2017 swearing-in ceremony he spoke of restoring trust. But George Floyd\u2019s death has raised questions about whether Arradondo \u2014 or any chief \u2014 can fix the department. The city\u2019s own data going back to 2015 shows that when police officers use force, 60% of the time the person they\u2019re dealing with is black, though only 20% of the population is black. \u201cI think the chief\u2019s heart is in the right place,\u201d City Council member Steve Fletcher said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think this department was ever going to let him get there. I think people understand he was in an impossible situation.\u201d Fletcher argues that Arradondo was too lenient with discipline in his first year as chief as he worked to build department morale, which made getting rid of problem officers difficult later. Arradondo\u2019s predecessor, Janee Harteau, was forced out over the fatal shooting of Justine Ruszczyk Damond. She said she received push-back from the union when she was trying to implement reforms and this week she called on police union President Lt. Bob Kroll to resign after his controversial comments. The Minnesota Department of Human Rights filed civil rights charges related to Floyd\u2019s death and will investigate the Minneapolis Police Department to determine if it has engaged in discriminatory practices, Governor Tim Walz said this week. Fletcher said he wants to examine whether the police department should be disbanded, saying he believes it\u2019s \u201cso broken it can\u2019t be fixed.\u201d \u201cI think we need to rebuild from the ground up,\u201d said Fletcher, vice chair of the city\u2019s public safety committee. Bob Bennett, an attorney who said he has sued the department \u201chundreds\u201d of times over police misconduct allegations, said Arradondo probably did the best he could, but the union has more sway than chiefs do over police conduct. \u201cI know he wants to reform the department as much as anyone I\u2019ve ever met or seen,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cHopefully this whole mess will bring about some change.\u201d \u201cWhat happened to Floyd happens every day in this country in education and health services and in every area of American life. It\u2019s time for us to stand up in George\u2019s name and say get your knee off our necks.\u201d If you haven\u2019t seen it yet, here\u2019s a video of some of Reverend Al Sharpton\u2019s powerful words at the George Floyd memorial service yesterday Here are the main points that have developed in the last few hours: Civil rights groups are to sue Trump over the assault on peaceful protesters near White House Twitter has disabled a Trump campaign video tribute to George Floyd, they say due to copyright complaint. It will no doubt add to tensions between the president and the social media platform Police officers in Buffalo have been suspended for pushing a 75-year-old to ground during the protests Black college student Justin Howell, hit in the head by \u201cless lethal\u201d rounds fired by police at a protest on Sunday, is in critical condition at hospital It is confirmed that Vallejo police killed an unarmed 22-year-old who was on his knees with his hands up The New York Times has dropped its initial defence of a \u2018Send in the troops\u2019 article and now says Tom Cotton\u2019s opinion piece did not meet editorial standards Ukrainian prosecutors find no evidence against Hunter Biden Good morning from London, I\u2019m Martin Belam, and I\u2019ll be running this live blog for a few hours now until I hand over to my colleagues in New York. You can contact me on martin.belam@theguardian.com or find me on Twitter @MartinBelam That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. Thank you so much to those of you who got in touch on Twitter. Before I go \u2013 this video was taken earlier this week, but because it\u2019s Friday: here are protestors singing along to Tupac\u2019s 1992 song \u201cChanges\u201d at the George Floyd protest all the way in Aotearoa (the M\u0101ori name for New Zealand): CBS reports that a black college student named Justin Howell, who was hit in the headby \u201cless lethal\u201d rounds fired by police at a protest on Sunday, is in critical condition at hospital, according to his brother, Joshua Howell. \u201cHowell is hospitalized with a fractured skull and brain damage and his brother cannot see him in person due to the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d say CBS. According to the New York Times, Joshua Howell says police continued to fire beanbag rounds at volunteer paramedics as they tried to cary his brother to safety. A video of this incident was posted to Twitter: The White House\u2019s security zone is being scaled up, according to WSB Capitol Reporter Jamie Dupree, who has shared images of what the larger fencing area will encompass \u2013 and how it compares to the previous closed-off area: Here is Reverend Al Sharpton\u2019s eulogy at a memorial service for George Floyd in Minneapolis: An increasing number of cities are rethinking the presence of school resource officers as they respond to the concerns of thousands of demonstrators many of them young who have filled the streets night after night to protest the death of George Floyd, AP reports. Portland Public Schools, Oregon\u2019s largest school district, on Thursday cut its ties with the Portland Police Bureau, joining other urban districts from Minneapolis to Denver that are mulling the fate of such programs. Protesters in some cities, including Portland, have demanded the removal of the officers from schools. Minneapolis suspended its school resource officer program on Tuesday. Districts in St. Paul, Minnesota and Denver are considering doing the same. Protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, have made the end of the school resource officer program in their district one of their demands. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said Thursday that he would also discontinue using school resource officers in two smaller metropolitan districts under a program that in total costs the city $1.6 million a year and has been in place for more than two decades. The three districts have a combined student population of nearly 53,000, with more than 49,000 in Portland schools alone. Nationwide, 43% of public schools had an armed law enforcement officer present at least once a week in the 2015-2016 school year, the last time the National Center for Education Statistics released data on this topic. Speaking of Twitter \u2013 and K-pop: K-pop fans around the world have joined forces to drown out online opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement, flooding social media with videos and images of their favourite artists alongside the #WhiteLivesMatter hashtag and other racist content. While their collective action meant the hashtag, as well as #WhiteOutWednesday and #BlueLivesMatter were trending in the top 10 on Twitter in the US earlier this week, the accompanying messages and attachments were emphatically off-message. Posts from K-pop stans \u2013 slang for obsessive fans \u2013 came with anti-racist messages and video footage of artists including the boy band phenomenon BTS and the rapper Ryujin. The social media bombardment saw K-pop fans commandeer rightwing and pro-Donald Trump hashtags to drown out racist and offensive posts, including criticism of protests in the US against the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis last week. Speaking of Twitter: you can get in touch with me directly @helenrsullivan. Comments, videos, tips, news, questions all welcome. Here\u2019s what we know about Twitter disabling Donald Trump\u2019s George Floyd tribute: In case you missed it: Twitter disabled a video by Donald Trump\u2019s campaign team that pays tribute to George Floyd, saying it is the subject of a copyright complaint. The video was retweeted nearly 7,000 times by people including the US president and his son Donald Jr. In response to the video\u2019s removal, the campaign accused the social media site and its co-founder, Jack Dorsey, of censoring an \u201cuplifting and unifying message from President Trump\u201d and urged its followers make a separate YouTube video go viral. The nearly four-minute clip posted on Wednesday shows images of peaceful protests while Trump speaks of the \u201cgrave tragedy\u201d before moving to a warning about violence from \u201cradical leftwing groups\u201d amid scenes of unrest and looting. The accompanying Team Trump tweet said: \u201cWe are working toward a more just society, but that means building up, not tearing down. Joining hands, not hurling fists. Standing in solidarity, not surrendering to hostility.\u201d An Associated Press photographer on assignment was attacked Thursday afternoon by a passerby while the journalist crossed the street with Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw and Mayor Jim Kenney. Matt Rourke was making photos of Outlaw and Kenney in North Philadelphia while the two city officials spent time with community members. Rourke is the photographer who took this photo: As Kenney, Outlaw and several more police officers and members of the media were crossing Broad Street, a man sucker-punched Rourke in his face. Outlaw was one of the first people to tend to Rourke as he lay on the street bloodied. It\u2019s unclear what prompted the attack. Police took down the man and arrested him. A Philadelphia Police Department spokeswoman said he remained in police custody Thursday night. An investigation into possible charges is underway. Rourke was taken to the hospital and is expected to be OK. In Australia, states are responding differently to Black Lives Matter protests planned for the weekend. New South Wales, home to Sydney, the country\u2019s most populous state, has asked that a planned protest not go ahead after it appeared that 10,000 people might attend, citing virus restrictions. NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller lodged an injunction against the protest because the numbers of those attending the protest kept growing online. Protests in groups of 10 are allowed under the health order, but that if the supreme court outlaws the protest, a gathering of hundreds would be illegal. The protest had secured permission as it originally planned to have fewer than 500 people present. Fuller confirmed that state police could arrest protesters in groups of over 500. Meanwhile South Australia has allowed a Black Lives Matter and Indigenous Lives Matter protest to go ahead in Adelaide on Saturday. In Victoria, police will fine protesters in groups over 20 at a Stop Black Deaths in Custody. A Guardian investigation has found that 432 Indigenous Australians have died in custody since 1991. The Huffington Post reports that police have seized black cloth masks intended to protect protestors from coronavirus infection. Law enforcement agents have seized hundreds of cloth masks that read \u201cStop killing Black people\u201d and \u201cDefund police\u201d that a Black Lives Matter-affiliated organization sent to cities around the country to protect demonstrators against the spread of Covid-19, a disease that has had a disparate impact on Black communities. The Movement for Black Lives (M4BL) spent tens of thousands of dollars on the masks they had planned to send all over the country. Four boxes of the masks were mailed from Oakland, California, but never left the state, HuffPo\u2019s Ryan J. Reilly reports: \u201cThe U.S. Postal Service tracking numbers for the packages indicate they were \u201cSeized by Law Enforcement\u201d and urge the mailer to \u201ccontact the U.S. Postal Inspection Service for further information.\u201d The mayor of Buffalo, where earlier today police were filmed pushing a protestor to the ground, causing his head to bleed, has tweeted a statement about the incident. The man was 75 years old, the statement notes, and is in a stable but serious condition in hospital. \u201cI am deeply disturbed by the video, as was police commissioner Byron Lockwood. he directed an immediate investigation into the matter, and the two officers have been suspended without pay.\u201d Lockwood calls the incident \u201cdisheartening\u201d in light of days of peaceful protests. Hi, Helen Sullivan joining you now. I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest news from across the country for the next few hours \u2013 please do get in touch on Twitter with questions, feedback, and, of course, news from wherever you are. I\u2019m @helenrsullivan. Alternatively, send me an email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com A memorial service for George Floyd was held in Minneapolis. Family members spoke and the civil rights campaigner Rev Al Sharpton also addressed the service. He promised a new march on Washington in August, 57 years after Martin Luther King Jr led his march to the capital, to seek to police reform. Three former Minneapolis officers charged with aiding and abetting the murder of Floyd appeared in court. Bail was set at $1m, down to $750,000 if certain conditions are met. An attorney for two of the officers is seeking a bail reduction, arguing that two of the officers were rookies. Former White House chief of staff John Kelly and former commander in Afghanistan and against Isis John Allen joined the ranks of senior military figures who\u2019ve criticized Donald Trump for using and threatening to use force against protestors. Combat units moved close to Washington were reportedly being sent back to base. Civil rights groups have sued Donald Trump, William Barr and other administration officials, on behalf of Black Lives Matter and individual protesters, over the attack on peaceful protesters which was dealt out so Trump could walk to St John\u2019s church for a photo op. Virginia\u2019s governor, Ralph Northam, confirmed that the state will move as swiftly as possible to remove a huge statue of Confederate general Robert E Lee from Monument Avenue in Richmond. The call to take down Confederate monuments has gained new momentum amid protests against police brutality toward Black Americans. Curfews were removed in many parts of California, including Los Angeles, Oakland and San Francisco. Peaceful protests continued across the state and across the nation. In Buffalo, NY, officers were filmed shoving a man to the ground, causing him to bleed profusely. The police department has suspended two officers over the incident and has launched an internal investigation, according to local news services. The New York Times issued a mea culpa over its decision to publish an op-ed in which Republican senator Tom Cotton advocates that the government \u201csend in the troops\u201d to quell the protest. The choice to run Cotton\u2019s contribution received widespread criticism, including from many New York Times staff that said it put the lives of Black Times staff at risk. My colleague Helen Sullivan in Australia will continue providing live updates. Erin McCormick reports from Albany, California: Even in suburban enclaves, where demonstrations rarely happen, families flooded out of their homes to join the protest in honor of George Floyd. In Albany, a tiny, historically-white, Bay Area community, hundreds of parents and children lined the corners in front of the local gas stations, waving signs. Passing cars honked at the banners reading \u201cEnd White Silence,\u201d and \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d As darkness approached, families headed home, dragging wagons full of sleepy children. Local seniors Henry Norr and Jean Tepperman had jury-rigged full facial shields on top of several layers of masks. They waved a sign reading \u201cDefund Police.\u201d The two Berkeley residents said they had been doing whatever they could to register their protest for days. \u201cWe were out in Oakland last night too,\u201d said Tepperman. \u201cAre you asking, because we\u2019re senior citizens?\u201d However the Berkeley resident said they hadn\u2019t lasted past the Oakland curfew Wednesday, when that protest broke out into a dance party. \u201cThat was after we left,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had to go home for bed.\u201d And here\u2019s a striking scene from Washington, DC, when lightning struck the Washington Monument. To be fair, the monument is outfitted with a lightning rod, and at 550-feet gets hit by lightening quite often. Thousands marched in San Diego, California today: Earlier today, as George Floyd\u2019s memorial service was underway, Democratic senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker spoke out against an amendment that would weaken bipartisan legislation that would make lynching a federal law. Republican senator Rand Paul of Kentucky singlehandedly held up the bill, which passed the House in February on a 410-4 vote, because he said it was too broad. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to conflate someone who has an altercation, where they had minor bruises, with lynching,\u201d he said. In an emotional address, Booker said he felt \u201cso raw today\u201d. \u201cOf all days we\u2019re doing this right now when, God, if this bill passed today, what that would mean for America,\u201d he said. Harris, the second Black woman elected to the Senate, said that \u201cBlack lives have not been taken seriously as being fully human and deserving of dignity, and it should not require a maiming or torture in order for us to recognize a lynching when we see it.\u201d \u201cSenator Paul is now trying to weaken a bill that was already passed. There\u2019s no reason for this,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no reason other than cruel and deliberate obstruction on a day of mourning.\u201d The progressive District Attorney of San Francisco has said his office will nor prosecute peaceful protesters after local police officers apprehended and arrested demonstrators who stayed out past curfew. Boudin, who was elected to his position in November 2019, promised changes to the criminal justice system in San Francisco. My colleague Vivian Ho profiled Boudin a while back: An update on the Buffalo man who was shoved by police officers: He is in stable condition at a local hospital, according to local public radio station WBFO-FM. Two officers have been suspended without pay as the Buffalo Police investigate the incident. Twitter has removed a video from the Trump campaign account, citing copyright infringement issues. The video, which displays images George Floyd and videos of people mourning his death overlayed with narration from Trump\u2019s first public speech following Floyd\u2019s killing. The president also warns about \u201cviolence and anarchy\u201d over images of looting. This is what the tweet looks like now: Police in Buffalo, New York were filmed shoving a man to the ground, causing him to bleed from the ear. The video also captures an officer trying to check on the man bleeding on the ground, only to be ushered away by another officer. The local police department has launched an investigation into the incident, police sources told a reporter for Investigative Post, a Buffalo-based publication. Black and minority Americans are more likely to be infected and die from Covid-19, because structural racism has left those populations with inferior health, housing and economic conditions, witnesses told a House subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis on Capitol Hill on Thursday. Even as protests against police violence roil the nation, the Covid-19 pandemic continues to infect or kill minority Americans at devastating rates \u2013 at least one independent report found black Americans dying at three times the rate of white Americans. Witnesses speaking to a House of Representatives subcommittee on racial disparities said the Covid-19 pandemic called for a \u201ctruth and reconciliation\u201d process and federal funding for minority health programs to counteract long-running health disparities. \u201cI have never been as scared for my patients as I have been the past few months,\u201d New York City emergency department doctor Ush\u00e9 Blackstock told the members of Congress. As the pandemic engulfed New York City and it became the world hotpot, she said her patient caseload shifted from a diverse group of New Yorkers to predominantly black Americans. As demonstrations took place across the US and a memorial with George Floyd\u2019s family was held in Minneapolis on Thursday, here are some of the most striking images from the day ... The movement to defund the police is gaining significant support across America, including from elected leaders, as protests over the killing of George Floyd sweep the nation. For years, activists have pushed US cities and states to cut law enforcement budgets amid a dramatic rise in spending on police and prisons while funding for vital social services has shrunk or disappeared altogether. Government officials have long dismissed the idea as a leftist fantasy, but the recent unrest and massive budget shortfalls from the Covid-19 crisis appear to have inspired more mainstream recognition of the central arguments behind defunding. \u201cTo see legislators who aren\u2019t even necessarily on the left supporting at least a significant decrease in New York police department [NYPD] funding is really very encouraging,\u201d Julia Salazar, a New York state senator and Democratic socialist, told the Guardian on Tuesday. \u201cIt feels a little bit surreal.\u201d A statement from House Republicans commemorating the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown is being widely mocked. While calling for the Chinese Communist Party to be held \u201caccountable for suppressing freedom,\u201d some Republican lawmakers have also advocated for the use of harsh policing and military deployment to quell ongoing demonstrations against police brutality. The use of teargas, flashbangs and other military tools against demonstrators has drawn criticism from civil rights advocates and public health officials. Moreover, as Mehdi Hasan, a columnist at The Intercept pointed out, Donald Trump infamously defended the Chinese government\u2019s brutal response to protesters in a 1990 interview. Kanye West has joined the protest in Chicago. But organizers said they didn\u2019t want a celebrity hijacking the youth-led demonstration, per reporters at the scene. The Trump administration continued to weaken core environmental protections in the US by announcing a pair of policies to cut reviews for large infrastructure projects and downplay the health benefits of rules to curb pollution. Both changes could disproportionately hurt communities of color, which are far more likely to live with pollution because of decades of environmental racism. They come after a week of nationwide protests over police killings of black Americans. The proposals could also make it easier for the government to ignore the climate crisis in making decisions. One of the policies came as an executive order from Donald Trump instructing agencies to use emergency authorities to bypass bedrock environmental laws and speed federal approvals for highways and oil and gas pipelines. The order said it is meant to accelerate the recovery from the \u201cdramatic downturn\u201d in the economy and high unemployment from the Covid-19 pandemic. The Guardian\u2019s Sarah Boseley and Melissa Davey write: The Lancet paper that halted global trials of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 because of fears of increased deaths has been retracted after a Guardian investigation found inconsistencies in the data. The lead author, Prof Mandeep Mehra, from the Brigham and Women\u2019s hospital in Boston, Massachusetts decided to ask the Lancet for the retraction because he could no longer vouch for the data\u2019s accuracy. The journal\u2019s editor, Richard Horton, said he was appalled by developments. \u201cThis is a shocking example of research misconduct in the middle of a global health emergency,\u201d he told the Guardian. A Guardian investigation had revealed errors in the data that was provided for the research by US company Surgisphere. These were later explained by the company as some patients being wrongly allocated to Australia instead of Asia. But more anomalies were then picked up. A further Guardian investigation found that there were serious questions to be asked about the company itself. An independent audit company was asked to examine a database provided by Surgisphere to ensure it had the data from more than 96,000 Covid-19 patients in 671 hospitals worldwide, that it was obtained properly and was accurate. The Lancet study had a dramatic impact on attempts to find out whether the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine, and its older version, chloroquine, could help treat patients with Covid-19. The US president, Donald Trump was among those who backed the drug before any high-quality trial evidence had been published. The World Health Organization and several countries suspended randomised controlled trials that were set up to find an answer. Those trials have now been restarted. Many scientists were angry that they had been stopped on the basis of a trial that was observational and not a \u201cgold standard\u201d RCT. Amid everything else going on, this just happened. Read on, from Reuters: An audit of thousands of old case files by Ukrainian prosecutors found no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Hunter Biden, the former prosecutor general who had launched the audit, told Reuters. Ruslan Ryaboshapka was in the spotlight last year as the man who would decide whether to launch an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, in what became a key issue in the impeachment of President Donald Trump. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy described Ryaboshapka as \u201c100 percent my person\u201d on a call in July 2019 in which Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate Biden, the man who became his main rival in the 2020 presidential race. After taking office, Ryaboshapka in October announced an audit of old cases he inherited, including those related to the energy company Burisma, of which Hunter Biden was a board member between 2014-2019. The audit was intended to probe whether cases Ryaboshapka had inherited from his predecessors had been handled properly, given the reputation of the prosecution service as being riddled with corruption and influence-peddling. \u201cI specifically asked prosecutors to check especially carefully those facts about Biden\u2019s alleged involvement. They answered that there was nothing of the kind,\u201d he added. Ryaboshapka was fired in March after lawmakers accused him of not moving quickly enough in prosecuting cases. Ryaboshapka said he was axed because he had started bringing real reform to the prosecution service for the first time in a way that threatened the interests of corrupt politicians. Two of the three officers who stood by as George Floyd was killed had been on the force for just four days, said an attorney representing the officers. Thomas Lane and J. Kueng have had bail set at $750,000. Their attorney wants to lower bail because the officers were barely off probation. From the AP: Police records indicate that while the men were rookies, they had more experience than a handful of days on the force. According to their records, they joined the department in February 2019 and became full officers in December. Minneapolis officers must serve a year on probation and spend time in field training with a more senior officer before they are fully qualified. The complaint against Lane, 37, notes that while he suggested to Chauvin that Floyd should be rolled over he \u201ctook no actions to assist Mr. Floyd, to change his position, or to reduce the force the officers were using against Mr. Floyd.\u201d Kueng\u2019s complaint says the 26-year-old was positioned between Chauvin and Lane and could hear their comments. Thao, 34, was seen in the cellphone video standing near a crowd of bystanders, and his complaint says although he fetched a hobble restraint \u2014 designed to restrict the movement of a person in custody \u2014 from the squad car, \u201cthe officers decided not to use it and maintained their positions.\u201d A judge in New York denied a request that the city release people held by police for more than 24 hours in compliance a state law requiring that a person be arraigned within 24 hours of an arrest. Justice James Burke of state supreme court in Manhattan denied the Legal Aid Society\u2019s demand that protestors be released in accordance with state law, noting that the police department was dealing with widespread unrest amid a pandemic. \u201cIt is a crisis within a crisis,\u201d Burke said. \u201cAll writs are denied.\u201d Court officials said the police and prosecutors had been slow to process paperwork, leaving dozens of New Yorkers in police custody for longer than 24 hours. Public health officials have warned that detaining protestors in police departments and jails will exacerbate the coronavirus pandemic, and increase infections. \u2026and following Hallie\u2019s report from Washington state, here\u2019s Sam Levin reporting from Los Angeles on another police killing of an unarmed man: Police in northern California fatally shot an unarmed 22-year-old who was on his knees with his hands up outside a Walgreens store while responding to a call of alleged looting, officials said. An officer in the city of Vallejo was inside his car when he shot Sean Monterrosa on Monday night amid local and national protests against police brutality. Police said an officer mistakenly believed Monterrosa had a gun, but later determined he had a hammer in his pocket. The killing of Monterrosa, a San Francisco resident, has sparked intense outrage in the Bay Area, particularly in the city of Vallejo, a city with a long history of police violence, high-profile killings and excessive force complaints. Here\u2019s Sam\u2019s full report: Hallie Golden reports from Washington state, on a case with disturbing echoes of the killing of George Floyd: The death of an African American father of two who called out \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d while handcuffed in police custody in March in Washington state has been ruled a homicide, according to a medical examiner\u2019s report released on Wednesday. Manuel Ellis, 33, died of respiratory arrest on 3 March in Tacoma, about 35 miles south of Seattle, due to hypoxia and physical restraint, said Rich O\u2019Brien, an investigator for the Pierce county medical examiner\u2019s office. Other factors that may have contributed to his death included methamphetamine intoxication and heart disease. The Washington congresswoman Pramila Jayapal referenced Ellis\u2019s death in a tweet on Thursday in which she highlighted the need for accountability and justice for him and \u201cfor so, so many more Black Americans in states across this country who should still be alive today\u201d. Here\u2019s the full report: It\u2019s worth pointing out here that Cotton\u2019s op-ed in the Times contained several false and unvalidated claims including the notion that \u201cleftwing radicals, like Antifa, infiltrated marches.\u201d Times journalists have debunked the Antifa claim. The New York NewsGuild called the choice to publish Cotton\u2019s piece \u201can irresponsible choice\u201d, noting that \u201cinvoking state violence disproportionately hurts Black and brown people. It also jeopardizes our journalists\u2019 ability to work in the field safely and effectively.\u201d The Times issued a mea culpa over the paper\u2019s decision to publish an op-ed Republican senator Tom Cotton titled \u201cSend in the troops\u201d. The decision to run the piece, which advocates for the deployment of the military against protestors rallying against police brutality toward Black Americans drew widespread criticism. Dozens of Times journalists voiced their opposition to the decision, noting that inciting a violent response to the protestors put Black journalists, and Black and brown people more broadly, in danger. On Twitter, many staffers posted the same message: \u201cRunning this puts Black @nytimes staffers in danger.\u201d Times publisher AG Sulzberger initially defended the editorial decision, saying the paper was committed to representing \u201cviews from across the spectrum\u201d. I\u2019m now handing the blog to Maanvi Singh, who will take our coverage into the evening. A summary of the past few hours: A memorial service for George Floyd was held in Minneapolis. Family members spoke and civil rights campaigner Rev Al Sharpton also addressed the service. He promised a new march on Washington on 28 August, 57 years since Martin Luther King Jr led his march to the capital, to seek policing reform. Three former Minneapolis officers charged with aiding and abetting the murder of Floyd appeared in court. Bail was set at $1m, down to $750,000 if certain conditions are met. Former White House chief of staff John Kelly and former commander in Afghanistan and against Isis John Allen joined the ranks of senior military figures splitting from Donald Trump over his threats to use troops against protesters and the assault on peaceful protesters in Washington on Monday. Combat units moved close to Washington were reported to being sent back to base. The ACLU has sued Donald Trump, William Barr and other administration officials, on behalf of Black Lives Matter and individual protesters, over the attack on peaceful protesters which was dealt out so Trump could walk to St John\u2019s church for a photo op. Attorney general William Barr claimed to have evidence of \u201cAntifa\u201d complicity in violent events around protests in the past week. Virginia governor Ralph Northam confirmed that the state will move as swiftly as possible to remove a huge statue of Confederate general Robert E Lee from Monument Avenue in Richmond. Protests are continuing around the country \u2013 Ankita Rao, for example, has been with protesters in New York City \u2013 so stay with us. More from Ankita Rao, in Brooklyn, New York: Thousands of people who gathered for a memorial event for George Floyd in Brooklyn on Thursday marched north to Williamsburg in the evening, a couple of hours before the 8pm curfew. Many others marched over the Brooklyn Bridge, which connects the borough with Manhattan. While many protesters had been out for several days, there were also people coming out for the first time in the name of black men and women who have been killed by police. Felisa, a nurse and activist from Brooklyn, said she and her daughter marched for the first time for the memorial. She passed out voter registration forms and masks. \u201cI\u2019m here as a parent of the movement,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen gang violence, the crack epidemic, the heroin epidemic \u2013 all the things they\u2019ve blamed the black community for.\u201d Her daughter, 18 and a chemical engineering student, said she had seen five shootings in New York this year, one of which was in her neighborhood this week. \u201cEven though I\u2019m getting my college education, that won\u2019t save me from an officer wanting to take my life,\u201d she said. There had been protests for many years but none like this one, she said. \u201cNow see what happens when you don\u2019t listen to the oppressed.\u201d As protesters walked by squads of police, many holding batons, some marchers stopped and stood with their back to the officers, directing others not to stop and to keep walking the main route. While some in the crowd continued to challenge police, those who had stopped begged them to avoid the violence of the past few days. \u201cIt was terrifying,\u201d said the Janeese Castelar, a soul singer who joined another woman to stop protesters from approaching the NYPD. \u201cBut we\u2019re being met with violence and people think it\u2019s our fault, so I have to prove that it\u2019s not.\u201d More on the ACLU and Black Lives Matter lawsuit, which can be found here. It was filed in the US district court for the District of Columbia, and it \u201cseeks an order declaring President Trump, Attorney General Barr, and other administration officials violated the protesters\u2019 first and fourth amendment rights, as well as engaged in a conspiracy to deny those rights\u201d. The lawsuit also \u201cseeks on order barring the officials from repeating the unlawful activities, and damages for the injuries plaintiffs sustained\u201d. The typically impressive Associated Press fact check I cited and linked to in my last post points, meanwhile, to something of what has happened to the notion of truth under Trump. Like the ACLU lawsuit, the AP story concerns whether or not tear gas was used on peaceful protesters in and around Lafayette Square in Washington on Monday, before Trump performed his purposeful walk from the White House to hold aloft a Bible in front of St John\u2019s church. It doesn\u2019t deal with whether or not rubber bullets were used, which Trump has also denied. This Washington Post piece does. About tear gas, the AP writes: \u201cThey didn\u2019t use tear gas,\u201d Trump said on Wednesday on Fox News Radio. The US Park Police denied using tear gas, yet acknowledged deploying a pepper compound, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other scientific organizations list as one form of tear gas. In other words, the president is just denying something as usual but the US Park Police are doing something more insidious: exploiting the tiniest crevice of terminological wriggle room to deny something they admit. And in such Orwellian vein, the AP has more: Law enforcement officials shy away from describing crowd-dispersing chemical tools as tear gas; it evokes police gassing citizens or the horrors of war. But giving those tools a more antiseptic name does not change the reality on the ground. Federal institutions such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense have listed tear gas as the common term for riot-control agents. Whether the common or formal term is used, the effects on people are the same. [In Lafayette Square on Monday] authorities, who came from more than a half-dozen agencies besides the Park Police, set loose several wafting compounds, causing people to cough and gag as they scattered, their eyes red and streaming in some cases. They displayed the results of exposure to tear gas tears, for example. \u201cTear gas is anything that makes you cry,\u201d said Dr Lynn Goldman, dean of the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, speaking of chemicals used in crowd dispersal. \u201cPepper spray is a tear gas. But there are all kinds of other ones, too.\u201d There is a lot more to the AP report, which can be read in full here. Also, as it happens, in that Fox News Radio interview on Wednesday, Trump said protesters \u201cburned down the church\u201d. Not so. In a letter to parishioners, the Rev Robert Fisher, rector of St John\u2019s, said: \u201cThere was a small fire in the parish house basement. Thankfully, it appears to have been contained to the nursery \u2013 though, as you might imagine there is smoke and water damage to other areas of the basement.\u201d The American Civil Liberties Union is suing Donald Trump, William Barr and other federal officials over the assault on peaceful protesters near the White House on Monday, which was ordered by Barr so Trump could walk to St John\u2019s church, the so-called Church of the Presidents, and hold up a Bible in a photo op meant to reassure evangelical supporters. According to a release from the ACLU of the District of Columbia, the lawsuit filed on behalf of Black Lives Matter DC and individual protesters accuses Trump and the other officials are accused of \u201cviolating their constitutional rights and engaging in an unlawful conspiracy to violate those rights\u201d. Washington Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the law firm of Arnold &amp; Porter also filed the suit. \u201cWhat happened to our members Monday evening, here in the nation\u2019s capital, was an affront to all our rights,\u201d April Goggans of Black Lives Matter DC, the lead plaintiff in the case, said in a quote provided by the ACLU. \u201cThe death of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor at the hands of police officers has reignited the rage, pain, and deep sadness our community has suffered for generations. We won\u2019t be silenced by tear gas and rubber bullets. Now is our time to be heard.\u201d Scott Michaelman, legal director for the ACLU of the District of Columbia, said: \u201cThe president\u2019s shameless, unconstitutional, unprovoked, and frankly criminal attack on protesters because he disagreed with their views shakes the foundation of our nation\u2019s constitutional order. \u201cAnd when the nation\u2019s top law enforcement officer becomes complicit in the tactics of an autocrat, it chills protected speech for all of us.\u201d Ben Wizner, director of the ACLU\u2019s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, said lawsuits would be filed across the US, where \u201claw enforcement armed with military weaponry are responding with violence to people who are protesting police brutality. \u201cThe First Amendment right to protest is under attack, and we will not let this go unanswered.\u201d Trump and supporters have claimed protesters in Lafayette Square, in front of the White House, and near St John\u2019s church were not tear-gassed. But as an Associated Press fact check points out, \u201cthe US Park Police denied using tear gas, yet acknowledged deploying a pepper compound, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other scientific organizations list as one form of tear gas\u201d. The White House has also contested reports that rubber bullets were also used to clear the crowd before Trump, who had just promised \u201claw and order\u201d in a brief Rose Garden address, walked to the church and posed with a Bible carried by his daughter, Ivanka. Here\u2019s a telling Washington Post headline: \u201cWhite House says police didn\u2019t use tear gas and rubber bullets in incident that cleared protesters with chemical irritants and projectile munitions.\u201d The events in and around Lafayette Square on Monday night have contributed to a growing rift in US society and even within the US military. Trump was accompanied to the church by officials including Mark Esper, the secretary of defense, and Gen Mark Milley, the chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Esper has said he didn\u2019t know what the president was intending to do. But senior figures including former defense secretary and Marine Corps general James Mattis, former JCOS chair Admiral Mike Mullen and former Marine Corps general John Allen, a former US commander against Isis and in Afghanistan, have expressed their disgust with both the stunt and the military\u2019s participation in it. Julian Borger, our world affairs editor, has more: There are a lot of sizeable protests going on around the US today. In New York City, for example, after a memorial service for George Floyd in Brooklyn, hundreds of marchers have been crossing the Brooklyn Bridge: Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York state, is worried about what such protests might mean for the coronavirus pandemic, which lest anyone forget has killed more than 107,000 people in the US, more than 24,000 of them in New York. \u201cIf you were at a protest, go get a test, please,\u201d Cuomo said at his daily briefing. \u201cThe protesters have a civic duty here also. Be responsible, get a test.\u201d An estimated 20,000 people have demonstrated in New York City alone, the governor said, adding: \u201cNew York City had the highest number of protesters. We have to be smart.\u201d Here\u2019s Jessica Glenza, our health reporter, on the subject of protests and the coronavirus: Earlier today, Virginia governor Ralph Northam (yes, him) confirmed that a statue of Gen Robert E Lee will be removed as soon as possible from Monument Avenue in Richmond, the capital of the old Confederacy. \u201cYou see, in Virginia, we no longer preach a false version of history,\u201d Northam, a Democrat, said. \u201cOne that pretends the civil war was about \u2018state rights\u2019 and not the evils of slavery. No one believes that any longer.\u201d Some people do and they will be cross. The state Republican party doesn\u2019t necessarily believe it but it did say in a statement the decision \u201cis not in the best interests of Virginia. Attempts to eradicate instead of contextualizing history invariably fail\u201d. But in the words of the Associated Press, \u201cNortham made the decision, which has been widely praised by black leaders and activists, after days of angry protests in Richmond and across the country over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck while he pleaded for air. The decision also came a day after Richmond\u2019s mayor, Levar Stoney, announced he will seek to remove the four other Confederate statues along Monument Avenue.\u201d Such moves were not pursued after the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in August 2017. The AP again: \u201cIn part, local governments were hamstrung by a state law that protects memorials to war veterans. That law was amended earlier this year by the new Democratic majority at the statehouse and signed by Northam. When the changes go into effect on 1 July, localities will be able to decide the monuments\u2019 fate.\u201d \u201c\u2026The statues on Monument Avenue are among the most prominent collection of tributes to the Confederacy in the nation. Lee\u2019s 21ft sculpture rises atop a pedestal nearly twice that tall on a grassy circle 200ft in diameter. \u2018We put things on pedestals when we want people to look up,\u2019 Northam said. \u2018Think about the message that this sends to people coming from around the world to visit the capital city of one of the largest states in our country. Or to young children.\u2019 \u201cElsewhere on the broad avenue lined with mansions and tony apartments are statues to Confederate president Jefferson Davis, generals JEB Stuart and Thomas \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson and naval officer Matthew Maury. A statue of black tennis hero Arthur Ashe, a Richmond native, was erected in 1996. \u201cA descendant of Lee\u2019s brother, the Rev Robert W Lee IV, said at the press conference that his line of the family \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d commends the governor\u2019s decision. \u201cFriends, the world may be burning and the world is about to turn because we are going to let justice roll down, and this is the start of something incredible,\u201d he said. Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, announced on Thursday that he will block the confirmation of Donald Trump\u2019s nominees until the White House provides Congress with \u201cadequate explanations\u201d for the firing of two inspector generals in recent months. It is rare for a president to remove an inspector general, a role created in the aftermath of Watergate. But in the last few months, Trump has carried out a purge of such government watchdogs who he deemed as insufficiently loyal, among them intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson, state department inspector general Steve Linick, acting Pentagon inspector Glenn Fine, and acting Health and Human Services inspector Christi Grimm. By law, the administration is supposed to serve notice to Congress at least 30 days before the removal of an inspector general. Grassley served notice on Twitter. Grassley\u2019s move is a rare break from the president. But the former judiciary committee chairman, who has long considered himself an advocate for inspectors general, has led the charge calling on the administration to provide an explanation for the removals. He raised similar concerns in 2009, when Barack Obama ousted Americorps inspector general Gerald Walpin. Lego fans were alarmed this week, when the toy industry giant stopped advertising a number of sets featuring police officers and equipment. Lego acted in light of protests against police brutality and racism following the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd, which have led to the worst civil unrest in the US in more than 50 years. The toy giant also paused advertising for an adult building set of the White House, home to President Donald Trump and the scene of extraordinary confrontations between law enforcement and protesters, some peaceful but still gassed and shot at with rubber bullets, over the past few days. With fans worried by reports that the sets had been removed from sale altogether, Lego was moved to say that was never the case. Toybook.com, an industry news site, first reported the move, saying it had obtained a copy of an email to marketers which requested the \u201cremoval of product listings and features for more than 30 Lego building sets, Minifigures, and accessories that include representation of police officers, firefighters, criminals, emergency vehicles, and buildings\u201d. Sets affected included the Lego City Police Station, Police Dog Unit, Patrol Car, Mobile Command Center and Police Highway Arrest. The Donut Shop Opening set was also listed, as it includes a police officer Minifigure and a \u201ccrook\u201d. Reports of Lego\u2019s move caused consternation and confusion among Lego fans, one Lego social media account asking the company to explain: \u201cWe all firmly believe #BlackLivesMatter. For decades Lego police &amp; fire rescue have been the very best example how to protect and rescue fellow minifigs and kids playing. What kind of message are you making here??\u201d Lego did explain, in an email to Toybook. \u201cWe requested that our affiliate partners refrain from posting promotional Lego content as part of our decision to respect #BlackOutTuesday,\u201d it said, \u201cand pause posting content on our social media channels in response to the tragic events in the US.\u201d Black Out Tuesday saw major institutions around the world post black squares and stop online activity in solidarity with the George Floyd protests. \u201cWe regret any misunderstanding and will ensure that we are clearer about our intentions in the future,\u201d Lego said. On Wednesday, the toy giant\u2019s own Twitter account posted a clear statement. \u201cWe stand with the black community against racism and inequality,\u201d it said. \u201cThere is much to do. We will donate $4m to organisations dedicated to supporting black children and all children about racial inequality.\u201d With protests over police brutality and the death of George Flloyd continuing around the US today, a short report from our voting rights editor on events this afternoon in Brooklyn, New York City: Thousands of protestors converged on Brooklyn\u2019s Cadman Plaza today for a memorial for George Floyd. The event was attended by Floyd\u2019s brother, Terrence, who addressed the crowd with calls for solidarity and peaceful protest in memory of his brother. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the protests,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not proud of the destruction.\u201d The crowd sprawled across Downtown Brooklyn and was charged with energy and anger after a peaceful protest in the same spot on Wednesday night ended with police bearing down on the crowd, pushing protesters to the ground and beating them with batons. New York mayor Bill de Blasio also attempted to address the crowd, calling for change and denouncing white supremacy. But he was booed and met with chants of \u201cNo Justice, No Peace\u201d and \u201ctraitor\u201d so loud most could not hear his speech. Rev Al Sharpton also used his eulogy at the memorial service for George Floyd to announce that, with the Floyd family, he would organise a march on Washington on 28 August to demand reform of the criminal justice system. It will be held 57 years to the day since Martin Luther King\u2019s March on DC. \u201cWe\u2019re going back to Washington,\u201d he said, turning to Martin Luther King III, the eldest son of MLK. \u201dThat\u2019s where your father stood in the shadows of the Lincoln Memorial and said \u2018I have a dream.\u2019 Well, we\u2019re going back this 28 August to restore and recommit that dream, to stand up.\u201d Numerous outlets are reporting that active duty US troops who were brought close to Washington after Donald Trump threatened to deploy the army against protesters are now being moved away. This is from Reuters: Several hundred active-duty troops from the 82nd Airborne Division who were sent to the Washington DC area to potentially respond to civil unrest are expected to start heading back to their home base in North Carolina, a US official said on Thursday. The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the decision was made earlier in the day and they would be returning to Fort Bragg soon. While the troops were in the National Capital Region, they were not deployed to Washington DC and were on standby in case they were needed. Trump\u2019s wish for troops, and threats to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807 in order to deploy them, have caused splits in his own administration. Defense secretary Mark Esper said he didn\u2019t think the Act was needed, then went to the White House to, it seems, be told otherwise. Speculation about Esper\u2019s job security is rife. Trump has also been rebuked by senior military figures, including Esper\u2019s predecessor as permanent secretary of defense, retired Marine Corps general James Mattis. Mattis issued an extraordinary rebuke of the president on Wednesday night. In doing so he was following Admiral Mike Mullen, a former chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Mattis and Mullen were then followed by John Allen, a retired Marine Corps general now chairman of the Brookings Institution, who warned today the US could be facing \u201cthe beginning of the end of the American experiment\u201d. Our reporter in Minneapolis writes: The service drew to a close with the mourners asked to stand for eight minutes and 47 seconds, the time that Derek Chauvin kept his knee on George Floyd\u2019s neck. Sharpton said was told before the service that would be a long time to ask people to stand in silence. It was indeed, he said. And a reminder of just how long Chauvin had to pull his knee away or for one of the other police officers with him to intervene and save Floyd\u2019s life. As the seconds ticked by, family members and other mourners clung to each other, weeping or staring up at brightly lit replica of the street mural of Floyd hanging behind his coffin, which was piled high with flowers. Others took in a portrait of Floyd next to the casket in what looks to be a selfie as he stares into the camera, wearing a black and gold striped hoodie. More from our reporter at the memorial service\u2026 But Sharpton also had words of hope. \u201cI\u2019m more hopeful today than ever,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I looked this time and saw marchers were in some cases young whites outnumbering the black marchers, I know that it is a different time and a different season. \u201cWhen I looked and saw people in Germany marching for George Floyd, it\u2019s a different time and different season. When they went in front of the parliament in London, England and said it\u2019s a different time and a different season, I come to tell you, America this is the time of building accountability in the criminal justice system.\u201d Sharpton said he remembered going to a march years ago and being confronted by a white woman who looked him in the face and said: \u201cNigger, go home.\u201d This week, he said, he came face to face with a young white girl. \u201cI braced myself and she looked at me and said: \u201cNo justice, no peace,\u201d Sharpton recalled, to a roar from the mourners. \u201cThis is the time,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t stop. We\u2019ll keep going until we change the whole system of justice.\u201d More from our reporter at the memorial service for George Floyd: Rev Al Sharpton, in a blue suit and wearing black gloves, gave a powerful eulogy that took a swipe at Donald Trump but mostly directed his anger more broadly. \u201cGeorge Floyd should not be among the deceased,\u201d the civil rights campaigner said. \u201cHe did not die of common health conditions. He died of a common American criminal justice malfunction. So it not a normal funeral. It is not normal circumstances. But it is too common and we need to deal with it.\u201d Sharpton took a stab at Trump\u2019s photo op with a bible outside St John\u2019s church in Washington earlier this week. \u201cHeld the Bible in his hand. I\u2019ve been preaching since I was a little boy. I never seen anyone hold a Bible like that,\u201d he quipped. \u201cI would like him to open that Bible and I\u2019d like him to read Ecclesiastes 3, to every season there is a time and a purpose and I think that it is our job to let the world when we see what is going on in the streets of this country and in Europe, and around the world, that you need to know what time it is. \u201cFirst of all, we cannot use bibles as a prop. And for those of you who have agendas that are not about justice, his family will not let you use George as a prop.\u201d Sharpton said people have accused him of being publicity hungry. He said that is exactly what he is, because he wants to shed light on injustice. He said he grew up with cockroaches in his home. \u201cOne of the things I found out about roaches is that if you keep the lights off, if you are in the dark, a roach will pull up at your dinner table and have a five-course meal,\u201d he said. Put the light on, he added, and they scuttle away. \u201cI\u2019ve spent all my life chasing roaches all over this country,\u201d he said. The police officer with his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck, Sharpton said, represented America\u2019s treatment of its black citizens for hundreds of years. \u201cThe reason we could never be who we wanted and dreamed of being is you kept your knee on our neck,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were smarter than the underfunded schools you put us in but you had your knee on our neck. We could run corporations and not hustle in the street but you had your knee on our neck. We had creative skills. We could do whatever anyone else could do. But we couldn\u2019t get your knee off our neck. \u201cWhat happened to Floyd happens every day in this country in education and health services and in every area of American life. It\u2019s time for us to stand up in George\u2019s name and say, \u2018Get your knee off our necks.\u2019\u201d The three former Minneapolis police officers charged with aiding and abetting in the murder of George Floyd appeared in court this afternoon, just blocks away from where the memorial service for the 46-year-old is taking place. You can see that service in the embedded livestream above. In Hennepin county district court, a judge set bail at $1m each for Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J Alexander Kueng. Bail would be lowered to $750,000 if they agreed to certain conditions, including forfeiting any personal firearms Derek Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd\u2019s death, which happened on Memorial Day, 25 May. Witness video shows Chauvin kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck during an arrest, for almost nine minutes. Floyd pleads he cannot breathe, then stops moving. Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison announced the charges against Thao, Lane and Kueng on Wednesday, also increasing the charge against Chauvin. Here\u2019s the Associated Press: Defense attorneys argued for lower bail. They told the court Chauvin was the training officer for Lane and Kueng, who had been on the job just four and three days respectively. Defendants don\u2019t normally enter pleas during their first appearances in Minnesota courts, which tend to be brief proceedings. Judge Paul Scoggin set their next court dates for 29 June. If convicted, Chauvin faces a maximum of 40 years in prison on the murder count and 10 years for manslaughter. Under Minnesota law, aiding and abetting second-degree murder is tantamount a second-degree murder charge, so Thao, Lane and Kueng face the same potential penalties if convicted. A date for Chauvin\u2019s first court appearance has not been set. The complaint against Lane, 37, notes that he asked about rolling Floyd on his side and wondered about delirium, but went on to say that Lane \u201ctook no actions to assist Mr Floyd, to change his position, or to reduce the force the officers were using against Mr Floyd.\u201d The complaint against Kueng, 26, says he was positioned between Chauvin and Lane and could hear their comments. The complaint against Thao, 34, who was seen in the cellphone video standing near a crowd of bystanders, says the officer initially got a hobble restraint from the squad car, \u201cbut the officers decided not to use it and maintained their positions.\u201d Governor Tim Walz and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights ordered a civil rights investigation of the police department to determine how to address its history of racial discrimination and find solutions for systemic change. As Nick Confessore of the New York Times put it on Twitter today, \u201cTrump began his term promising to build a wall to protect America from the world. He ends it building a wall to protect himself from Americans.\u201d Trump insisted yesterday that he did not visit the White House bunker on Friday night because protesters were clashing with law enforcement officers outside, as had been widely reported, but instead had been down there briefly during the day for a quick inspection. Carol Leonnig of the Washington Post duly disproved that, but who\u2019s even counting how many fibs the president tells about reported fact anymore? Anyway \u2013 back to Confessore\u2019s point. Tom Fitzgerald, for Fox 5 in Washington, has like many other reporters out and about in the capital noticed concrete barriers being put into place around the White House: Earlier, the Vermont senator Patrick Leahy, a Democrat, noticed Confessore\u2019s tweet and decided to make a point: More from our reporter at the memorial service for George Floyd in Minneapolis, which you can watch in the livestream embedded above\u2026 The family\u2019s lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said the fight for justice would have to go on \u201cinside the courtroom and outside the courtroom\u201d. It was revealed that Floyd had tested positive for coronavirus in April but Crump said that wasn\u2019t what killed him. \u201cIt was that other pandemic that we\u2019re far too familiar with in America, that pandemic of racism and discrimination that killed George Floyd,\u201d he said. Then family members stepped up to remember Floyd. Philonise Floyd described his love for his elder brother. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have much. Our mom did what she could. We would sleep in the same bed,\u201d he said. Philonise described his brother as inspiring, and how they would talk and dance and cook with their mother. \u201cIt was amazing, everywhere you go and see how people cling to him. They wanted to be around him. George, he was like a general. Every day you walks outside and there\u2019s a line of people \u2026 wanting to greet him and wanting to have fun with him. \u201cGuys that was doing drugs, like smokers and homeless people. You could tell because when they spoke to George they felt like they was the president because that\u2019s how he made you feel. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy man. It\u2019s amazing to me that he touched so many hearts.\u201d In Los Angeles, which has seen its share of protests and arrests since the killing of George Floyd, Mayor Eric Garcetti has confirmed that there will be no curfew tonight. \u201cAngelenos are rallying around powerful and peaceful demonstrations against racial injustice,\u201d said Garcetti. \u201cWe remain committed to protecting the right of all people to make their voices heard and ensuring the safety of protesters, businesses, residents, families, and our entire community.\u201d There\u2019s also this from the sheriff of Alameda County, which centres on Oakland: At a press conference in Washington on Thursday, Attorney General William Barr said federal law enforcement officers had gathered intelligence that extremist groups including Antifa had \u201chijacked\u201d peaceful protests over the death of George Floyd, seeking to incite violence and destruction. \u201cWe have evidence,\u201d Barr said, \u201cthat Antifa and other similar extremist groups, as well as actors of a variety of different political persuasions, have been involved in instigating and participating in the violent activity.\u201d Last week, Donald Trump sought to designate Antifa, an amorphous group name for the antifascist movement, a terrorist organization. Barr added: \u201cWe are also seeing foreign actors playing all sides to exacerbate the violence.\u201d Pressed by a reporter about why he mentioned Antifa as opposed to \u201cboogaloo\u201d or other far-right extremist elements, Barr said there was a \u201cwitches brew a lot of different extremist organizations trying to exploit the protests.\u201d Federal forces have taken over Washington\u2019s response to the unrest, under Barr\u2019s direction. All of the justice department components \u2013 including the FBI, the US Marshals, the Bureau of Prisons, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Drug Enforcement Administration \u2013 have been tapped to respond to violence and looting. Questions have been raised about such officers appearing in public \u2013 and being used to control the public \u2013 without identifying marks or insignia on their uniforms. In total, Barr said federal officials made 51 arrests for crimes connected to \u201cviolent rioting\u201d. The heads of each bureau provided updates. Here are the highlights: Barr said the justice department was conducting a \u201cparallel and independent\u201d investigation in possible federal civil rights violations. FBI director Christopher Wray said the agency had collected evidence that Antifa and \u201cother agitators\u201d were behind some of the violence. Director of US Marshals Donald Washington said there had been damage and vandalism to 21 federal courthouses in 15 states and DC, as well as damage and vandalism to \"many other federal properties\u201d. Acting ATF director Regina Lombardo said her agents had responded to \u201cshootings, burglaries, arson, bombings, especially destructive devices such as a molotov cocktail.\u201d BOP director Michael Carvajal said officers were not told to not identify themselves. He said they normally operate only with their own institutions and therefore don\u2019t need to identify themselves. He added that he probably should have considered marking the officers when they were deployed outside the White House. Our reporter is at the memorial service in Minneapolis, which you can follow in the live stream above: George Floyd\u2019s family arrived to gospel songs from a choir and band under a brightly lit replica of the street mural of Floyd painted on a wall at the site of his death. They sat in the centre of the sanctuary at the North Central University campus in downtown Minneapolis, with most other guests socially distancing at least a seat apart from each others. Mourners included Martin Luther King III and Jesse Jackson; political leaders, including state governor Tim Walz and US senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith; and celebrities including Kevin Hart and Jamie Foxx. The mood outside was sombre. A small group came to remember Floyd, and some held signs demanding justice and reform of the police, but there were no vocal protests. More from the memorial service for George Floyd which is being held in Minneapolis and which you can follow via livestream above: Reggie Jones, 47, travelled up from South Carolina to sell George Floyd T-shirts outside the memorial to raise funds for the victim\u2019s children with the permission of the family. He said he had not seen protests like those that have swept the US over the past week. \u201cSome things are going to change. It\u2019s going to help officers be conscious of their actions. It\u2019s going to allow people to hear us. Hear the cry. This crime right here really punched us in the gut. Not just African Americans but people from all over,\u201d he said. Jones said he was pleased that the three other police officers were charged on Thursday with aiding and abetting Derek Chauvin in the murder of Floyd. \u201cIt was necessary. Four police officers was there. Three of them could have stopped it,\u201d he said. The memorial service for George Floyd is being held in Minneapolis and a livestream is embedded at the top of this blog. Our reporter Chris McGreal is there, as he has been throughout this extraordinary time in the city. Here\u2019s a sample of his report before the service, which follows in full via a link: The eulogy is to be delivered by the civil rights activist the Rev Al Sharpton, who is expected to call for national legislation akin to the 1964 Civil Rights Act to offer greater protections and rights for Americans in dealing with the police. \u201cIt\u2019s not about piecemeal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need fundamental federal laws.\u201d As he went into the service, Sharpton said he was encouraged that so many white people had been demonstrating in support of police reform on a scale not seen before. John Kelly, formerly secretary of homeland security and White House chief of staff, has dismissed Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of James Mattis, the former secretary of defense who on Wednesday night aimed a blistering broadside at the president\u2019s handling of protests over the death of George Floyd. Mattis, a retired Marine Corp general, called Trump \u201cthe first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people \u2013 does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership.\u201d He also compared Trump\u2019s behaviour to Nazi propaganda and called the president\u2019s stunt on Monday, ordering the gassing of peaceful protesters so he could stage a photo op outside St John\u2019s church, an \u201cabuse of executive authority\u201d. Trump tweeted back: \u201cProbably the only thing Barack Obama &amp; I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world\u2019s most overrated General.\u201d Almost as inevitable as the abuse was the fact that the tweet contained a lie. Mattis resigned in December 2018, over Trump\u2019s attempt to withdraw US troops from Syria. Trump brought his departure forward, but didn\u2019t fire him. On Thursday Kelly, like Mattis a retired general though from the Army rather than the Marines, told the Washington Post: \u201cThe president did not fire him. He did not ask for his resignation. The president has clearly forgotten how it actually happened or is confused. The president tweeted a very positive tweet about Jim until he started to see on Fox News their interpretation of his letter. Then he got nasty. Jim Mattis is a honorable man.\u201d Unlike Mattis, Kelly has spoken out about Trump before, backing impeachment witness Lt Col Alexander Vindman and expressing quite wide disagreement. Asked in February why he went to work for Trump in 2017, Kelly said he had been \u201cfascinated \u2013 not necessarily in a good way \u2013 but fascinated as to what that election meant to our country\u201d. Kelly and Mattis have been widely reported to have been \u201cadults in the room\u201d in the first years of the Trump White House, willing to stand up to the president and obstruct his more dangerous impulses. They have also been widely criticised for moves or silences seen to support such behaviour. HR McMaster, another general who was Trump\u2019s second national security adviser, is due out in the autumn with a book that reportedly discusses his work at the White House. He has not commented publicly on the current situation. As George Floyd\u2019s family and invitees, including the Rev Jesse Jackson, arrived for the memorial service in Minneapolis, a small crowd gathered outside to pay respects. It included Maudeline St Jean, a nurse who brought her two sons. \u201cWhen I saw that video of George Floyd\u2019s death, it was so horrific I found myself crying. It\u2019s like a horror movie,\u201d she said. \u201cI came to show support for the family, and the fight for black freedom and ending the suffering of black people. I told my boys, you guys are coming with me. You have to be in this. It\u2019s not going to change if we sit home and watch it on television. We have to be a part of this part.\u201d St Jean said that the US has given her great opportunity but she was shocked by the racism she encountered. \u201cI was born in Liberia, came here 28 years ago. America\u2019s a great country. This is where I got educated. This is where I learned a lot. But there\u2019s 400 years of slavery and the idea that somebody else has the right to tell somebody how they can live. And they have the right to suppress you like they\u2019re your white masters. \u201cWe\u2019re not going back to lynching. That\u2019s what they did to George Floyd. They basically lynched him in front of everybody.\u201d Her 15 year-old son, Zachary, said the thought the most widespread protests the US has seen in half a century mark a turning point. \u201cA big change is going to come,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of change is going to happen. This sparked a lot of stuff in the US. This is going to be for a new generation that\u2019s going to see us. We\u2019re going to be seen, and people will see that black lives do matter. To show we\u2019re not animals. We\u2019re humans too.\u201d Here\u2019s Chris\u2019s full report from Minneapolis: Lauren Gambino in Washington is watching the Department of Justice press conference which is currently being held by Attorney General William Barr, and will be sending in her summary when it\u2019s done. As I get myself on stream, it seems worthwhile to post what White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said when he held a gaggle earlier, a gaggle being a White House ritual where a White House person stops and takes a few questions from a few White House reporters \u2013 collective noun, a lanyard or a grandstand. (Said satirically but with more than a little envy, of course.) Here\u2019s what the pool reporter, Christian Datoc of the Daily Caller, wrote about Gidley\u2019s answer to a question about whether Donald Trump is going to fire Mark Esper, his secretary of defense, who publicly disagreed with the president about the possible deployment of troops to quell unrest: Hogan Gidley took questions for roughly five minutes after his Fox hit. Trump/Esper: \u201cWe\u2019ve had this conversation with y\u2019all many times, and I know there\u2019s a lot of back and forth on these issues. But the President and the Secretary of Defense went yesterday. And as you know, when the President loses confidence, if he loses confidence, you\u2019ll know that.\u201d Here again is Julian Borger, our world affairs editor, on what Esper\u2019s predecessor in the role, James Mattis, had to say about Trump, troops and gassing peaceful protesters in order to stage religiously themed photo ops. Esper, remember, walked with Trump and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Mark Milley to St John\u2019s church on Monday, a fact which Mattis noted: Martin Pengelly here, taking over from Joan E Greve to take you through the afternoon. The New York Times publisher AG Sulzberger is out with a letter to staff who opposed the publication yesterday of an op ed column by Tom Cotton, a Republican senator from Arkansas and former soldier, whose headline baldly stated its argument: Send In The Troops. In the words of Mario Koran\u2019s Guardian report, \u201cNumerous New York Times employees tweeted that \u2018Running this put Black @nytimes staffers in danger\u2019 along with screenshots of Cotton\u2019s piece.\u201d Here\u2019s a chunk of Sulzberger\u2019s letter: The op-ed page exists to offer views from across the spectrum, with a special focus on those that challenge the positions taken by our Editorial Board. We see that as a source of strength, allowing us to provide readers with a diversity of perspectives that is all too rare in modern media. We don\u2019t publish just any argument \u2013 they need to be accurate, good faith explorations of the issues of the day \u2013 and there are many reasons why Op-Eds are denied publication. It is clear many believe this piece fell outside the realm of acceptability, representing dangerous commentary in an explosive moment that should not have found a home in The Times, even as a counterpoint to our own institutional view. I believe in the principle of openness to a range of opinions, even those we may disagree with, and this piece was published in that spirit. Times media reporter Marc Tracy has the full letter: That\u2019s it from me today. Martin Pengelly is going to take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Republican senator Lisa Murkowski said she is struggling with whether to support Trump\u2019s reelection, citing James Mattis\u2019 severe criticism of the president\u2019s response to the George Floyd protests. Murkowski said the former defense secretary\u2019s words were \u201ctrue, honest, necessary and overdue.\u201d A Georgia investigator testified that one of the men who attacked Ahmaud Arbery used a racist slur against him. According to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent in charge of the case, the man who filmed the killing of Arbery said Travis McMichael called the black man a \u201cfucking n-----\u201d after shooting him. The killing of Arbery, who was unarmed and jogging when he was attacked, sparked outcry across the country, which intensified after Floyd was killed. US Navy veteran Michael White has been released from Iran after being detained for nearly two years. White\u2019s release comes amid heightened tensions between the US and Iran due to reimposed sanctions and the killing of Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. Martin will have more coming up, so stay tuned. George Floyd\u2019s body lies in a gold coloured casket surrounded by white flowers at his memorial service in Minneapolis. His portrait is to one side, and a brightly lit street mural dominates the back of the auditorium at North Central University, behind the choir and band. Floyd\u2019s son, brother and sister are expected to be among those attending. The eulogy is to be delivered the civil rights activist, Rev Al Sharpton, who is expected to call for national legislation akin to the 1964 Civil Rights Act to offer stronger protections and rights for Americans in dealing with the police. \u201cIt\u2019s not about piecemeal,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need fundamental federal laws.\u201d As he went into the service, Sharpton said he was encouraged that so many white people had been demonstration in support of police reform on a scale not seen before. After the service, Floyd\u2019s body will be flown to Raeford, North Carolina where he was born for a public viewing and private family service on Saturday. Another public viewing will be held in Houston, where Floyd grew up and lived much of his life, before a private burial. The family of George Floyd and invitees are gathering in Minneapolis for the first of three memorial services across the country scheduled for 1pm central time. But thousands of ordinary people who joined protests over the past week to demand justice for Floyd have been asked to keep away amid concerns about social distancing. Anthony Thornton, a 70 year-old African American computer hardware designer, arrived hours ahead of the service and was the first to set himself up in a beach chair outside. \u201cI have family in DC. They sent me a brand new phone and said, \u2018Dad, go out, bring us some videos.\u2019 So I\u2019m out here to do that and at the end of the day to say I found some peace out of all of this. There\u2019s a lot of destruction all over town,\u201d said Thornton, who boasts he holds the Guinness world record for longest distance a human being has walked backwards in 24 hours. Does he think that the huge protests across the country will bring about significant change? \u201cNo I don\u2019t. I know some form of justice will eventually happen. But it will take many years. We could have the same situation next month,\u201d he said. Republican senator Lisa Murkowski emphasized that she would continue to work with Trump and his administration, even as she struggles with whether to support his reelection. The Alaska Republican said there should not be too much focus on who she would vote for, arguing it would distract from important questions in connection to the George Floyd protests. Murkowski acknowledged some might consider that a \u201cdodge,\u201d but she added, \u201cI think there are important conversations that we need to have as an American people among ourselves, about where we are right now.\u201d Republican senator Lisa Murkowski said she has been struggling with the question of wether to support Trump this year for some time now. \u201cI am struggling with it,\u201d Murkowski told reporters on Capitol Hill. \u201cI have struggled with it for a long time. I think you know that.\u201d The Alaska Republican noted she did not support Trump in the 2016 election, but she said she thought questions about who she would vote for are \u201cdistracting\u201d amid the George Floyd protests. Republican senator Lisa Murkowski said that she is struggling with whether to support Trump in his bid for reelection, citing James Mattis\u2019 criticism of the president. Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, Murkowski applauded Mattis for his excoriating statement about the president\u2019s response to the George Floyd protests. Murkowski said the former defense secretary\u2019s words were \u201ctrue, honest, necessary and overdue,\u201d going on to say she is sruggling with whether to support Trump this year. \u201cPerhaps we\u2019re getting to the point where we can be more honest with the concerns that we might hold internally, and have the courage of our own convictions to speak up,\u201d Murkowski said. In his statement, Mattis said he was \u201cangry and appalled\u201d by Trump\u2019s response to the protests. \u201cDonald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people \u2013 does not even pretend to try,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cInstead he tries to divide us.\u201d Another 1.9 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week as the total number of claims passed 42 million since the coronavirus pandemic hit the US. The pace of layoffs has slowed dramatically from its peak of 6.6m at the start of April as states start to relax quarantine orders and last week was the ninth consecutive week of declines. But the scale of layoffs remains staggeringly high. In the worst week of the last recession \u201cjust\u201d 665,000 people filed for unemployment. Jason Reed, professor of finance at the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Mendoza College of Business, said the numbers may be coming down, but \u201cthis is unprecedented. The figures are so high that it\u2019s hard to grasp the reality.\u201d On Friday the labor department will release May\u2019s monthly jobs report. Economists are predicting unemployment will rise to close to 20% from 14.7% in April and some 8m more jobs will have been lost after a combined drop of 21.4m in March and April. A Georgia investigator testified that one of the men who attacked Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed black man who was fatally shot while jogging in February, used a racist slur against him. According to Richard Dial, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent in charge of the case, the man who filmed the fatal encounter said Travis McMichael called Arbery a \u201cfucking n-----\u201d after shooting him. McMichael apparently made the remark before police arrived on the scene, after shooting Arbery three times. McMichael and his father, Greg McMichael, were arrested last month and have been charged with murder and aggravated assault. Dial testified today during a preliminary hearing in the case, which is meant to determine whether probable cause exists to support the criminal charges. Arbery\u2019s killing sparked protests against police brutality, which intensified after the Memorial Day killing of George Floyd. The two men\u2019s names, along with that of Breonna Taylor, have been chanted many times at protests in recent days. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell offered a message in support of Mark Esper after the White House signaled the defense secretary\u2019s job may be in trouble. \u201cIn these challenging times, the President and the American people are very well-served by the expert advice and principled leadership of people like Secretary Esper and Attorney General Barr,\u201d McConnell said in a tweet. \u201cI appreciate their dedicated work at this difficult time for our nation and their steadfast commitment to their constitutional duties to preserve peace and order, uphold liberty, and protect the American people so they can freely exercise their rights. I am glad President Trump has assembled such an impressive team that is working hard for all Americans.\u201d McConnell\u2019s message could provide a boost for Esper as speculation intensifies over whether the president will dismiss the defense secretary, which could create a very ill-timed cabinet shake-up. Esper said yesterday that he did not support sending active-duty troops to states that have seen George Floyd protests, as Trump has suggested doing. Hours later, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany tip-toed around a question about whether the president still has confidence in Esper. \u201cAs of right now, Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper,\u201d McEnany said. The secretary of the army interestingly sent a tweet about soldiers needing to protect Americans\u2019 right to peaceably assemble, just three days after a group of peaceful protesters near the White House were forcibly removed using tear gas. \u201cEvery Soldier and Department of the Army Civilian swears an oath to support and defend the Constitution. That includes the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances,\u201d secretary of the army Ryan McCarthy said in a tweet. The timing of the tweet was noteworthy, considering Trump has sought to depict the protesters who have demonstrated in response to the killing of George Floyd as violent \u201cthugs.\u201d The tweet also comes one day after defense secretary Mark Esper reversed plans to withdraw active-duty troops froom the DC region, who were deployed in response to the protests. In a bit of good news for the day, US Navy veteran Michael White has been released from Iran after being detained for nearly two years and has started making his way home on a Swiss government aircraft. The AP reports: The U.S. special envoy for Iran, Brian Hook, flew to Zurich with a doctor to meet freed detainee Michael White and will accompany White to the United States aboard an American plane, the officials said. White\u2019s release was part of an agreement involving an Iranian-American doctor prosecuted by the Justice Department, and followed months of quiet negotiations over prisoners. ... \u2018I am blessed to announce that the nightmare is over, and my son is safely in American custody and on his way home,\u2019 White\u2019s mother, Joanne White, said in a statement. She thanked the State Department and Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and onetime New Mexico governor, for raising her son\u2019s case with the Iranians. The news comes amid heightened tensions between the US and Iran due to sanctions reimposed after Trump withdrew support for the 2015 nuclear deal and the killing of Iranian general Qassem Suleimani earlier this year. Republican senator Lindsey Graham said James Mattis had been duped by the \u201cliberal media\u201d after the defense secretary issued an excoriating statement about Trump\u2019s response to the George Floyd protests. During a Fox News interview this morning, the South Carolina senator issued a message directly to Mattis. \u201cI think you\u2019re missing something here, my friend,\u201d Graham said. \u201cYou\u2019re missing the fact that the liberal media has taken every event in the last three and a half years and laid it at the president\u2019s feet. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s blameless, but I am saying that you\u2019re buying into a narrative that I think is, quite frankly, unfair.\u201d Mattis said in his statement that he was \u201cangry and appalled\u201d by how Trump had responded to the protests against police brutality in recent days. \u201cDonald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people \u2013 does not even pretend to try,\u201d Mattis said. \u201cInstead he tries to divide us. We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership.\u201d Of course, Graham had similarly harsh words for Trump during the 2016 campaign, before becoming one of his closest allies. Graham said in December 2015 that a Trump nomination \u201cwould be an utter, complete and total disaster. If you\u2019re a xenophobic, race-baiting, religious bigot, you\u2019re going to have a hard time being president of the United States, and you\u2019re going to do irreparable damage to the party.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Jennifer Rankin reports from Brussels: Belgian activists inspired by the Black Lives Matter protests in the United States have begun a fresh campaign to remove statues of the imperial king Leopold II from the city of Brussels. A group called Repair History has launched a Change.org petition calling on city authorities to remove all statutes of Leopold II, the Belgian King whose brutal and rapacious rule of Congo is estimated to have caused the deaths of 10m Congolese people. The group has called for the statues to be removed by 30 June, the 60th anniversary of Congo\u2019s independence from Belgium. Using the hashtag Black Lives Matter, the petitioners wrote: \u201cA hero for some, but also an executioner for many people. In the space of 23 years this man killed 10m people without stepping foot in Congo. For 23 years, he treated the Congolese people as chattels for the production of rubber, which was very valuable at the time.\u201d The Congo Free State, founded in 1885 as Leopold II\u2019s personal fiefdom, later inspired Joseph Conrad\u2019s novel of imperial horror, Heart of Darkness. The group wrote that the statues had no place in Belgium, or Brussels, estimated to be home to 200 nationalities and often described as the capital of Europe. The Belgian capital has several prominent statues and busts of Leopold II, some of which have been damaged with paint in recent years. One of the main streets close to the national parliament is the Rue des Colonies. The Brussels deputy mayor in charge of heritage Khalid Zian has said the petition will be discussed at the next town meeting on Monday 8 June, the daily newspaper Le Soir reported. NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said active-duty troops were \u201cabsolutely not\u201d necessary to keep the peace in New York, after the president floated the idea of sending troops to states that have seen George Floyd protests. Shea added that Trump\u2019s rhetoric about needing to \u201cdominate\u201d the streets amid the protests was unhelpful. \u201cI think what we need now is coming together,\u201d Shea told CNN, calling for \u201cless divisiveness by many people.\u201d \u201cThere is a lot of anger, there is a lot of rage, but there\u2019s got to be healing. And it\u2019s got to start at every level of society,\u201d Shea said. The commissioner said many officers have been attacked in the past week. \u201cIt is a very dangerous time, and I impress upon everyone: there are problems. But they are not going to get better or be solved by continued violence,\u201d Shea said. The NYPD has been criticized in recent days for their treatment of protesters, with some violent incidents being caught on tape. On Saturday, two police cruisers were filmed driving into a crowd of demonstrators. Shea said the department has made many positive changes in recent years, but he acknowledged, \u201cOne incident ... and unfortunately there\u2019s been more than one incident, can really hurt you here.\u201d New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees has apologized for his lack of \u201ccompassion or empathy\u201d after he said he disagrees with athletes protesting against racism during the national anthem. Brees registered his opposition to the non-violent protest movement launched by Colin Kaepernick during the 2016 NFL season in an interview with Yahoo Finance published on Wednesday. \u201cI will never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag of the United States of America or our country,\u201d the 41-year-old said. \u201cLet me just tell what I see or what I feel when the national anthem is played and when I look at the flag of the United States \u2026 I envision my two grandfathers, who fought for this country during World War II.\u201d The comments, which came in the wake of widespread civil unrest in the US after the police killing of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, sparked immediate backlash. LeBron James, arguably the most high-profile athlete in America, posted his thoughts on Twitter. \u201cYou literally still don\u2019t understand why Kap was kneeling on one knee??\u201d wrote the LA Lakers star on Twitter. \u201cHas absolute nothing to do with the disrespect of [America] and our soldiers( men and women) who keep our land free. My father-in-law was one of those.\u201d On Thursday, Brees issued a lengthy apology on Twitter and Instagram, although he did not mention whether he had changed his views on anthem protests. \u201cIn an attempt to talk about respect, unity, and solidarity centered around the American flag and the national anthem, I made comments that were insensitive and completely missed the mark on the issues we are facing right now as a country,\u201d Brees wrote. \u201cThey lacked awareness and any type of compassion or empathy. Instead, those words have become divisive and hurtful and have misled people into believing that somehow I am an enemy. This could not be further from the truth, and is not an accurate reflection of my heart or my character.\u201d Brees is considered one of the best quarterbacks in NFL history. He is the league\u2019s all-time leader in passing yards and touchdowns. This is Joan Greve, taking over for Joanna Walters. Reverend Al Sharpton offered a hopeful message this morning, after days of protests in response to the killing of George Floyd while in police cusotdy. \u201cOut of all the years that I\u2019ve been marching and protesting and doing eulogies and speeches, I am more hopeful going to this service than I have been in a long time,\u201d Sharpton said on MSNBC. The civil rights activist pointed to the Washington protesters who returned to demonstrate the day after they were tear-gassed near the White House as a sign of Americans\u2019 dedication to change. \u201cThey came back the next day,\u201d Sharpton said. \u201cAnd that makes me knowing that we\u2019re on the brink of real change because it takes sometimes years of investing what a lot of us did before we see the return that is was not for nothing. And I believe we\u2019re at a turning point here.\u201d Sharpton said his eulogy at Floyd\u2019s Minneapolis memorial service this morning would focus on that message of hope and imminent change. The governor of Virginia is expected to announce the removal of a prestigious Confederate monument from the state capitol\u2019s historic Monument Avenue, the AP has reported. Democrat Ralph Northam will hold a press conference at 11am ET, where he is expected to announce the state will remove a massive statue of Confederate General Robert E Lee, and place the statute in storage. The state will then seek a new location for the statue. The statue has become a focal point for protests of police brutality in Virginia, and which have been ongoing since George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man in Minneapolis, died at the hands of police. While Lee\u2019s statue watches over the unrest, demonstrators have covered its massive pedestal in graffiti. Lee was known as the commander of the Southern States in the American Civil war. His likeness in Richmond was installed in 1890, or about 25 years after the end of the war. It was greeted by 10,000 admirers at the time it was installed, the Washington Post reported. Since 2015, activists have urged states to remove Confederate statues from government-owned property, many of which glorify the architects of structural racism in America. Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison spoke out on ABC news this morning to say he is confident of achieving convictions in the cases of the police officers charged in the homicide of George Floyd on May 25. He took over the case at the weekend and charged the three former officers yesterday who were with former officer Derek Chauvin as they tried to arrest Floyd and he ended up dead after Chauvin kneeled on his neck. The three others have been charged with aiding and abetting murder by Chauvin. Traditionally, criminal cases against police officers for deaths committed in the course of their duty are very hard to prosecute and for the prosecutor to win. Juries tend to believe officers and police have wide legal immunity. Proving aiding and abetting will be tough, but Ellison said: \u201cThey helped, you can look at the tapes.\u201d He said the other three can be seen acting \u201cin support of what Chauvin was doing , and what was not done...despite the pleas and cries [from Floyd] they did not help.\u201d He said the officers are culpable and he was confident of conviction. \u201cThis is a social change moment,\u201d he said, to address police brutality and racism and, \u201cbeyond policing, the inadequate housing, racist attitudes, poverty.\u201d Fired Minneapolis police officers Alexander Kueng, 26, Thomas Lane, 37, and Tou Thao, 34, are due to appear in court this afternoon to face charges filed yesterday of aiding and abetting former officer Derek Chauvin in the murder of George Floyd on May 25. The men are at the Hennepin County Jail. Derek Chauvin was charged yesterday with second degree murder after Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison took over the case, an upgrade of the third degree murder charge brought last week by the Hennepin County prosecutor. Chauvin is detained in state prison. Just before the scheduled court appearance today, a memorial service will begin in Minneapolis for George Floyd. The four officers were fired on May 26, the day after Chauvin kneeled on 46-year-old Floyd\u2019s neck as he was pinned to the street, for almost nine minutes. The death has been ruled a homicide by two autopsies, one official, one private carried out at the request of Floyd\u2019s family. Protests continue across the country, with many demonstrators echoing some of Floyd\u2019s dying words, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and staging die-ins for eight minutes 46 seconds, the length of time Chauvin, who is white, kneeled on the African-American man\u2019s neck during an arrest. Kueng was seen on video taken by a witness pressing on Floyd\u2019s back, while Lane pinned his legs. Thao stood alongside and warned bystanders against intervening. A family memorial service will take place for George Floyd today at 1pm CDT in Minneapolis. All four police officers involved in his killing are now in custody and facing charges Protests continued overnight, but with seemingly less violence overall. Some cities were scaling back their response - Seattle is cancelling a planned curfew However, New Orleans police confirm they used tear gas, and there was violence in New York injuring protestors and the police AP figures put the number of arrests so far in protests about the killing to be 10,000 nationwide Barack Obama offered words of hope and optimism about the future Former defence secretary James Mattis launched an extraordinary attack on the president over his handling of the protests, accusing him of dividing the US Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, has spoken out over the killing of George Floyd, telling pupils at her old high school \u201cI am so sorry that you have to grow up in the world where this is still present.\u201d I\u2019m signing off now from London, and handing over to my colleagues in the US. Thank you for reading the live blog - you can find all of our George Floyd coverage here - and I hope you have a safe day. Writer and Yale PhD candidate Philip V McHarris has written a blistering opinion piece for us today about the situation that has led the country to the grief, protests and violence seen over the last few days: It\u2019s far less likely that we would be witnessing the widespread, multiracial rebellion that we are seeing today if Black communities \u2013 and all other marginalized communities \u2013 had the resources to thrive, weren\u2019t brutalized and killed by police, and had access to free healthcare, a universal basic income, safe and comfortable housing, dignified work and quality schools. No amount of law and order can repress the desire to live full lives, where people\u2019s basic needs are met, and their lives are not plagued by routine violence and cut short by premature death. It is well worth reading in full: The George Floyd protests \u2013 and riots \u2013 are a rebellion against an unjust system The first of three memorial services for George Floyd will be held today in Minneapolis, with all of the police officers involved in his death now in custody and facing charges, Renowned civil rights leader Rev. Al Sharpton and the Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump will be among the speakers at the event today. Floyd\u2019s body will then go to Raeford in North Carolina, where he was born, for a two-hour public viewing and private service for the family on Saturday. Finally, a public viewing will be held Monday in Houston, where he was raised and lived most of his life. A 500-person service on Tuesday will take place at The Fountain of Praise church and will include addresses from Sharpton, Crump, and the Rev. Remus E. Wright. There will be a private burial. The Greek capital Athens, no newcomer to a protest or two, saw thousands of supporters of anti-racist, leftist and anarchist groups take to the streets late Wednesday. As in the northern city of Thessaloniki the night before, many held banners emblazoned with the words \u201cno justice no peace\u201d and \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d as they marched on the US embassy before stone-pelting demonstrators prompted riot police to aggressively disperse the crowd with copious rounds of tear gas. Organisers told the Guardian similar protests are now being planned nationwide before a massive demonstration, in conjunction with anti-facist groups across Europe and the US, is held on 26 June. \u201cWe want to show our solidarity. There will be more,\u201d said Petros Constantinou, a municipal councillor who also heads the anti-rascist, anti-fascist KEERFA movement. The killing of George Floyd in many ways has reminded Greeks of the fatal shooting of an unarmed teenage boy in downtown Athens in December 2008. That shooting spurred mass protests - and riots - across Greece as hundreds of thousands spontaneously took to the streets to decry police brutality. \u201cMore than 120 police stations were attacked back then nationwide,\u201d Constantinou recalled. \u201cIt was the beginning of the economic crisis in Greece, the social context was very similar to that in the US today and there was a lot of institutionalised racism especially among the police which helped create Golden Dawn,\u201d he added referring to the anti-immigrant neo-Nazi group whose hit squads spawned fear on the streets for years to come. On Wednesday night much of central Athens - on the boulevarde that runs from the capital\u2019s main Syntagma Square to the US embassy - was daubed with graffiti in support of US protestors. CBS News this morning has been publicising a poll they have conducted about race relations in the US, which shows sharply deteriorating figures from their previous studies. 57% of Americans, according to the poll, think police are more likely to use deadly force against a black person than a white person, which is up from 43% back in 2016. In total, 42% of people polled thought race relations were getting worse, and 61% of people though race relations were \u201cgenerally bad\u201d. Not surprisingly, white respondents tended to be less pessimistic about the situation. There\u2019s more detail on the poll here: Americans\u2019 views shift on racial discrimination - CBS News poll Coronavirus restrictions have led to the cancellation of three proposed protest rallies in Norway over the killing of George Floyd. Associated press reports that rallies were planned in Oslo, Bergen and Trondheim but local authorities said that without permission, no more than 50 people can gather in one place. Mohamed Awil, president of the African Student Association co-organising the demonstration said more than 15,000 people had said they planned to take part in Thursday\u2019s demonstration outside the US Embassy. A smaller demonstration is now proposed, which will involve a much smaller group forming a chain and marching to the US embassy. The photos coming in from around the world show the truly global impact that the killing of George Floyd has had. Here are some of the best pictures in so far today from Africa and across Europe: Speaking of the election campaign, the president is up and about and on a tweeting spree that includes a dig at rival Joe Biden. One of the significant victories for the protest movement yesterday was the announcement that Virginia governor Ralph Northam plans to order the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue in Richmond. The memorial to one of the commanders in the Confederate States Army has been a focal point of protests. In 1975, Biden was part of a unanimous Senate vote to restore citizenship to Lee, 110 years after the general surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant. Trump has also been retweeting several posts by activist and author Charlie Kirk including attacks on Elizabeth Warren. Trump has also again vocally defended Roger Stone - convicted in 2019 of lying to Congress, tampering with a witness and obstructing the House investigation - describing him as \u201ca victim of a corrupt and illegal Witch Hunt, one which will go down as the greatest political crime in history.\u201d The coronavirus outbreak and the outpouring of public protest and grief over the killing of George Floyd have taken place against the backdrop of the build-up to November\u2019s election. My colleague Lauren Gambino in Washington has been looking at whether Joe Biden has enough about him to convince protesters he would be a \u2018transformational\u2019 president? A Monmouth University poll found more Americans trusted Biden than Trump to handle race relations in the country. Fifty-two per cent said they have a great deal or some confidence in Biden\u2019s ability to address the issue while only 40% said they felt the same about the president. Jabari Nyomba, 30, was among a crowd of thousands that circled the Barclays Center in Brooklyn to protest police brutality, chanting \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and carrying signs that memorialized George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery. \u201cWe\u2019re tired of institutional racism,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re tired of seeing our brothers and sisters getting killed by the ones that are supposed to serve and protect us. I\u2019ve just had enough.\u201d You can read Lauren\u2019s piece in full here: Can Joe Biden convince protesters he would be a \u2018transformational\u2019 president? Martin Luther King\u2019s daughter Bernice King has overnight posted criticism of New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Bees. He faced a backlash for repeating his claim that he will \u2018never agree\u2019 with protests during the national anthem. Bernice King tweeted a series of images of white people doing the so-called \u2018George Floyd challenge\u2019 social media trend, and told him \u201cThis is the kneeling Drew should be bothered by.\u201d Hi, welcome to our US politics live blog which, as with most of the last nine days, will no doubt be dominated by the protests in the wake of the killing of George Floyd. Here are the key points today so far: Protests continued overnight, but with seemingly less violence overall. Some cities were scaling back their response - Seattle is cancelling a planned curfew However, New Orleans police confirm they used tear gas, and there was violence in New York injuring protestors and the police AP figures put the number of arrests so far in protests about the killing to be 10,000 nationwide Barack Obama offered words of hope and optimism about the future Former defence secretary James Mattis launched an extraordinary attack on the president over his handling of the protests, accusing him of dividing the US Meghan Markle, Duchess of Sussex, has spoken out over the killing of George Floyd, telling pupils at her old high school \u201cI am so sorry that you have to grow up in the world where this is still present.\u201d Donald Trump has got a fairly empty diary ahead of him today - he receives an intelligence briefing at 3pm, and then we are expecting an executive order on \u201cexpediting permitting\u201d at 4:30pm. I\u2019m Martin Belam in London, and I\u2019ll be running this live blog for the next couple of hours before handing over to my colleagues in New York.

distancing. </p> \n  <p>He labelled the argument \u201cfutile\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Fagan also acknowledged the right to protest and the importance of the Black Lives Matter protest in drawing attention to the treatment of Indigenous Australians at the hands of police, but reasoned that many Australians had had to forfeit rights during the pandemic, including to attend church and forfeiting their livelihoods. </p> \n  <p>Organisers had previously indicated they and supporters would attend the protest regardless of the legal decision.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time

The rules were due to apply from 21 September or a date to be fixed by the secretary.</p> \n  <p>Allowable absences are an integral part of the old subsidy model \u2013 they define reasons children can be absent that won\u2019t result in reduced subsidies to parents. They\u2019re less relevant under the temporary free system, as the government stopped caring about the whys and wherefores of children not attending care.</p> \n  <p>We can\u2019t be sure the 13 July date is when the free system will snap back to something resembling the old subsidy model.

      "bodyText": "Thanks for staying with us. We\u2019re going to leave for the today. Before that, here are today\u2019s main developments. The NSW supreme court ruled tomorrow\u2019s Black Lives Matter protest in Sydney will be unlawful due to Covid-19 restrictions. The PM Scott Morrison and CMO Brendan Murphy earlier urged people not to attend due to Covid restrictions, but protesters are vowing to push ahead and say they will do their best to enforce social distancing. Protests will also go ahead in Victoria and South Australia. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Thanks. Speaking outside court, assistant commissioner Michael Willing has warned there will be a \u201csignificant\u201d police presence at Saturday\u2019s rally. \u201cPolice will be out in numbers to enforce that decision,\u201d Willing said. Asked how police would respond if thousands turned out, he said: \u201cWe will consider any option, we have sufficient resources and expertise.\u201d \u201cWe will have significant police resources out.\u201d Organisers of the Sydney protest have gathered outside court vowing the protest will go ahead on Saturday. The NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge, who was a witness during the legal challenge, said he will be attending on Saturday, and urged social distancing for all those who attend. Raul Bassi, the protest organiser and legal respondent on Friday, said the decision would not impact the right to protest. \u201cI never lose my decision to fight for what is true...Tomorrow we meet in there,\u201d he said. The NSW Supreme Court has ruled a Black Lives Matters protest scheduled in Sydney on Saturday is illegal as it will breach public health safety. Justice Desmond Fagan ultimately assessed there would be a public safety risk in allowing the protest to go ahead, likening it to a \u201cdefiance\u201d of decisions made by ministers and the expert health advice those decisions were based on. Fagan said he did not accept the argument of lawyers representing the protest organisers that people would attend the rally regardless of the legal decision, and that in that case, it would be safest for the public to have the cooperation of police to close of streets and allow for greater space for social distancing. He labelled the argument \u201cfutile\u201d. Fagan also acknowledged the right to protest and the importance of the Black Lives Matter protest in drawing attention to the treatment of Indigenous Australians at the hands of police, but reasoned that many Australians had had to forfeit rights during the pandemic, including to attend church and forfeiting their livelihoods. Organisers had previously indicated they and supporters would attend the protest regardless of the legal decision. In his judgment, Fagan said he did not accept arguments from lawyers for the protesters that if he banned the demonstration, thousands of people would turn up anyway. The NSW Supreme Court has denied permission for Black Lives Matter protesters to demonstrate in Sydney tomorrow. Justice Desmond Fagan accepted a request from the NSW police that the proposed protest be considered unlawful. \u201cI cannot accept that these proposals ... should take the place of the public health order which applies to all citizens,\u201d he said. The current rules in NSW allow gatherings of no more than 10 people. Fagan described the protest as an \u201cunreasonable proposition\u201d given the current social distancing restrictions. The Age newspaper in Melbourne has issued an apology for its front page story this morning, which claimed without evidence that Black Lives Matter protesters had threatened \u201cpolice command with spitting, inflammatory chanting and other forms of physical abuse\u201d ahead of tomorrow\u2019s demonstration. After significant backlash, the paper said in a \u201cclarification\u201d added to a re-written version of the story: The headline and opening paragraphs of the original version of this story reported concerns within the Victorian Government about the potential for some activists to provoke physical confrontation with police during planned protests. The story fell short of The Age\u2019s editorial values and standards and caused understandable offence to many members of the community. The claim that some activists had threatened police with spitting and abuse was not backed up beyond one unnamed senior government source. The story put undue emphasis on these claims. The main organisers of the rally, the Warriors of the Aboriginal Resistance, clearly stated that they had no knowledge of any threats to police. The Age apologises. To give you an idea of how last minute this legal challenge was, the lights in the court room have just turned off automatically. It\u2019s 6.40pm, 3 hours and 10 minutes after we started. The last-ditch nature of the challenge was also apparent earlier in the afternoon, when lawyers representing the police were still printing off legal documents in the courtroom after Justice Fagan had begun proceedings. Justice Desmond Fagan is taking \u201c20-25 minutes\u201d to consider whether to allow Saturday\u2019s Black Lives Matter protest in Sydney. Lawyers representing the organisers of the protest have relied on the argument that the protest will ultimately be safer if it has police endorsement, so the roads can be closed and more space allowed for protesters to socially distance. Emmanuel Kerkyasharian, representing the protest organiser, said people will turn up to the protest regardless of the court decision, and would be forced to march on footpaths if roads were not closed for them. He argued this will lead to a greater danger of transmission. Justice Fagan has said such an assumption diminishes the police commissioner\u2019s concerns, and that if he rules the protest should not go ahead, it is not taking away the political right to protest, just deferring it. Over in the NSW Supreme Court, Justice Desmond Fagan just adjourned the court for 20-25 minutes while he determines his decision. He says he will hand down the decision and give his reasons at the same time. However, these comments are worth noting. The NSW chief health officer, Kerry Chant, is asked about the decision to allow spectators in corporate boxes at NRL matches, and its relevance to Saturday\u2019s proposed protest. Emmanuel Kerkyasharian, representing the protest organiser, informed the court of the NRL spectator decisions. \u201cIt\u2019s been announced while we\u2019re sitting here.\u201d Chant tells the court the NRL measure only applies to corporate boxes as they are deemed comparable to restaurants and pubs. Asked if Friday\u2019s measure will allow spectators to sit in stands, Chant said \u201ccertainly not within NSW\u201d. Chant has also told the court that gatherings and crowds of the scale expected at Saturday\u2019s protest can lead to the transmission of Covid-19. She said it\u2019s likely there are undiagnosed Covid-19 cases in the community, and warns they may not even have symptoms yet but could still spread the virus at the rally \u201cShould there be a person who attends the event [the protest] who may have symptoms or may be in a situation where they are going to develop symptoms in subsequent days, would be considered infectious and they may well transmit through close contact and that would lead to the risk of transmission,\u201d Chant said. She was asked if she could estimate how many Covid-19 positive people would likely be present at the protest, but she said she could not. The hearing at the NSW Supreme Court is continuing. The NSW Dr Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant is now being called to give evidence. They are still going in the NSW supreme court. The protest organiser Raul Bassi has just completed his evidence. The NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge has been now been called. AAP reports that the NSW government\u2019s decision today on crowds at NRL games relates to corporate boxes. The state government told the NRL on Friday corporate boxes would fall into the same category as pubs and clubs pending the approval of a biosecurity plan. It means each corporate room will be able to have one person per four square metres from next weekend, with up to 50 people allowed per box. Venues such as Bankwest Stadium have multiple boxes and lounges that can be split into different sections on top of their corporate boxes, meaning the number of attendees could be able to climb much higher. The move will allow club sponsors to return to matches, with the ruling applied only to food and drink areas such as corporate suites. The rules will only apply to NSW-based matches. The ARL Commission chairman, Peter V\u2019landys, is still hopeful of club members then being able to return as part of capped crowds from 1 July. \u201cWe\u2019re very pleased the government have corrected the anomaly, because this was allowed in pubs, clubs and racecourses but not sports stadiums,\u201d V\u2019landys told AAP. Hi everyone, Luke Henriques-Gomes here, taking over from Naaman Zhou. Thanks to Naaman for his work today. I\u2019ll steer you through until stumps tonight. We\u2019re still awaiting a decision from the NSW supreme court about whether tomorrow\u2019s Black Lives Matter protest in Sydney can go ahead. Bizarre stuff here. As the court hears from Raul Bassi, the organiser of Saturday\u2019s planned protest in Sydney, about his credentials organising \u201cthe three biggest protests in solidarity with Aboriginal people in this city\u201d, the NSW chief health officer, Kerry Chant, appears on TV screens around the court room. It appears police have arranged for her to provide her opinion on the public health repercussions of the event. Justice Fagan tells Chant she has interrupted the proceedings, and she disappears from the screens. Some breaking news. The NSW government has just given permission for NRL fans to watch live games in stadiums, effective next week, as long as physical distancing is adhered to. A light moment while the court has briefly adjourned. Lawyers for police have moved onto a different point, arguing notice for the assembly was not given with seven days\u2019 notice. Lawyers representing the organisers argue that the original notice of assembly \u2013 for 50 people in a different part of Sydney \u2013 was given with seven days\u2019 notice. Justice Desmond Fagan said he can\u2019t take notice for the first iteration of the protest as notice for the revised protest that is scheduled for Saturday \u2013 where organisers say 5,000 people will attend. NSW Police are attempting to have the Black Lives Matter march scheduled in Sydney on Saturday ruled illegal on a technicality, because the notice of assembly documents for the protest were not signed by the organisers. Lawyers representing police are arguing that none of the three notices of assembly filed for the event \u2013 which was originally scheduled to be smaller and in a different part of Sydney \u2013 make the notices invalid. The court heard the most recent assembly notice for a protest 5,000 people in Town Hall on Saturday, was given to police on 4 June - yesterday. The court proceedings are still ongoing. Organisers of the rally in Melbourne, Warriors of the Aboriginal Resistance, held a short press conference this afternoon and indicated the protest would proceed tomorrow at state parliament, despite warnings from Victoria police that people could be fined for breaching public health orders around large gatherings. \u201cEvery time we rally, the state and the police attempt to stop us,\u201d Meriki Onus said. \u201cProtest is not a choice when so many of our people are murdered at the hands of police and prison guards.\u201d She said safety was paramount and protesters had been asked to wear a mask, bring hand sanitiser and use it regularly, to remain 1.5 metres apart, and to not protest in groups larger than 20, while remaining 1.5 metres apart in those groups. However, jobs will still be lost at AAP, with only up to 95 jobs available to current AAP staff. The Australian Associated Press newswire will be sold to a consortium of \u201cimpact investors and philanthropists\u201d, with a contract to be complete in mid-June. The supreme court ruling on Saturday\u2019s protest in Sydney is imminent. Submissions are being made in court right now. Western Australia now has a total of 30 active coronavirus cases, after a family of four tested positive after returning from overseas, AAP reports. The 30 people consist of nine locals, one person from interstate and 20 crew from the Al Kuwait livestock ship. None are in hospital. The mother of David Dungay, an Indigenous man who who said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 12 times before he died in jail in 2015, has said she will protest the treatment of Indigenous people in custody on Saturday regardless of the legality of the march. \u201cI\u2019m marching for my son ... the nurses and doctors put my son under ground, and I\u2019m going to walk on it,\u201d Leetona Dungay said. Indigenous elders and organisers of the Sydney Black Lives Matter protest scheduled for Saturday gathered outside the NSW supreme court on Friday afternoon before it heard a challenge from NSW police. The police have launched a last-ditch effort to have Saturday\u2019s protest called off over fears the large assembly \u2013 expected to be in the thousands \u2013 would risk spreading Covid-19. Maria Clague, an Indigenous activist, who is not an organiser of Saturday\u2019s protest, said \u201cwe\u2019d like police to work with us not against us\u201d. \u201cYou will not silence us ... We support George Floyd ... and everyone standing up for Aboriginal people,\u201d Clague said. The NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge was also in attendance at the press conference. Organisers of the Sydney protest have held a press conference outside the New South Wales supreme court to oppose the NSW police\u2019s decision to take the protest to court. \u201cWe have a right to gather on our country,\u201d says Aunty Rhonda Dixon-Grosvenor. \u201cWe have a right to speak, and a right to express ourselves as human beings. \u201cWe have lost so much. We were the first people to be affected with colonisation. The first stolen generation, and we will stand up for our rights as equal human beings.\u201d Faith Black, who was scheduled to MC the protest tomorrow, says: \u201cThere have been so many deaths uncovered during the royal commission and nobody has ever been held accountable. Now that there is worldwide recognition of how black people are being treated, we are taking that opportunity to bring deaths in custody to the forefront. We were just being accused of being militant. We are not militant people. We are a peaceful loving nation, we always have been. We have traditional custodianship over this land and we want to work with you. We expect that in return. Greg Hunt says that the protest is \u201cdoubly dangerous\u201d to Indigenous elders who attend the Black Lives Matter and Indigenous Lives Matter protests around the country tomorrow. We know that Indigenous Australians, as a general principle, have higher comorbidities, lower life expectancy. That is one of our great tasks. It would be a terrible irony if, as we pursue the national goal of increasing the health of Indigenous Australians, there is a protest which put that health at risk. There may well be many people associated with Indigenous Australia and if they attend a mass gathering, they then risk taking that back to their elders and their elderly. Victoria police have issued a statement on fines for tomorrow\u2019s Melbourne protest. They say they will not fine \u201cthousands of people\u201d on the day, and want the protest to be peaceful. But they will fine the organisers, and \u201cother persons\u201d, after the protest is over, if it is found to breach health orders. Claims in the media this week that Victoria police will not be issuing infringement notices to people who breach chief health officer directions at tomorrow\u2019s planned protest in the CBD are wrong. In the exercise of police discretion, those who intentionally break the law will be held to account, and we have again contacted the organisers of the protest this morning to ensure this point is understood. It is our strong preference that the protest does not occur at this time, while the restrictions in relation to public gatherings remain in place. If it is to proceed then it must be conducted in a manner which does not breach the chief health officer directions. We have also been clear that it would not be practical to issue infringements to thousands of persons congregating for a protest. We wish to keep the protest a peaceful one. That said, after the event and as per other recent protests, we will assess the evidence of the protest and if it did breach CHO guidelines we will not hesitate to issue infringement notices to the organisers. We will also consider other persons whom it may be appropriate to infringe. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, is also urging people not to attend protests. It is fundamentally important for people to be able to express their democratic right. But a mass gathering whether it is a protest or a football match ... at this time is not safe. It undermines and risks all of the work that Australians have done to save lives and protect lives. Any mass gathering at this time is a lottery with peoples\u2019 lives. Murphy: What we know is that one person, one high viral load person, can infect 30 to 40 people. We have seen that in Australia. One person infecting 35 people at a wedding. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, is speaking now. He says that he and the other state health officers have put out a statement \u201cexpressing our serious concerns\u201d about mass gatherings and protests. A mass gathering, even if people try to make it safe by trying to practise distancing and hand hygiene, is inherently dangerous because people can\u2019t really keep apart. They can\u2019t stop touching each other. We don\u2019t know who is there. We can\u2019t contract trace. Avoid mass gatherings. The Labor MP Amanda Rishworth has said that the government is leaving people \u201cin limbo\u201d with the uncertainty around childcare. \u201cDespite the government flagging that the current arrangements would end on 28 June, and the minister promising he would give four weeks\u2019 notice of any change, we still haven\u2019t heard a peep from the government about its plan after the current scheme ends,\u201d she said in a statement. Rishworth said that the current free childcare scheme had left out many families, and had negatively impacted quality of care, but that returning to the old system was also \u201cnot the answer\u201d. \u201cLabor calls on the government to act urgently and properly fund and implement a system that delivers affordable, high quality and accessible early education and care for all Australian families,\u201d she said. Friday afternoon has become a bit of a dumping ground for policy backflips and embarrassing announcements: a fortnight ago it was the $60bn jobkeeper costing error, last week it was the $721m robodebt refund. Will we be getting a Friday surprise today as well? Earlier, at the press conference, Scott Morrison was asked about free childcare, which the education minister, Dan Tehan, has signalled must come to an end as the economy reopens and more children return to care. Morrison said that centres \u201care keen to move back to a more normal arrangement\u201d and \u201cwe will be in a position in the not too distant future to make further announcements about that\u201d. So far \u2013 a pretty good candidate for the Friday surprise. Then we spotted a legislative instrument, registered on Friday, in which the education department secretary nominated 13 July as the date at which new rules on allowable absences from childcare will apply. The rules were due to apply from 21 September or a date to be fixed by the secretary. Allowable absences are an integral part of the old subsidy model \u2013 they define reasons children can be absent that won\u2019t result in reduced subsidies to parents. They\u2019re less relevant under the temporary free system, as the government stopped caring about the whys and wherefores of children not attending care. We can\u2019t be sure the 13 July date is when the free system will snap back to something resembling the old subsidy model. But it\u2019s a pretty big bread crumb in the trail. We will know in the \u201cnot too distant future\u201d. Meanwhile, here are the images from a protest in Canberra today. In Western Australia, the premier, Mark McGowan, is announcing huge liftings of restrictions in the state. Full-contact competitive sport will be allowed from tomorrow, and gyms can reopen. Western Australians will also be allowed back onto Rottnest Island. \u201cUp to 300 people will be allowed in some settings, and there\u2019s a capacity to apply for exemptions for more,\u201d McGowan says. \u201cIndoor and outdoor venues with multiple divided spaces are able to have a hundred people in each space.\u201d Galleries, museums, the TAB and zoos can also reopen. This just in from AAP. Victoria police will fine protesters if more than 20 people attend. Meanwhile, the South Australian police commissioner, Grant Stevens, has allowed a Black Lives Matter and Indigenous Lives Matter protest to go ahead in Adelaide on Saturday. Stevens has granted an exemption to Covid-19 restrictions so that protesters can gather and march. But he says the protest must still abide by physical distancing rules. Fuller says that online attendance showed 10,000 people were attending on Facebook. \u201cWe know that is not always accurate,\u201d he says. But it is \u201cwell above\u201d the original application. He says the protest could theoretically go ahead \u201cif the organisers had two individual protests running at once with 500 people\u201d. \u201cBut how can you control how many people turn up once it gets up to 10,000 potential hits? [Organisers] confirmed they were unable to control it. They refused to rescind their application to protest, which resulted in us going to the supreme court. \u201cIf 501 turn up, we could give them a direction to leave. If they refuse, we can arrest them, or arrest them and give them a caution or a court attendance notice, or a $1,000 fine. \u201cIf we are put in the corner tomorrow, we will make arrests.\u201d Fuller says that if the supreme court rules in favour of the protest it can go ahead with 500 attendees. But if more attend, then it will depend on the circumstances on the day. Berejiklian says she gives Fuller \u201ca million per cent\u201d support. Fuller says protests in groups of 10 are allowed under the health order, but that if the supreme court outlaws the protest, a gathering of hundreds would be illegal. If 10 people turn up in Pitt Street tomorrow, we wish them well. But if hundreds and thousands of people turn up, then they\u2019re in breach of the health order and if they haven\u2019t complied with the supreme court, then obviously all of the police powers available to us can be used. But we would much rather see a peaceful outcome. I think Sydneysiders are more mature than what we\u2019ve seen in the press. We\u2019re not saying you can never protest again, it\u2019s just not the right time at the moment. Berejiklian then speaks directly to those intending to attend. I\u2019m asking, appealing and pleading with those thousands of people who\u2019ve indicated they\u2019re turning up to a protest \u2013 please do not do it. Stay at home. Express yourself in a different way. Fuller clarifies that the protest organisers did get all their paperwork in on time. If they submit the appropriate documentation, known as a Form 1, protests get protection from the Summary Offences Act, which means we can\u2019t use a lot of our powers that we normally would in a public unlawful gathering. In this case, the Form 1 was submitted in the appropriate amount of time, which means if the organisers refuse to stop the protest, then the only way forward is for the supreme court to make the ultimate decision in relation to that. The NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, says he lodged an injunction because the numbers of those attending the protest kept growing online. \u201cThe NSW police every year facilitates nearly a thousand protests in the Sydney CBD alone,\u201d he says. \u201cThis protest, in particular, has grown in numbers. \u201cWe also view social media closely. As of the morning, that had escalated to potentially 10,000 protesters turning up. And the organiser, himself, admitted that he couldn\u2019t ensure that the protesters could adhere to \u2026 the current health orders. \u201cThis morning we commenced legal action ... Regardless of that, we had been pre-planning for this protest like we do any other, regardless of the outcome of the supreme court application.\u201d Berejiklian said that the protest\u2019s request had \u201csubstantially changed\u201d. \u201cWhen a protest organisation cannot guarantee that those participating in the protest will adhere to social distancing, that is deemed an illegal act. \u201cIf you feel so strongly about an issue during a pandemic, please consider expressing your views in a different way. \u201cAt no stage did the NSW government support or give the green light, or give the go-ahead for thousands and thousands of people flagrantly, flagrantly, breaching the health rules.\u201d The health minister, Brad Hazzard, says this is \u201cnot political, it is about health\u201d. He says that NSW has a limit of 500 people outside. NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian has said that she supports the police application to make Saturday\u2019s Black Lives Matter and Indigenous Lives Matter protest illegal. The NSW police have applied for an injunction in the supreme court to make the protest illegal. That result will be known in the afternoon. Berejiklian says that police have ways to ensure social distancing during large gatherings, but that the attendance grew too high for Saturday\u2019s protest for organisers to guarantee that. The premier says: I spoke to the commissioner and it became abundantly clear that police would not be able to assure the maintenance of those health ordsers, that the number of protesters far exceeded what the initial request was. The police commissioner and I discussed the fact that the police commissioner would apply to the supreme court to have the intended protest tomorrow that was intended to go ahead deemed illegal. In Victoria, the CEO of the state\u2019s peak body for Aboriginal health has shared advice to protestors on Saturday for keeping safe from Covid-19. \u201cWe must take a harm minimisation approach to the rally,\u201d says Jill Gallagher, the CEO of The Victorian Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (VACCHO). Australia has a dark history of colonial oppression like the USA ... Australia is starting to reckon its past, and tell the truth, and we think that is a huge step in right direction. We support a peaceful protest of collective action and our approach is one of harm minimisation. If you can\u2019t attend that\u2019s OK, you will have the ability to show solidarity and support via livestream. [Warriors of the Aboriginal Resistance] will live-stream the event via their Facebook. This is a peaceful protest with strength and purpose. Gallagher says the advice of VACCHO and Victorian Aboriginal elders is to stay home if you are unwell. While the police are acknowledging the pain and suffering our community is facing. And respecting our communities right to peacefully protest, this must be done safely and in trying to reduce the transmission of Covid-19. Remember to keep a safe distance of 1.5 meters apart at all times. Be sensible. Peacefully protest but do this lawfully. Hygiene and personal equipment are critical to reduce the risk and stop the spread of Covid \u2013 wear face masks, bring sanitisers, and wash your hands. Stay deadly. Stay safe. She adds that Aboriginal organisations have already done an exceptional job in limiting the spread of the virus. \u201cThe fact that we have only had six cases in our community, shows us what we ALREADY know, which is that Aboriginal Community Control works.\u201d NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge has labelled the NSW police decision to take the protest to court \u201cseriously unhelpful\u201d. \u201cWhatever the police say, thousands of people will attend tomorrow,\u201d he says. \u201cThe choice for the police is to work collaboratively to make this assembly safe, socially distanced and peaceful or to keep going down the same aggressive path that got us here in the first place. \u201cWhat\u2019s needed now is cooperation, understanding and peacefully working together, not court orders and the implicit threat of more police violence.\u201d Earlier today, the NSW police minister David Elliott also said that the rallies on Saturday were \u201cnot my kind of cause\u201d and that people who attend were \u201cnot of sound mind\u201d. NSW treasurer Dominic Perrottet also opposed the protest and said that \u201cas a father of six kids I go home to a mass protest every day\u201d. NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge has confirmed that the NSW police are going to the state\u2019s supreme court to try and call off a Black Lives Matter and Indigenous Lives Matter rally planned for tomorrow. Northern Territory chief minister Michael Gunner is speaking now. He says the NT will wait to see how southern states go over the next few weeks to decide when to re-open its borders. \u201cWe are looking at what happens in the south. New South Wales and Victoria are going from stage one to stage two in the next few weeks ... We are looking at the community transmission rate down south and how they control any outbreaks. What no one knows yet is how they will handle it from step one to step two.\u201d Finally, Morrison is asked whether it is an \u201cembarrassment\u201d that people could be able to go on holiday to Queenstown in New Zealand before they could go to Queensland. He says he hopes that Queensland and WA will drop their border closures by July, which is consistent with the national framework released a few weeks ago. \u201cFor people in Victoria, NSW and the ACT, I\u2019m sure they would like to see a bit of Queensland sunshine, and Western Australian sunshine,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope states would make decisions consistent with that national cabinet timetable.\u201d The government is preparing the ground to make the $70bn jobkeeper wage subsidy less generous after a Treasury review in June. Under consideration are: Limiting the subsidy to the hardest-hit industries Limiting the subsidy to businesses that are still experiencing the requisite 30% or 50% (for larger companies) downturn in revenue Agreeing to Labor\u2019s calls to wind back the payment for people who normally earn less than $1,500 a fortnight. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, has been out defending the prospect of changes midway through the program, by arguing the government has always said there would be a review. On Wednesday, he told Radio National Drive: \u201cWe always said when we put the jobkeeper program out there that there would be a review about halfway through.\u201d And on Friday, he told Sky News: \u201cAs we\u2019ve said right from the outset there is a review halfway through.\u201d The only problem is: this is not correct. There was no mention of a Treasury review when the program was announced on 30 March \u2013 not in the media release or the press conference with Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg. Legislation for the wage subsidy included a review by the attorney general\u2019s department of various workplace relations aspects of the plan \u2013 such as employers\u2019 ability to stand down workers to trigger eligibility for the payment \u2013 but no mention of a Treasury review. The first mention I can find is on 8 May, when Morrison said: \u201cThere\u2019s a review built into jobkeeper to be done before the end of June.\u201d That set the hares running that the subsidy could be wound back. Labor asked at the Covid-19 Senate committee \u2013 and Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy said Treasury had always known there\u2019d be a three month review but he wasn\u2019t sure when it was announced. The reason this matters is: businesses planned on the basis the program would last at least six months and it wasn\u2019t until five weeks into the scheme the government said payments could be cut mid-stream. The scheme is generous, maybe it should be pared back \u2013 but the least the government can do is not rewrite history that we have always known this. Morrison is also asked whether it is \u201ca national shame\u201d that there have been at least 432 Indigenous deaths in custody since 1991. He is also asked if the government has to do more \u2013 given only two-thirds of the recommendations have been implemented from the royal commission into deaths in custody. He says it is a shame, and that governments are working on the Closing the Gap initiatives. \u201cIn Australia we understand the problems we have in this area ... All Australians share these concerns. And so I don\u2019t diminish them for a second. \u201cBut what I do say is that Australia is not other places. So let\u2019s deal with this as Australians\u201d. Morrison is asked whether people should stay away from Black Lives Matter and Indigenous Lives Matter protests on the weekend. He says that each state\u2019s police departments have made their decisions to allow them. But he says: \u201cIt\u2019s not a good idea to go\u201d. And he says that he has asked the AHPPC to consider this matter. \u201cIt is important for people to have their right to protest ... but with those liberties come great responsibility,\u201d he says. \u201cFor all of those Australians who couldn\u2019t attend the funeral of a family member or couldn\u2019t see a loved one in a nursing home or a veteran who couldn\u2019t remember their fallen colleagues by attending a war memorial service on Anzac Day, I say to them don\u2019t go. \u201cWe all found a way on Anzac Day ... we stood on the end of our driveways and we held up a light\u201d. He says people should \u201cfind a better way\u201d to protest. \u201cI encourage people not to attend for those reasons, and those reasons only.\u201d Morrison has just guaranteed that Jobkeeper will be in place until the end of September \u2013 the full term of the original 6 month announcement. \u201cThe six months provision of Jobkeeper has been set out in legislation and people can count on that.\u201d However, he has said that a 3 month review will be undertaken. My colleague Paul Karp has more information on that coming up. Frydenberg says the draft legislation will be released next month, and \u201cthe intention is to have that legislation passed before the end of the year, and put in place from the first of January next year.\u201d \u201cDuring the Covid crisis, we established a zero dollar threshold for foreign investment, that was to protect the national interest. But that was always to be temporary.\u201d He also says that passive foreign investments in non-sensitive areas will be \u201cstreamlined\u201d. Frydenberg says this reform is \u201cthe most significant since the establishment of the [Foreign Investment] act in 1975\u201d. He says the government will create a new national security test for those seeking to invest in \u201ca sensitive national security business\u201d. This applies to individuals as well as state companies. The exact definition of this will be worked out later, but it will include telecommunications, energy and \u201cbusinesses that collect, store and own data that is critical to Australia\u2019s national security and defence\u201d. Morrison announces an extra $50m of funding for government agencies so they have the resources to enforce the new foreign investment rules. Josh Frydenberg says that 20% of foreign investment comes from the US, 10% each from the UK and Japan, and 5% from China. Scott Morrison is speaking now. He says treasurer Josh Frydenberg will announce new foreign investment rules \u2013 which we reported on yesterday. He begins by saying Australia has become prosperous because we are an \u201coutward looking, open, trading economy\u201d, but that investment must be \u201con our rules\u201d. He also says he spoke with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi yesterday. NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge says NSW police are threatening to go to the state\u2019s supreme court to cancel permission for a Black Lives Matter and Indigenous Lives Matter protest tomorrow. Hi everyone, it\u2019s Naaman Zhou here. Thanks to Michael McGowan and Matilda Boseley for their work this morning. We are still waiting on Scott Morrison to emerge for his press conference. In the meantime, the Australian stock market has opened lower today, snapping a four-day winning streak. The ASX200 was down 18.7 points, or 0.31 per cent, after the first 15 minutes of trade today. I\u2019m going to hand you over to my colleague Naaman Zhou, who will take you through the rest of the day. Of the three new cases in Victoria, two are in hotel quarantine. The third is a student from Newbury Primary school, which I mentioned earlier will close today as a result. Sutton said that case had \u201calmost certainly been picked up in the community\u201d. \u201cThey happen to be attending school but this is not transmission within the school and the risk of transmission in the school remains very low,\u201d he said. But Sutton said he doesn\u2019t think it is \u201cinevitable that we will have a spike\u201d as a result of the protest. We have gotten transmission down to extremely low levels and it may be there is no one there with coronavirus but obviously the greater the numbers that gather together the greater the opportunity there is for one of those individuals, for more, to be there with coronavirus and to be infectious and to transmit to others. Victoria\u2019s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, has again asked people in Melbourne not to attend the planned Black Lives Matter protest. Victoria has recorded three new cases of Covid-19 overnight, and at a press conference just now Sutton said \u201cthere is a risk that all of the gains that we have made are put at risk by people gathering in large numbers\u201d. It takes a single individual who is infectious to potentially transmit to many others in a mass gathering setting. That is what my focus is on and that is why I would reinforce that now is not the time to be in a mass gathering setting. With respect to the protest tomorrow, I made a statement yesterday that from a public health perspective, again, it is not the time to be having large gatherings. So I do urge anyone not to be breaking the directions. The directions state that a gathering should not be of greater than 20 people. Clearly a protest breaks those public health directions and it is a public health risk. I understand the passions that people will have in relation to this and the desire to protest, but my focus has always been on the health and wellbeing of people and that includes for the protesters themselves. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, will hold a press conference in Canberra at 10.30am. Quite a morning for 2GB. A little earlier the treasurer Dominic Perrottet (who, like David Elliott, is from the right of the New South Wales Liberal party) also said Saturday\u2019s protests should not go ahead. As a father of six kids I go home to a mass protest every day and I can\u2019t take my kids to my brother\u2019s house under these social restrictions that we have in place. You can\u2019t defend the indefensible. I think it\u2019s ridiculous. When people are making enormous sacrifices right now I think situations like this, and protests like this on the weekend, clearly shouldn\u2019t go ahead. So you now have a situation where the NSW police have approved a protest which is being criticised both by senior members of the government and the Labor opposition. I bet the premier Gladys Berejiklian is going to be glad the pubs are open by the time this day is over. The New South Wales police minister, David Elliott, has been on 2GB this morning talking about those protests. He has been, as you might expect, quite uncomplimentary, saying people who plan to attend the protest against police brutality are \u201cnot normal\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone who goes out during a pandemic and joins a mass gathering is of sound mind,\u201d he said. The protest, near Town Hall, has been authorised by NSW police, and the minister said he believed the protestors would have taken the issue to court if it wasn\u2019t. As the premier said yesterday, there are things in our society that it is virtually impossible to stop,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cThe people who attend these gatherings during a pandemic don\u2019t care what their parents say.\u201d There are reports a primary school in Melbourne has been forced to close after a positive Covid-19 case. Some interesting politicking going on in Sydney this morning. As you can see below, the Daily Telegraph, in its inimitable style, has splashed on concerns about a Black Lives Matter protest planned for tomorrow. Those concerns are, in fact, coming from the NSW Labor party. The state opposition leader, Jodi McKay, has told the paper; \u201cIs [Gladys Berejiklian] really giving her approval for a mass rally with potentially thousands of participants, when the maximum number of people allowed to visit a private home remains just five?\u201d Good morning. Bit going on. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has just been talking about the federal government\u2019s proposed new foreign interference regime. The Morrison government wants to institute a new national security test, including expanded powers for the treasurer to force the sale of assets or impose conditions after a deal is reached if national security is at risk. The new rules would also make changes to protect health and tax information stored on servers. The move is likely to draw the ire of China at a time of heightened tensions between Canberra and Beijing, but Dutton says the new rules are \u201ccountry agnostic\u201d. They are country agnostic and that is important because the threat can come from a number of actors and we need to make sure that we can deal with that threat. When you are saving your data to the cloud at the moment that ultimately end up in a server somewhere in a physical location. If the wrong people own that premises then that information could be exploited and that\u2019s just one example, there are many more that we would need to deal with on a regular basis. I think this is a sensible upgrade in modernisation of the laws and the treasurer will provide that outline later today. I might leave you there for this morning, the esteemed Michael McGowan will take you through the rest of the day. The New England Journal of Medicine has also retracted its paper on the dangers of hydroxychloroquine after reports on Surgisphere by Melissa Davey. Just 38 of a predicted 36,000 food boxes have been delivered under a $9.3m government initiative designed to deliver emergency food supplies to older Australians isolating throughout Covid-19, reports Elias Visontay. \u201cThis result indicates that referrals to, and take up of referrals by providers is working very well, but that demand is low for this form of emergency assistance,\u201d said the health department\u2019s response to the question taken on notice, seen by Guardian Australia. You can read the full report here: Western Australia will join the Northern Territory in lifting travel restrictions across remote Indigenous communities today. These communities have been quarantined from the rest of the states since 18 March to shield them from Covid-19. The federal government says the decision has the full support of the WA land councils and Aboriginal community-controlled health services in the state. A spokesperson for the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said: The Government will continue to monitor the situation in Western Australia in partnership with the Western Australian Government, the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation. In the event of an outbreak of COVID-19, the Australian Government will work with the Western Australian Government to move rapidly and take all necessary steps to continue to safeguard the health of remote communities. There are a number of Black Lives Matter rallies planned for the capital cities at the weekend, protesting against the deaths of Indigenous people in custody in Australia and the police killing of George Floyd in the US. The NSW government is allowing the Sydney rally to go ahead, a decision which has drawn criticism from the opposition. \u201cIs [Gladys Berejiklian] really giving her approval for a mass rally with potentially thousands of participants, when the maximum number of people allowed to visit a private home remains just five?\u201d the state\u2019s Labor leader, Jodi McKay, has asked in the Daily Telegraph. In Victoria, Daniel Andrews has asked people to stay home but has said police have decided not to fine protesters for gathering en masse: Do you lock people up, do you inflame what is, I think, a pretty volatile situation given the depth of feeling on these issues? Or \u2026 do you take a look and say it\u2019s by no means ideal, but it\u2019s certainly better than seeing that gathering on Saturday deteriorate into something like we\u2019ve seen overseas. Just staying on Covid-19 medication news, the Lancet has officially retracted a paper which caused the World Health Organization to halt trials of hydroxychloroquine. A Guardian investigation had revealed errors in the data that was provided for the research by the US company Surgisphere. These were later explained by the company as some patients being wrongly allocated to Australia instead of Asia. But more anomalies were then picked up. A further investigation by my colleague Melissa Davey found that there were serious questions to be asked about the company itself. Good morning all, Matilda Boseley here to take you through the morning. First up today, the antiviral drug remdesivir has been officially endorsed as a treatment for patients with moderate to severe Covid-19 infections. The drug has been recommended by the National Covid-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce, which brings together the country\u2019s peak health groups. Originally developed for the treatment of Ebola, it is the first medication to be recommended as a possible treatment for patients hospitalised after contracting coronavirus. \u201cThis is the first information we have that a drug has a beneficial effect as a treatment for Covid-19,\u201d said the taskforce\u2019s executive director, Assoc Prof Julian Elliott. \u201cThe preliminary data published so far from two clinical trials indicate that it can reduce the time for someone to recover from Covid-19. However, we do not yet have definitive information that remdesivir will reduce the risk of dying from the disease.\u201d Elliott said the taskforce had reviewed evidence to speed up the development of the recommendation in less than two weeks. Remdesivir is not licensed for use in Australia but the federal government has approved exemptions to some aspects of the Therapeutic Goods Act to allow the drug to be accessed in the context of clinical trials and for compassionate use. The taskforce also said it understood there was a sufficient supply in Australia to meet expected demand.",

But there is no guarantee Sars-CoV-2 will play out in the same way.</p> <p>Social distancing and robust testing \u2013 or a lack of it \u2013 will be critical in deciding the future of the pandemic. But its shape will also be influenced by factors outside our control.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/wave2-zip/giv-3902fWNMHWJrifc2\" data-alt=\"Future waves\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/wave2-zip/giv-3902fWNMHWJrifc2\">Future waves</a> </figure>  <p>The first is whether we can become immune to the virus, and if so, how long that protection endures for.</p> <p>Sometimes immunity can last for decades. During the 2009 swine flu pandemic, public health authorities were initially confused as to why many older people seemed to be immune. Later, they discovered the virus was structurally similar to one that circulated during the 1918 pandemic. The immune systems of many older people had dealt with a similar virus 92 years ago.</p> <p>Resistance to some earlier discovered coronaviruses has been thought to fade within a year. If immunity to Sars-CoV-2 is not permanent, a report from Harvard epidemiologists says it is likely to <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6493/860\">enter into regular circulation</a>, coming in annual or biennial waves or sporadic outbursts.</p> <p>The frequency of significant outbreaks may also be influenced by the weather. Most influenzas spread more easily in the winter because the virus is thought to prefer dry air over humidity, and because people in cold environments spend more time indoors and close to each other.</p> <p>Existing coronaviruses also follow seasonal patterns. If this coronavirus behaves in the same way \u2013 and there is not yet strong evidence that it does \u2013 we could see regular wintertime surges of Covid-19.</p> <p>But with so many people still apparently not immune to the virus, that summer relief may not arrive this year, says James Hay, a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard\u2019s Chan School of Public Health.</p> <p>\u201cThe factor that most contributes towards transmission is how many people are still susceptible,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd with so many still susceptible, that\u2019s going to swamp out any climate effect.\u201d</p> <p>Significant mutations in the virus might also lead to a wave of new infections down the track. So far, scientists say that isn\u2019t a huge concern. </p> <p>\u201cEven though there are different genomes out there that have changes compared to each other \u2026 there\u2019s no evidence any of those changes are in spots that are critical for the immune system to recognise,\u201d Rasmussen says.</p> <p>But that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t see a significant mutation later. \u201cWe\u2019ve only known about this for six months, so it\u2019s possible different strains could emerge in the future, because it does have a higher mutation rate,\u201d she says. \u201cBut right now there\u2019s no evidence that that\u2019s happening.\u201d</p> <h2>Infections are kept under control</h2> <p>For countries that are able to implement highly effective interventions such as testing and contact tracing, this first wave of coronavirus cases may be the last they experience, at least for some time.</p> <p>In New Zealand, which has managed to virtually eradicate the virus and installed robust systems to monitor new outbreaks, there may be no significant new outbreaks or future waves at all, says Nick Wilson, a professor of public health at the University of Otago.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/wave3-zip/giv-39024N7DuaXHi0NR\" data-alt=\"Infections under control\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/06/wave3-zip/giv-39024N7DuaXHi0NR\">Infections under control</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cNew Zealand is about to eliminate this virus,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cEven if there are border control failures, I expect that the contact tracing system is now good enough to control an occasional outbreak. So this country should be able to avoid future waves until a vaccine arrives.\u201d</p> <p>Countries with small populations and isolated geography such as New Zealand and Australia may be able to pull this off. South Korea is another country whose virus detection and suppression systems may be advanced enough to smother any future outbreaks. But it will be extremely difficult for most countries, especially those with large populations and porous borders.</p> <h2>The virus peters out</h2> <p>There are a minority of epidemiologists who argue the deadliness of the coronavirus has been overstated. One of the most prominent is Sunetra Gupta, a professor of theoretical epidemiology at Oxford University, who says the virus could already be on the way out.</p> <p>She argues that the antibody studies conducted so far have been unreliable, and do not take into account the possibility that many people might already be immune to Covid-19 because of exposure to more benign coronaviruses. </p> <p>Others, including neuroscientist Karl Friston, have also spoken of some populations such as Germany\u2019s having some kind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/covid-19-expert-karl-friston-germany-may-have-more-immunological-dark-matter\">immunological \u201cdark matter\u201d</a> that has kept fatalities there low compared to Spain, Italy or the UK.</p> <p>This view is an outlier, and most governments have preferred to plan for the worst-case scenario \u2013 that millions of people are vulnerable to the virus. But Gupta argues the fact that virus transmission rates have peaked and fallen even in some places that did not institute harsh lockdowns is evidence for her theory.</p> <p>\u201cIn almost every context we\u2019ve seen the epidemic grow, turn around and die away \u2013 almost like clockwork,\u201d Gupta told <a href=\"https://unherd.com/2020/05/oxford-doubles-down-sunetra-gupta-interview/\">the media outlet</a> UnHerd last week.</p> <p>\u201cTo me that suggests that much of the driving force here was due to the buildup of immunity,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s a more parsimonious explanation than one which requires in every country for lockdown, or various degrees of lockdown, including no lockdown, to have had the same effect.\u201d</p>",

If societies reopen before the virus is sufficiently eradicated, it may be that this first wave does not completely go away, says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University. \u201cIn the US, we are lifting lockdowns when there are still increasing numbers of cases in a bunch of states \u2026 We may just have peaks and valleys of transmission occurring over and over again as people\u2019s behaviour changes,\u201d she says. The scale of these peaks could be reduced by making changes such as wearing masks, using public transport in a staggered way and avoiding overcrowded social events \u2013 which are increasingly being blamed for being \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d of the first wave of the coronavirus. If outbreaks grow too large, some governments might choose to reimplement quarantines. \u201cIf we\u2019re reopening and we start to see case numbers growing rapidly in a few weeks, we may see rolling lockdowns or shutdowns to try to control the virus in those areas,\u201d Rasmussen says. Future waves Most influenza pandemics have historically struck in distinct wave patterns, with a first peak usually followed by a resurgent second wave six months later. But there is no guarantee Sars-CoV-2 will play out in the same way. Social distancing and robust testing \u2013 or a lack of it \u2013 will be critical in deciding the future of the pandemic. But its shape will also be influenced by factors outside our control. The first is whether we can become immune to the virus, and if so, how long that protection endures for. Sometimes immunity can last for decades. During the 2009 swine flu pandemic, public health authorities were initially confused as to why many older people seemed to be immune. Later, they discovered the virus was structurally similar to one that circulated during the 1918 pandemic. The immune systems of many older people had dealt with a similar virus 92 years ago. Resistance to some earlier discovered coronaviruses has been thought to fade within a year. If immunity to Sars-CoV-2 is not permanent, a report from Harvard epidemiologists says it is likely to enter into regular circulation, coming in annual or biennial waves or sporadic outbursts. The frequency of significant outbreaks may also be influenced by the weather. Most influenzas spread more easily in the winter because the virus is thought to prefer dry air over humidity, and because people in cold environments spend more time indoors and close to each other. Existing coronaviruses also follow seasonal patterns. If this coronavirus behaves in the same way \u2013 and there is not yet strong evidence that it does \u2013 we could see regular wintertime surges of Covid-19. But with so many people still apparently not immune to the virus, that summer relief may not arrive this year, says James Hay, a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard\u2019s Chan School of Public Health. \u201cThe factor that most contributes towards transmission is how many people are still susceptible,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd with so many still susceptible, that\u2019s going to swamp out any climate effect.\u201d Significant mutations in the virus might also lead to a wave of new infections down the track. So far, scientists say that isn\u2019t a huge concern. \u201cEven though there are different genomes out there that have changes compared to each other \u2026 there\u2019s no evidence any of those changes are in spots that are critical for the immune system to recognise,\u201d Rasmussen says. But that doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t see a significant mutation later. \u201cWe\u2019ve only known about this for six months, so it\u2019s possible different strains could emerge in the future, because it does have a higher mutation rate,\u201d she says. \u201cBut right now there\u2019s no evidence that that\u2019s happening.\u201d Infections are kept under control For countries that are able to implement highly effective interventions such as testing and contact tracing, this first wave of coronavirus cases may be the last they experience, at least for some time. In New Zealand, which has managed to virtually eradicate the virus and installed robust systems to monitor new outbreaks, there may be no significant new outbreaks or future waves at all, says Nick Wilson, a professor of public health at the University of Otago. \u201cNew Zealand is about to eliminate this virus,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cEven if there are border control failures, I expect that the contact tracing system is now good enough to control an occasional outbreak. So this country should be able to avoid future waves until a vaccine arrives.\u201d Countries with small populations and isolated geography such as New Zealand and Australia may be able to pull this off. South Korea is another country whose virus detection and suppression systems may be advanced enough to smother any future outbreaks. But it will be extremely difficult for most countries, especially those with large populations and porous borders. The virus peters out There are a minority of epidemiologists who argue the deadliness of the coronavirus has been overstated. One of the most prominent is Sunetra Gupta, a professor of theoretical epidemiology at Oxford University, who says the virus could already be on the way out. She argues that the antibody studies conducted so far have been unreliable, and do not take into account the possibility that many people might already be immune to Covid-19 because of exposure to more benign coronaviruses. Others, including neuroscientist Karl Friston, have also spoken of some populations such as Germany\u2019s having some kind of immunological \u201cdark matter\u201d that has kept fatalities there low compared to Spain, Italy or the UK. This view is an outlier, and most governments have preferred to plan for the worst-case scenario \u2013 that millions of people are vulnerable to the virus. But Gupta argues the fact that virus transmission rates have peaked and fallen even in some places that did not institute harsh lockdowns is evidence for her theory. \u201cIn almost every context we\u2019ve seen the epidemic grow, turn around and die away \u2013 almost like clockwork,\u201d Gupta told the media outlet UnHerd last week. \u201cTo me that suggests that much of the driving force here was due to the buildup of immunity,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s a more parsimonious explanation than one which requires in every country for lockdown, or various degrees of lockdown, including no lockdown, to have had the same effect.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Welcome to this week\u2019s roundup of developments from the coronavirus pandemic. As lockdowns continue to ease in countries around the world, scientists have been reflecting on why some groups have been harder hit than others, and which strategies have proved most successful in tackling the virus. Soul searching in Sweden The Swedish approach to tackling the coronavirus has been described as \u201clight touch\u201d, with shops, gyms and restaurants allowed to stay open, and the public simply asked to avoid non-essential travel or venturing out if unwell \u2013 measures in sharp contrast to the strict lockdowns of neighbouring countries including Norway and Denmark. Now Sweden\u2019s chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, has said the country could have done better, agreeing on Swedish Radio that too many people had died from Covid-19 and adding that the country should have adopted a stance somewhere between the Swedish approach and that of other countries. While Sweden\u2019s per million death rate from Covid-19 is lower than those of the UK, Italy or Spain, it is far higher than that of Norway or of Denmark. And over the seven days to 2 June, it appears Sweden\u2019s death rate per capita was the highest in the world. But Tegnell has maintained that the government took the right steps. \u201cBased on the knowledge we had then, we feel we made the appropriate decisions,\u201d he told a Swedish newspaper. Hydroxychloroquine remains in the limelight The drug hydroxychloroquine, promoted by an enthusiastic Donald Trump, has once again been thrown into the spotlight after concerns were raised by the Guardian and scientists over the data on which an influential study into the drug was based. The study, which was published in the journal the Lancet, drew on hospital data from around the world and concluded that hydroxychloroquine was associated with an increased risk of death or heart problems in people with Covid-19. However, the Guardian revealed serious problems in how the data was collected, finding it was provided by a tiny US-based company called Surgisphere, and had clear errors. The Guardian also found Surgisphere\u2019s employees did not appear to have a medical background; indeed one seems to be a science fiction writer. The Lancet has now retracted the study, while the World Health Organization, which had suspended its work on the drug because of the research, has said it will resume its clinical trials. The New England Journal of Medicine has also retracted a paper based on the Surgisphere data. However, this week a randomised control trial \u2013 the \u201cgold standard\u201d for medical research \u2013 was published that found no sign that hydroxychloroquine is better than placebo in protecting individuals against infection with the coronavirus. While experts have welcomed this study, they have said more research is needed since the trial was small, involving 821 participants, 107 of whom developed Covid-19. Further trials are under way, including one involving more than 40,000 healthcare workers. Concerns over a second wave A number of countries and regions are experiencing upticks in coronavirus cases after seeing infections fall, including Iran. The country has reported a rise in cases after easing lockdown restrictions in April. The health minister, Saeed Namaki, said that if people did not stick to social distancing, the ramifications could be dire. \u201cMy colleagues and the deputies of the ministry of health are working around the clock and travelling to one province every day to control this epidemic, but we are dealing with local issues and behaviours that could lead to the return of the peak of the disease,\u201d he said. Science Weekly podcast In this week\u2019s edition of Science Weekly, Ian Sample talks to Prof Carl Heneghan about the uncertainties in predicting future outbreaks of Covid-19 and what we can do to prevent them Obesity warnings over Covid-19 Experts have warned that obesity increases the risk of death from Covid-19, and have said more needs to be done to help people reduce their weight, including by offering treatments such as gastric balloons. According to Prof John Wilding, the president of the World Obesity Federation, obesity doubles the chances of death from Covid-19, while data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has revealed that almost three-quarters of patients critically ill with Covid-19 across a collection of European countries, including Italy, Spain and Sweden, are obese. Doctors say among the reasons why obesity is a problem with Covid-19 is that it is harder to ventilate such patients, while severe obesity is known to affect the immune system. Shaw Somers, a consultant bariatric surgeon, said: \u201cWith severe obesity, your immune system is working overtime. What we know from Covid is those who do badly have an exaggerated inflammatory response that comes on after seven to 10 days. Their immune system goes berserk and kills them. And we think that obesity just amplifies it and just makes it much worse.\u201d Experts say even being a few stone overweight could reduce the body\u2019s resilience to illnesses, including Covid-19.",

One of many blunders in the first phase of the UK\u2019s response was to allow <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/28/why-did-so-many-people-die-of-covid-19-in-the-uks-care-homes\">substantial transmission</a> within hospitals and care homes.&nbsp;</p> <p>I don\u2019t wish to dwell on past mistakes.

Testing, tracing and isolation is of course right, but mildly symptomatic people must be encouraged to request a test immediately.

      "body": "<h2>Megan Nolan</h2> <p>When I was forced out of my cheerfully ignorant denial about Covid-19 \u2013 the day I had to abandon a long anticipated three month stay in New York and fly back to Ireland \u2013 I still didn\u2019t believe any of it. Even when my brother picked me up from the airport and drove me to my hometown, both of us in gloves and masks and I experienced for the first time that people who loved each other really were no longer touching, the unnatural stiffness of it all \u2013 even then I didn\u2019t buy it. I knew logically it was happening, of course, and harboured no conspiracy theories, but still I could not credit it. \u201cIt can\u2019t be real,\u201d I thought to myself quite calmly, \u201cBecause there is no way I could bear it.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>It seemed impossible that I should be sequestered without a partner or friends for an indefinite period. At the best of times, my great, characteristic, weakness is a compulsive need for company. I find it impossible to stay in more than a night or two a week. I do not enjoy my own company. Why would I? My work involves dissecting and categorising and exploring my thoughts and feelings, so that by the time it\u2019s 6pm I am utterly sick of what I have to say. I want only to hear my friends talk endlessly at me, relieving me of the need to hear myself, feel myself.&nbsp;</p> <p>In New York, I was recently single and filled with the giddy potential of a new city and a new phase of my life. I went out every night and dated with abandon. Towards the end, when I was getting the impression that living this way would soon be impossible, I started making a log of these funny or sweet or sexy or embarrassing encounters. The night before I flew home, knowing it would be the last for an unknowable length of time, I kissed my date on his doorstep over and over, not wanting to leave and have my life as a flighty, promiscuous person officially end.&nbsp;</p> <p>I\u2019ve spent the past five years without much by way of stability, mostly on purpose, sometimes not. Work and money have been precarious, London housing situations sporadic and short-lived. I was often doing stints abroad, house sitting, or looking after cats, or taking advantage of a cheap sublet somewhere or other. You pay a price for rejecting stability \u2013 I was often exhausted from having no real base, my belongings are in five different households in three countries \u2013 but you get many good things in return too. Chiefly it was the feeling of authoring my own life, the immense privilege of doing more or less what I wanted to be doing at all times and not having any significant responsibilities beyond keeping myself alive.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I drink until I\u2019m drunk and I talk to people. I find myself having long phone conversations with fairly arbitrary people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The pandemic means that I am now suffering the absence of all the bonds I refused and enjoying none of the rewards that mitigated the particular kind of loneliness I chose.&nbsp;Back in Ireland, I am drinking too much. Every second or third night I sit at the desk in the front room my mother kindly gave over to me as a makeshift office, and I drink until I\u2019m drunk and I talk to people. In an attempt to imitate the haphazard, incontinent socialising of my normal life, I find myself having hour-long phone conversations with fairly arbitrary people I barely knew before all this, as well as my closest friends and my beloved ex partner. It\u2019s sort of awful but sort of heartening too, the amount we need to connect with each other, so that we\u2019ll do it with semi-strangers in these absurd circumstances even when it\u2019s uncomfortable and agonising in its own way.&nbsp;</p> <p>I drink Cava and grapefruit juice and I drink Rioja that costs 30 quid because what else am I spending money on right now, and when it\u2019s late and I should be asleep I drink vodka and lime juice with tap water and ice. I drink whatever\u2019s around, because I know I\u2019ll want the hangover almost as much as I want to be drunk. The hangover days make&nbsp;the perennial feeling of inert sluggishness feel almost good, make the formless hours justified in their bland repetition.&nbsp;</p> <p>I\u2019ll return to London next week, it being as close a thing to home as I have, in time to turn 30. When I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/04/writing-shameful-feminine-karl-ove-knausgard-my-struggle-writing\">sold my book last year</a> it was the first time in my life I gained any sort of financial security. I am feeling profoundly grateful that I can now afford to live alone. I\u2019ve bought the first television I\u2019ll have had since I left home at 18, soft furnishings, good crockery. I invest in it all gladly, thinking this flat is where I\u2019ll necessarily be for the foreseeable future. I\u2019m adapting, in other words. But I can\u2019t help but remember the good reasons I rejected domesticity until now, resisted objects, pets, permanence. I\u2019m so lucky to have what I have, but I won\u2019t stop waiting for the day I can give it all away, when I can pack up the TV and the good casserole dish and the reading lamp and go off and be both as totally social and as totally lonely as I wish to be again.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Acts of Desperation</em> <em>will be published by Jonathan Cape in 2021.</em></p> <h2><br>Margaret Drabble</h2> <p>In lockdown, time stands still while simultaneously moving at astonishing speed. My husband, Michael, and I are self-isolating in Somerset. I am impressed by how quickly predictive texting caught on to the new language of coronavirus. It certainly knows how to spell \u201cself-isolating\u201d, a concept that didn\u2019t exist a few months ago.</p> <p>I am utterly gripped by the news and cannot get enough of it. The unrolling of this great tragedy, which has as yet no end or ending in sight, is a spectacle like no other. At my age, I don\u2019t really care much what happens to me, so I feel in a sense fortunate to have been able to witness this extraordinary drama. I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to have missed it. The politics and the science, national and international, are compelling. I seize eagerly on each new bit of information about the vaccine and symptoms and bad or good crowd behaviour. It\u2019s amazing to be in the midst of a situation that nobody, but nobody, understands, with outcomes that nobody can predict. </p> <p>We have all had to learn new tricks.

We have read together forthcoming books by our friends <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/carmen-callil\">Carmen Callil</a>, Nell Dunn, and Mich\u00e8le Roberts, which provide company.

Anna gives me the detail that the TV coverage misses. The feeling of what it\u2019s like to live under curfew in a city where shops have been boarded up or set on fire, where barbed-wire barricades are the new normal and where 50 national guard personnel carriers have been parked up just outside her local coffee shop. I know this isn\u2019t about her, as she never fails to remind me. It isn\u2019t Anna who is getting killed by the police or being regularly stopped and searched, but I can\u2019t help worrying about her. She has also volunteered at the local food bank and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of the way she is trying to give something back to her adopted city. Though, she won\u2019t thank me for saying so. I\u2019m also amazed by my 96-year-old mother. The care home where she lives has been under lockdown, so she has been allowed no visits from my sisters or me for the last three months. A few weeks ago, we got the news we had all been dreading. My mother had tested positive for the coronavirus and none of us knew if we would ever see her again. Telephone calls became both more banal and laden with meaning as I tried to say the things I wanted to say without worrying her even more. Today, though, we got the astonishing news that my mother has now tested negative. She survived countless air raids and being machine-gunned by a Messerschmitt in the war and now she has beaten the coronavirus. I\u2019m beginning to think she\u2019s indestructible. There\u2019s clearly something special in the Crace women genes.</p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>It\u2019s getting increasingly hard to write satire. A few weeks ago, I wrote as a joke that one of the reasons Boris Johnson may have been late to introduce lockdown measures was because he didn\u2019t want to have to cancel Carrie Symonds\u2019s baby shower at Chequers. Now Private Eye is reporting that this indeed may have been the case. But it never once occurred to me that MPs would spend over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/mps-join-90-minute-long-queue-to-vote-to-end-virtual-voting\">90 minutes in a queue</a> that wound round Westminster Hall and back into Portcullis House to vote to deny at least 100 of their fellow MPs the chance to take part in future votes. To add to the sense of the surreal, the government had chosen to make Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s absurd change to parliamentary procedure \u2013 the hybrid participation and electronic voting system had worked perfectly well in the months before recess \u2013 into a three-line whip even though the new measures were in direct contravention of its message to the rest of the country to continue working from home wherever possible. Opposition MPs got visibly more annoyed the longer the farce went on, but what was also remarkable was how many Tory MPs managed to slow things up by not being able to master the basics of saying their name and how they were voting at the dispatch box. Stephen Crabb managed the unique double of first going to the no side to shout \u201cAye\u201d before moving sideways to say \u201cNo\u201d as he went through the aye lobby. If I was an opposition MP, I would be forcing as many divisions as possible in a day just to highlight the waste of time and absurdity. After several days of queueing in the rain, many Tories will be starting to have murderous thoughts towards Rees-Mogg and Johnson.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>I am suffering a strange kind of brain fade while watching TV at the moment. Last week, the Walter of Channel 4\u2019s Walter Presents series was on Radio 4\u2019s Front Row listing some of his favourite European crime and thriller series. He gave a special mention to the Swedish drama Before We Die, so my wife and I made a note to start watching it. Right from the opening credits, it was immediately apparent to me that I had already seen it some years before, but the weird thing was I just couldn\u2019t remember anything about it even though it was simultaneously entirely familiar. What happens is that as each scene develops I suddenly remember precisely what is going to occur in the next one but nothing about how it will continue thereafter. We are now more than halfway through and I am still clueless about who will be alive or dead at the end of each episode \u2013 let alone at the the end of the series. The best way I can describe it is that it is like watching a football match in which I know precisely what will happen in the next 20 seconds \u2013 who will pass to whom and so on \u2013 but have no idea of the game\u2019s dynamics or final score. This has never happened to me before. It\u2019s somehow unnerving. Which is probably why my favourite current programme in lockdown is Springwatch. I could watch beavers, storks, moths and ospreys doing nothing very much for hours on end safe in the knowledge that the next 30 seconds are almost certainly going to be like the previous 30 seconds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"033ecef13d0263d00c8761eb90fdfd09fdb6e49e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/033ecef13d0263d00c8761eb90fdfd09fdb6e49e/0_168_5031_3019/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ikea store\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019re in the queue to vote for the meatballs.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>Given the likely major recession brought on both by the government\u2019s \u00a3500bn coronavirus bailout plan and the highest rate of unemployment in generations \u2013 not to mention Boris Johnson\u2019s weird obsession with a no-deal Brexit \u2013 it\u2019s hard to see how many previous spending commitments are going to go ahead. Yet next year, HS2 will set to work tunnelling 13 miles under the Chilterns as part of the London to Birmingham route \u2013 no one is counting on the Birmingham to Leeds and Manchester ever being completed \u2013 and the construction company has just launched a local competition to decide the name of the two purpose-built 2,000-tonne boring machines which are about to leave the factory. In order to avoid the embarrassment of having to choose the hot favourite, Borey McBoreyface, HS2 has limited the options to just three: Cecilia, after Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin, a Buckinghamshire astronomer and astrophysicist; Florence, after Florence Nightingale; and Marie after Marie Curie. Fair to say though that this has not gone down well with Chilterns locals upset about having their neck of the woods turned into a building site.

He has now received an email from the testing company to say that, though they have lost track of his test results, they haven\u2019t lost track of his inquiry about his lost results and are pleased to have assigned him a case reference number. In the meantime they have asked him to let them know if his concern related to his missing swab tests \u2013 what else did they imagine it was about? \u2013 and if the results did miraculously turn up then could he please let them know as it would save them the bother of not being able to locate them themselves. The email came from Olivia, who described her occupation as \u201cpatient experience officer\u201d. The word \u201cpatient\u201d was doing a lot of heavy lifting. There again, no part of the government\u2019s test-and-trace system that was supposed to be central to its plans for easing lockdown regulations on Monday appeared to be functioning properly. After minimal training, many of the 25,000 contact tracers have appeared to have next to nothing to do and the Guardian has now seen internal documents suggesting nothing much will improve <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/04/nhs-track-and-trace-system-not-expected-to-be-operating-fully-until-september-coronavirus\">until September at the earliest</a>. All of which has left me thinking that I am no longer going to rely on the government as a safe source of advice and will be maintaining my own lockdown measures that are entirely based on what other European countries were insisting on about six weeks previously, as their handling of the crisis has been so much better than our own. Only on Thursday, Grant Shapps made it compulsory to wear a face covering on public transport from 15 June.

In the last three years both ITV and Channel 4 have appointed their first female chief executives, Carolyn McCall and Alex Mahon respectively. Davie is the 17th successive man to be appointed to the role of director general since the BBC was founded in 1927.</p> <p>\u201cIt would have been right to have a woman now. It is disappointing,\u201d said Carrie Gracie, the BBC\u2019s former China editor. \u201cI do feel Tim understands the challenges of the BBC. He\u2019s thought hard about them.

He will have to take a significant pay cut in his new role: Hall received \u00a3475,000 in pay and benefits. Davie has agreed to be paid the same as Hall until August next year, when his pay will increase to \u00a3525,000. The BBC says the pay rise is in line with inflation since 2012, the last time the director general\u2019s pay increased.</p> <p>Davie spent a spell as deputy chairman of the Hammersmith and Fulham Conservative party in the 1990s, and unsuccessfully ran for a council seat in 1993. He remains good friends with Stephen Greenhalgh, who started his political career in the borough and was made a Tory peer by Boris Johnson last month. Davie attended drinks held by the council, when Greenhalgh was its leader, in 2007, <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmselect/cmpubacc/221/8010910.htm\">according to the BBC hospitality register</a>.

He had been accused of violating US sanctions on Iran. A second Iranian scientist, Sirous Asgari, who had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/iran-scientist-us-detention-coronavirus-sirous-asgari\">held by US</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/iran-scientist-us-detention-coronavirus-sirous-asgari\"> immigration authorities</a> for months, was also allowed to return to Iran.</p> <p>Trump tweeted: \u201cThank you to Iran. It shows a deal is possible!\u201d He added that it was in Iran\u2019s interests to reach an agreement on a new nuclear deal before the US presidential election. The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, tweeted: \u201cThis can happen for all prisoners. No need for cherry picking.\u201d</p> <p>The US has no direct diplomatic relations with Iran, and the swap was organised by Swiss intermediaries who act as the US representatives in Tehran.</p> <p>The UK Foreign Office, at least in public, has not been able to make progress in striking a comparable pragmatic deal with Iran, in the way that the US has managed to overcome huge political conflicts.</p> <p>Tulip Siddiq, the Labour MP campaigning for Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s release, said: \u201cThe US has negotiated the release of another hostage from Iran. I\u2019m happy for Michael White and his family \u2013 but I would like to ask the UK government why they haven\u2019t done the same for Nazanin, so that she could be on a plane home right now too?\u201d</p> <p>Although both the UK and Iran deny there is a direct relationship, it is privately acknowledged that the return of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/jan/22/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-pay-400m-debt-in-aid-urges-husband\">\u00a3400m owed by the UK to Iran</a> for more than 30 years, arising from an arms deal, would change the atmosphere surrounding Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s fate.</p>",

If she is forced to stay indefinitely in Tehran, the family is certain to contrast her fate to the US prisoner Michael White, who was released this week after nearly a year of negotiations. The release occurred even though Iran is locked in a bitter conflict over the US pull-out from the 2015 nuclear deal, and Donald Trump\u2019s subsequent imposition of sweeping economic sanctions, which have crippled the Iranian economy and made the regime\u2019s fight against the coronavirus harder. The US, as part of an apparent prisoner swap, allowed Majid Taheri, an Iranian scientist imprisoned in the US for 16 months, to be released. He had been accused of violating US sanctions on Iran. A second Iranian scientist, Sirous Asgari, who had been held by US immigration authorities for months, was also allowed to return to Iran. Trump tweeted: \u201cThank you to Iran. It shows a deal is possible!\u201d He added that it was in Iran\u2019s interests to reach an agreement on a new nuclear deal before the US presidential election. The Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, tweeted: \u201cThis can happen for all prisoners. No need for cherry picking.\u201d The US has no direct diplomatic relations with Iran, and the swap was organised by Swiss intermediaries who act as the US representatives in Tehran. The UK Foreign Office, at least in public, has not been able to make progress in striking a comparable pragmatic deal with Iran, in the way that the US has managed to overcome huge political conflicts. Tulip Siddiq, the Labour MP campaigning for Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s release, said: \u201cThe US has negotiated the release of another hostage from Iran. I\u2019m happy for Michael White and his family \u2013 but I would like to ask the UK government why they haven\u2019t done the same for Nazanin, so that she could be on a plane home right now too?\u201d Although both the UK and Iran deny there is a direct relationship, it is privately acknowledged that the return of \u00a3400m owed by the UK to Iran for more than 30 years, arising from an arms deal, would change the atmosphere surrounding Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s fate.",

      "bodyText": "House prices fell for a third month running in May as lockdown measures to tackle the coronavirus stifled homebuying activity, according to figures from the mortgage lender Halifax. The bank said the average price of a home in the UK dropped by 0.2% over the month and stands at \u00a3237,808. Over the last three months, the period during which the pandemic was declared, prices were down by 0.5%. However, the lender said the relaxation of lockdown measures in England in mid-May had led to an uptick in interest from buyers. That was underlined by Taylor Wimpey on Friday, with the housebuilder reporting strong interest since reopening its sales centres. It said it had seen a threefold increase in appointments in the week to 31 May and a 32% rise in website traffic compared with the same period last year. Cancellations remained low throughout the lockdown, Taylor Wimpey said, with 306 purchases falling through, or just 5% of the private order book. This is slightly down on the figure for the same period in 2019. As the UK went into lockdown in March, buyers and sellers were told to delay their moves if possible and to suspend all new viewings. With valuers unable to visit properties, and lenders diverting resources to dealing with requests for payment holidays, many deals were put on hold until the market was unlocked on 12 May. Russell Galley, the managing director of Halifax, said calculating house prices \u201cremains challenging\u201d as a result of the fall in sales during lockdown, with increased volatility expected. \u201cLooking ahead, we expect market activity to increase progressively as restrictions are eased further across the whole of the UK and we continue to have confidence in the underlying health of the housing market over the long term,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, the extent of downward pressure on market confidence and prices over the coming months will depend on how quickly the economy is able to recover from the effects of the pandemic and the available government policy support for jobs and households.\u201d Earlier this week, Nationwide building society said its index showed prices had fallen in May at the fastest rate since the 2009 financial crisis. Both reports are based on mortgages that each lender has approved during the month.",

The company, based in San Francisco, made a loss of $932m (\u00a3738m) in the three months to 2 May, compared with a profit of $227m during the same period in 2019. The retailer, known for its denim, chinos and T-shirts, wrote off $235m for excess stock. Like many of its competitors, Gap has been left with mountains of seasonal clothing it has not been able to sell, while 90% of its global stores were temporarily forced to close during lockdown. The pandemic has triggered several high-profile retail insolvencies in the US, including fashion chain J Crew and department store chains JC Penney and Neiman Marcus. The Gap group, which also owns the Old Navy and Banana Republic brands, said customers were focused on buying casual clothes while staying at home, affecting sales at Banana Republic, which offers more workwear. Gap has almost 2,800 stores in North America and has now reopened 55% of its company operated stores in the region. It hopes to reopen most of the rest throughout June. A range of retailers will be permitted to reopen in England from 15 June, provided they install physical-distancing measures inside stores. The UK operations of of US lingerie chain Victoria\u2019s Secret collapsed into administration on Friday. No immediate store closures or job losses are planned while a buyer is sought.

Rob Harding, joint administrator at Deloitte, called the firm\u2019s collapse \u201cyet another blow to the UK high street\u201d, adding it was \u201ca further example of the impact the Covid-19 pandemic is having on the entire retail industry\u201d. L Brands, the US parent company, posted a near-$270m net loss over the most recent three months as sales slid 37%. Gap\u2019s chief executive, Sonia Syngal, said the retailer\u2019s online sales doubled in Mayand she was optimistic for long-term growth. The retailer said it would close some Gap and Banana Republic branches while also seeking rent concessions. It paid no rent for closed stores in April, extended its payment terms to suppliers and deferred its first-quarter dividend as it sought to cut costs and preserve cash. Gap is being sued by the largest shopping mall operator in America for unpaid rent during the coronavirus shutdown. Simon Property Group, which counts Gap as one of its biggest tenants, filed a lawsuit on Thursday, accusing Gap of failing to pay almost $66m in rent and charges while its stores were closed. Commercial property landlords in the the UK have been temporarily banned by the government from taking legal action against tenants who refuse to pay their rent until 30 June.",

      "body": "<p>As far as wine is concerned, there\u2019s one unexpected bonus to the coronavirus, and by that I don\u2019t mean being able to convince yourself that every night is a Saturday night. Rather, it\u2019s that you can now get the same access to the movers and shakers of the wine world as me or any other wine professional. Whereas before, especially if you live somewhere from where it\u2019s hard to get to wine tastings, you can now virtually visit vineyards and chat to winemakers anywhere in the world.</p> <p>The fact that wineries can no longer receive visitors, and that many wine importers and wholesalers who supply restaurants have no current market, has been a game-changer thanks to video apps such as Zoom and Instagram Live.

Rather, it\u2019s that you can now get the same access to the movers and shakers of the wine world as me or any other wine professional. Whereas before, especially if you live somewhere from where it\u2019s hard to get to wine tastings, you can now virtually visit vineyards and chat to winemakers anywhere in the world. The fact that wineries can no longer receive visitors, and that many wine importers and wholesalers who supply restaurants have no current market, has been a game-changer thanks to video apps such as Zoom and Instagram Live. And the real beauty of it is that this works just as well for the smallest retailer as the biggest wine producer. One small wine shop, Vineyards of Sherborne (@vineyards_wine on Instagram), enterprisingly hosted a live chat with award-winning Argentinian winemaker Andr\u00e9s Vignoni of Vi\u00f1a Cobos, whose luscious malbec, Felino, the shop stocks as part of its Wine Goes Live case.

      "bodyText": "When applications to be the BBC director general opened at the start of the year, it was seen by some potential candidates within the media industry as something of a poisoned chalice. The victorious candidate would inherit a sprawling broadcaster facing a hostile government intent on cutting it down to size, an organisation required to impose further financial cuts even as it struggled to compete in a global media marketplace, and a media business built on the principle of universal appeal trying to attract younger audiences who don\u2019t feel the same natural affinity to its services. Then the coronavirus pandemic happened, the commercial media industry took a financial hammering, and the BBC saw surging audience figures and growing public trust as people turned to the national broadcaster in a time of national crisis. All of the underlying problems remain but Tim Davie \u2013 a longterm BBC commercial executive who has never made a programme \u2013 inherits an organisation that has, by chance, earned a brief period of breathing space and a chance to reset its relationship with ministers. Davie\u2019s background in marketing is often mentioned dismissively by journalists within the organisation, who note that before joining the BBC one of his most notable actions was helping to rebrand Pepsi\u2019s packaging to blue in the 1990s. What has rarely been noticed is his stint during the same era as the deputy chairman of the Hammersmith and Fulham Conservative party \u2013 experience that could come in handy for what is an intensely political role. The first issue he will have to deal with is placating a government that, powered by the anti-media fury of the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, spent the start of the year proposing to cut the BBC down to size \u2013 boycotting key political programmes and launching a still-ongoing consultation on decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee. Since then the corporation has won plaudits from ministers for its provision of accurate health information and educational programming, with the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, often effusive in his praise. But as the coronavirus infection rate starts to recede, so relations between ministers and the BBC have become increasingly strained. Emily Maitlis\u2019s monologue criticising Cummings on Newsnight has not helped matters, with signs that the government is once again willing to confront the corporation\u2019s news arm. There is a growing acceptance that the concept of the licence fee being charged on possession of a television, currently guaranteed until 2027, is starting to appear outdated. Even the BBC is tentatively suggesting an eventual shift to a Scandinavian-style model where the public are directly taxed to support public service broadcasting. Davie \u2013 who specialised in raising funds for the BBC through non-licence-fee operations by selling formats around the world \u2013 will play a key role in shaping any new funding model, while also having to spend years imposing endless cuts. The BBC chairman, David Clementi, who led the appointment process, will also have been well aware that his own term on the corporation\u2019s board runs out at the start of 2021. He will have known that if the board appointed a leftfield candidate then, in less than a year, ministers could appoint a new BBC chairman with the instruction to sack the director general. Some of these political attacks are made possible by the shakiness of some of the audience figures for the corporation\u2019s output. In absolute terms, the BBC remains dominant in the British media world: its news website has far more readers than any other outlet, it still accounts for half of all radio listening, and the vast majority of the population use it in some way every week. But there is a small but growing number of people \u2013 mainly younger, more diverse audiences \u2013 who do not consume any BBC content, undermining the concept of a universal licence fee providing a universal service. Then there is the growing issue of trust in the corporation\u2019s news output, which remains high among the general population but is fraying around the edges, following years of criticism of apparent bias in its political output from both the left and right of politics. That\u2019s before taking into account the growing anger from many BBC staff, powered by their own social media channels, over the corporation\u2019s commitment to presenting different sides of the debate on issues such as race and LGBT rights. With the corporation increasingly finding itself in the middle of an ongoing culture war, it won\u2019t be long until Davie becomes embroiled in a row similar to the debate over Naga Munchetty\u2019s comments on Donald Trump. But ultimately, as the man who will lead the BBC through its 100th anniversary celebrations in 2022, Davie\u2019s stint in charge will be judged on one thing alone: will he manage to ensure that when he steps down, the UK still has a financially sustainable public service broadcaster that enjoys the support of majority of the public?",

The risk is that you get a race to the bottom on a street. Consumers will be wary of shops that have no hard and fast policies.\u201d</p> <p>Large and small shops are scrambling to prepare for the reopening of the high street on 15 June, with businesses experimenting with measures from \u201cbrowsing by appointment\u201d to using floral designs for distance warning stickers because they are believed to be more reassuring.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/03/coronavirus-lockdown-rules-what-is-allowed-in-england-scotland-wales-and-northern-ireland\">Lockdown rules: what is allowed in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Goodacre said the difficulty of estimating how many shoppers would be in an average store \u2013 alongside complicating factors such as the fact that customers were more likely to buy something if they had been queuing \u2013 made it hard to predict the impact of social distancing on business.</p> <p>With an estimated 70% of pre-coronavirus trade needed to break even, Goodacre said retailers would \u201cbe lucky to see 30-40% of sales with this kind of capacity\u201d.</p> <p>The report\u2019s conclusions are based on the speed and unpredictability of people\u2019s movements, which means they are much more likely to get near each other when shopping than when queuing or sitting at a desk \u2013 and therefore require a bigger \u201chalo\u201d.</p> <p>Chris Turner, the chief executive of British BIDs \u2013 the representative group for Business Improvement Districts \u2013 said the report showed that maintaining a 2-metre distance was \u201chugely problematic\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you do the sums, you find that a small cocktail bar can fit about two people in,\u201d he added. He warned that more planning needed to be done to prepare shared high street space, saying: \u201cRetailers are finding creative ways to deal with this 2-metre malarkey \u2013 but they can\u2019t afford to have them all queuing outside at the same time as it stands because if everybody does that it\u2019ll be chaos.\u201d</p> <p>Prof Cathy Parker, one of the report\u2019s authors, said that \u201cpeople don\u2019t want to go from one place to another and see that the numbers are really different. Anything that\u2019s going to make people think the rules are being broken and it\u2019s a risky environment, that\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine to see everybody queuing up, that doesn\u2019t look like a risk,\u201d she added. \u201cBut telling people to keep 2 metres apart in shops where people are bunching \u2026 You can tell retailers to manage capacity but how do they work that out? None of it is visible in the government guidelines.\u201d</p> <p>Ministers are continuing to debate whether social distancing rules could be relaxed to 1 metre without risking a rapid rise in the coronavirus \u201cR\u201d rate that will determine whether the UK faces a second wave of infections.</p> <p>Some shops, pubs and restaurants are calling for a change to 1-metre distancing, in line with World Health Organization guidelines. The research found that such a reduction would mean that only about 5 to 6 sq metres would be needed per shopper.</p> <p>But while Turner said that for many hospitality businesses \u201cit will not be financially viable to reopen unless the distance is reduced from 2 metres\u201d and called for the minimum to be reviewed, he noted that the uncertainty over the final guidance risked \u201ctossing all the planning into disarray\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a real sense that the government is making it up as it goes along,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u200b\u2022 This article was amended on 9 June 2020 to clarify the type of modelling used in the study, and to remove a graphic which, \u200bwhile showing the correct figures, did not show the exact modelling used to arrive at these figures.</p>",

Consumers will be wary of shops that have no hard and fast policies.\u201d Large and small shops are scrambling to prepare for the reopening of the high street on 15 June, with businesses experimenting with measures from \u201cbrowsing by appointment\u201d to using floral designs for distance warning stickers because they are believed to be more reassuring. But Goodacre said the difficulty of estimating how many shoppers would be in an average store \u2013 alongside complicating factors such as the fact that customers were more likely to buy something if they had been queuing \u2013 made it hard to predict the impact of social distancing on business. With an estimated 70% of pre-coronavirus trade needed to break even, Goodacre said retailers would \u201cbe lucky to see 30-40% of sales with this kind of capacity\u201d. The report\u2019s conclusions are based on the speed and unpredictability of people\u2019s movements, which means they are much more likely to get near each other when shopping than when queuing or sitting at a desk \u2013 and therefore require a bigger \u201chalo\u201d. Chris Turner, the chief executive of British BIDs \u2013 the representative group for Business Improvement Districts \u2013 said the report showed that maintaining a 2-metre distance was \u201chugely problematic\u201d. \u201cWhen you do the sums, you find that a small cocktail bar can fit about two people in,\u201d he added. He warned that more planning needed to be done to prepare shared high street space, saying: \u201cRetailers are finding creative ways to deal with this 2-metre malarkey \u2013 but they can\u2019t afford to have them all queuing outside at the same time as it stands because if everybody does that it\u2019ll be chaos.\u201d Prof Cathy Parker, one of the report\u2019s authors, said that \u201cpeople don\u2019t want to go from one place to another and see that the numbers are really different. Anything that\u2019s going to make people think the rules are being broken and it\u2019s a risky environment, that\u2019s a problem.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s fine to see everybody queuing up, that doesn\u2019t look like a risk,\u201d she added. \u201cBut telling people to keep 2 metres apart in shops where people are bunching \u2026 You can tell retailers to manage capacity but how do they work that out? None of it is visible in the government guidelines.\u201d Ministers are continuing to debate whether social distancing rules could be relaxed to 1 metre without risking a rapid rise in the coronavirus \u201cR\u201d rate that will determine whether the UK faces a second wave of infections. Some shops, pubs and restaurants are calling for a change to 1-metre distancing, in line with World Health Organization guidelines. The research found that such a reduction would mean that only about 5 to 6 sq metres would be needed per shopper. But while Turner said that for many hospitality businesses \u201cit will not be financially viable to reopen unless the distance is reduced from 2 metres\u201d and called for the minimum to be reviewed, he noted that the uncertainty over the final guidance risked \u201ctossing all the planning into disarray\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s a real sense that the government is making it up as it goes along,\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 June 2020 to clarify the type of modelling used in the study, and to remove a graphic which, while showing the correct figures, did not show the exact modelling used to arrive at these figures.",

      "bodyText": "The government was advised to scale up its coronavirus test-and-trace effort using a call centre system as early as February, government documents show, raising questions about why the system launched last week as lockdown measures were eased is still not fully operational. A report presented to the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) on 12 February, when the UK was still actively tracing contacts of those infected with Covid-19, recommended a 10-fold increase in Public Health England\u2019s test-and-trace capacity in order to extend the number of cases that could be managed. \u201cScaling this response up, using for example a call-centre type system to support the local PHE teams, should be possible and feasible,\u201d the experts from Public Health England and the University of Cambridge recommended. However, this suggestion does not appear to have been pursued and contact tracing was abandoned in March. The PHE experts also concluded that contact tracing would become potentially unsustainable when the number of infections resulted in more than 8,000 contacts needing to be traced each day, and recommended that the operation should be wound down at that stage. Tracking down all the contacts of an infected person would have been more challenging at that stage in the epidemic, because numbers were rising rapidly, and widespread social distancing did not come into place until the lockdown on 23 March. The latest tranche of documents published by Sage, which cover advice given by its subgroups on public health, reveal that the government was also repeatedly alerted to the risk of spreading infections from hospitals to care homes. A document, from 24 February, considering the case of a hospital outbreak, recommends that there should be \u201cno discharges to care or residential homes\u201d under these circumstances and that other patients who are fit to be discharged should be required to isolate at home in order to prevent onward spread in the community. On 13 April, the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) warned that \u201cparticular caution should be exercised in Covid-19 patients discharged from hospital to nursing homes, homeless shelters, or other institutions where there are vulnerable individuals\u201d. About 16,000 UK care home residents are believed to have died from Covid-19 in outbreaks that have struck 38% of care homes in England and 59% in Scotland. And infections spilling over from care homes and hospitals into the community are continuing to be a significant driver for new cases across the country. Government advisers also highlighted the potentially limited effectiveness of the proposed NHS test-and-trace app, at a time when it was being heralded as a key component of safely lifting lockdown. One paper points out that an app would potentially require people with only a 5% chance of infection to quarantine, and that the requirement of around 75% of the population to download the app to make it highly effective would mean it would need to become the most popular user-installed app, ahead of Facebook and with triple the popularity of the most popular Android game. The documents also give some insights into the advice the government was receiving on the widespread use of face masks, which was previously advised against, before the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, announced on Thursday that face coverings would be compulsory on public transport from 15 June. A document, from 13 April, recommends that there is insufficient evidence to support the universal use of masks in the community, warning of the possible \u201csignificant impact on the ability of the NHS to purchase sufficient masks for healthcare workers\u201d. A week later, on 21 April, scientists on Sage decided there was \u201cenough evidence to support recommendation of community use of cloth face masks, for short periods in enclosed spaces, where social distancing is not possible\u201d. Other documents show that experts considered whether to recommend a 1-metre instead of 2-metre rule for physical distancing, and concluded that since transmission at distances of above 1 metre was known to be possible, \u201c1 metre is a minimum, 2 metres is precautionary\u201d and that \u201cthere is no entirely safe minimum duration\u201d for contact with an infected person, but that 15 minutes was a pragmatic threshold for the purposes of contact tracing. Curbs on travel into the UK were also considered on 22 March, but experts advised this would have a \u201cnegligible impact\u201d on the outbreak given widespread transmission in the UK. \u201cThis might change if the UK were to successfully contain the epidemic,\u201d one document reports. Despite relatively high numbers of infections continuing in the UK, rules announced in May revealed passengers arriving in the UK by plane, ferry or train would have to quarantine for 14 days. The documents are the latest to be released after No 10 came under pressure to publish the membership of Sage and the advice it has provided to ministers. In April, the Guardian revealed that Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s senior aide, had participated in Sage meetings.",

But twice as many existed before the start of human civilisation.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Today, 10 billion more trees are cut down than are planted every year. This destruction is a significant contributor to the carbon emissions that are driving the climate crisis. However, trees draw carbon dioxide back out of the atmosphere as they grow, and planting trees will need to play an important part in ending the climate emergency.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Forests are also a vital and rich habitat for wildlife.

Have a good weekend and stay safe \u2013KM US president Donald Trump is set to hold a press conference shortly, where he\u2019s expected to celebrate the jobs figures. You can follow that on our US live blog here: US stocks have extended their gains, with the Dow now trading higher by 3%. Global oil prices have climbed to three month highs above $40 a barrel on Friday, after reports emerged that members of the Opec oil cartel will agree to extend their historic oil production cuts. The world\u2019s largest oil producers are expected to sign off the agreement this weekend to continue holding back 9.7 million barrels of oil a day through the summer to prevent a market collapse due to the coronavirus crisis. The international oil price benchmark, Brent crude, climbed by $2.40, or 6%, to $42.39 a barrel on Friday afternoon. US oil prices rose $2.05, or almost 5.5%, to $39.46 a barrel. The original deal has helped oil prices to climb well above the lows seen in April when Brent crude fell to 21 year lows of $16 a barrel, and US prices turned negative for the first time. Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the Opec cartel, and Russia have reportedly agreed to extend the deal to at least the end of July while Riyadh continues to push for the cuts to remain in place through August. The meeting is scheduled to take place via webinar on Saturday. Bjornar Tonhaugen, the head of oil markets at Rystad Energy, said: It now seems very likely that OPEC+ will meet tomorrow to hash out a deal to extend the current May-June deep cuts for one more month. Wall Street was rip raring to go after the data release, and stocks are rallying at the start of trading. S&amp;P 500 is up 2% Dow is up 2.6% Nasdaq is up 0.8% European stocks have hit session highs on the back of the US jobs data: An interesting point by the former economic adviser to Joe Biden, about the sheer scale of the recovery needed to bounce back from the massive job losses so far: Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at AvaTrade, says the US unemployment rate \u201cmind-blowing number\u201d: The US unemployment rate has shocked everyone because the number was much lower than the market expectation. Speculators were whispering for 20%. This a mind-blowing number and shows that the economy is improving. Things are not as bad as many thought. This data, if it is a true reflection of the economy, is likely to speed up the recovery for the US economy. Covid-19\u2019s devastating assault on the US economy waned in May as the unemployment rate dipped to 13.3% and the US added another 2.5m jobs. The latest tally follows the loss of 20m jobs in April when unemployment hit 14.7%. In February the unemployment rate was just 3.5%. A decade\u2019s worth of gains made in the labor market since the last recession have been erased in just three months. All 50 states have now begun easing quarantine restrictions and the pace of this unprecedented hollowing has now slowed as some have returned to work but uncertainties remain. Weekly unemployment claims have plummeted from a frightening peak of 6.6m in April to 1.9m last week but Jason Reed, a professor of finance at the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Mendoza College of Business, said the numbers were still huge. He worried America is now witnessing a shift from temporary to permanent layoffs. With the pandemic still spreading, the true scale of Covid-19\u2019s impact on the US economy is yet to be determined. The headline figures do not show the loss of hours and income millions of people are experiencing or count many people who have been sidelined by the shutdown but have not yet claimed benefits. You can read the full report here: The surprise print on unemployment has been a massive boost for US futures with the Dow now up 2.3%. Safe haven assets are also losing their allure. Pantheon Macroeconomics\u2019 chief economist reckons that the surprise surge could be due to how easy it was to rehire staff that were originally let go at the start of the pandemic: It comes as US non-farm payrolls showed the economy actually grew by 2.5 million jobs. That compared to expectations for a loss of 8 million, according to a Reuter poll. BREAKING: The US unemployment rate has unexpectedly fallen to 13.3% in May. That is down from 14.7% in April. Economists had been expecting unemployment to reach 19.8%, according to a Reuters poll. Rail unions have threatened to strike over government plans for an \u201carmy\u201d of volunteers at transport hubs to remind travellers to wear a face covering, my colleagues Helen Pidd and Gwyn Topham write. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, announced the policy of using volunteers without consultation according to the RMT union, which condemned moves to put unpaid workers in \u201csafety critical roles\u201d. Face coverings will be mandatory on public transport in England from 15 June to help stop the transmission of coronavirus as more people go back to work, the government announced on Thursday. Speaking on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Friday, Shapps said passengers would also be encouraged to cover their face when entering bus and train stations with the help of volunteer \u201cjourney makers\u201d. The RMT general secretary, Mick Cash, said the Department for Transport had \u201cdone a backroom deal to recruit unpaid and unskilled workers on our railway without even so much as conversation with rail unions\u201d and the union would consider a strike ballot. Here\u2019s how US futures are looking ahead of the jobs report: Dow Jones futures are up 1.29% S&amp;P 500 futures are up 0.84% Nasdaq futures are up 0.17% Markets are rallying ahead of the US non-farm payrolls report and unemployment rate expected at 13.30pm this afternoon. We are expecting to see US unemployment creep towards 20%, but given optimism across markets it\u2019s unclear whether those historic figures will knock stocks from their current course. Conor Campbell, a financial analyst at SpreadEx, said: The Dow Jones is set to join in with this jubilance later this afternoon, with the futures suggesting the index will strike its own 3-month peak of 26600 courtesy of a 330 point increase. Standing in the Dow\u2019s way is a nonfarm jobs report potentially set to reveal that another 7.75 million jobs were lost last month. This as the unemployment rate shoots up to a staggering 19.4%. Wage growth, meanwhile is expected to pull back from 4.7% to 1% month-on-month, suggesting that more high-wage jobs vanished in May than in the low-wage wipe-out that hit in April. Sky is reporting that Ryanair is joining IAG in a potential challenge to the UK government\u2019s quarantining laws: Emma Wall, head of investment analyis at Hargreaves Lansdown says the stock market rebound in recent weeks has been \u201cextraordinary\u201d but says it may be too soon to celebrate. The rally in global markets from the lows of March have been welcomed by professional and individual investors alike. Quite a few funds are in positive territory year to date now, having clawed back the coronavirus-related losses. Certain sectors in particular have recovered well; many US and global funds are posting gains year to date. This is an interesting juxtaposition with the 2008 global financial crisis when markets and funds took considerably longer to get back into the black. There is some nervousness that the rally is too quick too soon, and another dip is on its way \u2013 particularly if you take heed of bond markets. The issue is that while sentiment is improving, the fundamentals haven\u2019t changed, she said. Most economies are still imposing restrictions, even if lockdowns are slowly being eased. There is also political and social unrest growing globally, the incredibly important Black Live Matters movement has the potential to cause market volatility, as do the new rules imposed on Hong Kong. In the short-term, investors should prepare for more market volatility. If bond markets are to be believed, we\u2019re entering a period of very low growth and very low inflation - but equities disagree. As ever, a balanced and well-diversified portfolio is the best way to hedge your bets. Tim Davie, the head of BBC Studios who turned down an offer to run the Premier League last year, has been appointed as the corporation\u2019s next director general. Davie, 53, who has responsibility for monetising brands from Top Gear to Doctor Who around the world, was considered the frontrunner to take over from Tony Hall. Davie was selected by the BBC board from a shortlist of candidates that included Charlotte Moore, the BBC\u2019s director of content, Will Lewis, the former chief executive of the publisher of the Wall Street Journal, and Doug Gurr, the head of Amazon\u2019s UK and Ireland operations. His appointment comes in spite of calls to appoint a woman to the most senior role at the BBC for the first time in its history. A former Procter &amp; Gamble and Pepsi marketer, Davie previously ran the BBC\u2019s audio and music operation and acted as director general during the Savile crisis, before Lord Hall was appointed. Last year Davie turned down an offer to be chief executive of the Premier League. Davie, who joined the BBC in 2005 as head of marketing, is the corporation\u2019s top-paid executive, taking home \u00a3642,000 last year. He will have to take a significant pay cut; Hall received \u00a3475,000 in pay and benefits. You can read more here: BREAKING: Tim Davie has been appointed as the next director general of the BBC. He is set to take up his post on 1 September. Bentley has confirmed that it is aiming to cut 1,000 jobs through a voluntary redundancy scheme, shrinking its workforce by almost a quarter as it responds to the coronavirus pandemic. The luxury carmaker warned that it cannot rule out future compulsory redundancies, as the pandemic cuts demand for cars. Bentley, whose 4,200 workers are mainly based in Crewe, Cheshire, said it was already planning to restructure as it switches from internal combustion engine products towards hybrids that also contain battery-powered vehicles. The job losses come a day after 2,000 redundancies were announced at sports car maker Aston Martin and car dealer Lookers. Sports car maker McLaren has also said it will cut 1,200 jobs. Adrian Hallmark, Bentley\u2019s chief executive, also warned that a no-deal Brexit could \u201ccompound the coronavirus disaster\u201d, ahead of an end-of-month deadline to agree a deal or an extension beyond 31 December. \u201cMy message to politicians is this: please don\u2019t push us off a second cliff,\u201d he told the Financial Times. The UK arm of Victoria\u2019s Secret has filed for protection from creditors, the Wall Street Journal (\u00a3) is reporting. It says the company\u2019s owner L Brands is using the \u201clight touch administration\u201d tool to block claims on its unpaid debts as it tried to weather the coronavirus crisis. The move allows the company to keep running the businesses, with administrators\u2019 consent. The report says that it could eventually lead to the sale of the business. Staggering flight statistic picked up by our reporter Joanna Partridge: The comments from IAG chief Willie Walsh have done nothing to dampen appetite for the airline group\u2019s shares. IAG is up 11% and is the best performing stock on the FTSE 100. It\u2019s followed close behind by Carnival, despite having suspending all of its cruises in the US and Canada for 2020, according to Reuters. It comes as all European stock markets extend their gains, with French and Italian leading the pack are rising more than 2% each. The boss of British Airways-owner IAG has blamed the UK plans to quarantine arrivals for 14 days for having \u2018torpedoed\u2019 lans to start flying in July. Speaking to Sky News, Willie Walsh confirmed he was speaking to to lawyers about challenging the UK\u2019s quarantine rules. While BA recently set out plans to cut up to 12,000 jobs to offset the worst impact of the pandemic, Walsh said on Friday that no final decision had yet been made on actual job losses. Britain\u2019s financial watchdog has launched 30 enforcement investigations into firms that have given bad advice to customers about transferring out of their defined benefit pension schemes, my colleague Mark Sweney writes. The Financial Conduct Authority has banned financial advisers from getting paid only when a customer transfers a pension, known as contingent charging, which creates a bias for advisers to recommend a transfer. The watchdog said the move to investigate 30 firms followed its latest review of the pension transfer market, which it has been monitoring since consumers were given the freedom in 2015 to move their pension pots between schemes or to withdraw their money. Christopher Woolard, the interim chief executive of the FCA, said: The proportion of customers who have been advised to transfer out of their defined benefit pension is unacceptably high. While much of the advice we looked at was suitable, we are still finding too many cases in which transfers were not in the customer\u2019s best interests. The FCA also published a review of the British Steel pension scheme, where members have been \u201cpreyed on\u201d by advisers getting about \u00a36,000 per case they convinced to transfer out. In a review of 192 cases of steel workers, 47% were found to have been given unsuitable advice and 32% had \u201cinformation gaps\u201d. The FCA, which has already written to almost 4,000 former scheme members advising them how to complain, intends to contact all members. BBC economics editor Faisal Islam details the news that Richard Hughs will be taking over from Robert Chote as the head of the Office for Budget Responsibility. Administrators of Neil Woodford\u2019s failed flagship investment fund have announced the sale of \u201ca significant portion\u201d of the equity income fund\u2019s remaining assets. The sale will help it make another tranche of payments to investors who have been trapped in the fund for a year, having been suspended following a surge in redemptions last June. Link Fund Solutions said in a letter this morning: We are now able to confirm to investors in the Fund that we have reached agreement with Acacia Research Corporation (\u201cAcacia\u201d) for the sale of an agreed selection of up to 19 of the fund\u2019s healthcare assets in return for up to \u00a3223.9m Link said the sale could take up to six months to complete and was not able to confirm the exact dates and amount that would be paid out (it\u2019s unlikely to the full amount of the sale, given that admin costs are shaved off). Meanwhile, law firm Nelsons has confirmed it is now looking at a possible claim against Link for failing to deal with Woodford\u2019s illiquidity issues sooner. They\u2019ve also claimed that to have received more than 300 enquiries from investors interested in suing Hargreaves Lansdown for promoting Woodford and its Equity Income Fund as \u2018best buys\u2019. Worth noting that the Halifax house price data is far more optimistic than what we saw from Nationwide earlier this week. ( Nationwide\u2019s data showed average prices tumbling 1.7% in May from the previous month, to \u00a3218,902. That was the biggest monthly fall since February 2009.) The Halifax house price index shows a further 0.2% month-on-month decline in May, as continued lockdown measures took their toll on the housing market. The average price of a house in the UK was \u00a3237,808. The annual figures are far more optimistic, though, showing a 2.6% increase from the same month last year. Russell Galley, Managing Director, Halifax, said: This is the third successive monthly fall, though more modest than in April, and reflects a continued loss of momentum following what was a strong start to the year. Though it should still be noted that with a limited number of transactions available, calculating average house prices remains challenging and increased volatility is to be expected. The easing of restrictions in mid-May on property viewings has eased some of the fears about a long-term decline and has given a short-term boost to buyers and homeowners trying to re-start transaction that had been put on hold. Galley says: Looking ahead, we expect market activity to increase progressively as restrictions are eased further across the whole of the UK and we continue to have confidence in the underlying health of the housing market over the long-term. However, the extent of downward pressure on market confidence and prices over the coming months will depend on how quickly the economy is able to recover from the effects of the pandemic and the available government policy support for jobs and households. Back to that dismal GfK consumer confidence data. Joe Staton, GfK\u2019s client strategy director, said: Against a backdrop of falling house prices, soaring jobless claims, and with no sign of a rapid V-shaped bounce-back on the cards, consumers remain pessimistic about the state of their finances and the wider economic picture for the year to come. He notes that the only \u201cbright spark\u201d is in the figures for major purchases (as in, expensive items), which is pointing to pent up demand by shoppers across the UK despite most shops remaining shut. But looking at the next chart, there does seem to be some stabilisation following the sharp drop in March and April, and there may be hope that - barring a second peak in Covid-19 infections - that consumer sentiment will start to bounce back Staton said: As the lockdown eases, it will be interesting to see just how the consumer appetite for spending returns in a world of socially-distanced shopping and the seismic shift to online retailing \u2013 alongside worries of a fresh spike in COVID-19 cases as relaxations increase. The euro surged yesterday after the ECB ramped up its coronavirus response by agreeing to inject an additional \u20ac600bn (\u00a3539.5bn) of emergency financial support into the Eurozone economy. It\u2019s meant that the currency has dominated peers including the pound, which is at its lowest level in over two months against the euro. The pound has performed better against the greenback, with dollar weakness helping push the sterling to near three-month highs. After ending Thursday\u2019s session in the red (which analysts have chalked up to profit taking) European shares are back in positive territory this morning: FTSE 100 is up 0.6% France\u2019s CAC 40 is up 1% Germany\u2019s XETRA DAX is up 1.1% Spain\u2019s IBEX is up 1.4% Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets and business. Consumer confidence took a dive in May to the lowest level since the global financial crisis. That\u2019s according to the latest GfK consumer confidence index, which fell to -36 in second half of the month, amid worries over a surge in unemployment and tumbling house prices during the Covid-19 lockdown. (We\u2019ll get an update on house prices when Halifax releases their data at 8:30am) That GfK reading was the lowest since the banking crash in January 2009, and is close to record lows of -39 recorded in July 2008. However, the release is not expected to dampen overall sentiment on equity markets, with the FTSE 100 and its European peers all set to rise when markets open at 8am. And all eyes will turn to US non-farm payrolls for May this afternoon. As jobless numbers continue to mount during the pandemic, we\u2019re expecting to see the US unemployment rate edge closer to 20%. Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, says: With certain sections of the US economy slowly reopening, there is a hope that we could start to see the unemployment rate start to plateau as more and more people return to work after being furloughed.

The European manufacturer\u2019s job cuts in the UK are expected to fall mainly on the vast factory in Broughton, north Wales, which produces wings for commercial planes such as the A320 and A350. When compulsory redundancies are included, it is likely that UK job losses will be multiple times higher. One option under consideration was to offer voluntary redundancy to 500 workers, focusing on those nearer to retirement, a person with knowledge of discussions said. However, another source cautioned that no final decision had been made and it was only one of a number of options as the manufacturer prepared for years of lower demand. Airbus said in April it would cut the number of planes it built by a third. Airlines around the world have cancelled or delayed orders for new aircraft as their fleets remained grounded. The production cuts have led to the expectation of thousands of job cuts across Airbus\u2019s global operations. Boeing, Airbus\u2019s US rival, has said it will cut a tenth of its global workforce of 160,000, with 12,000 cuts already decided. Bombardier, which makes business jets, said on Friday it would cut 2,500 jobs, mainly in Canada. Rolls-Royce, the British jet engine manufacturer, has plans to cut 9,000 jobs, with a voluntary redundancy scheme underway. Guillaume Faury, Airbus\u2019s chief executive, has said it could take five years for commercial aviation demand to recover to pre-pandemic levels. Airbus has already made steep cuts to the numbers of contractors at Broughton. About 500 workers employed by the Guidant staffing agency have been told they will not return to work. Airbus employed 14,000 workers in the UK before the crisis, including 6,000 at Broughton.

This puts the daily infection rate at 5,600 compared with almost 8,000 in last week\u2019s figures.</p> \n<p>Peter Benton, the director of population and public policy operations at the ONS, said: \u201cThat, we think, is a real reduction in the number of people being infected.\u201d</p> \n<p>Previously, the ONS had said the trend looked flat and stable, but as more data has accumulated a downward trend is now evident, the analysis said.</p> \n<p>However, Benton said it remained a concern that of those who had tested positive in the study so far, only 30% had reported experiencing any symptoms either when the swab was taken or in the weeks before or after, suggesting that in the majority of cases, people may be unaware they are infected.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2020-06-05T12:10:31/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graph\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2020-06-05T12:10:31/embed.html\">Graph</a> \n <figcaption> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWhilst the rates are going down \u2026 we\u2019re still finding about 70% of those testing positive aren\u2019t reporting any symptoms either at the visit when they have a swab or the visit before and after,\u201d said Benton. \u201cIt does mean there\u2019s a risk that a number of us might be out and about, positive, infectious and don\u2019t know it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Those working outside their homes were found to be three times as likely to test positive, and those working in patient-facing healthcare roles had a six times greater risk of infection.</p> \n<p>Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said the risk to those in patient-facing jobs was an important finding. \u201cThis significantly higher figure suggests that a significant part of the current Covid-19 epidemic may be an infection control issue rather than a series of community outbreaks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe control strategies are different in hospitals and care homes, which require infection control, whilst community transmission requires social distancing and contact-tracing.\u201d</p> \n<p>The ONS snapshot data appears to show a steeper downward trend than Public Health England reports of new confirmed cases and hospital admissions. Although most regions have shown a downward trajectory, in some areas the trend has only been marginal and the overall reproduction number, R, has been hovering close to 1. The <a href=\"https://epiforecasts.io/covid/posts/national/united-kingdom/\">latest analysis</a> by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine\u2019s modelling team suggests that the current halving rate for the epidemic in the UK is about two months and that nationally R is 0.9-1.</p> \n<p>The slight rise in R revealed on Friday is likely to cause some concern.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"e60c6aea-b500-4a5a-b6af-b1d99f7d0511\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>R, or the 'effective reproduction number', is a way of rating a disease\u2019s ability to spread. It\u2019s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out \u2013 eventually.</p>\n    <p>At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 \u2013 higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.</p>\n    <p>The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus; people's behaviour, such as social distancing;&nbsp;and a population\u2019s immunity. A country may see regional variations in its R number, depending on local factors like population density and transport patterns.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-devlin\"><b>Hannah Devlin</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Science correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A key issue is that R is a figure that covers all settings; it does not simply reflect transmission in the community \u2013 which is particularly important&nbsp;when it comes to lifting restrictions&nbsp;\u2013 but is an overall figure that includes care homes. Experts have previously cautioned that outbreaks in care homes and hospitals may be raising the overall R value.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>There are also some differences in R depending upon the source because different research&nbsp;groups calculate the number in slightly different ways. The figure released by the government takes these different approaches into account, and combines the results, yielding a range for the R number.</p> \n<p>Experts say that as the overall number of cases reaches low levels, outbreaks will still be seen but R will become less important.

      "bodyText": "The R value in England has risen to between 0.7 and 1, according to the government\u2019s latest official estimates, with some regions now at risk of seeing a rise in the number of infections. The latest data suggests the north-west is an area of concern and some local authorities may have R values \u2013 the rate of transmission \u2013 above 1, at which point the epidemic will begin to grow in these communities. The estimates come as data from the Office for National Statistics suggested Covid-19 cases had fallen significantly in recent weeks, with the number of people infected in England roughly halved in the second half of May. The snapshot infection survey, covering the last two weeks in May, found that during that period an estimated 53,000 people were infected at any time. This puts the daily infection rate at 5,600 compared with almost 8,000 in last week\u2019s figures. Peter Benton, the director of population and public policy operations at the ONS, said: \u201cThat, we think, is a real reduction in the number of people being infected.\u201d Previously, the ONS had said the trend looked flat and stable, but as more data has accumulated a downward trend is now evident, the analysis said. However, Benton said it remained a concern that of those who had tested positive in the study so far, only 30% had reported experiencing any symptoms either when the swab was taken or in the weeks before or after, suggesting that in the majority of cases, people may be unaware they are infected. \u201cWhilst the rates are going down \u2026 we\u2019re still finding about 70% of those testing positive aren\u2019t reporting any symptoms either at the visit when they have a swab or the visit before and after,\u201d said Benton. \u201cIt does mean there\u2019s a risk that a number of us might be out and about, positive, infectious and don\u2019t know it.\u201d Those working outside their homes were found to be three times as likely to test positive, and those working in patient-facing healthcare roles had a six times greater risk of infection. Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said the risk to those in patient-facing jobs was an important finding. \u201cThis significantly higher figure suggests that a significant part of the current Covid-19 epidemic may be an infection control issue rather than a series of community outbreaks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe control strategies are different in hospitals and care homes, which require infection control, whilst community transmission requires social distancing and contact-tracing.\u201d The ONS snapshot data appears to show a steeper downward trend than Public Health England reports of new confirmed cases and hospital admissions. Although most regions have shown a downward trajectory, in some areas the trend has only been marginal and the overall reproduction number, R, has been hovering close to 1. The latest analysis by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine\u2019s modelling team suggests that the current halving rate for the epidemic in the UK is about two months and that nationally R is 0.9-1. The slight rise in R revealed on Friday is likely to cause some concern. A key issue is that R is a figure that covers all settings; it does not simply reflect transmission in the community \u2013 which is particularly important when it comes to lifting restrictions \u2013 but is an overall figure that includes care homes. Experts have previously cautioned that outbreaks in care homes and hospitals may be raising the overall R value. There are also some differences in R depending upon the source because different research groups calculate the number in slightly different ways. The figure released by the government takes these different approaches into account, and combines the results, yielding a range for the R number. Experts say that as the overall number of cases reaches low levels, outbreaks will still be seen but R will become less important. That is because in a local outbreak the R value would look high, but the number of infections would be low and the outbreak would be in a small area, and therefore controllable. However if R rises above 1 and stays there, the situation could quickly become problematic. The impact of the first wave of relaxation measures around lockdown rules is unlikely to be reflected in the R number until next week.",

The extension of the ban on non-essential travel by foreign nationals into the EU\u2019s border free-travel zone was approved by the EU\u2019s 27 home affairs ministers on Friday by video conference. The travel ban, which will be extended until 1 July, had been due to expire on 15 June and applies to all non-EU countries, with exemptions for citizens from EU-associated countries Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. British travellers also remain exempt from the ban but face two-week quarantine requirements from some European governments. The EU\u2019s home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, told journalists that \u201calmost all member states\u201d had expressed \u201ca strong preference for a further but short prolongation\u201d of the ban.

Both Spain and Italy have large tourist industries, which they are anxious to reopen to get their economies moving. European governments have already begun to open borders with selected neighbours, resulting in a cat\u2019s cradle of rules, but several are excluding the UK, which has the highest official death toll in Europe. Britons arriving in France and Spain are required to go into quarantine for 14 days, which is in part a reciprocal measure matching the UK\u2019s two-week isolation period imposed on foreign visitors. Germany continues to discourage its citizens from travelling to the UK. On Friday the Czech Republic became the latest country to ease restrictions, when it announced it was opening its borders with Germany and Austria 10 days ahead of schedule. Travellers from those countries were free to enter the Czech Republic from noon local time without going into quarantine or having to provide a negative coronavirus test.

Spain requires foreign arrivals to go into quarantine for two weeks, but has hinted that the requirement could end sooner than the planned date of 1 July. The Spanish government has said it wants to welcome British tourists this summer but it depends on the British quarantine policy. In other European developments on Friday, Sweden reported 1,056 confirmed new cases, the third day in a row the Scandinavian country \u2013 which has taken a light-touch approach to Covid-19, relying on citizens\u2019 civic responsibility rather than a mandatory lockdown \u2013 has recorded more than 1,000 infections. Chief epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, who said this week that if faced with the virus now Sweden would probably \u201cdo something in between what we did and what the rest of the world has done\u201d, told a news conference on Thursday that the new cases were was mainly in western Sweden and among younger people. Authorities reported 77 more deaths, bringing the total to 4,639, which equates to a death toll per million many times higher than its Nordic neighbours\u2019 but not as high as the UK, Italy or Spain or Belgium, all of which also imposed stricter lockdowns. In France, the head of the government\u2019s scientific advisory council said the virus was \u201ccirculating slowly\u201d but it could \u201creasonably be said\u201d it was under control. More than 50% of people in Spain \u2013 but not those in the Madrid or Barcelona regions \u2013 will enter the fourth and final phase of lockdown de-escalation on Monday, in which restaurants can serve diners indoors and shops, cinemas and theatres can open at 50% capacity. Turkey cancelled a weekend lockdown announced late on Thursday after a public backlash, but warned daily cases were rising. Ireland is accelerating its exit from lockdown by expanding it travel limit and reopening shops, playgrounds, libraries and other facilities from Monday. No D-Day veterans will attend the anniversary of the Allied landings in Normandy, France for for the first time in 75 years.

People know they\u2019re under threat, people know they\u2019re overcrowded, people know they have to go out and earn a living.

Mendes started out as a theatre director and launched his film career with the Oscar-winning American Beauty after he had spent several years at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/donmar-warehouse\">Donmar Warehouse</a> in London.</p> <p>While the careers of those in theatre have suffered in recent months, there are many, he writes, \u201cwhom Covid-19 has made rich\u201d.

He urges the continuation of the job retention scheme and a package to support theatre\u2019s vital freelance workforce.</p> <p>Asking for an increase in the rate for theatre\u2019s tax-relief scheme, from 20% to 50%, Mendes invites the government to become a \u201ctheatrical angel\u201d akin to the private individuals who invest in productions and share in the profits of successful shows. \u201cThis is not a request for a handout, or for long-term life support,\u201d he writes, calling on the government to commit to a Cultural Investment Participation Scheme. \u201cIt is an offer for the government to become partners in a successful business.\u201d</p> <p>The Cultural Investment Participation Scheme was outlined last month by <a href=\"https://solt.co.uk/about-london-theatre/press-office/solt-and-uk-theatre-continue-to-work-with-government-to-find-solutions-for-the-theatre-industry/\">the Society of London Theatre</a><a href=\"https://solt.co.uk/about-london-theatre/press-office/solt-and-uk-theatre-continue-to-work-with-government-to-find-solutions-for-the-theatre-industry/\"> and UK Theatre</a>, which submitted a paper to&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-digital-culture-media-sport\">Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport</a> proposing a series of practical solutions to support the theatre industry, amid warnings that 70%&nbsp;of theatres will run out of cash by the end of 2020.

He continues: \u201cIt would be deeply ironic if the streaming services \u2013 Netflix, Amazon Prime et al \u2013 should be making lockdown millions from our finest acting, producing, writing and directing talent, while the very arts culture that nurtured that talent pool is allowed to die.\u201d He calls upon the titans of those industries to \u201cuse a fraction of their Covid-19 windfall\u201d to support the performing arts during the crisis. But Mendes goes further, detailing practical propositions for steering theatre through the period of shutdown and recognising the impracticalities of staging economically viable productions for socially distanced audiences in venues. He urges the continuation of the job retention scheme and a package to support theatre\u2019s vital freelance workforce. Asking for an increase in the rate for theatre\u2019s tax-relief scheme, from 20% to 50%, Mendes invites the government to become a \u201ctheatrical angel\u201d akin to the private individuals who invest in productions and share in the profits of successful shows. \u201cThis is not a request for a handout, or for long-term life support,\u201d he writes, calling on the government to commit to a Cultural Investment Participation Scheme. \u201cIt is an offer for the government to become partners in a successful business.\u201d The Cultural Investment Participation Scheme was outlined last month by the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre, which submitted a paper to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport proposing a series of practical solutions to support the theatre industry, amid warnings that 70% of theatres will run out of cash by the end of 2020. The paper points out theatre generates \u00a3133m in VAT payments for the Treasury in London alone: \u201cWe want the government to invest in our sector so we can continue to play our vital role in Britain\u2019s future success and help the UK\u2019s recovery.\u201d",

Which people, exactly, would you randomise? Everyone who lives in a particular street? Everyone who catches a particular bus? To be included in a randomised trial, people have to give informed consent and agree to comply with the intervention. If only a small proportion agrees, how many streets or bus-loads or squares-full of people would you need to invite in order to get enough to generate your \u201cfact\u201d?</p> <p>How would you test the hypothesis that <em>my</em> mask protects <em>you</em>? This is problematic because, instead of just following up with one individual who is already signed up to the study (me), you\u2019d somehow need to identify a fraction of all the people I came into contact with as I went about my life, and test each of them to see if they developed the disease. But none of those other people (random street-dwellers or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/fewer-than-four-in-10-people-in-uk-wear-a-face-covering-guardian-survey\">bus passengers</a> or square-crossers) agreed to be in the trial in the first place. You simply can\u2019t study them like laboratory animals (though someone has done a randomised controlled trial to show that face coverings are highly effective in reducing SARS-CoV-2 <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa644/5848814\">transmission in hamsters</a>).</p> <p>In order to \u201cdo science\u201d on the effectiveness of face coverings in the real world, you would either have to define some kind of closed system to be your sampling frame, say a school or home environment, or compromise and study the effect of mask-wearing on the <em>wearer</em> rather than on other people. And that\u2019s what scientists have done.</p> <p>I\u2019ve reviewed all the published <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jep.13415\">randomised trials on masks and face coverings</a> for the general public in a peer-reviewed scientific paper. The trials consist of studies of mask-wearing in closed systems and of masks to protect the wearer, usually at specific mass events (notably, pilgrimages to the Hajj).

      "bodyText": "Jacob Rees-Mogg has praised local BBC programming and said it \u201cmust be kept up\u201d after the public service broadcaster admitted it was considering cutting both the award-winning Inside Out series of investigative programmes and regional political debate shows in England. Rees-Mogg, the Conservative MP for North East Somerset and the leader of the House of Commons, noted that David Garmston, who presents Sunday Politics West \u2013 one of the programmes facing the axe \u2013 was \u201cone of the most popular figures around and it is very important that local television is kept up.\u201d Somerset\u2019s daily BBC news programme, Points West, was \u201cmore watched, proportionately, than EastEnders, which is an indication of how popular these programmes are and the local service that they provide\u201d, Rees Mogg added. But despite this support, he said the future of BBC programming was a matter for the BBC when asked to grant a parliamentary debate on the issue by Liz Twist, the Labour MP for Blaydon in Tyneside. Twist has written to Helen Thomas, the BBC\u2019s director of English Regions, asking for the rationale behind the cuts to regional programming. \u201cRegional television output has performed strongly during the current pandemic and has provided balanced, professional and forensic reporting,\u201d wrote Twist. \u201cIt is vitally important that communities in the north-east and across the UK are given a voice, and that our politicians can be held to account.\u201d She called on Thomas to justify the decision, asking: \u201cAt a time when our regions are feeling increasingly disconnected and left behind from Westminster politics, how does the BBC intend to continue to serve our local communities and provide scrutiny to our elected representatives?\u201d Other MPs have criticised the move. Jacob Young, the Tory MP for Redcar on Teesside, tweeted: \u201cRegional Politics shows are so important to help understand what\u2019s going on in our area. The politics of the north-east are very different to that of London. [Presenter Richard Moss] and team have always been professional, insightful &amp; balanced in their programming- hoping to see a return soon.\u201d Simon Clarke, the Conservative MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s extremely concerning that Politics North has no return date. It\u2019s a good programme, produces insightful reports and constitutes an all-too-rare extended format for debate on key regional issues. Hope @BBCNews will ensure it comes back to our screens.\u201d The broadcaster has previously said it will need to make a further \u00a3125m of spending cuts as a result of the coronavirus pandemic hitting commercial revenue and licence fee payment. A BBC spokesperson said: \u201cWe\u2019ve cancelled the second series of Inside Out this year and will continue with our single political programme for England through to the summer. These decisions allow us to prioritise our resources while providing the best possible service for our audiences during the current situation. \u201cSeparately we are taking a thorough look at what we do in England.

      "body": "<p>The Tory MP spearheading efforts to promote the Covid-19 contact-tracing app trial on the Isle of Wight appears to have broken lockdown rules at a barbecue also attended by the chairman of the Brexit party and political journalists, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>Bob Seely went to the evening gathering hosted by the Spectator magazine\u2019s deputy editor, Freddy Gray, in the village of Seaview on the island last month. Richard Tice, the Brexit party chairman, and his partner, the political journalist Isabel Oakeshott, were also there.</p> <p>Seely said he was unaware others would be present when he arrived for a meeting, and that at all times social distancing was followed.</p> <p>At the time, there was strict guidance against groups mixing from different households or people visiting and entering another person\u2019s home, with the health secretary stipulating that that included gardens.</p> <p>Seely, who has been a strong advocate of the government\u2019s coronavirus app being trialled on the island, attended the barbecue with his partner. He has pushed the government\u2019s stay-at-home message, as well as highlighting warnings against people visiting second homes. In March, Seely urged new visitors to the island to self-isolate for at least a week, adding: \u201cWe need to do what we can to make sure our NHS is not overwhelmed.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement issued to his local paper after he was approached by the Guardian, Seely said: \u201cAs the island\u2019s MP, I have had a lot of dialogue with local residents over recent weeks. The vast majority of these have been over the phone or the internet. A handful of these \u2013 when requested \u2013 have been in person, at a 2-metre distance and outside.</p> <p>\u201cI was in Seaview two weeks ago undertaking constituency work. Whilst there, I agreed to visit someone who wanted to discuss the app. He is a journalist and an acquaintance. When I arrived, I saw another couple of people there, which I was not expecting. I thought about leaving, but felt that was perhaps overreacting.</p> <p>\u201cI apologise because, on balance, I called this wrong. It would have been better to have spoken to this person without any others nearby.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cAt a sensible distance, we talked in the garden. The others left 15 minutes later, and I stayed to talk with this person [Gray] for a further 20 minutes or so. I then left. I didn\u2019t go inside any building, nor did I have a drink. As it was after normal working hours, my girlfriend was with me.</p> <p>\u201cIn the interests of being transparent, I am happy to confirm that, as the island\u2019s MP, I have had a very small number of other such face-to-face conversations \u2013 again at a social distance \u2013 over recent weeks with other people on the Isle of Wight (such as council, media and public health representatives) when requested.\u201d</p> <p>Gray conceded he invited Seely over to discuss the contact-tracing app after they fell out over a recent article he had written, but stressed that the MP did not drink any alcohol and \u201cdidn\u2019t stay long\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>Tice and Oakeshott did not deny their attendance and made reference to testing their eyesight \u2013 an apparent nod to the reason given by the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, for driving to a beauty spot during lockdown.&nbsp;</p> <p>Oakeshott is thought to have been staying last month at her nearby apartment in Seaview, a second home which she purchased in 2018. Government rules have stated that people must remain in their primary residence, specifying that essential travel does not include visits to second homes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Gray\u2019s wife was also present at the gathering on Friday 22 May, as well as his family. </p> <p>The property in Seaview, part of a building split into flats with gardens, is owned by Gray\u2019s mother-in-law, according to Land Registry records. On 3 May, Gray wrote a piece for the Spectator in which he said he had been staying on the Isle of Wight at his mother-in-law\u2019s property. In the article, in which he questioned whether the island was the best place to launch the tracing app, he wrote: \u201cI should admit that I am one of the dreaded \u2018DFL\u2019 (Down From London) visitors, whom most islanders despise.\u201d</p> <p>At the time of the gathering, lockdown measures had only been eased, on 13 May, to the point of allowing one person to meet one other from a different household in public outdoor settings as long as they stayed more than 2 metres apart.&nbsp;</p> <p>The government\u2019s guidance stated that people could not \u201cgather in a group of more than two (excluding members of your own household), except for a few specific exceptions set out in law (for work, funerals, house moves, supporting the vulnerable, in emergencies and to fulfil legal obligations)\u201d.</p> <p>A day before the new measures were introduced on 13 May, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, stressed that people should not meet in a person\u2019s garden. He told This Morning: \u201cWe are not recommending that people do that [meet others] in their own gardens.\u201d Measures have since been relaxed so that up to six people can meet outdoors, including in gardens.</p> <p>Last month, the Guardian revealed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/22/dominic-cummings-durham-trip-coronavirus-lockdown\">Cummings</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/22/dominic-cummings-durham-trip-coronavirus-lockdown\"> travelled 264 miles</a> from London to Durham with his family during lockdown. During his time in the north-east, he drove to Barnard Castle with his wife and child, saying he needed to test his eyesight before a long drive.</p> <p>Gray told the Guardian: \u201cYou\u2019ve busted me. I did invite Bob over to discuss the app \u2013 since we had had a falling out over the article I had written. I did not, however, tell him that it would be a massive rave in the garden involving children flagrantly eating barbecue food, champagne and a baby being flung around.</p> <p>\u201cBob didn\u2019t stay long. I apologised for having caused him distress with my app article and he said no hard feelings. We talked about a follow-up piece on how the app was performing, as I moved on to white wine. Bob didn\u2019t drink \u2013 though I believe he may have eaten one or possibly two sausages.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"961bb1a72a2c15781beabf17b3c6274a6913cd7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/961bb1a72a2c15781beabf17b3c6274a6913cd7b/0_369_2187_1312/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Isabel Oakeshott.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isabel Oakeshott.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Forsyth/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Asked for comment about his attendance at the gathering and to explain the purpose of his visit to the Isle of Wight, Tice said: \u201cI have followed the prime minister\u2019s advice to wash my hands, stay alert, maintain social distancing and test my eyesight when appropriate.\u201d</p> <p>Oakeshott said: \u201cI work on the Isle of Wight all year round. It is where I go to write. I have stayed alert, washed my hands regularly and, as always, enjoyed my time on this paradise isle. Now and again I\u2019ve also tested my eyesight, which seems to be in good order. Along with the rest of the nation, I am delighted at the recent decriminalisation of barbecues.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Kirsty Brimelow QC, of Doughty Street Chambers, said: \u201cThe law at that time prohibited a person leaving or being outside where they were living without reasonable excuse. Amendments on 13 May 2020 did relax the law, including a reasonable excuse as being in a public open space for \u2018open-air recreation\u2019 with one member of another household. However, it did not include a private garden.</p> <p>\u201cIt is likely that going to a private barbecue would not have been a reasonable excuse. The regulations were and are draconian and often illogical with no obvious foundation in health advice. However, there have been upwards of 17,000 fixed penalty notices issued to members of the public for breaching the regulations. The government should set up a panel to review all fixed penalty notices. Otherwise unfairness and lack of trust will continue. Laws are meaningless if they are unfairly applied.\u201d</p> <p>Ian Lavery MP the former chair of the Labour party said it appeared that Seely had broken lockdown rules, adding: \u201cBob Seely\u2019s actions are extremely concerning and should be taken very seriously. Boris Johnson claimed to be taking back control of the Covid-19 pandemic but this is just the latest example that shows he can\u2019t even control his own MPs.\u201d</p>",

It would have been better to have spoken to this person without any others nearby.\u201d He added: \u201cAt a sensible distance, we talked in the garden. The others left 15 minutes later, and I stayed to talk with this person [Gray] for a further 20 minutes or so. I then left. I didn\u2019t go inside any building, nor did I have a drink. As it was after normal working hours, my girlfriend was with me. \u201cIn the interests of being transparent, I am happy to confirm that, as the island\u2019s MP, I have had a very small number of other such face-to-face conversations \u2013 again at a social distance \u2013 over recent weeks with other people on the Isle of Wight (such as council, media and public health representatives) when requested.\u201d Gray conceded he invited Seely over to discuss the contact-tracing app after they fell out over a recent article he had written, but stressed that the MP did not drink any alcohol and \u201cdidn\u2019t stay long\u201d. Tice and Oakeshott did not deny their attendance and made reference to testing their eyesight \u2013 an apparent nod to the reason given by the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, for driving to a beauty spot during lockdown. Oakeshott is thought to have been staying last month at her nearby apartment in Seaview, a second home which she purchased in 2018. Government rules have stated that people must remain in their primary residence, specifying that essential travel does not include visits to second homes. Gray\u2019s wife was also present at the gathering on Friday 22 May, as well as his family. The property in Seaview, part of a building split into flats with gardens, is owned by Gray\u2019s mother-in-law, according to Land Registry records. On 3 May, Gray wrote a piece for the Spectator in which he said he had been staying on the Isle of Wight at his mother-in-law\u2019s property. In the article, in which he questioned whether the island was the best place to launch the tracing app, he wrote: \u201cI should admit that I am one of the dreaded \u2018DFL\u2019 (Down From London) visitors, whom most islanders despise.\u201d At the time of the gathering, lockdown measures had only been eased, on 13 May, to the point of allowing one person to meet one other from a different household in public outdoor settings as long as they stayed more than 2 metres apart. The government\u2019s guidance stated that people could not \u201cgather in a group of more than two (excluding members of your own household), except for a few specific exceptions set out in law (for work, funerals, house moves, supporting the vulnerable, in emergencies and to fulfil legal obligations)\u201d. A day before the new measures were introduced on 13 May, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, stressed that people should not meet in a person\u2019s garden. He told This Morning: \u201cWe are not recommending that people do that [meet others] in their own gardens.\u201d Measures have since been relaxed so that up to six people can meet outdoors, including in gardens. Last month, the Guardian revealed that Cummings travelled 264 miles from London to Durham with his family during lockdown. During his time in the north-east, he drove to Barnard Castle with his wife and child, saying he needed to test his eyesight before a long drive. Gray told the Guardian: \u201cYou\u2019ve busted me. I did invite Bob over to discuss the app \u2013 since we had had a falling out over the article I had written. I did not, however, tell him that it would be a massive rave in the garden involving children flagrantly eating barbecue food, champagne and a baby being flung around. \u201cBob didn\u2019t stay long. I apologised for having caused him distress with my app article and he said no hard feelings. We talked about a follow-up piece on how the app was performing, as I moved on to white wine. Bob didn\u2019t drink \u2013 though I believe he may have eaten one or possibly two sausages.\u201d Asked for comment about his attendance at the gathering and to explain the purpose of his visit to the Isle of Wight, Tice said: \u201cI have followed the prime minister\u2019s advice to wash my hands, stay alert, maintain social distancing and test my eyesight when appropriate.\u201d Oakeshott said: \u201cI work on the Isle of Wight all year round. It is where I go to write. I have stayed alert, washed my hands regularly and, as always, enjoyed my time on this paradise isle. Now and again I\u2019ve also tested my eyesight, which seems to be in good order. Along with the rest of the nation, I am delighted at the recent decriminalisation of barbecues.\u201d Kirsty Brimelow QC, of Doughty Street Chambers, said: \u201cThe law at that time prohibited a person leaving or being outside where they were living without reasonable excuse. Amendments on 13 May 2020 did relax the law, including a reasonable excuse as being in a public open space for \u2018open-air recreation\u2019 with one member of another household. However, it did not include a private garden. \u201cIt is likely that going to a private barbecue would not have been a reasonable excuse. The regulations were and are draconian and often illogical with no obvious foundation in health advice. However, there have been upwards of 17,000 fixed penalty notices issued to members of the public for breaching the regulations. The government should set up a panel to review all fixed penalty notices. Otherwise unfairness and lack of trust will continue. Laws are meaningless if they are unfairly applied.\u201d Ian Lavery MP the former chair of the Labour party said it appeared that Seely had broken lockdown rules, adding: \u201cBob Seely\u2019s actions are extremely concerning and should be taken very seriously. Boris Johnson claimed to be taking back control of the Covid-19 pandemic but this is just the latest example that shows he can\u2019t even control his own MPs.\u201d",

The French study followed work by Chinese researchers which suggested that hydroxychloroquine can slow infections by blocking the virus behind Covid-19 from entering cells in the body. But more recent, albeit small-scale, research from China has shown that patients who were treated with the drugs fought off coronavirus no more quickly than those who didn\u2019t get it. Indeed, one patient given hydroxychloroquine severely worsened in condition while four patients on the medicine developed signs of liver damage and experienced diarrhoea.

I\u2019d say a bit about how you can\u2019t discuss the history of the American Indian Movement without talking about what else you must be ready to do when you take over and occupy a federal building. I\u2019d remind you that the first gay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/pride\">Pride</a> was a riot led by Black trans women. But I need to move forward in time.</p> <p>Last week in Minneapolis, Minnesota, officer Derek Chauvin subdued and handcuffed a 46-year-old black man named <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>. Chauvin then knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck for almost nine minutes. Completely compliant, Floyd pleaded for his life and called for his mother&nbsp;in the presence of passersby, who begged Chauvin to take his knee off Floyd\u2019s neck. They warned him that Floyd was about to die. Floyd did, indeed, die.</p> <p>Citizens watching an unjust and unnecessary killing but incapable of intervening is one example of the US as a police state. They can\u2019t intervene, first, because police are doing the killing; second, for fear of losing their own lives; and third, because history says that there will be no justice for the man they mean to save, nor for themselves after they\u2019re killed for trying to do the right thing.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is no proper training for encounters with law enforcement for black people in the United States. Being compliant or subdued is no guarantee that cops can\u2019t still murder you. And the cases of people such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/27/freddie-gray-police-officers-charges-dropped\">Freddie Gray</a> in Baltimore prove that \u2013 even when death following police brutality and negligence is ruled a homicide \u2013 no police officer can ever be held responsible by a medical examiner for committing murder.</p> <p>After Floyd\u2019s killing, people took to the streets in protest for several days here in the US and abroad, and demonstrations continue. In the United States, because so many of these people were black, they were met with tanks and law enforcement in riot gear. But I don\u2019t want to say too much more about the police just yet, because everyone knows that their real job in times of protest is to enforce the American value of property over life. Save for more military-grade weaponry, this has not changed since the turn of the 20th century.</p> <p>I\u2019d rather think about the citizens marching nationwide for radical change. Of course, most of them are black or young, many in their 20s. Their entire lives, these protesters have known the truth about police brutality. More recently, though, they\u2019ve weathered coronavirus-related deaths and illnesses of parents, grandparents and friends. (Floyd himself recovered from the virus before his killing.)</p> <p>They\u2019re aware of all the ways our government enabled the spread of the virus, and they know they risk their own health when they gather to declare their need for something more than reform when it comes to policing. They found out about the baffling killings of people including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/breonna-taylor-kentucky-protests-shooting\">Breonna Taylor</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/ahmaud-arbery-attacker-used-racial-slur-after-shooting-jogger-court-hears\">Ahmaud Arbery</a> and Tony McDade after having sheltered in place for many weeks. They live in a nation where the unemployment rate reached nearly 15%. If they participated in any looting, they probably needed and used what they stole. They know that capitalism comes before public health here. They think about the future.</p> <p>These are the circumstances under which an overwhelming majority of these young people protest peacefully while others have bricked, burned, and spray-painted buildings. When we talk about violent protest in the United States, we generally mean that someone broke a window or took a pair of shoes, not that they physically harmed anyone. I find this outrageous in the context of police throwing teargas at and shooting rubber bullets into peaceful crowds. And it seems silly in light of the fact that Chauvin was only arrested the morning&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;protesters burned down a police station in Minneapolis \u2013 that\u2019s four days after he killed Floyd.</p> <p>In Philadelphia, protesters defaced the Frank Rizzo statue beyond recognition. The image of the former mayor stood facing City Hall for two decades in spite of the fact that he ran on phrases such as \u201cVote white\u201d, and commanded that police heading to the scene of a protest \u201cget their black asses\u201d. City officials finally removed the statue in the night after it was vandalised. No letter-writing campaign made that happen.</p> <p>I do not mean to incite anyone to riot. I mean to remember that&nbsp;the worst thing about the current moment of protest is that it wouldn\u2019t have happened had George Floyd lived.&nbsp;History should tell us that whatever anyone does in the present moment to express rage at the police state is as necessary as Nat Turner\u2019s slave rebellion in 1831. </p> <p>These rebels and rabble-rousers marching today have something radical in mind.

      "body": "<p>The prime minister has claimed the track, test and trace system is \u201cworld-beating\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/03/the-guardian-view-on-governing-after-lockdown-boris-johnsons-grip-is-weak\" title=\"\">Editorial</a>, 3 June). This is so far from reality as to be laughable.</p> <p>Last week, on Thursday 28 May, my wife developed symptoms. I rang for a test the same day. I was told to go online and book a courier to deliver the test materials, only this would not be delivered until Friday. The courier duly arrived and promptly departed. I then had to go back online to book another courier to pick up the test, and this could not take place until Saturday. I performed the test and the courier picked it up. The system promised a result in two to three days but we only received the result on Wednesday 3 June, six days after my first contact.</p> <p>Such a system is absolutely useless for public health purposes, as numerous contacts could have infected others in the intervening six days. This system is not fit for purpose, and is the result of the government having ignored local public health services, opting instead for a complicated and centralised system, contracted out to a series of private operatives such as Serco, G4S, Randox and Amazon.</p> <p>Had this not been the policy, we could indeed have had a world-beating system based on our local NHS public health structure. In this system I would have been able to phone on the Thursday, a local NHS worker could have come out the same day, done the test, taken it to our local hospital lab one mile away, and we could have had the result phoned through and advice given within 12 to 24 hours. One shudders to think of the public money wasted on the current system. It is not surprising that public confidence in the government\u2019s handling of this pandemic is dwindling.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Dr Nigel Speight</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Durham</em></p> <p>\u2022 I have been self-reporting on the Covid-19 Zoe app and was asked to get a test after reporting mild fatigue and a rash on my big toe.</p> <p>Booking a test was straightforward on gov.uk. I went to the regional testing centre in Hanley. The army personnel were efficient. However, everyone is required to use a test kit themselves. I was unsure that I could swab my tonsils accurately. I asked for help and was told that there was no one medically trained at the site to assist. I tried. Instructions are clear that the swab must not touch tongue, teeth, cheeks or gums.</p> <p>I have no confidence in the test result. My husband and I will self-isolate for seven days anyway. We must have widespread testing to identify the spread of this new disease and to prevent further spread. Testing must be reliable, but I believe most people will not swab correctly.</p> <p>Money is spent on gov.uk, the hire of a car park, portable cabins, PPE equipment, gazebos, army and other personnel, testing kits and laboratory services \u2013 all for a test that is unreliable. The inaccuracy should be minimised by having a medically trained person to use the swab. <br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Rachel White</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Alsager, Cheshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 My partner and I returned from the test centre in Brighton shocked and angry, not because of delay or error (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/28/concerns-over-delays-and-errors-at-uk-drive-in-coronavirus-test-centres\" title=\"\">Report</a>, 28 April), but because of the rude, threatening and disrespectful behaviour of some staff members. My partner and I are of pensionable age.</p> <p>Having failed to see any signage instructing me otherwise, I took four photographs of the stadium car park, where I ordinarily travel to enjoy football. I was then told this was forbidden on \u201ca government site\u201d and I was happy to delete them. This precipitated a tirade from one of those present, who impatiently repeated the message and interrupted all attempts to clarify and explain. She then spoke to my partner, who assured her that she had not used her mobile, was feeling unwell (hence our visit), and was very anxious about the test. She shouted at my partner, who was taking time to access her phone because she was wearing plastic gloves, and told her that she was giving her \u201ca final warning\u201d, after which she would \u201cvoid the test\u201d.</p> <p>After she was satisfied that both our phones were free of any photos of the car park, we were able to proceed with self-testing.

      "bodyText": "The prime minister has claimed the track, test and trace system is \u201cworld-beating\u201d (Editorial, 3 June). This is so far from reality as to be laughable. Last week, on Thursday 28 May, my wife developed symptoms. I rang for a test the same day. I was told to go online and book a courier to deliver the test materials, only this would not be delivered until Friday. The courier duly arrived and promptly departed. I then had to go back online to book another courier to pick up the test, and this could not take place until Saturday. I performed the test and the courier picked it up. The system promised a result in two to three days but we only received the result on Wednesday 3 June, six days after my first contact. Such a system is absolutely useless for public health purposes, as numerous contacts could have infected others in the intervening six days. This system is not fit for purpose, and is the result of the government having ignored local public health services, opting instead for a complicated and centralised system, contracted out to a series of private operatives such as Serco, G4S, Randox and Amazon. Had this not been the policy, we could indeed have had a world-beating system based on our local NHS public health structure. In this system I would have been able to phone on the Thursday, a local NHS worker could have come out the same day, done the test, taken it to our local hospital lab one mile away, and we could have had the result phoned through and advice given within 12 to 24 hours. One shudders to think of the public money wasted on the current system. It is not surprising that public confidence in the government\u2019s handling of this pandemic is dwindling. Dr Nigel Speight Durham \u2022 I have been self-reporting on the Covid-19 Zoe app and was asked to get a test after reporting mild fatigue and a rash on my big toe. Booking a test was straightforward on gov.uk. I went to the regional testing centre in Hanley. The army personnel were efficient. However, everyone is required to use a test kit themselves. I was unsure that I could swab my tonsils accurately. I asked for help and was told that there was no one medically trained at the site to assist. I tried. Instructions are clear that the swab must not touch tongue, teeth, cheeks or gums. I have no confidence in the test result. My husband and I will self-isolate for seven days anyway. We must have widespread testing to identify the spread of this new disease and to prevent further spread. Testing must be reliable, but I believe most people will not swab correctly. Money is spent on gov.uk, the hire of a car park, portable cabins, PPE equipment, gazebos, army and other personnel, testing kits and laboratory services \u2013 all for a test that is unreliable. The inaccuracy should be minimised by having a medically trained person to use the swab. Rachel White Alsager, Cheshire \u2022 My partner and I returned from the test centre in Brighton shocked and angry, not because of delay or error (Report, 28 April), but because of the rude, threatening and disrespectful behaviour of some staff members. My partner and I are of pensionable age. Having failed to see any signage instructing me otherwise, I took four photographs of the stadium car park, where I ordinarily travel to enjoy football. I was then told this was forbidden on \u201ca government site\u201d and I was happy to delete them. This precipitated a tirade from one of those present, who impatiently repeated the message and interrupted all attempts to clarify and explain. She then spoke to my partner, who assured her that she had not used her mobile, was feeling unwell (hence our visit), and was very anxious about the test. She shouted at my partner, who was taking time to access her phone because she was wearing plastic gloves, and told her that she was giving her \u201ca final warning\u201d, after which she would \u201cvoid the test\u201d. After she was satisfied that both our phones were free of any photos of the car park, we were able to proceed with self-testing. We then drove to hand in our test samples, only to be stopped by five security staff, one of whom demanded to see the deleted photos file on our phones, even though these had already been checked. We were then allowed to leave. The experience was more redolent of a visit to a cold war security border than to a Department of Health and Social Care facility. Graham Stevens Crowborough, East Sussex \u2022 So according to Serco\u2019s CEO, its contract for contact tracing \u201cwill go a long way in cementing the position of the private sector companies in the public sector supply chain\u201d (NHS test-and-trace system \u2018not fully operational until September, 4 June). This confirms what many of us already suspected: the pandemic is being used by the government to accelerate the ongoing privatisation of the NHS, as the Guardian warned a month ago (UK government \u2018using pandemic to transfer NHS duties to private sector\u2019, 4 May).

      "bodyText": "The politicization of the coronavirus crisis and the Brazilian government\u2019s deliberate \u201ctorpedoing\u201d of social distancing efforts has condemned South America\u2019s largest country to a historic tragedy that will most punish the poor, Brazil\u2019s most respected medical voice has said. As Brazil\u2019s death toll surpassed that of Italy, Drauzio Varella told the Guardian that historians would be unkind to President Jair Bolsonaro, who is facing international condemnation for his handling of the pandemic. \u201cI think history will ascribe to him a level of guilt that I really wouldn\u2019t want for myself,\u201d said Varella, an oncologist, author and broadcaster who is a household name thanks to decades of public health activism. Only two countries, the US and the UK, have lost more lives, and Brazil seems poised to overtake the latter. Brazil has confirmed 615,000 cases, second only to the US. \u201cBecause in Brazil we are already the third country in the world in terms of deaths, we will soon become the second, and we are going to come close to the level of mortality in the US, which has 330 million citizens \u2013 that\u2019s 60% larger than Brazil\u2019s population,\u201d predicted Varella. \u201cThe situation couldn\u2019t be worse. It just couldn\u2019t.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019ve the feeling our country is living through a tragedy \u2013 and that this tragedy is going to be so much more severe for the poorest,\u201d who often lived in cramped, precarious conditions and had no choice but to go out to work and use packed public transport. Brazil has officially suffered 34,021 Covid-19 deaths since confirming its first fatality in mid-March and on Thursday registered a daily record of 1,473 fatalities. That means that a Brazilian is now dying to Covid-19 every minute, the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper noted on Friday\u2019s front page. Varella, 77, who is widely revered for his work in Brazil\u2019s overcrowded prisons, said a tragedy of this scale could have been avoided had Bolsonaro\u2019s administration reacted differently to an epidemic that reached South America after many other parts of the world. \u201cOur country had the time to prepare for the epidemic and didn\u2019t prepare \u2013 and, when the epidemic did arrive, although some measures that could have had an impact in terms of isolation were adopted \u2026 this was torpedoed by the federal government.\u201d Varella said warring politicians had given Brazil\u2019s 210 million citizens \u201cconflicting signals \u2013 with governors and mayors promoting the need for isolation, and the federal government calling this an outrage that would destroy the economy and cause more people to die of hunger than from the disease\u201d. \u201cThis is a ridiculous vision,\u201d Varella added. \u201cAnd this has created a very difficult outlook for the country \u2026 we are now reaping the results of this policy of antagonism, of the politicization of the epidemic \u2013 which is the worst situation possible.\u201d Varella said Bolsonaro \u2013 who has repeatedly flouted health ministry recommendations by visiting shops and attending protests and even a barbecue \u2013 shouldered particular responsibility for the confusion. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we have an ideological debate. No. The president has simply been going out on to the streets every weekend to draw crowds, without a mask, and challenging the need for isolation. This has virtually become government policy,\u201d he said. Political instability had also played a role in the botched response, which contrasts with Brazil\u2019s agile and inventive reaction to past health crises such as the 2015 Zika epidemic and HIV in the 90s. \u201cWe have lost two health ministers during this crisis and we now have an interim minister. This hasn\u2019t happened anywhere else in the world.\u201d Varella, who has spent recent years hunting for medicines of the future in remote corners of the Amazon, praised Brazil\u2019s \u201cSUS\u201d public health service, which was partly inspired by Britain\u2019s NHS, for preventing an even greater catastrophe. Bolsonaro, a far-right populist who models himself on Donald Trump, has defended his opposition to quarantine measures by claiming he is defending the livelihoods of Brazilian workers. \u201cWe can\u2019t go on like this. Nobody can take it any more,\u201d Bolsonaro said on Thursday as he again questioned shutdowns imposed by governors and mayors. \u201cThe collateral impact will be far greater than those people who unfortunately lost their lives because of these last three months here,\u201d Bolsonaro claimed. Varella said that view that was mistaken \u2013 and warned moves to reopen the economy risked further aggravating \u201ca very profound crisis\u201d. \u201cThe truth is we\u2019re relaxing [the quarantine] at a point when the number of cases is in full ascent \u2026 without any security. \u201cWe will pay the price for what is happening now \u2013 having more people in the streets, the crowds. In two or three weeks the number of cases will rise. There\u2019s no magic to it. There\u2019s no solution or something that means Brazil will be different,\u201d he warned.",

It comes after the UK government said on Thursday it would be mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport from 15 June, but these coverings can be simply T-shirts or scarves. UK becomes second country with 40,000 Covid-19 deaths The UK has become the second country to officially record more than 40,000 coronavirus-related deaths, as health officials said another 357 people who had tested positive for the virus have died. So far, 40,261 deaths due to the virus have been recorded, giving the UK the world\u2019s second-highest pandemic death toll behind the United States. The actual Covid-19 death toll is widely considered to be higher as the total only includes those who have tested positive for the virus. Sweden records third consecutive day of over 1,000 new cases Sweden has reported another large rise in new cases of coronavirus on Friday, with the 1,056 positive tests reported by the public health agency marking the third day the country\u2019s caseload had increased by more than a thousand. While a report of 2,214 cases on Wednesday was partly explained by a lab releasing a backlog of results, on Thursday, after another 1,084 cases were reported, the public health agency said the rise in cases could not wholly be explained by increased testing. The agency\u2019s chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, said the increases in new cases was seen primarily in Western Sweden and among younger people. Hospital staff in England and visitors will be required to wear face coverings All hospital visitors and outpatients in England will need to wear face coverings from 15 June, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said. All hospital staff will also be required to wear type one or type two surgical masks. Hancock also made a plea for people to be mindful of attending large protests over the death of George Floyd in the US.

Researchers studying patients who were admitted to the Canisius Wilhelmina hospital in the Dutch city of Nijmegen have extolled the benefits of vitamin K after discovering a link between deficiency and the worst coronavirus outcomes. US unemployment rate improves Covid-19\u2019s devastating impact on the US economy waned in May as the unemployment rate dipped to 13.3% and the US added another 2.5m jobs. The surprise news follows the loss of 20m jobs in April when unemployment hit 14.7%. Economists had been expecting a rise to as high as 20% but the rate is still historically high. Donald Trump, the US president, called the fall in unemployment an \u201caffirmation of all the work we\u2019ve been doing\u201d. US billionaires gain half a trillion dollars during outbreak Even as more than 42 million people have signed on as unemployed in the US, the country\u2019s billionaires have added half a trillion dollars to their combined wealth, according to a thinktank report. During the 11 weeks from 18 March, when US lockdowns started, the wealth of America\u2019s richest people surged by over $565bn, the Institute for Policy Studies calculated. Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, saw his wealth increase by $36.2bn. Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg was the second biggest beneficiary, increasing his net worth by $30.1bn. Judge bans Sydney Black Lives Matter protest over Covid-19 fears A judge in Australia has banned a Black Lives Matter protest planned to take place in Sydney on Saturday, citing the coronavirus crisis, after a legal application from police. New South Wales state supreme court justice Des Fagan ruled the rally was not an authorised public assembly. Under restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus, outdoor gatherings in Sydney are restricted to 10 people, while up to 50 people can go to funerals, places of worship, restaurants, pubs and cafes. Paris police ban demonstration on Saturday Police in Paris cited ongoing health risks related to the coronavirus pandemic as they banned a demonstration against police brutality planned to take place outside the city\u2019s US embassy on Saturday. Trouble broke out at another anti-police demonstration in the French capital on Wednesday after thousands turned up despite a police ban on the event in memory of Adama Traore, a 24-year-old black Frenchman who died in a 2016 police operation. Parts of Spain will enter final phase of easing lockdown next week On Monday, more than half of Spain will enter the fourth and final phase of the country\u2019s lockdown de-escalation, the government announced. However, the 52% of Spaniards in the last stage will not include those in the Madrid region or the Barcelona metropolitan area \u2013 the two parts of the country hit hardest by Covid-19. People living in areas in the final phase, such as Andaluc\u00eda, the Balearic islands and the Canary islands, can once again eat inside restaurants as long as social distancing is practised, while shops, cinemas and theatres can open at 50% capacity.",

What the heck is going on?' | Suzanne Wrack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But the simile doesn\u2019t end there: Football Federation Australia has proved itself a nimble and adaptable figure internationally, too. Earlier this year, in the space of just two weeks, the organisation negotiated moving the Matildas\u2019 entire Olympic qualifying group from Wuhan to Sydney, including organising stadiums, hotels and training grounds for all four participating national teams. The league responded well to those shifting calendars, moving a handful of games around to ensure all Matildas players would be available for the competition\u2019s scheduled conclusion.</p> <p>While its neat finish has meant the W-League has been largely out of sight as Australian clubs and administrators have worked to see out the A-League season, the flexibility shown by football\u2019s decision-makers in the women\u2019s space could prove invaluable in the months ahead.</p> <p>Around the world, in a wearyingly predictable fashion, many women\u2019s clubs and leagues have been significantly warped or sacrificed altogether as their men\u2019s equivalents have steamed towards a restart. Leagues in France, Spain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/01/fa-criticised-binning-womens-super-league-alison-mcgovern\">and England</a> have all been cancelled (with Italy likely to follow), while the NWSL in the United States has <a href=\"https://www.nwslsoccer.com/news/article/nwsl-announces-2020-challenge-cup-presented-by-pg-and-secret\">morphed into the Challenge Cup</a>: a 25-game World Cup-style knockout tournament that will run for just one month.</p> <p>The question hanging over many of these leagues now is: what happens next? For Europe\u2019s \u201cbig five\u201d \u2013 France, Spain, England, Italy, and Germany \u2013 kick-off for the 2020-21 season is slowly approaching. All five leagues usually begin their seasons in August or September and conclude in May the following year, while the NWSL is traditionally held between April and October. But there is no knowing whether the leagues are still working toward these original dates, just as there\u2019s no knowing whether a second wave of Covid-19 cases across Europe and the US could cause further (and possibly fatal) disruptions to them.</p> <p>For international players caught up in league and contract insecurity, then, the W-League is becoming a rather enticing proposition. Still far enough in the future that international travel restrictions could be lifted, in a country that is tracking well in terms of new Covid-19 cases (meaning its four-month season could be played out unhindered \u2013 perhaps even with crowds), and with the rescheduled Tokyo Olympics just a few months after its conclusion, the W-League is perfectly placed to capitalise on the global uncertainty currently facing the domestic women\u2019s game.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t the first time Australian women\u2019s football has had to be logistically nimble. Just as the W-League adjusted its calendar in 2014 to account for Australia hosting the 2015 men\u2019s Asian Cup, the competition could shift slightly to reduce the gap between its conclusion and the start of the Olympics, meaning players wouldn\u2019t risk losing match fitness between the two competitions.</p> <p>In addition, extending the W-League to a full home-and-away season while also adding an extra club \u2013 two suggestions that are part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/oct/15/wide-reaching-plans-for-independent-w-league-revealed\">the league\u2019s long-term vision</a> \u2013 would provide more game-time for Olympic-bound Matildas as well as more opportunities for international players to prepare themselves for the second-biggest women\u2019s football tournament on the planet.</p> <p>A temporary expansion of international visa spots could be another way of enticing foreign players desperate for game-time ahead of Tokyo, while more flexible player loan agreements between Australian and international clubs could ensure that international players contracted to clubs in less stable leagues could continue to play football in a competitive, professional environment while their parent leagues get themselves in order.</p> <p>And as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/21/australia-and-nzs-womens-world-cup-bid-highlights-a-global-shift\">2023 Women\u2019s World Cup decision looms</a>, such domestic moves could be perfectly timed to ride the wave of enthusiasm generated if Australia\u2019s joint bid with New Zealand proves successful.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/29/wolfsburg-cologne-frauen-bundesliga-freiburg-leverkusen\">Wolfsburg thrash Cologne as Frauen Bundesliga bucks trend with restart</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFFA\u2019s intent remains for the W-League 2020-21 season to return in and around its usual season window,\u201d an FFA spokesperson said. \u201cHowever, the season window is always assessed and reviewed annually to ensure we can optimise the W-League for players, fans and partners.</p> <p>\u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic has impacted our competition design planning and finalisation timelines for the 2020-21 season and we are not in a position to confirm any further details at the moment. However, we absolutely remain committed to continuing to professionalise, grow and showcase the women\u2019s game in Australia and the W-League remains a key element in that commitment.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>If the W-League can show the same adaptability as it did earlier this year by pouncing upon the current uncertainty facing the domestic game elsewhere, it could set Australian women\u2019s football on a new and potentially more prosperous course.</p>",

The league responded well to those shifting calendars, moving a handful of games around to ensure all Matildas players would be available for the competition\u2019s scheduled conclusion. While its neat finish has meant the W-League has been largely out of sight as Australian clubs and administrators have worked to see out the A-League season, the flexibility shown by football\u2019s decision-makers in the women\u2019s space could prove invaluable in the months ahead. Around the world, in a wearyingly predictable fashion, many women\u2019s clubs and leagues have been significantly warped or sacrificed altogether as their men\u2019s equivalents have steamed towards a restart. Leagues in France, Spain and England have all been cancelled (with Italy likely to follow), while the NWSL in the United States has morphed into the Challenge Cup: a 25-game World Cup-style knockout tournament that will run for just one month. The question hanging over many of these leagues now is: what happens next? For Europe\u2019s \u201cbig five\u201d \u2013 France, Spain, England, Italy, and Germany \u2013 kick-off for the 2020-21 season is slowly approaching. All five leagues usually begin their seasons in August or September and conclude in May the following year, while the NWSL is traditionally held between April and October. But there is no knowing whether the leagues are still working toward these original dates, just as there\u2019s no knowing whether a second wave of Covid-19 cases across Europe and the US could cause further (and possibly fatal) disruptions to them. For international players caught up in league and contract insecurity, then, the W-League is becoming a rather enticing proposition. Still far enough in the future that international travel restrictions could be lifted, in a country that is tracking well in terms of new Covid-19 cases (meaning its four-month season could be played out unhindered \u2013 perhaps even with crowds), and with the rescheduled Tokyo Olympics just a few months after its conclusion, the W-League is perfectly placed to capitalise on the global uncertainty currently facing the domestic women\u2019s game. This isn\u2019t the first time Australian women\u2019s football has had to be logistically nimble. Just as the W-League adjusted its calendar in 2014 to account for Australia hosting the 2015 men\u2019s Asian Cup, the competition could shift slightly to reduce the gap between its conclusion and the start of the Olympics, meaning players wouldn\u2019t risk losing match fitness between the two competitions. In addition, extending the W-League to a full home-and-away season while also adding an extra club \u2013 two suggestions that are part of the league\u2019s long-term vision \u2013 would provide more game-time for Olympic-bound Matildas as well as more opportunities for international players to prepare themselves for the second-biggest women\u2019s football tournament on the planet. A temporary expansion of international visa spots could be another way of enticing foreign players desperate for game-time ahead of Tokyo, while more flexible player loan agreements between Australian and international clubs could ensure that international players contracted to clubs in less stable leagues could continue to play football in a competitive, professional environment while their parent leagues get themselves in order. And as the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup decision looms, such domestic moves could be perfectly timed to ride the wave of enthusiasm generated if Australia\u2019s joint bid with New Zealand proves successful. \u201cFFA\u2019s intent remains for the W-League 2020-21 season to return in and around its usual season window,\u201d an FFA spokesperson said. \u201cHowever, the season window is always assessed and reviewed annually to ensure we can optimise the W-League for players, fans and partners. \u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic has impacted our competition design planning and finalisation timelines for the 2020-21 season and we are not in a position to confirm any further details at the moment. However, we absolutely remain committed to continuing to professionalise, grow and showcase the women\u2019s game in Australia and the W-League remains a key element in that commitment.\u201d If the W-League can show the same adaptability as it did earlier this year by pouncing upon the current uncertainty facing the domestic game elsewhere, it could set Australian women\u2019s football on a new and potentially more prosperous course.",

Friday, the first minister was questioned about his government\u2019s position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the

not come in until 15 June, and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Drakeford said a \u201cdefinitive statement\u201d on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about England\u2019s new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.</p> \n  <p>But he said the UK government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \u201cmaking the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Earlier on Friday the <strong>British Medical Association</strong> (BMA) Wales called on the Welsh government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.</p> \n  <p>The trade union\u2019s council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown that if mouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid-19 and therefore save lives.</p> \n   <p>BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh government to change their position immediately,

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s equality watchdog is launching an inquiry into the \u201clong-standing structural racial inequality\u201d thrown into the spotlight by the pandemic. The Equality and Human Rights Commission said analysis and evidence-based guidance is needed to tackle entrenched racism and Covid-19 death rates among BAME groups. It comes after Public Health England\u2019s review came under criticism for not explaining the reasons for already known disparities in health outcomes and not making recommendations for tackling them. The R value in England has risen to between 0.7 and 1. The latest data suggests the north-west and south-west are areas of concern, and Matt Hancock confirmed the R was higher in those regions than the rest of the country. National easing of lockdown measures would go ahead, he said, with a focus on localised lockdowns to address flare-ups. All hospital staff, patients and visitors in England must wear face coverings from 15 June. Hospital staff will be required to wear type one or type two surgical masks at all times, while patients and visitors will need to wear face coverings, the health secretary said. The UK\u2019s death toll passed the grim milestone of 40,000. The DHSC confirmed a rise of 357 deaths, bringing the total of reported deaths following a positive test to 40,261. That\u2019s it for today from the UK. If you\u2019d like to continue following the Guardian\u2019s coverage of the pandemic, head over to the global live blog for the worldwide picture. The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 within the prison estate continues to rise, Ministry of Justice figures show, as the total population dropped below 80,000 for the first time in 12 years. As at 5pm on Thursday, 482 prisoners had tested positive for the coronavirus across 79 prisons, an increase of less than 1% in 24 hours. There 947 infected prison staff across 105 prisons, an increase of less than 0.5% in the same period. There are around 79,800 prisoners across 117 prisons in England and Wales, and around 33,000 staff working in public sector prisons.The population was last below 80,000 in January 2008. The total has come down from around 83,000 at the start of the crisis due to scheduled releases and reduced numbers coming into prisons via the courts, as well as processing prisoners held on remand. At least 23 prisoners and nine staff are known to have died, as well as one prison escort driver and one NHS trust employee working in a secure training centre. Here is the moment Matt Hancock urged Britons to avoid large protests over the weekend \u201cfor the safety of your loved ones\u201d. The health secretary said he understood why people are appalled at the death of George Floyd but warned that coronavirus remains a \u201creal threat\u201d in the UK as lockdown easing measures come into effect. The Tory MP leading efforts to promote the Covid-19 contact-tracing app trial on the Isle of Wight appears to have broken lockdown rules at a barbecue also attended by the chairman of the Brexit party and political journalists, Simon Murphy and Peter Walker report. Bob Seely went to the gathering at a time when the guidance stated you could only meet one other person and strictly ruled out groups mixing from different households or people visiting and entering another person\u2019s home, including in gardens. And that\u2019s the end of the press conference. It remains unclear why the health secretary led this one alone. Q. BAME communities are disappointed with PHE\u2019s review because it\u2019s content was nothing new. Why were there no explanations for the disproportionate impact on, or mitigations for protecting, BAME lives? Hancock says socioeconomic factors including the increased risks of customer-focused occupations need to be addressed. The government will do the \u201cnext step\u201d to address the issues following the PHE review, he says. Q. Structural issues of racism and discrimination increase risks to health. Why wasn\u2019t this included in PHE\u2019s review, as Michael Gove promised? Hancock says the government will be rigorous in trying to understand the reasons why and answer these questions. Q. Isn\u2019t 4 July an unrealistic target for reopening hotels, restaurants and tourist attractions, given the rates of infection and the R value? Hancock says people shouldn\u2019t seize on one report, but should look at all the reports in the round, which Sage has done. Q. Would you be expecting the police to break up demonstrations of seven or more people this weekend? Hancock says: That is very much an operational matter for the police. Q. Is there a different R value in the community compared with hospitals and care homes? Hancock says of course there is a higher incidence amongst health and social care staff, but it\u2019s not rising as a proportion. But the measures you must take in health and social care settings are different to get transmission down, he adds. Q. Why have you only made face masks compulsory for hospital staff now, was it because of a lack of PPE before? Hancock says the change is about face masks for staff and face coverings for patients. Q. When will there be guidance on how a regional lockdown will work in practice? Q. Are you speaking to regional mayors and local authorities about protecting their populations and enforcing local lockdowns? Hancock says there is engagement through test-and-trace with regional and devolved leaders. Q. At what point [re the R number] do you put the brakes on easing measures? Hancock says Sage\u2019s assessment is that the overall UK R is between 0.7 and 0.9. Q. Studies suggest the R value could be above 1 in some areas, such as Liverpool and Manchester, and is rising due to increased mixing between households. Should people still exercise all the new freedoms or extra caution? Hancock says everybody should exercise caution. They\u2019re moving towards a more local, as opposed to national, approach to lockdown, he adds. Sage says the R is between 0.7 and 0.9, higher in the south-west and north-west of England, but remains below 1, he says. The focus is on localised lockdowns, he says. Q. Is the infrastructure in place to enact a local lockdown should one happen tomorrow? Hancock says yes, as in Weston-super-Mare. Q. What are the chances of a no-deal Brexit, given Michel Barnier said trade talks aren\u2019t progressing well? Hancock says he hopes not because the UK\u2019s position is very reasonable. Any agreement must reflect that the UK is an independent sovereign state, he says. They will work hard to bring the vision based within the political declaration to the final agreement, he says. Q. The chief scientific adviser once said keeping deaths below 20,000 would be a good outcome. How do you assess the outcome of more than 40,000 deaths? Hancock says this is a time of sorrow for us all. His heart goes out to all the families whose lives will never be the same again. We need to keep the R value below 1, he says. Q. Is the R value being around 1 in the south-west and north-west of concern and might there be a case for more regional restrictions? Hancock says this is right and Sage advises R is below 1 in all regions. However, local lockdowns in the event of flare-ups will be important. The joint biosecurity centre is looking into areas where there have been flare-ups, he adds, to deal with the sources of outbreaks. Q. When will UK zoos be able to reopen? Hancock says this is close to his heart because he comes from Chester and knows Chester Zoo \u201cextremely well\u201d. But they must be reopened in a safe way, he adds. He is taking questions from members of the public now. Q. How do you square the Bank of England\u2019s \u00a31.8bn bailout scheme for airlines with your promises of a \u201cgreen transport revolution\u201d? Hancock says greenhouse gas levels have fallen sharply due to lower numbers of flights during lockdown. Net zero emissions remains an important goal, he says. But we do need an airline industry and a long-term trajectory to getting to net zero, he adds. Ahead of further protests this weekend, Hancock says he understands why people are deeply appalled and upset. But, we still face a real threat from coronavirus, he says, so it is vital to protect yourselves and your families this weekend. He says, for the safety of your loved ones, do not attend large gatherings, including demonstrations, of more than six people this weekend. We must remain vigilant to protect the NHS, Hancock says. As the NHS reopens across the country, it\u2019s critical to stop the spread among staff, patients and visitors, he says. All hospital visitors and outpatients will need to wear face coverings, he says. New guidance will also be provided to NHS staff in England, coming into force on 15 June, he adds. All hospital staff will be required to wear Type 1 or 2 surgical masks at all times, not just when they\u2019re on the front line, he says, except areas designated as covid-secure. 7,080 people remain in hospital with Covid-19, down from 8,285 last week, he says. A further 357 people died following a positive test, showing we have so much more to do, he says. Tests carried out and posted out reached 207,231 as of 5 June, he says. A further 1,650 cases were confirmed as of 5 June, he adds. Through the antibody tests, which find out if you have had the virus, you can help make a difference, Hancock says. By donating your blood, which has your antibodies in it, you can help someone in hospital suffering with Covid-19, he says. If you have had coronavirus, you can go to the NHS blood and transplant website to do this. The health secretary is speaking now, going straight into the slides. He says the R value for the UK is estimated to be between 0.7 and 0.9, according to Sage. And the ONS survey estimates the number of new infections stands at 39,000 per week \u2013 roughly 5,600 per day, which is lower than similar estimate last week, he says. The health and social care secretary will lead this afternoon\u2019s daily press briefing solo, due to begin shortly. It comes as the UK\u2019s official toll of reported deaths after a positive coronavirus test across all settings passed the awful 40,000 milestone (see 3.47pm.) and the R number in England rose to between 0.7 and 1 (see 2.35pm.). The World Health Organization (WHO) has updated its guidance on wearing masks in public to help limit the spread of coronavirus. Speaking during a virtual briefing on Friday afternoon, the WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said governments should encourage people to wear masks in shops, on public transport, and in areas where social distancing is not possible. He said people aged 60 and over, or those with underlying health issues, should wear medical masks in situations where social distancing was not possible. But he added: Masks alone will not protect you from Covid-19, they are not a replacement for hand hygiene and social distancing. The WHO previously stressed there was no evidence that wearing a mask \u2013 whether medical or other types \u2013 by healthy people in the wider community could prevent them from being infected with respiratory viruses. The lacklustre response to the BAME Covid-19 death toll and and absence of recommendations in Public Health England\u2019s report risk fuelling tensions over racial injustice in Britain, MPs have warned. Haroon Siddique and Josh Halliday report that BAME MPs have said the government\u2019s failure to tackle the disproportionate number of BAME deaths from coronavirus makes a mockery of Matt Hancock\u2019s statement in the Commons that \u201cblack lives matter\u201d. Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, the MP for Slough, who has lost three relatives to coronavirus, said: It\u2019s all very well saying black lives matter, but if you\u2019re not going to be taking any action to make sure that, yes, those lives do matter, then those are just hollow words. People have been talking about these injustices for so long, and if the government doesn\u2019t take action, I think that that anger and exasperation will only increase, and that doesn\u2019t benefit anybody.\u201d Chi Onwurah, the MP for Newcastle Central, said: To use the phrase \u2018black lives matter\u2019, then to go on to not do anything about the clear outstanding case of black people dying disproportionately, reeks of hypocrisy and will undermine faith in the government\u2019s desire or intention to take action. Read the full story here: Wales will consider making face coverings compulsory on public transport, the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said England\u2019s decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries. On Friday, the first minister was questioned about his government\u2019s position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid-19 in areas where people can\u2019t socially distance and to save lives. Drakeford told the government\u2019s daily press briefing in Cardiff: The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport. That will not come in until 15 June, and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context. Drakeford said a \u201cdefinitive statement\u201d on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about England\u2019s new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster. But he said the UK government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \u201cmaking the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\u201d. Earlier on Friday the British Medical Association (BMA) Wales called on the Welsh government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public. The trade union\u2019s council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown that if mouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid-19 and therefore save lives. BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus. The meeting between Boris Johnson, European commission president Ursula von der Leyen and president of the European Council Charles Michel is expected to take place before the next European council summit on 19 June. Sources expect that the face-to-face meeting being sought by chief negotiators David Frost and Michel Barnier will then happen towards the end of June or beginning of July. However, some commentators think there may also be a high level political meeting between Johnson and a leading EU premier, likely to be Emmanuel Macron before the summit too. This would be along the lines of the Wirral summit Johnson had with Leo Varadkar outside Liverpool last October which led to the breakthrough on the Irish border that helped the prime minister get the Brexit deal over the line. We reported earlier that the Scottish health secretary has written to health board chiefs warning them that failures to routinely test care home staff for coronavirus will be made public in a weekly league table from next week. Asked what sanctions were available should this new policy not be met, a government source confirmed that the standard board escalation route \u2013 the Scottish equivalent of special measures \u2013 would be used to make sure the job was done. They added it is important to note that many boards are implementing the testing policy but there is a need for consistency and transparency, hence the weekly publication of data. The Department of Health said 40,261 people had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of 5pm on Thursday, up by 357 from 39,904 the day before. Some interesting interim findings from a survey of Scottish parents, carried out by the parents\u2019 organisation Connect. With 2007 responses from 29 out of 32 local authorities, the survey finds that 59% are currently planning to send their children back to school when the next term begins on 11 August, while only 3% were definitely not planing to let them return, which is notable in contrast to the concerns of many English parents about the return of pupils this month. Scotland\u2019s education secretary has said that the schools return will be based on a blended model of in-school and at-home learning, which 20% said was not possible for them, while 36% said it depended on their employer being flexible. A whopping 87% wanted more consultation on how part time schooling/nursery will work, while 25% said extra care would be \u2018essential\u2019 in addition to part time education. A University of Oxford clinical trial into an anti-malarial drug will end with \u201cimmediate effect\u201d after it was found to be ineffective against Covid-19, researchers have said. The Recovery trials, which look at potential coronavirus treatments, involve a number of medications that are licensed for use in other conditions, including the drug hydroxychloroquine. However, after reviewing the data on Thursday, the chief researchers have decided to end the hydroxychloroquine arm of the trial after it was found to be not effective in preventing the deaths of Covid-19 patients in hospital. The researchers found that 25.7% of patients who were in the hydroxychloroquine arm died after 28 days compared with 23.5% of people with standard care alone. Prof Martin Landray said: This trial has moved at incredible speed, there was a huge upsurge in cases if you go back a month or so, we have to base our decisions on the latest data and that came through just last night. He added: We never say never, but I think this is not a treatment for Covid. A senior Northern Ireland police officer has made a strong appeal to protesters not to take part in demonstrations this weekend. PSNI assistant chief constable Alan Todd said his officers are engaging with organisers of Black Lives Matter gatherings to explain the coronavirus regulations, adding if the warnings are ignored then enforcement will be used. He made the comments ahead of three planned demonstrations across Northern Ireland this weekend over the death of George Floyd in police custody in the US last week. Todd described the protest as \u201cvalid\u201d but warned that public gatherings of more than six people are against coronavirus regulations, as is travelling for a protest. Up to 2,000 people gathered in Belfast city centre on Wednesday to express their support for the Black Lives Matter campaign. The first minister Arlene Foster described it as a breach of the law and urged that there should be no repeat of it, while the deputy first minister Michelle O\u2019Neill said she was fully supportive of the BLM campaign but urged those involved to find other ways to show solidarity. Todd said: I have a very clear message to organisers, the best way to resolve this for everybody\u2019s interests is to call off these events. Large crowd protests are at this time inappropriate. If people choose to ignore these warnings and with all the advice and guidance from the chief medical officer, healthcare professionals, from police, from political representatives across the spectrum, if people choose to ignore all that and break the law then there will have to be consequences. People can take my messaging today as being my engagement with them, my explanation, and my encouraging them to obey the law - if they choose to ignore the first three Es they can expect over the weekend to find enforcement being used. He added: On any other day as a police service we would be fully facilitating those protests in a peaceful and lawful manner with the organisers, however this is not any other day, we\u2019re in the middle of a pandemic and gathering in crowds, socially distanced or otherwise, is both a risk to public health and a breach of the health protection regulations. It seems to be somewhat ironic that we would protest the avoidable and unnecessary death of an individual in the United States by risking unnecessary and avoidable deaths in Northern Ireland. Wales\u2019s first minister, Mark Drakeford, said the UK government had not discussed its decision to make the wearing of face masks on public transport mandatory in England. He said he wished the Welsh government had had the chance to discuss it with the UK government before the announcement was made, adding: That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event. But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made. We had no advance notice from the Department for Transport in England that this announcement was to be made. We\u2019re going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether it\u2019s a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards. Police will have to abide by the requirements of the test-and-trace system, Downing Street has said. The confirmation came after reports that forces were intending to carry out their own tracing processes if officers tested positive for coronavirus. According to Sky News, forces were looking at a different contact-tracing system because of concerns the government\u2019s scheme could place officers in danger, or compromise sensitive information. But the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said the NHS test-and-trace system was for \u201ceveryone, including police officers\u201d. And the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC) insisted forces were not setting up their own separate scheme. The PM\u2019s spokesman added: Any member of the emergency services who has symptoms of coronavirus should self-isolate. I think what the NPCC has said is that there are ongoing discussions with Public Health England (PHE) about how the NHS test-and-trace service will work for officers in cases where there may be operational or security issues to consider. No 10 said the NPCC had made clear officers would still be \u201crequired to engage\u201d with the tracking system but said the government would not want to \u201cpre-empt\u201d the conclusion of discussions between PHE and the NPCC about how it would work in sensitive cases. In a statement, the NPCC said: To be clear, police forces are not setting up a contact-tracing system for officers which is separate to the NHS test-and-trace service. In order to ensure information about policing activity and the privacy of members of the public is protected, police officers and staff will not be able to disclose sensitive information to the NHS test-and-trace service. The NPCC is in discussions with PHE to resolve this issue, and has proposed a system whereby police officers and staff in certain roles have their cases referred to a national vetted public health outbreak team. Officers with symptoms will still be required to engage with the test-and-trace process at the outset. They will still be able to access appropriate medical advice and treatment if they have tested positive for coronavirus, or are made aware that they have come into contact with someone who has tested positive. NHS England has announced another 123 deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 27,282. Of the 123 new deaths announced on Friday: - 19 occurred on 4 June - 50 occurred on 3 June - 23 occurred on 2 June - seven occurred on 1 June The figures also show 19 of the new deaths took place in May, four occurred in April, and the remaining one death took place on 25 March. NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for post-mortem examinations to be processed and for data from the tests to be validated. The figures published on Friday by NHS England show 8 April continues to have the highest number of hospital deaths on a single day, with a current total of 899. The R value in England has risen to between 0.7 and 1, according to the government\u2019s latest official estimates with some regions now at risk of seeing a rise in the number of infections. The latest data suggests that the north-west of England is an area for concern and that some local authorities may have R-values \u2013 the rate of transmission \u2013 above 1, at which point the epidemic will begin to grow in these communities. The Government\u2019s chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told a virtual briefing with journalists on Friday the R-number - the average number of people that will contract coronavirus from an infected person - for England was between 0.7 and 1, while it remained between 0.7 and 0.9 for the UK as a whole. He said the prevalence of Covid-19 was on a \u201cdownward trajectory\u201d in the UK, adding: The prevalence of coronavirus, according to the ONS, is at 0.1%, with 53,000 people with Covid-19 in the past two weeks. He said the incidence rate was at 0.7% per week, which meant there were \u201croughly\u201d 39,000 new coronavirus cases each week. Sir Patrick said: The latest R-value calculation is between 0.7 and 0.9 for the UK as a whole, it may be a little bit higher in England it may be between 0.7 and 1, and there is a bit of regional variation. Public Health Wales said a further four people have died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths in Wales to 1,383. Another 76 people have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 14,314. Downing Street said it was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that BA had declined to meet with the Home Secretary on Thursday but would not comment on suggestions the airline would be pursuing legal action over ministers\u2019 plans to quarantine visitors for two weeks. The Prime Minister\u2019s spokesman, when asked about the threat of legal action, said: I don\u2019t think you\u2019d expect me to comment on threats of legal action. In terms of our position on this, the quarantine system is designed to keep the transmission rate down, manage the risk of new cases being brought in from abroad and help prevent a second wave of the virus. On BA\u2019s no show, the No 10 spokesman added: As the Home Secretary said at yesterday\u2019s meeting, we want to work with industry across the board through this pandemic - that includes BA. Obviously we\u2019re disappointed they chose not to attend the meeting. At the Downing Street press conference the Prime Minister\u2019s spokesman has confirmed a group of scientists advising the UK Government saw the results of a test that showed a \u201cclear gap\u201d in Scotland\u2019s preparedness for handling a virus similar to Covid-19 (see 09.07) The exercise held in March 2018 simulated an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Mers-CoV) to assess NHS Scotland\u2019s readiness to respond to a suspected outbreak. The Prime Minister\u2019s spokesman said: It was specifically to test the preparedness of the Scottish Government, as I understand it, and that reflects the fact that public health is a devolved matter. The report produced by the Scottish Government was shared with the Nervtag group - New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, in long-hand - at a meeting on June 2019. When put to the spokesman that the report represented a missed opportunity to act earlier on the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE), the PM\u2019s spokesman said: I think we\u2019ve acknowledged that the UK Government did face challenges in securing PPE at a time when there was unprecedented global demand across the world. We have now made good progress, both in terms of getting more PPE from overseas but also in increasing domestic (supply). Important breaking news from Gary Lineker (well, for football fans at least). The far-right activist Tommy Robinson has spent the night in a police cell in Barrow after being arrested at a rally in support of a local girl accused of lying about being raped. He was one of four men from outside Cumbria arrested in Barrow on Thursday night, local newspaper The Mail reported. Sky News reports that its analysis suggests cases in the UK are taking longer to fall than in Spain, Italy, France and Belgium. It says: Only Sweden, which decided not to impose a lockdown, has a higher rate of infection. In the last week of May, there were 236 newly confirmed cases per million population in the UK. The findings confirm the concern expressed on Wednesday by the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, that the country\u2019s epidemic has a \u201clong tail\u201d, with both cases and deaths taking longer to fall than he would like. The coronavirus pandemic has evolved differently across Europe, affecting countries in the west more than those in the east. The level of infection and the deaths in all these countries are now coming down, but not all are improving at the same pace. In the UK and Sweden, the number of daily confirmed cases remains high and the shape of their epidemics is diverging from those of Spain, France and Italy. The full Sky News report is here. Brexit talks have hit the buffers, with \u201cno significant progress\u201d made in the fourth round of talks over trade and the future relationship with the EU. At a press conference, Michel Barnier accused the UK of continuing \u201cto backtrack on the commitments\u201d it made in the political declaration including pledges to achieve a close economic partnership and to co-operate on security and policing. I do not understand why. We cannot accept this. No progress was made on fishing, with the UK expressing frustration that the EU did not take its own detailed proposed deal to the table. A high-level summit between Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen and David Maria Sassoli, the presidents of the European commission and parliament respectively, is now expected at the end of the month with a face-to-face meeting of a small team of negotiators before this to see if there is any hope of breaking the logjam. The UK chief negotiator, David Frost, said both sides were \u201creaching the limits of what we can achieve\u201d through video conferences. Neither side wants talks to drag on to the autumn, with Barnier saying they cannot continue like this \u201ceternally\u201d. UK sources said the same on Friday. We\u2019re not up for a long negotiation over the next months, well into the autumn where nobody knows what\u2019s going to happen. October is too late for us. The UK rejected suggestions by Barnier that the UK has been backsliding on the political declaration, adding: We are committed to the political declaration. It describes itself as a document that sets the parameters. It isn\u2019t in itself a treaty. It sets the parameters for our discussion and in my dictionary parameters means limits. London has made a veiled threat of imposing tariffs on agricultural goods such as beef, tomatoes and dairy products that would have a high impact on exports from the likes of Ireland, France and Spain, as a means of unlocking talks. This follows Michael Gove\u2019s declaration last month that the UK would be prepared to move away from the zero-tariff goal if the EU was not prepared to budge on demands for a level playing field. \u201cWe\u2019d rather not,\u201d said a senior source, but tariffs exist in the Canada and Japan deals on a small percentage of goods. \u201cWe\u2019re not up for line-by-line tariff negotiations. We have been clear about that,\u201d the source added. \u201cBut typically the kind of goods that are excluded from FTA are the most sensitive agricultural goods,\u201d said the insider. Pilot progammes requiring voters to present ID at polling stations are lawful, the court of appeal has ruled, potentially paving the way for the scheme to be rolled out nationwide at future elections. Ten local authorities participated in the pilots during last year\u2019s May elections. Voters had to meet ID requirements, as set out by each authority, to be able to cast their vote. The unanimous appeal court ruling dismissed a claim by Neil Coughlan, 66, a community activist from Braintree in Essex, who argues that it will disenfranchise those who do not have or cannot find their documents and alienate people from the democratic process. Voter fraud is extremely rare and the electoral trials are unlawful, his lawyers told the court in April. Delivering judgment, Lord Justice McCombe said: Clearly, the right to vote at any election is an important right and courts will be vigilant to prevent the use of so-called \u2018Henry VIII\u2019 [statutory instrument] powers of this type by ministers to curtail such an important right by mere order, unless the claimed use of the power has been clearly and distinctly conferred by parliament. In my judgment, however, the use of the power ... to test a pilot scheme of this type does not in truth override or abrogate the right to vote at all. The voter remains entitled to vote and must only produce sensible means of demonstrating that entitlement. Lord Justice Underhill said while he understood Coughlan\u2019s concern that voter ID \u201cmay inhibit some voters from voting, and that the impact may be greater on the more disadvantaged groups\u201d, part of the purpose of the pilots was to establish whether there would be such an impact, and to what extent. Cat Smith, the shadow minister for voter engagement and young people, criticised the initiative: The government\u2019s fixation with voter ID is a blatant attempt to rig future elections in its favour through voter suppression. We saw with the Windrush scandal how some communities struggle to provide official documentation, with the severe consequences. Yet the Tories continue to push through changes that disproportionately exclude people from ethnic minority backgrounds from voting. Sarah Sackman, a barrister who represented Coughlan, said he would appeal. She said: The court of appeal has today given the green light to the government\u2019s plans to require ID before you can vote. That changes centuries of democratic practice in this country. My client, Mr Coughlan, is seeking to take his case to the Supreme Court. He, along with groups like Operation Black Vote and Age UK, fear this will disenfranchise marginalised groups and that the UK will go the way of America, where ID requirements have been used to suppress voting amongst minorities. Nicola Sturgeon and Scotland\u2019s chief constable, Iain Livingstone, have urged Black Lives Matter supporters to avoid taking part in large public protests in Scotland this weekend because of the live risk of transmitting the coronavirus. Livingstone said during the Scottish government\u2019s daily press briefing he recognised people were \u201cshocked and distressed\u201d by the death of George Floyd. \u201cI understand the desire of people to make their voices heard,\u201d he added. But attending the mass rallies planned in various cities in Scotland would be dangerous, he said. Police were liaising with the event organisers to urge them to avoid breaching Scotland\u2019s strict lockdown and social distancing rules, which prohibits gatherings of more than eight people and requires those groups to stay at least two metres apart. Livingstone said: Because the threat of coronavirus is still with us, people shouldn\u2019t attend mass gatherings which pose a very clear risk to public health. It is essential everyone sticks to the rules. The first minister said protestors should heed the appeal from prominent BAME politicians on Thursday, including Hamza Yousaf, the Scottish justice secretary, and Anas Sarwar, a senior Scottish Labour MSP, to find different ways to protest. Issued with Kadijartu Johnson, the sister of Sheku Bayoh who died in Scottish police custody five years ago, the statement said some data showed BAME people were being disproportionately impacted by Covid-19. Progress defeating the virus was \u201cfragile\u201d they said, adding: Therefore, as long-term anti-racist campaigners we are still urging people to protest but to use the many other methods available at this time, including digital protests. Sturgeon said that in normal times, she would have taken part in protests this weekend but \u201cmass gatherings isn\u2019t safe and poses risks to health: Every single decision we make just now as individuals affects the health and safety of everyone. A \u00a3500 payment to social care workers in Wales to thank them for their efforts during the pandemic is to be extended, the first minister Mark Drakeford has announced. Kitchen and domestic staff, agency and nursing staff working in care homes will receive the extra payment, and personal assistants and domiciliary care workers providing care to people in their own homes will also be eligible. The payment will be subject to tax and National Insurance contributions and discussions were ongoing with the HM Treasury about waving that, Drakeford added. Self-harm has increased among women prisoners during the pandemic and some are being released without anywhere to go, inspectors have said. Inspectors, who carried out scrutiny visits on 19 May, said they were troubled by the impact of new restrictions at three women\u2019s prisons \u2013 Bronzefield, Eastwood Park and Foston Hall. The restrictions were aimed at controlling the spread of the virus but the inspectors were concerned about the suspension of specialist support for some of the most vulnerable women. Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons, said: We found that self-harm had increased from the high levels seen prior to the restrictions being implemented. Despite enhanced welfare checks and support in place at Bronzefield and Eastwood Park, Clarke said there was concern about the impact of \u201cthe very sudden withdrawal of a range of interventions from a small number of prisoners with very high levels of need\u201d. An inspectors\u2019 report noted that despite the work of staff, \u201cthe very restricted regime meant prisoners at risk of self-harm felt isolated from others and craved more human contact\u201d. Prisoner release schemes were \u201cundermined by the lack of accommodation for many on release\u201d, according to Clarke. He said that since the start of the restrictions, \u201c40% of prisoners released from Bronzefield and Eastwood Park and 20% of those release from Foston Hall had no accommodation on the day of their release\u201d. The inspectors\u2019 report on the scrutiny visits added: This was not a safe way to release potentially vulnerably prisoners, especially during a pandemic. Efforts to reduce the amount of inmates through release schemes had proved largely ineffective as significant numbers of new prisoners were admitted. Under the new restrictions, face-to-face visits and education sessions had stopped and prisoners were allowed out of their cells in smaller groups. The inspectors were concerned by the absence of any organised physical education provision and they said that social distancing was not routinely observed at Bronzefield. The report said video-based visits not been set up and some women had not seen their children for two months, which comes as children separated from their mothers and prison minister Lucy Frazer are set to give evidence to the joint committee on human rights on Monday. Details about the significantly restricted daily regimes were well communicated by staff who maintained positive relationships with prisoners, the inspectors added. Liverpool had the Beatles and Atomic Kitten; Manchester gave birth to Oasis and Take That. But which city has produced the better music overall? There\u2019s only one way to find out: fight! On Sunday the mayors of Greater Manchester and the Liverpool city region will take part in a DJ battle to raise money for charities helping during the pandemic while settling an age-old beef over which of their regions is musically superior. Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram will be taking turns on the decks to play songs by acts from in and around Manchester and Liverpool. The battle will be shown exclusively on the United We Stream platform. Without the Beatles Liverpool wouldn\u2019t stand a chance, suggested Burnham: Let\u2019s face it - if we had excluded music from the 1960s, there would be no contest. Rotheram begs to differ. He boasted: Everyone knows that our city region is the centre of the known musical universe. Not only are we a UNESCO World City of Music, but we have produced more No1 hits than anywhere else in the country. Broadcast from 8pm, the mayors will play an hour\u2019s set each, spinning tracks from the \u201860s up to the present day and including plenty of classic Merseybeat and Madchester. People will be invited to vote for the winning city by leaving a comment whilst making a donation on the United We Stream JustGiving page. The money raised from the event will be shared between the Greater Manchester Mayor\u2019s Charity, supporting efforts to tackle homelessness, and LCRCares, a campaign to support organisations on the frontline supporting communities throughout the Liverpool city-region. The UK arm of lingerie brand Victoria\u2019s Secret has slipped into administration, raising fears for more than 800 employees. Victoria\u2019s Secret UK runs 25 stores across the UK. It has called in Deloitte for a \u201clight touch\u201d administration, after the company was hit by the closure of high streets during the pandemic. Victoria\u2019s Secret had already furloughed 785 of its workers before appointing administrators. Administrators will try to find a buyer for its assets, or re-negotiate its rents, in a bid to pull it out of administration. Deloitte administrator Rob Harding said it was \u201cyet another blow to the UK high street\u201d and further evidence of the impact of the pandemic on the retail sector as a whole. He said: The effect of the lockdowns, combined with broader challenges facing bricks and mortar retailers, has resulted in a funding requirement for this business, resulting in today\u2019s administration. Following on from his frank comments on the lack of progress in post-Brexit trade talks (see 12.25pm.), Michel Barnier accused the UK of having backtracked on the political declaration. The EU chief negotiator told a Brussels press conference that the negotiating teams were still \u201cvery far\u201d from reaching agreement on the level playing field, nuclear safety, and anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism funding. He said \u201cround after round\u201d the UK had sought \u201cto distance themselves\u201d from the political declaration agreed by the EU and the prime minister Boris Johnson. He said: In all areas, the UK continues to backtrack under commitments undertaken in the political declaration, including on fisheries. We cannot and will not accept this backtracking on the political declaration. The UK\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator David Frost has said the progress in the talks with the EU was \u201climited\u201d but that the tone had been \u201cpositive\u201d. He took a rather different tone to his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, who said there had been \u201cno significant areas of progress\u201d at the end of the fourth round of talks (see 12.25pm.). Frost said that if further progress was to be made the two sides needed to \u201cintensify and accelerate\u201d their work rate. In a statement, he said: Progress remains limited but our talks have been positive in tone. Negotiations will continue and we remain committed to a successful outcome. He echoed Barnier\u2019s suggestion that the resumption of face-to-face talks would prove more effective. Frost said: We are now at an important moment for these talks. We are close to reaching the limits of what we can achieve through the format of remote formal rounds. If we are to make progress, it is clear that we must intensify and accelerate our work. We are discussing with the commission how this can best be done. We need to conclude this negotiation in good time to enable people and businesses to have certainty about the trading terms that will follow the end of the transition period at the end of this year, and, if necessary, to allow ratification of any agreements reached. For our part we are willing to work hard to see whether at least the outline of a balanced agreement, covering all issues, can be reached soon. Any such deal must of course accommodate the reality of the UK\u2019s well-established position on the so-called \u2018level playing field\u2019, on fisheries, and the other difficult issues. There has been \u201cno significant areas of progress\u201d at the end of the fourth round of talks on a post-Brexit trade deal, the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said. He told a Brussels press conference: My responsibility is to speak to truth and to tell the truth this week there have been no significant areas of progress. On fisheries the UK have not shown any true will to explore other approaches beyond zonal attachment for the sharing of quotas. They continue to condition access to waters to an annual negotiation which is not possible for us - not even technically possible. The EU hopes to restart face-to-face talks with the UK at the end of June, Barnier confirmed, which he hoped would be \u201cmore effective\u201d. Barnier added that \u201cthe door is still open\u201d for the UK to extend the transition period. He said: All we are asking for is the political declaration to be complied with. There has been no significant progress on these points, not since the start of negotiations, and I don\u2019t think we can go on like this forever. The UK has refused to extend the transition period to allow for more time for negotiations. From our side, as indeed was already pointed by President Von der Leyen we have always been open to extending this period by one or two years. It\u2019s possible and written into the agreement. Our door is still open to that end. However, if there is no joint decision to such an extension, as is the case now, if there is no change, the UK will leave the single market and the customs union on 31 December. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has been asked to review evidence into the death of railway worker Belly Mujinga in recognition of wider public interest, although the case is not being reopened, British Transport Police (BTP) said. Mujinga died in April with Covid-19, a few weeks after an incident at London\u2019s Victoria station. She is survived by widower and an 11-year-old daughter. BTP interviewed a 57-year-old man but said the incident did not lead to the worker\u2019s death and decided not to refer the case to the CPS. In a new statement on Friday, BTP said it had invited the CPS to conduct an independent review of the available evidence, and whether there were any further lines of inquiry. BTP said it understood the depth of feeling over the case and that there were further questions over how it was decided there was insufficient proof of a crime to justify a prosecution. We can assure the public that we have comprehensively reviewed all the available evidence and have not identified any offences or behaviour that meets the threshold for prosecution. The development came as the number of people signing a petition launched in support of Mujinga topped a million. Her trade union the Transport Salaried Staffs\u2019 Association (TSSA) has received messages of support from across the UK and from countries including the US and Germany. Mujinga\u2019s husband Lusamba thanked those who have signed the petition and said the public reaction to her case had taken the family by surprise. He added it had come amid anger over the killing of George Floyd in the US. He said: On Wednesday, thousands of people protested in London to cry it loud that black lives matter. Black lives do matter. Belly\u2019s life mattered. It mattered to me, to our daughter, our friends and family, to Belly\u2019s colleagues, and now it matters to many thousands of you out there. We were there, united in our anger and our grief. United in our determination to be heard and in our determination to get change. We want justice for Belly. We reported earlier this morning that the UK\u2019s equality watchdog \u2013 the Equality and Human Rights Commission \u2013 is launching an inquiry into the \u201clong-standing, structural race inequality\u201d that has been laid bare by the pandemic (see 7.44am.). The EHRC said it would carry out in-depth analysis and develop evidence-based recommendations for urgent action to tackle entrenched racial inequalities in specific areas. A government-commissioned Public Health England (PHE) investigation found that people of Bangladeshi background in England were twice as likely as white Britons to die if they contracted Covid-19, and other BAME groups faced an increased risk of up to 50%. The BBC reported on Thursday that black communities felt they had been \u201cmisled\u201d after it was revealed that the PHE inquiry was not led by black doctor Prof Kevin Fenton as was originally announced, and that he had instead \u201ccontributed\u201d to the review. The final report also did not include the responses of more than 1,000 organisations and individuals who had been consulted, highlighting issues of racism, trust, discrimination and stigma. One of the organisations angered by the omissions is the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB). Harun Khan, the secretary general of the MCB, said it was \u201cdisappointing\u201d those responses were not in the final review: It\u2019s very disappointing when many organisations, including the Muslim Council of Britain, put significant effort into supporting the government and Public Health England in this review, that those views been overlooked despite being specifically sought. There has also been frustration that the PHE report confirmed what was already known \u2013 that BAME people are at higher risk of mortality from Covid-19 than their white counterparts \u2013 without setting out clear recommendations on how to better protect BAME lives from the virus. Khan added: The purpose of the review was not to replicate evidence already in the public domain - as appears to now be the case - it was to understand the extent of the problem, establish a clear action plan recognising the structural racism already previously identified, and crucially, develop specific recommendations to stop the unnecessary loss of lives in BAME communities. It is therefore vital to have a third party external to government, such as the EHRC, to look into this issue. However whilst initial statements appear to recognise the importance of listening to experts, we remain cautious considering the poor track record the EHRC has on investigating racism with actionable recommendations, including in the case of Windrush or Islamophobia in the Conservative party. British Airways\u2019 parent company is considering taking legal action against the government\u2019s decision to impose a 14-day quarantine on international arrivals. IAG chief executive Willie Walsh described the policy as \u201cterrible\u201d and warned it has \u201ctorpedoed our opportunity to get flying in July\u201d. He told Sky News: We think it\u2019s irrational, we think it\u2019s disproportionate, and we are giving consideration to a legal challenge to this legislation. We\u2019re reviewing that with the lawyers later on today. I suspect there are other airlines who are doing so because it\u2019s important to point out there was no consultation with the industry prior to enacting this legislation. We do believe it is an irrational piece of legislation. From Monday, people arriving in the UK will need to self-isolate for 14 days. There has been widespread concern that this will cause huge damage to the travel and aviation sectors as they recover from the pandemic. BA has announced plans to cut up to 12,000 jobs as part of a restructuring. The home secretary Priti Patel has insisted the rule is \u201cbacked by the science\u201d and is \u201cessential\u201d to save lives. IAG had previously said it intends to make \u201ca meaningful return to service\u201d in July. British Airways declined to join a meeting between Patel and the travel industry to discuss the quarantine on Thursday. It is understood the Home Office received no reply from the airline after being invited to the discussion, which was attended by several of its competitors including Virgin Atlantic, easyJet and Jet2. Len McCluskey, general secretary of union Unite, said it was \u201cfrankly irresponsible that BA would sit this out\u201d. A police force in Wales has urged English visitors to check its lockdown rules after being forced to turn away 1,000 cars from a beauty spot in just two days. Dyfed-Powys police said they have stopped tourists from as far as London who had travelled to a picturesque area in the Brecon Beacons known as \u201cwaterfall country\u201d last weekend. On Friday the force said many of the drivers stopped in the village of Ystradfellte claimed they did not know Wales has a five-mile limit for non-essential journeys. Meanwhile, in England people can now travel an unlimited distance for exercise and to access beauty spots. Offenders included a doctor from London who travelled to Brecon to buy lamb, a group from Devon who made a 350-mile round trip to Wisemans Bridge, Pembrokeshire, to \u201clook at the beach\u201d, and a birthday party from Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, who ventured to Elan Valley, Powys, for a barbecue. A spokeswoman for the force said: Police in Powys are reminding people to check the rules before they travel, as tourists from the Midlands, London and Bristol continue to visit despite lockdown restrictions. Many of those stopped claimed they thought the rules around travel were the same as in England, while others had deliberately flouted them. In Wales fines for repeated breaches of lockdown regulations start at \u00a360 but double for each repeated offence to a maximum of \u00a31,920. Snowdonia, the Elan Valley and the Pembrokeshire coast all remain closed to the public, as do all National Trust car parks and properties. Good morning. I\u2019m Lucy Campbell, taking over the blog for the rest of the day. As ever, please feel free to get in touch with news tips, comments and stories you think we should be covering here. Your thoughts are always welcome and hugely helpful. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ BBC Studios head Tim Davie will replace Tony Hall as the director-general of the corporation, it has been announced. Davie, one of the BBC\u2019s most senior executives, said in a statement: I am honoured to be appointed the BBC\u2019s next director-general. This has been a critical time for the UK and these past few months have shown just how much the BBC matters to people. Our mission has never been more relevant, important or necessary. I have a deep commitment to content of the highest quality and impartiality. Looking forward, we will need to accelerate change so that we serve all our audiences in this fast-moving world. Much great work has been done, but we will continue to reform, make clear choices and stay relevant. I am very confident we can do this because of the amazing teams of people that work at the BBC. The incumbent director-general, Lord Hall, said: I\u2019m delighted that Tim has been appointed as the next director-general. He is a fantastic leader. I wish him every success for the future. I know that the BBC is in safe hands. The Guardian\u2019s Mark Sweney has more. Doctors of the World have welcomed the launch of an inquiry into racial discrimination in the UK by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The organisation said it had carried out a rapid assessment of the circumstances and needs of communities excluded from healthcare services. The assessment revealed People unable to self-isolate because of housing and financial circumstances Literacy and language barriers prevented people getting through to NHS111. Poverty prevented some people reaching the NHS when they needed help and advice because they did not have mobile phone credit and people were forced to choose between food or phone credit. Digital exclusion caused by poverty prevented people from protecting themselves from COVID-19. Doctors of the World UK Policy and Advocacy Manager Anna Miller said: As a track and trace system is rolled out, and the pandemic response increasing relies on a technological solution, the disparities between those able to protect themselves and those who cannot will only increase. Put simply, if track and trace is going to work then the government needs to ensure everyone has enough money to buy phone credit. View the full report. In its report the ONS stated that there is evidence that Covid-19 is currently under-diagnosed. Looking at possible explanations for the number of non-Covid-19 excess deaths, it noted that a number of death certificates in England and Wales have stated that more information would be provided later, some of which have since been updated to mention Covid-19. It stated: This supports the theory that Covid-19 is under-diagnosed at present on death certificates. Deaths involving Covid-19 could also have been recorded as non-Covid-19 deaths if the person had a severe underlying condition that was exacerbated by Covid-19 - including deaths due to conditions such as chronic lower respiratory disease, dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Separately, the fact that deaths related to asthma and diabetes are occurring at a \u201csignificantly higher rate compared to the five-year average\u201d could indicate that some people with these conditions are not receiving care fast enough to prevent death taking place, due to extra pressures on the healthcare system. The ONS added that it is \u201cplausible\u201d that some of these deaths are because undiagnosed Covid-19 had \u201cexacerbated the pre-existing condition\u201d. The number of people with Covid-19 in England has fallen to around 5,600 new infections a day from around 8,000 reported last week, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. The ONS published data on how many people at any one time are infected with Covid-19 based on swab results from households across the country. It said: Modelling of the trend over time shows evidence that the number of people in England testing positive has decreased in recent weeks. There were an estimated 39,000 new Covid-19 infections per week in England between April 26 and May 30, equating to an incidence rate per week of 0.07 new cases per 100 people. This means fewer than one in every 1,000 people had Covid-19. Just over a week ago, on May 28, the ONS estimated there were around 54,000 new coronavirus infections per week in England, or around 8,000 a day. This suggests a drop of around a third between the two datasets. The estimates are based on swab tests of 19,000 people in 9,000 households. British Airways\u2019 owner International Airlines Group chief executive Willie Walsh says he is considering a legal challenge against the quarantine plans, Sky News are reporting. More on this as we get it. Access to public toilets is incredibly important, so please do help us map what is happening throughout the UK. Iran International TV has reported that British-Iranian citizen Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s lawyer Mahmoud Behzadi-Rad has said that Nazanin\u2019s furlough has been extended and that she is currently wearing an ankle tag, renewing hopes that she may soon be released form Evin Prison indefinitely. Behzadi had claimed this morning that Nazanin\u2019s previous leave had expired in early June and said: \u201cWe will have to wait to see what happens.\u201d He did not say how long Nazanin\u2019s leave has been extended for, but expressed hope that the instructions of the head of the judiciary of the Islamic Republic of Iran, to \u201cpardon and mitigate punishment\u201d would include a number of prisoners, including his client, Nazanin. Last week Richard Ratcliffe told the Observer that his wife was the victim of \u201cpsychological torture\u201d at the hands of the Iranian regime, her husband has said, as her hopes of being granted clemency were dashed for the second time in a week. The 41-year-old mother had been left \u201cdeflated\u201d, \u201cunsettled\u201d and desperate to see her five-year-old daughter, Gabriella, in England, Ratcliffe said. Police forces are planning their own contact tracing system over concerns the government\u2019s test and trace scheme could place officers in danger, according to Sky News. Sky reports: Under the plans, police officers who test positive for Covid-19 would not give their contacts to NHS contact tracers, but would instead inform their police force who would take over contact tracing to identify anyone at risk of catching the virus. The plans, which are being developed by national police organisations, could see police forces take over all contact tracing for police officers and staff, according to a source close to the matter. Another option being discussed is seconding staff from NHS test and trace to police forces, although police chiefs doubt Public Health England (PHE) has the resources to make this possible. Police forces are concerned strict application of contact tracing rules could see entire stations or units having to shut down, and that contact tracing could compromise sensitive information. The average house price fell for the third month in a row in May, according to an index. Across the UK, a 0.2% month-on-month decline in property values in May took the average house price to 237,808, Halifax said. It followed monthly falls of 0.6% in April and 0.3% in March. House prices were 2.6% higher compared with a year earlier. Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, said: This is the third successive monthly fall, though more modest than in April, and reflects a continued loss of momentum following what was a strong start to the year. Though it should still be noted that with a limited number of transactions available, calculating average house prices remains challenging and increased volatility is to be expected. People shielding in Wales have been told they should continue to do so until the middle of August. Like in England, on June 1 the Welsh Government advised people who are shielding that they could leave their homes to meet people from another household outdoors, as long as strictly follow to social distancing rules and good hygiene measures. But almost 130,000 people will this week begin to receive letters from the chief medical officer for Wales setting out the latest advice and will be told to continue shielding until 16 August. Dr Frank Atherton, Wales\u2019s chief medical officer said: We are asking all those in the shielding group to continue to shield until 16 August because coronavirus has not gone away. We want to do all we can to keep those people in this group safe and that means asking them to continue to shield. Thanks to reader Kaitey Dave for flagging this, and The BBC have got an interesting story, which has come out of a freedom of information request. It found that an exercise simulating a coronavirus outbreak in Scotland, which was shared with a UK government advisory group, showed a \u201cclear gap\u201d in preparedness. A report into Exercise Iris revealed frontline staff \u201cunease\u201d over personal protective equipment and \u201cthe need for substantive progress\u201d. The exercise simulated an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, a coronavirus like Sars-Cov-2 with different characteristics. The Scottish government says its findings were shared with attendees. Like the novel coronavirus, Mers-CoV causes a respiratory disease and key symptoms include fever and a cough. However, transmission rates are believed to be far lower and fatality rates are much higher. The Scottish health secretary has warned health board chiefs that failures to routinely test care home staff for coronavirus will be made public in a weekly league table from next week. In a strongly-worded letter to health board chief executives, Jeane Freeman ordered them to send her detailed plans on how they plan to implement the policy by 3pm on Friday, adding that the Scottish government will publish board-by-board data on the number of tests completed each week from next Wednesday. \u201cWhere directions are issued, these will not be for local interpretation \u2014 they must be implemented in full and without delay,\u201d she wrote. At this week\u2019s first minister\u2019s questions, Nicola Sturgeon was challenged repeatedly about testing in care homes after NRS figures revealed that more people have now died in care homes in Scotland than in hospitals. Sturgeon and Freeman have faced growing criticism over their directive to test all hospital patients twice before they are discharged to care homes on April 22, despite earlier warnings about the risks of asymptomatic infection. Nearly one thousand elderly patients were discharged from hospitals into care homes at the start of the pandemic without testing, and many staff fear that this had fatal results. Transport for London volunteers will be handing out single-use face masks for journeys over the next week before they become mandatory on public transport on June 15, as announced last night by the government. According to TfL, an estimated 30-50% of passengers are already wearing face coverings on journeys - in line with the Guardian\u2019s own surveys around Britain this week. It urges passengers to buy masks from local shps or make their own coverings, which \u201ccan be a simple cloth that covers the nose and mouth\u201d . As with many lockdown rules, the impression is that authorities don\u2019t expect to require fines and law enforcement for general co-operation - but from June 15 TfL said its \u201cpolice partners will help customers to comply with the requirement\u201d. Sadiq Khan told the BBC that there would be an \u201celement of discretion and good faith\u201d, with young children and people with breathing problems exempt, and the policy relying on \u201cpositive peer pressure\u201d \u2013 although he said commuters not \u201ctake the law into your own hands\u201d if they saw people without face coverings. Around 85% of Tube and bus services are now running but public transport capacity will be effectively 13-15% of normal levels with social distancing. With more businesses due to open on June 15, that date will also see another change, with older Londoners losing the right to use the Freedom Pass before 9am \u2013 agreed as part of the financial bailout package imposed on TfL by government. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has been doing the rounds today, defending the decision to ask all commuters to wear masks on public transport from June 15. He told BBC Breakfast: It is an additional measure, it is marginal, we accept it is marginal and the scientists weren\u2019t in full agreement about it but we think it is worth doing absolutely everything possible. He added that wearing a face covering is not as important as washing your hands or social distancing for preventing the spread of Covid-19. He said the reason face coverings have not been mandatory so far is because the transport system has only been at 5% capacity. He said: I am afraid this is not some panacea, wearing a face covering has been argued about and the scientists have said before and I have commented before that it has been a debatable point because what happens is that as people take those coverings on and off, it can lead to cross infection. I do think on balance it is right to do absolutely everything possible because it removes the doubt and provides some reassurance to passengers as well but it is not some panacea. Shapps compared the new face coverings rule on public transport to the alcohol ban introduced on Transport for London a decade ago: You won\u2019t be able to use public transport unless you are wearing it, so you could be asked to leave and ultimately you could be fined but I don\u2019t think that will be necessary in the vast majority of cases. There were all these discussions at the time but in the end most people just want to do the right thing, most people just want to get on top of this disease and here is something small but important that we can do. Shapps defended the Government\u2019s track and trace system, which the Guardian revealed might not be fully operational until September or October. He said the alleged delays only meant the app would continue to be improved. He said: The app itself will continue to be improved just as apps are always being improved and I tend to think they are never really finished. Just to be clear, right now, you\u2019ve got an NHS test and trace system which is indeed on global scales extremely impressive - to give you an example, yesterday I announced 233,000 tests had been carried out. Right now, if anyone watching this is feeling ill and they think they might have Covid-19 symptoms they can go online this minute and book a test - and the scale of testing right now is currently among the best in the world. He said the government had now recruited 25,000 contact tracers, who were making thousands of calls \u201cright now\u201d. He added: Anyone who gets a positive coronavirus outcome, their contacts are being requested - where they have been, who they have spoken to and how long they have been in those locations.\u201d Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary Ed Miliband has also been on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning. He argued that the government should help airlines, but it should insist on conditions that make them \u201cgo green\u201d. Laurence Taylor, deputy assistant commissioner at the Metropolitan Police, has warned that future mass gatherings to protest against the death of George Floyd would be \u201cunlawful\u201d due to the current coronavirus restrictions in place. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme The health protection regulations are really clear that it is unlawful. The Government said that for health reasons people should not be meeting in groups of six, so we would strongly encourage people not to come out and gather in these large numbers because they are putting themselves and others at risk. And if they do come out, then we would ask them to observe that social distancing, think about those around them. But of course, by coming and gathering in these large groups they are potentially risking their health and also risking taking the virus back to their families. Good Morning Britain\u2019s Kate Garraway has given a really moving update on the health of her husband Derek Draper on the show this morning. Draper has been in hospital for 10 weeks and has been put into a coma after being diagnosed with coronavirus. Speaking to her colleagues she said: He\u2019s still with us, he has fought the most extraordinary battle and I hate the idea of that but it is a battle. The fact that he\u2019s still here and holding on, I\u2019m so grateful that he is still here. He\u2019s very, very sick and as time goes on it\u2019s a virus, it\u2019s a little bit like a computer virus, the doctors manage one bit extraordinarily well and there seems to be hope and then there is something else. It\u2019s affected him from the top of his head to the tip of his toes. The UK\u2019s equality watchdog is launching an inquiry into \u201clong-standing, structural race inequality\u201d, which has been thrown into stark relief by the coronavirus pandemic. The Equality and Human Rights Commission said it would carry out in-depth analysis and develop evidence-based recommendations for urgent action to tackle entrenched racial inequalities in specific areas. Black and minority ethnic people have been disproportionately affected and have been two to three times more likely to die from Covid-19, according to a UCL study. A government-commissioned Public Health England (PHE) investigation found that people of Bangladeshi background in England were twice as likely as white Britons to die if they contracted Covid-19, and other BAME groups faced an increased risk of up to 50%. The mayor of London Sadiq Khan said Covid-19 had exposed \u201cthe major health inequalities that exist in our society\u201d, adding that he was pleased about the investigation. The move came as the Government Equalities Office announced a review into the government\u2019s response to inequalities in Covid-19 infection and death rates, including the impact of age, sex, occupation, obesity, comorbidities, geography, and ethnicity. Read the full story here: Here are some of the top stories in the UK today: The NHS coronavirus test-and-trace system designed to prevent a second deadly wave is not expected to work at full speed until September or October, the Guardian has learned. It comes as a leaked email from the chief executive of Serco \u2013 one of the main companies contracted to deliver the service \u2013 revealed how he doubted the scheme would evolve smoothly but said he wanted it to \u201ccement the position of the private sector\u201d in the NHS supply chain. Face coverings on public transport will be compulsory from 15 June in England to help stop the transmission of coronavirus as more people go back to work, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said on Thursday. Rail passengers can now be warned of busy trains and stations before they leave home as part of a UK industry system designed to help maintain physical distancing and safe travel during the coronavirus pandemic. A row has broken out between Priti Patel and British Airways over the plans to quarantine travellers for 14 days as the airline refused to meet her, and a government source branded the company \u201cnot serious about getting Britain working again\u201d. Dentists have warned there will be no return to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for dentistry in England report the BBC when practices can reopen from Monday, with some saying they lacked enough warning of openings and do not have the necessary protective kit. I\u2019m Lexy Topping and I\u2019ll be with you on the UK coronavirus liveblog until 11am this morning.

The monthly report comes from a survey administered in one week in the middle of the month (in May, it was administered 10-16 May). Meanwhile, the weekly reports come from states reporting the number of new unemployment claims they received that week.</p> <p>The headline figures from the latest monthly report indicate the risky game of reopening America means jobs are coming back but other measures in the report indicate the widespread economic devastation has not been relieved yet.</p> <p>Here are five key takeaways from the report that show it is a more sobering picture of the economy:</p> <h2>1. Racial disparities remain</h2> <p>While people may be celebrating that the national unemployment rate in May fell from 14.7% in April to 13.3%, the black unemployment has remained virtually unchanged. In April, the black unemployment rate was 16.7%, in May it was 16.8%.</p> <p>Meanwhile white Americans saw the largest decrease in unemployment of any racial group, going from 14.2% in April to 12.4% in May. Historically, the white unemployment rate is lower than the national unemployment rate, while black unemployment can be nearly twice as high.&nbsp;</p> <p>Hispanic Americans are still seeing the highest unemployment rate of any racial group, with a 17.6% unemployment rate in May, down from 18.9% in April.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/hshierholz/status/1268900107170152448\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">These <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JobsDay?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#JobsDay</a> numbers highlight the damage of the coronavirus ression\u2014a recession that has caused greater job loss in black households than white households and that will, as a result, exacerbate existing racial inequalities. 10/</p>&mdash; Heidi Shierholz (@hshierholz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hshierholz/status/1268900107170152448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 5, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>2. 19.6m jobs are still gone</h2> <p><br>While 2.5m jobs coming back is not insignificant, March and April saw 1.4m and 20.7m decreases in employment, respectively. That means that 19.6m have still not come back since shutdown orders were put in place in March.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/econjared/status/1268891456661598210\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here&#39;s a simple but important picture of what&#39;s happening to jobs. Extremely welcome reversal, of course, if it sticks, but the magnitude of the losses means that even if this uptick pace continues, it would take almost a year just to make up lost ground. <a href=\"https://t.co/kClNyb5kUz\">pic.twitter.com/kClNyb5kUz</a></p>&mdash; Jared Bernstein (@econjared) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/econjared/status/1268891456661598210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 5, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>3. Hospitality and leisure gained 1.2m jobs but still has a 35% jobless rate&nbsp;</h2> <p>Almost half of the employment gains in May were from the hospitality and leisure <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t18.htm\">industry</a>, which has been the industry hit hardest by shutdown orders. In May, the industry saw a 1.2m increase in jobs after it lost 7.5m jobs in April and 743,000 jobs in March.&nbsp;</p> <p>Other hard-hit industries saw increases in employment: construction added 464,000 jobs, education and health services 424,000 and retail recorded an increase of 368,000.&nbsp;</p> <p>But unemployment rates in those industries remain high. Leisure and hospitality had a 35.9% unemployment rate in May, nearly three times the overall national unemployment rate.

      "bodyText": "Friday brought hope that the US economy is finally digging its way out of the rubble after Covid-19 wiped out millions of jobs \u2013 with no indication of when they would be coming back. But beneath the surface, deep problems remain. The Department of Labor\u2019s monthly jobs report brought surprising news that the unemployment rate decreased to 13.3% and the economy gained 2.5m jobs in May. The report, which is released at the beginning of each month, differs from the weekly unemployment report the department releases every Thursday. The monthly report comes from a survey administered in one week in the middle of the month (in May, it was administered 10-16 May). Meanwhile, the weekly reports come from states reporting the number of new unemployment claims they received that week. The headline figures from the latest monthly report indicate the risky game of reopening America means jobs are coming back but other measures in the report indicate the widespread economic devastation has not been relieved yet. Here are five key takeaways from the report that show it is a more sobering picture of the economy: 1. Racial disparities remain While people may be celebrating that the national unemployment rate in May fell from 14.7% in April to 13.3%, the black unemployment has remained virtually unchanged. In April, the black unemployment rate was 16.7%, in May it was 16.8%. Meanwhile white Americans saw the largest decrease in unemployment of any racial group, going from 14.2% in April to 12.4% in May. Historically, the white unemployment rate is lower than the national unemployment rate, while black unemployment can be nearly twice as high. Hispanic Americans are still seeing the highest unemployment rate of any racial group, with a 17.6% unemployment rate in May, down from 18.9% in April. 2. 19.6m jobs are still gone While 2.5m jobs coming back is not insignificant, March and April saw 1.4m and 20.7m decreases in employment, respectively. That means that 19.6m have still not come back since shutdown orders were put in place in March. 3. Hospitality and leisure gained 1.2m jobs but still has a 35% jobless rate Almost half of the employment gains in May were from the hospitality and leisure industry, which has been the industry hit hardest by shutdown orders. In May, the industry saw a 1.2m increase in jobs after it lost 7.5m jobs in April and 743,000 jobs in March. Other hard-hit industries saw increases in employment: construction added 464,000 jobs, education and health services 424,000 and retail recorded an increase of 368,000. But unemployment rates in those industries remain high. Leisure and hospitality had a 35.9% unemployment rate in May, nearly three times the overall national unemployment rate. Retail had the second-highest unemployment rate of any industry at 15.1%. 4. Millions more people gave up looking for work or had their hours cut The official unemployment rate only counts people who indicated they are willing and able to work and are currently not working in any capacity. But millions more people whose jobs have been affected by the economic crisis are not represented in that rate. Many people are still working, but had their hours cut \u2013 perhaps because they were a server at a restaurant that is now just doing takeout or they work at a grocery store that reduced the hours it is open. These people want to be working a full, 40-hour work week, but cannot. More than 10 million people indicated they were working part-time because of economic conditions, either business conditions have worsened or they could only find part-time work. The U-6 is the unemployment rate that includes the total unemployed plus people who have given up looking for work or are working part-time but want full-time employment. The U-6 in February was 7%, while in May it was 21.2%. This gives a more in-depth picture of how many workers have been affected by the pandemic. 5. The unemployment rate is probably higher than it appears For the last few months, the Department of Labor has admitted that the official unemployment rate is probably higher because people are not filling out the survey correctly. The survey allows people to indicate they are employed but absent from work the week the survey was conducted and asks them to list the reason why, such as childcare, medical purposes, school or vacation. The survey instructs those who are employed but are not at work due to coronavirus to be marked as unemployed on temporary layoff. But the department noted that a higher-than-usual number of people indicated they were employed but not at work for \u201cother reasons\u201d and suspect that they are misclassified. While in other years during this time, about 500,000 said they were employed but out of work for \u201cother reasons\u201d, in May, that number climbed to 5.4 million. If those workers \u201chad been classified as unemployed on temporary layoff, the overall unemployment rate would have been about 3 percentage points higher than report\u201d, the Department of Labor said in May\u2019s report. The department said it was investigating how it could mitigate the misclassification in the future.",

Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out \u2013 eventually.</p>\n    <p>At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 \u2013 higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.</p>\n    <p>The reproduction number is not fixed, though.

That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.</p>\n    <p>The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus; people's behaviour, such as social distancing;&nbsp;and a population\u2019s immunity.

Mobile phones weighed as much as two kilos, hair metal was still big and George Bush \u2013 the older one \u2013 was president of the United States.</p> <p>Since then, the country has enjoyed a run of 29 years of uninterrupted economic growth, fuelled by China\u2019s apparently insatiable demand for coal and iron ore, that put the memory of recession, unemployment queues and boarded-up shopping strips beyond the reach of an entire generation.</p> <p>Through drought, flood, the dot.com crash and even the global financial crisis, during which it was the only developed economy not to shrink, Australia continued to bloom \u2013 although for the past few years its citizens have suffered from stagnant wages growth, with the spoils of success instead flowing to company shareholders.</p> <p>Now, young people are being hit the hardest by the downturn, with the bulk of an estimated 1.2 million jobs lost, ripped from industries including hospitality, the arts and retail that tended to employ large numbers people in their 20s or early 30s.</p> <p>Gross domestic product shrank by 0.3% in the first three months of the year, and the economic forecasts are gloomy at best, with economists expecting the next set of numbers will be much worse.</p> <p>And it is by no means clear that the federal government will repeat the rescue of a decade ago, when it pumped money into the pockets of householders and the broader economy, after emergency spending ends in September.</p> <p>The early 90s recession, which got under way in late 1990 and lasted about a year, was the result of the end of the long, flashy economic boom of the 1980s coming crashing to a halt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9951f57dd9fb44f526e9c6e3364ea46c5dcfb91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9951f57dd9fb44f526e9c6e3364ea46c5dcfb91/0_188_3200_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bob Hawke and Paul Keating in Sydney in 1988.

      "bodyText": "Paul Tung has never seen anything like it before. At 30 \u2013 he turns 31 this month \u2013 the former airline sales manager is too young to remember the last time Australia\u2019s economy went backwards in the early 1990s. He\u2019s been laid off by airline Virgin Australia, which is teetering on the brink of collapse after it was grounded by government travel bans, and because the entire travel sector has been devastated by the coronavirus crisis he has so far had no luck finding a new job. So far, some of the damage has been cushioned by increased unemployment benefits, and the support of his partner, Kevin, who still has a job. But with an estimated 1.2 million people thrown out of work due to the coronavirus economic shutdown, Tung worries what will happen to him and others in the same boat if benefits revert to their usual levels in September, as Australia\u2019s conservative government plans. \u201cI\u2019ve still got a mortgage,\u201d Tung says. \u201cIf we can\u2019t actually have a secure job by that time, we are quite screwed up.\u201d \u2018They might be out of work for a while\u2019 Last time Australia\u2019s economy went backwards Tung was, as he says, \u201cbeing born\u201d. Mobile phones weighed as much as two kilos, hair metal was still big and George Bush \u2013 the older one \u2013 was president of the United States. Since then, the country has enjoyed a run of 29 years of uninterrupted economic growth, fuelled by China\u2019s apparently insatiable demand for coal and iron ore, that put the memory of recession, unemployment queues and boarded-up shopping strips beyond the reach of an entire generation. Through drought, flood, the dot.com crash and even the global financial crisis, during which it was the only developed economy not to shrink, Australia continued to bloom \u2013 although for the past few years its citizens have suffered from stagnant wages growth, with the spoils of success instead flowing to company shareholders. Now, young people are being hit the hardest by the downturn, with the bulk of an estimated 1.2 million jobs lost, ripped from industries including hospitality, the arts and retail that tended to employ large numbers people in their 20s or early 30s. Gross domestic product shrank by 0.3% in the first three months of the year, and the economic forecasts are gloomy at best, with economists expecting the next set of numbers will be much worse. And it is by no means clear that the federal government will repeat the rescue of a decade ago, when it pumped money into the pockets of householders and the broader economy, after emergency spending ends in September. The early 90s recession, which got under way in late 1990 and lasted about a year, was the result of the end of the long, flashy economic boom of the 1980s coming crashing to a halt. As dole queues and flannel shirts replaced corner offices and power shoulders, the then treasurer, Paul Keating, famously said it was \u201ca recession that Australia had to have\u201d \u2013 a claim the veteran economist Saul Eslake dismisses as an attempt to rewrite history. Eslake, a former economist at several big banks including ANZ, says that while the growth of the economy since then makes the 1990s slump look small, it devastated people\u2019s lives. \u201cIt took a long time to get unemployment down, and that\u2019s why people now use the term \u2018scarring\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cThe longer people remain out of work, the harder it is to find work, and if they do find work it\u2019s usually at lower wages.\u201d Because today\u2019s recession was caused by a deliberate choice to shut down parts of the economy, rather than a financial collapse, Eslake is confident that more of those laid off this time \u2013 as many as three-quarters \u2013 will get to go back to their old jobs, even if at reduced hours. \u201cBut there\u2019s another cohort that won\u2019t get their jobs back,\u201d he says. \u201cIf they\u2019re in tourism or something like that, that\u2019s going to be the last sector to recover so they might be out of work for a while.\u201d Eslake says the Australian economy\u2019s golden streak of nearly 30 years was propelled by four factors \u2013 high migration, a strong relationship with major trading partner China, a housing boom and good macroeconomic policy. But he fears all but good macroeconomic policy are now out of reach. \u201cWe\u2019ve had 30 years with those four things helping us along, with wind in our direction,\u201d and three of them aren\u2019t going to be there. \u2018They\u2019re reluctant players\u2019 Adding to the grim picture, the Australian economy was already weak before the coronavirus crisis hit. Growth was weak \u2013 last year, the country fell into in a \u201cper capita recession\u201d because economic growth was less than the increase in population \u2013 and since the end of the mining boom wages have been moribund, rising just 2.1% in the year to the end of March. Inequality has increased since the early 90s, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics data compiled by the government\u2019s in-house thinktank, the Productivity Commission. So far, a conservative Coalition government has given no hint it wants to address these problems. Instead, much of the talk coming from the national capital, Canberra, has involved painting ideas such as cutting corporate regulation and reducing the power of Australia\u2019s already-struggling union movement as solutions to the economic crisis. Despite a historic aversion to deficit spending, the ruling Liberal-National Coalition has so far pledged a total of more than $130bn \u2013 more than 10% of the Australian economy \u2013 to keep things going through the shutdown. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, are now under pressure from a restive backbench to stop spending. So far, the only economic stimulus program that goes out beyond September that the government has committed to is a relatively small $688m committed to funding home renovations. Wayne Swan, who was treasurer of the Rudd government during the 2008 global financial crisis, dismisses the program as \u201cboutique\u201d and \u201cfucking ridiculous\u201d. He says the government should learn both from his success during the GFC and the failures of his Labor party to deal properly with the 90s recession. \u201cThe mistakes that have always been made, going back to the great depression, is that particularly conservatives, flick the switch to austerity too early,\u201d he says. He says his stimulus program restored confidence because of its \u201clong tail\u201d of construction projects, which gave business confidence to invest. \u201cThey\u2019ve got none of that, none of that,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re reluctant players in a game they don\u2019t believe in.\u201d \u2018I feel bad every day\u2019 Eslake thinks that in the end Swan\u2019s government poured too much money into the economy, but he reckons that at the beginning of an economic crisis there is no way governments can know how bad it will get. \u201cYou\u2019re either going to do too much \u2013 or at least announce too much \u2013 or do too little,\u201d he says. \u201cKnowing that you\u2019re going to make one of those mistakes, in these circumstances the right mistake to make is to promise to do more than it turns out you need to do. \u201cIf you do that you can always stop or wind it back once it\u2019s clear that you\u2019ve done too much. Whereas if you don\u2019t do enough, not only will what you do not have worked, but you will have undermined confidence in your capacity to come up with the right amount when you try a second or third time.\u201d Meanwhile, the economic disaster is playing havoc with Tung\u2019s life. He was planning to get married to Kevin, \u201cbut we\u2019ve had to postpone that, not only for the social distancing but also because of the finances\u201d. He feels bad that Kevin is now the sole breadwinner for the family and their dog, a 12-year-old Alaskan Malamute named Tyrese. \u201cThe emotional effect is something we have to look into as well,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel bad every day.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>In one of those strange circle of life things, about three years ago, I had <a href=\"https://meanjin.com.au/essays/political-life/\">a conversation with Greg Combet</a> about how Australian politics could pull itself out of the death spiral of rolling leadership coups.</p> <p>Combet \u2013 one of Labor\u2019s brightest stars \u2013 had burned out during the leadership feud between Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, and with the grinding effort of legislating a carbon price in a minority parliament. Given he was a substantial loss to public life, I was interested in his thoughts about how things might become less toxic.</p> <p>Part of the problem, Combet thought, was Canberra\u2019s parliamentary culture was too insular, and the pace of governing was too punishing. One way to combat that would be adopting the American model, where people were recruited from outside the political system to serve in the cabinet or the executive. Recruiting high-powered outsiders from diverse backgrounds to mingle with the political lifers for a term of government would refresh the gene pool in the 2600 postcode, and allow some members of a government to focus exclusively on policy-making rather than having to juggle portfolio and representative responsibilities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/05/coalition-governments-homebuilder-grants-for-renovations-and-building-criticised-by-economists-and-backbench-mps\">Coalition government's grants for renovations and building criticised by economists and backbench MPs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a strange bit of happenstance, years later, Combet finds himself on Scott Morrison\u2019s National Covid-19 Coordination Commission. The NCCC is not the model Combet floated, because the commissioners are advisers, not decision-makers. But the group is not that distant from his outsiders-inside concept.</p> <p>The commission was a prime ministerial improvisation. Morrison pulled together a high-powered group of suits at the height of the Covid-19 crisis because he needed people with the skills to manage logistics in the economy. He needed people who knew how to find or conjure up essentials, like personal protective equipment, when global supply chains were profoundly disrupted.</p> <p>Nev Power, a former Fortescue executive, and a person with many corporate and philanthropic interests, including being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/23/covid-commission-boss-nev-power-steps-back-at-gas-company-amid-conflict-of-interest-concerns\">deputy chairman of a gas company</a>, Strike Energy, was drafted to run the show.</p> <p>The group began as troubleshooters and river guides, but it has evolved beyond the initial brief to become something of a kitchen cabinet for Morrison, providing advice on how the economy can recover after the pandemic. Covid has been a crisis where ad-hoc cabinets have proliferated. I\u2019ll come back to this point shortly, but first, we need to finish ventilating Combet\u2019s idea.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>So we have the bizarre situation of an in-house conflict of interest register that can\u2019t be scrutinised by the people paying for the enterprise \u2013 taxpayers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When he championed the idea of recruiting expert civilians to the heart of Australian governments in our conversation in 2017, Combet was clear doing this would require significant adjustments to governance. Given these external appointments would be funded by taxpayers, new forms of public accountability would need to be considered, perhaps a committee process that would deal solely with the draftees.</p> <p>But in this particular instance, we\u2019ve had the coordination commission constituted in haste, with accountability retrofitted in what looks to be chaotic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/05/government-refuses-to-release-conflict-of-interest-disclosures-from-covid-commission-members\">and patchy fashion</a>. A couple of quick examples.

      "bodyText": "In one of those strange circle of life things, about three years ago, I had a conversation with Greg Combet about how Australian politics could pull itself out of the death spiral of rolling leadership coups. Combet \u2013 one of Labor\u2019s brightest stars \u2013 had burned out during the leadership feud between Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, and with the grinding effort of legislating a carbon price in a minority parliament. Given he was a substantial loss to public life, I was interested in his thoughts about how things might become less toxic. Part of the problem, Combet thought, was Canberra\u2019s parliamentary culture was too insular, and the pace of governing was too punishing. One way to combat that would be adopting the American model, where people were recruited from outside the political system to serve in the cabinet or the executive. Recruiting high-powered outsiders from diverse backgrounds to mingle with the political lifers for a term of government would refresh the gene pool in the 2600 postcode, and allow some members of a government to focus exclusively on policy-making rather than having to juggle portfolio and representative responsibilities. In a strange bit of happenstance, years later, Combet finds himself on Scott Morrison\u2019s National Covid-19 Coordination Commission. The NCCC is not the model Combet floated, because the commissioners are advisers, not decision-makers. But the group is not that distant from his outsiders-inside concept. The commission was a prime ministerial improvisation. Morrison pulled together a high-powered group of suits at the height of the Covid-19 crisis because he needed people with the skills to manage logistics in the economy. He needed people who knew how to find or conjure up essentials, like personal protective equipment, when global supply chains were profoundly disrupted. Nev Power, a former Fortescue executive, and a person with many corporate and philanthropic interests, including being deputy chairman of a gas company, Strike Energy, was drafted to run the show. The group began as troubleshooters and river guides, but it has evolved beyond the initial brief to become something of a kitchen cabinet for Morrison, providing advice on how the economy can recover after the pandemic. Covid has been a crisis where ad-hoc cabinets have proliferated. I\u2019ll come back to this point shortly, but first, we need to finish ventilating Combet\u2019s idea. When he championed the idea of recruiting expert civilians to the heart of Australian governments in our conversation in 2017, Combet was clear doing this would require significant adjustments to governance. Given these external appointments would be funded by taxpayers, new forms of public accountability would need to be considered, perhaps a committee process that would deal solely with the draftees. But in this particular instance, we\u2019ve had the coordination commission constituted in haste, with accountability retrofitted in what looks to be chaotic and patchy fashion. A couple of quick examples. In the middle of May, officials reported NCCC commissioners were required to disclose any conflicts of interest ahead of any internal deliberations, but a special adviser to the commission on manufacturing, Andrew Liveris, the former chairman and chief executive of the Dow Chemical Company, was not required to make a disclosure. It wasn\u2019t clear why not, because Liveris was obviously hands on, preparing advice recommending a taxpayer-backed expansion of the gas industry. A draft of that advice later leaked. A couple of weeks later, it was reported that Liveris was now required to make a declaration, but none of these declarations would be made public. We\u2019ve learned this week that commissioners are required to declare any potential conflicts of interest to one another, but Morrison\u2019s department is refusing to make these declarations public. So we have the truly bizarre situation of an in-house conflict of interest register that can\u2019t be scrutinised by the people paying for the whole enterprise \u2013 taxpayers. As well as accountability procedures obviously lagging the advice giving, the NCCC enterprise is expanding. It started with a budget of $3m, and that\u2019s now up to $5.4m. There\u2019s evidence of mission creep. A Senate committee examining the government\u2019s response to coronavirus heard this week a whole-of-government communications group had been located within the orbit of the commission rather than in the prime minister\u2019s department, which is a head-scratcher, given the NCCC started as a nuts and bolts group, evolved to a policy advisory group, and now is apparently contributing to government messaging.

The point of the stroll down memory lane is to highlight the intrinsic problems associated with putting the advice cart before the governance horse. For what it\u2019s worth, I think Combet, in-principle, was right: it is good for governments to open the windows and get a range of voices in (the emphasis here being range of voices, and the problem with the NCCC is the membership isn\u2019t diverse enough). But it\u2019s best that happens not as an improvisation, but as part of a carefully thought out strategy \u2013 otherwise the clean-up, rather than the contribution, becomes the story.

Work has given me my best friends, meaningful work, and an educated understanding of the world. But it\u2019s also utterly reductive, demoralising, and humiliating. I am one of the lucky ones, with a salaried, permanent job, and yet it feels actually like an abusive relationship.

Shelter, food and interesting culture are more important.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Anonymous, Hokianga</strong></p> <h2>\u2018Chronic problems exposed\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cThe biggest changes I hope to see are not in my home but in society at large, where Covid-19 has thrown some chronic problems into stark relief. We could try to get back to how things were, but why, when we know how dysfunctional it was?\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Ben Whitmore, Raglan, 43</strong></em></p> <h2>\u2018Greater appreciation of time\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cI would hope to see a new \u2018normal\u2019, one where people appreciate their time more and working from home is a real possibility. It seems as if many people gained a greater appreciation for their time, health, and nature during the lockdown, and it would be a shame if this was lost so quickly and without serious consideration for what life could be like.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>Edward, 29, Auckland</strong></em></p>",

I am going to miss the quiet streets, empty skies and more audible bird song \u2013 that was the silver lining during our lockdown.\u201d Nicki Frances, Lower Hutt, early 50s \u2018Rely on the outside world less\u2019 \u201cI believe New Zealand needs to look at how it can look after itself more when this happens again. I don\u2019t think New Zealand should give up on globalism but I do think we should rely on the outside world less.\u201d Nicola, Auckland \u2018Unrelenting greyness of the office\u2019 \u201cI would love to be able to retain the silence and the birdsong. The impact of traffic noise has been shown to be all-pervasive harm to our peace and connection to nature. Electric cars and bikes are far quieter \u2013 I would like to see a definite and fixed timetable for the phase-out of all combustion engines. I\u2019ve loved being able to enjoy the sunshine all day long, while working from home. When I stop for a coffee, I can go sit in the sun, or go potter outside amongst the plants. When I think of going back to the office, all I see in my mind is the unrelenting greyness of shadowy office space. I no longer want to spend the best part of every day sitting in the gloom. But most of all, working from home has made me realise how stressful my work is, and how much I dread the everyday office conflict, hierarchy, surveillance and \u2018constructive criticism\u2019. Work has given me my best friends, meaningful work, and an educated understanding of the world. But it\u2019s also utterly reductive, demoralising, and humiliating. I am one of the lucky ones, with a salaried, permanent job, and yet it feels actually like an abusive relationship. Lockdown has made me realise more than ever I need to get out, and find some other way to earn a living \u2013 independent, creative, and with my self-respect in one piece.\u201d Anonymous, Wellington, 48 \u2018I love people\u2019 \u201cI love people so I want to be able to carry on just like before.\u201d Leif, Auckland, 82 \u2018This pandemic is a portal\u2019 \u201cAs the wonderful Arundhati Roy wrote shortly after the Covid-19 pandemic had been declared, this pandemic is a portal. We can step through to work towards a world focused on human and planetary health, happiness and wellbeing, or we can try to \u2018get back to normal\u2019 \u2013 which means continuing the unsustainable economic rat race that has been driving us into a spiralling vortex of problems. I\u2019m for going through the portal. The first thing we need to do is change our mindsets \u2013 we\u2019ve become an urbanised consumer society \u2013 and we\u2019d do well to listen to the voices of our first people who work so hard to teach us kaitiakitanga (guardianship and protection), a way of managing the environment, based on the M\u0101ori world view.\u201d Anne, South Island \u2018Not the same dynamic\u2019 \u201cIn terms of work-life I\u2019m quite pleased to go back to the office, I really enjoy the team I work with and working from home doesn\u2019t give the same team dynamic that I\u2019m used to. I also really enjoy the separation between home and work life which just isn\u2019t possible where I currently live.\u201d Anonymous, 28, Wellington \u2018Community values\u2019 \u201cIt seems the silver lining in NZ has been a reinforcement of some core community values which may have been lost over the last few decades. That may be a bit of a generalisation but I\u2019ve noticed more care and consideration in my own neighbourhood over this time.\u201d Tim, 49, Lower Hutt \u2018No return to business as usual\u2019 \u201cUltimately Covid is another expression of climate change. As is the severe drought we are still experiencing. I am not an advocate for going back to business as usual. Shelter, food and interesting culture are more important.\u201d Anonymous, Hokianga \u2018Chronic problems exposed\u2019 \u201cThe biggest changes I hope to see are not in my home but in society at large, where Covid-19 has thrown some chronic problems into stark relief. We could try to get back to how things were, but why, when we know how dysfunctional it was?\u201d Ben Whitmore, Raglan, 43 \u2018Greater appreciation of time\u2019 \u201cI would hope to see a new \u2018normal\u2019, one where people appreciate their time more and working from home is a real possibility. It seems as if many people gained a greater appreciation for their time, health, and nature during the lockdown, and it would be a shame if this was lost so quickly and without serious consideration for what life could be like.\u201d Edward, 29, Auckland",

Every Thursday they knew the Argus came out and that had all the info for the week.\u201d</p> <p>Veana Scott worked at the Argus as a journalist, editor and photographer for 26 years before retiring in 2009. \u201cI know that sounds rather strange,\u201d she says, \u201cbut then we\u2019re farmers in the district and I couldn\u2019t move the farm and I loved my writing and I loved my job and I started just a young journo and finished up as the editor, so I did have a fair bit of power.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29d60aa49f7844eb620ddcd08312289abb33be9a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29d60aa49f7844eb620ddcd08312289abb33be9a/0_676_2773_1663/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former journalist for the Wagin Argus, Veana Scott\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former Wagin Argus editor Veana Scott fears in-depth reporting will disappear as papers shift online.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Veana Scott</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scott, now in her early 70s, enjoyed doing in-depth interviews, and fears that kind of reporting may disappear from rural areas as papers shift online. \u201cIt\u2019ll be three or four paragraphs of this, that or the other, and you won\u2019t be able to have that in-depth [story] that I think a lot of country people love.\u201d</p> <p>Phil Blight, 62, has been the shire president for the past 12 years. Did he read the Argus? \u201cEvery week.\u201d According to Blight, the town has lost a faithful historian.</p> <p>\u201cI can remember the front page, for example, when Donald Campbell drove through town [in 1964] after having smashed the world speed record in Lake Dumbleyung just down the road,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s recorded now in the archives of the Argus, and that won\u2019t happen again. To me that\u2019s pretty sad.\u201d</p> <p>If the Argus was the historian of Wagin, Don and Coral Davies are the historians of the Argus. Don worked there from 1956 to 1999, starting as an apprentice linotype operator and taking over the business \u2013 the Argus and a commercial printing press \u2013 when his stepfather, the previous owner, died in 1972. Coral handled accounts, took photographs and \u201canything that needed doing\u201d.</p> <p>In 1993 Don reluctantly sold to Rural Press, which in 2007 merged with Fairfax, which has since been taken over by Nine.</p> <p>Now aged 78 and 71, Don and Coral felt so strongly about preserving the paper\u2019s legacy that they staged a low-level heist upon hearing the bound archives had been left behind in the old Argus building when it was sold in 2012.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76f27a2cc4201da2ca5f1c470ff03e8ed593ac98\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76f27a2cc4201da2ca5f1c470ff03e8ed593ac98/0_0_1633_1184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Don Davies at the Wagin Argus\u2019s old Linotype machine\" width=\"1000\" height=\"725\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former Wagin Argus owner Don Davies at the old Linotype machine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Don Davies</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The new owner found the annals of history simply stacked out the back. \u201cHe asked someone at the local grocery store who he should contact, and they said us,\u201d Coral says. The Davies weren\u2019t sure if Rural Press would try to lay claim to the archives, but slipped in and rescued them regardless.</p> <p>\u201cI guess we felt like we didn\u2019t have any authority to be doing it,\u201d Coral says. \u201cWe just made sure they were safe.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt showed you how much they thought of the area,\u201d Don says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2020/may/30/the-rot-in-australian-media-is-already-advanced-wwe-need-to-understand-the-damage-wrought-in-2020\">The rot in Australian media is already advanced. We need to understand the damage wrought in 2020 | Jason Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Davies look back with great sadness about how things ended.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the reasons we sold out in the first place was because we couldn\u2019t have financed the changes to digital and we knew that Rural Press could,\u201d Don says.</p> <p>\u201cWe sold to preserve it,\u201d Coral adds, \u201cnot to have it close down.\u201d</p> <p>But even as they mourn the Argus, Wagin locals are clear-eyed about its decline.</p> <p>At its height in the 80s, there were eight people employed across the buzzing newsroom and noisy printing press. By 2014, the paper was staffed solely by Blayde Grzelka, a teenager fresh out of high school who was doing his best at his first media gig. He spent three days a week in Wagin, living in a room at the local pub, and filed to an editor an hour and a half away in Collie. The other two days he filed for the Fairfax paper in Mandurah.</p> <p>\u201cIt might have been a bit too much for me to handle at the time, but I made it work,\u201d Grzelka says.</p> <p>There were other problems. Advertising in the Argus had plummeted, and the lucrative Woolorama program was basically keeping the paper afloat. Blight recalls making the case for the Argus to a Fairfax executive, and being told to go and count the number of ads in a recent edition. There were five. \u201cI thought, \u2018wow, nothing could survive on that\u2019,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2705c73c9dace3bc4c704b8f0b8aa44ea0db435\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2705c73c9dace3bc4c704b8f0b8aa44ea0db435/0_60_1280_964/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coral Davies sits on printed copies of the Wagin Argus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"753\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coral Davies sits on printed copies of the Wagin Argus just before she retired in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wagin Argus \u2013 Coral Davies</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So when The Argus finally folded, locals were sad, but not surprised. The model was broken. Few understand this better than Grzelka, who says he wrote for nine different Fairfax papers in regional WA between 2014 and 2017. As of this month, two are still printing.</p> <p>Wagin was an interesting place to cut his teeth, Grzelka says, but he became dispirited after encountering pushback on his attempts to write about mental health. As his career progressed, he struggled to find meaning in his work, and eventually left journalism.</p> <p>\u201cAt the end, when I was reporting there, I don\u2019t think I did a whole lot of good,\u201d he says, of the Argus. \u201cIt was just a thing that has always existed there, and they needed it to still exist, and that\u2019s why I was there.\u201d</p> <p>How are stories in Wagin told now? Some nearby towns still have newspapers owned by Seven West Media. The Narrogin Observer does a good job of covering the area, according to Blight, but it\u2019s not the same. \u201cNot your own town, not your own identity,\u201d he says. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t quite cut the mustard.\u201d</p> <p>Each time a country paper shuts down there is a ripple effect, spreading out to the smaller towns in its orbit. The Wagin paper used to cover the tiny towns of Dumbleyung and Lake Grace, now the Narrogin paper covers Wagin. \u201cAnything to the east of us, there wouldn\u2019t be a journalist within cooee,\u201d says Coral Davies.</p> <p>Social media plays a role, with some groups and pages devoted to sharing Wagin events and chatter. Everyone agrees that this leaves out many older people in the area.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re probably halfway between everyone being engaged with social media and no one being engaged with social media, so there\u2019s a vast tract of our community who wouldn\u2019t know what happened last week,\u201d Blight says. As Coral Davies puts it, the paper folded \u201ca generation too soon\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f7be8396409e452ccc26c4bead10d8ffbfd5dd13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7be8396409e452ccc26c4bead10d8ffbfd5dd13/0_0_183_276/183.jpg\" alt=\"Front page of the Wagin Argus from 1978\" width=\"183\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A front page of the Wagin Argus from 1978.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wagin Argus</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the Argus went, the local community resource centre started putting out a newsletter, the Wagin Wool Press.</p> <p>Jessica Hamersley, 70, is on the volunteer committee.

Funding is cobbled together from the centre, advertising and sales.</p> <p>Elsewhere, community-run publications have popped up that fall closer to the newspaper end of the spectrum.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/18/more-than-150-australian-newsrooms-shut-since-january-2019-as-covid-19-deepens-media-crisis\">More than 150 Australian newsrooms shut since January 2019 as Covid-19 deepens media crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Merredin, halfway between Perth and Kalgoorlie, the community-run paper is called the Phoenix.

      "bodyText": "In the great tradition of country towns with unusual claims to fame, Wagin is home to the second largest ram sculpture in Australia. The sheep and wheat town, population 1,852, is 230km south-east of Perth. Its 30-foot-tall Giant Ram statue, unveiled in May 1985, held the crown for just four months before it was tragically usurped by the 50-foot Big Merino in Goulburn, which opened in September the same year. When this history unfolded, the Wagin Argus was 80 years old and thriving. The newspaper went on to celebrate its 110th birthday in March 2015 at the annual Woolorama festival, where its lone 20-year-old journalist accepted a commemorative award. \u201cWe hope to express the district\u2019s hope and expectation that providence will continue to smile on the good ship Wagin Argus and all those who sail in her,\u201d the presenter said. Six months later, she sank. \u201cFairfax planning to axe Wagin Argus, Merredin-Wheatbelt Mercury, Central Midlands Advocate\u201d read the ABC headline. The article added, unconvincingly: \u201cThe regions will instead be serviced by an expanded Farm Weekly newspaper.\u201d It was an early event in Australia\u2019s unfolding regional media crisis, now much accelerated as media giants cease to print, or shut altogether, scores of titles in the coronavirus pandemic. And it offers lessons, too \u2013 some dispiriting, others hopeful \u2013 about what the future may hold for affected towns. Asked what the Argus meant to them, Wagin locals offer various accolades: \u201cIt was the heart of everything.\u201d \u201cMy wedding photo was on the front page, a thousand years ago.\u201d \u201cIt helped hold the community together.\u201d \u201cIt was a very important part of my life.\u201d The paper covered community events with gusto, scrutinised shire politics and painstakingly documented the local footy, netball and cricket triumphs. When it closed, \u201cpeople were very lost, to start with,\u201d says the 38-year-old Wagin ambulance officer Amanda Howell. \u201cI think people relied on it. Every Thursday they knew the Argus came out and that had all the info for the week.\u201d Veana Scott worked at the Argus as a journalist, editor and photographer for 26 years before retiring in 2009. \u201cI know that sounds rather strange,\u201d she says, \u201cbut then we\u2019re farmers in the district and I couldn\u2019t move the farm and I loved my writing and I loved my job and I started just a young journo and finished up as the editor, so I did have a fair bit of power.\u201d Scott, now in her early 70s, enjoyed doing in-depth interviews, and fears that kind of reporting may disappear from rural areas as papers shift online. \u201cIt\u2019ll be three or four paragraphs of this, that or the other, and you won\u2019t be able to have that in-depth [story] that I think a lot of country people love.\u201d Phil Blight, 62, has been the shire president for the past 12 years. Did he read the Argus? \u201cEvery week.\u201d According to Blight, the town has lost a faithful historian. \u201cI can remember the front page, for example, when Donald Campbell drove through town [in 1964] after having smashed the world speed record in Lake Dumbleyung just down the road,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s recorded now in the archives of the Argus, and that won\u2019t happen again. To me that\u2019s pretty sad.\u201d If the Argus was the historian of Wagin, Don and Coral Davies are the historians of the Argus. Don worked there from 1956 to 1999, starting as an apprentice linotype operator and taking over the business \u2013 the Argus and a commercial printing press \u2013 when his stepfather, the previous owner, died in 1972. Coral handled accounts, took photographs and \u201canything that needed doing\u201d. In 1993 Don reluctantly sold to Rural Press, which in 2007 merged with Fairfax, which has since been taken over by Nine. Now aged 78 and 71, Don and Coral felt so strongly about preserving the paper\u2019s legacy that they staged a low-level heist upon hearing the bound archives had been left behind in the old Argus building when it was sold in 2012. The new owner found the annals of history simply stacked out the back. \u201cHe asked someone at the local grocery store who he should contact, and they said us,\u201d Coral says. The Davies weren\u2019t sure if Rural Press would try to lay claim to the archives, but slipped in and rescued them regardless. \u201cI guess we felt like we didn\u2019t have any authority to be doing it,\u201d Coral says. \u201cWe just made sure they were safe.\u201d \u201cIt showed you how much they thought of the area,\u201d Don says. The Davies look back with great sadness about how things ended. \u201cOne of the reasons we sold out in the first place was because we couldn\u2019t have financed the changes to digital and we knew that Rural Press could,\u201d Don says. \u201cWe sold to preserve it,\u201d Coral adds, \u201cnot to have it close down.\u201d But even as they mourn the Argus, Wagin locals are clear-eyed about its decline. At its height in the 80s, there were eight people employed across the buzzing newsroom and noisy printing press. By 2014, the paper was staffed solely by Blayde Grzelka, a teenager fresh out of high school who was doing his best at his first media gig. He spent three days a week in Wagin, living in a room at the local pub, and filed to an editor an hour and a half away in Collie. The other two days he filed for the Fairfax paper in Mandurah. \u201cIt might have been a bit too much for me to handle at the time, but I made it work,\u201d Grzelka says. There were other problems. Advertising in the Argus had plummeted, and the lucrative Woolorama program was basically keeping the paper afloat. Blight recalls making the case for the Argus to a Fairfax executive, and being told to go and count the number of ads in a recent edition. There were five. \u201cI thought, \u2018wow, nothing could survive on that\u2019,\u201d he says. So when The Argus finally folded, locals were sad, but not surprised. The model was broken. Few understand this better than Grzelka, who says he wrote for nine different Fairfax papers in regional WA between 2014 and 2017. As of this month, two are still printing. Wagin was an interesting place to cut his teeth, Grzelka says, but he became dispirited after encountering pushback on his attempts to write about mental health. As his career progressed, he struggled to find meaning in his work, and eventually left journalism. \u201cAt the end, when I was reporting there, I don\u2019t think I did a whole lot of good,\u201d he says, of the Argus. \u201cIt was just a thing that has always existed there, and they needed it to still exist, and that\u2019s why I was there.\u201d How are stories in Wagin told now? Some nearby towns still have newspapers owned by Seven West Media. The Narrogin Observer does a good job of covering the area, according to Blight, but it\u2019s not the same. \u201cNot your own town, not your own identity,\u201d he says. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t quite cut the mustard.\u201d Each time a country paper shuts down there is a ripple effect, spreading out to the smaller towns in its orbit. The Wagin paper used to cover the tiny towns of Dumbleyung and Lake Grace, now the Narrogin paper covers Wagin. \u201cAnything to the east of us, there wouldn\u2019t be a journalist within cooee,\u201d says Coral Davies. Social media plays a role, with some groups and pages devoted to sharing Wagin events and chatter. Everyone agrees that this leaves out many older people in the area. \u201cWe\u2019re probably halfway between everyone being engaged with social media and no one being engaged with social media, so there\u2019s a vast tract of our community who wouldn\u2019t know what happened last week,\u201d Blight says. As Coral Davies puts it, the paper folded \u201ca generation too soon\u201d. After the Argus went, the local community resource centre started putting out a newsletter, the Wagin Wool Press. Jessica Hamersley, 70, is on the volunteer committee. The aim is to fill some gaps left by the Argus: sports news, rosters, other \u201cnitty-gritty\u201d details, and a fortnightly front-page story. Funding is cobbled together from the centre, advertising and sales. Elsewhere, community-run publications have popped up that fall closer to the newspaper end of the spectrum. In Merredin, halfway between Perth and Kalgoorlie, the community-run paper is called the Phoenix. It has no journalists, and while a council media manager criticised its quality in a 2019 survey by the Public Interest Journalism Initiative, long-time residents Martin Morris and Brad Anderson say it has plugged the gap, and feels more genuinely local than the Fairfax-owned paper it replaced. New independent newspapers the Horsham Times and Ararat Advocate have recently sprung up in regional Victoria to replace titles hit by the pandemic closures, as well as the Naracoorte Community News in South Australia. Hamersley, who used to write for the West Australian, would love to see the Wool Press morph from a newsletter to a full-blown community newspaper \u2013 but adds Wagin could use some help. \u201cThat would be mighty fine, if somebody would set up some sort of \u2018how to be a local journalist\u2019 learning that we could all tap into.\u201d In the meantime, as papers continue to fold, she is worried. \u201cI think lots of things were happening before the pandemic, and have been exacerbated by the pandemic, that illustrate country Australia is losing its voice.\u201d",

More than half of all cases are in the Western Cape province. The country imposed a strict, nationwide lockdown that included the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/south-africas-alcohol-ban-has-given-massive-boost-to-criminal-gangs\">banning of alcohol and cigarette sales</a>, but has since eased restrictions. </p> <p>Meanwhile in New York, where an estimated 30,000 people joined demonstrations following the death of George Floyd, governor Andrew Cuomo has urged protestors to get tested for coronavirus. \u201cI\u2019m not a nervous Nellie, I\u2019m just looking at the numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cMany wear masks.

Africa\u2019s biggest industrial power now has a total of 40,792 infections, the health ministry said. It saw a rise of 56 deaths, bring the total to 848. More than half of the cases are in the Western Cape region where health services are under pressure.</li> <li><strong>New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, urged protestors to get tested for coronavirus, </strong>saying several days and nights of demonstrations in the state after the killing of George Floyd could accelerate the spread. He noted that an estimated 30,000 people have protested in the state.</li> <li><strong>Turkey announces weekend lockdown in 15 cities. </strong>Turkey<strong> </strong>will impose a weekend lockdown in 15 cities as part of efforts to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, the interior ministry said.In a statement, the ministry said bakeries and certain shops could operate during the lockdown.Turkey has had 167,410 Covid-19 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University.</li> <li><strong>The UK unveiled a $2bn (\u00a31.5bn) fund aimed at ensuring poorer countries can access doses of a potential coronavirus vaccine. </strong>The announcement was made at the third Gavi vaccine alliance replenishment summit, a virtual pledging event that raised $8.8bn.<strong> <br></strong></li> <li><strong>The UK\u2019s transport secretary, has announced that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport in England from 15 June</strong>.

Our coverage continues here Again on the China travel warning regarding Australia, Australian opposition spokesman for housing Jason Clare, told the ABC there had been a \u201cspike in racist abuse\u201d but said Australia is one of the safest countries in the world. \u201cThe borders are shut. They\u2019ll probably be shut for some time until we\u2019ve got a treatment or a vaccine. But I\u2019m sure I speak on behalf of all of the tourist operators up and down and right across Australia when I say that we want to get tourists back when it\u2019s safe to do so. So I hope that the government is working with the Chinese government to ensure that when we can open the border again, we can get Chinese tourists back.9:36 AM Government MP Jason Falinski said the relationship with China was \u201cstrained\u201d and there had been unfortunate incidents in Australia, and it was something Australia and China needed to resolve. One Australian senator, Rex Patrick from one of the minor parties - Centre Alliance, has responded to the China news, calling for a parliamentary inquiry into Australia\u2019s relationship with China. California governor Gavin Newsom has said film and TV productions can resume from June 12 if local health officials approve. Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro threatened to pull the country out of the World Health Organization (WHO) unless it stops being a \u201cpartisan political organisation.\u201d In comments to journalists broadcast on CNN Brasil, Bolsonaro also said hydroxychloroquine \u201cis back\u201d after \u201csham\u201d studies regarding its efficacy were retracted. Bolsonaro has touted the drug as a treatment for the novel coronavirus despite a lack of scientific evidence about its effectiveness. The Lancet paper that halted global trials of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 because of fears of increased deaths was retracted on Thursday after a Guardian investigation found inconsistencies in the data. In New York, the Associated Press reports that arrests from a week of protests have started to put a strain on the city\u2019s justice system amid the Covid-19 pandemic. There have been well over 2,000 arrests as police seek to impose order across the city. Public defenders say too many of those arrested have been detained for too long in cramped and unsanitary conditions while authorities figure who should receive summonses for minor violations and go free, or be charged in criminal complaints and face arraignments remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic. The backlog prompted The Legal Aid Society to file a lawsuit demanding the New York police department release people held in violation of a requirement to get them in front of a judge within 24 hours, a situation that one defense lawyer said \u201cappears to be designed to retaliate against New Yorkers protesting police brutality.\u201d Patricia Miller, who heads the city\u2019s Special Federal Litigation Division, called the allegation \u201cdisingenuous\u201d and \u201cexceptionally unfair\u201d. The NYPD and court system are \u201cworking within the confines of a pandemic and now suddenly called upon not only to secure orderly protesting, but also to address rioters who are committing burglaries, destroying private property, and assaulting fellow New Yorkers,\u201d Miller said. A council in England has \u201cstrongly\u201d advised its schools to delay wider reopening until at least June 22 over concerns about the R rate in the North West. Tameside Council\u2019s director of public health Dr Jeanelle de Gruchy has written to all headteachers following new data which suggested the reproductive rate of coronavirus is now around one in the region. The letter said: \u201cMembers of SAGE (Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies) and the Association of Directors of Public Health advised caution and concern about the too rapid easing of lockdown and the increased risk of a second pandemic wave. \u201cBalancing this concern, the national R number being between 0.7 to 1.0 and estimated at 0.73 in the North West and the importance of having our children back at school, I supported the limited increase in the number of children attending planned in the Borough from Monday 8th June. \u201cHowever information released at 2pm today estimates the R value is now above the critical value of 1 for the North West, at 1.01. \u201cBecause of this change in R, and despite the excellent work undertaken, I am therefore strongly advising all schools and childcare settings to delay wider opening until at least 22 June for us to be more assured that the rate of infection is reducing and R is firmly below 1.\u201d The council said the situation would be monitored and reviewed on a weekly basis. China\u2019s Ministry of Culture and Tourism has advised the public to avoid traveling to Australia, citing racial discrimination and violence against the Chinese in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cThere has been an alarming increase recently in acts of racial discrimination and violence against Chinese and Asians in Australia, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d the ministry said in a statement reported by Reuters. It did not give any specific examples of such discrimination or violence. People of Asian origin have said they have been harassed since the outbreak of the coronavirus including in the United States. China issued a warning to tourists traveling there earlier this year after some said they were mistreated in connection with the outbreak. The front page of Friday\u2019s UK edition of The Guardian. Public trust in science may have been shaken by the publication of academic papers based on false data in leading medical journals, according to renowned infectious disease doctors and former World Health Organization advisers. The director of Australia\u2019s Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, Professor Sharon Lewin, said she and colleagues were \u201cgobsmacked\u201d by the saga and said it should be \u201ca wake-up call\u201d in a global rush to publish studies about Covid-19. At a primary school in the Canadian province of Quebec, nine children have tested positive for Covid-19 out of a class of 11, health officials said. The class was small because the school has been operating at half capacity. Health officials confirm the school in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res had taken preventative measures, such as handwashing reminders and marking spaces on the floor to encourage social distancing. Primary schools opened across Quebec outside the city of Montreal on 11 May, despite the province being Canada\u2019s biggest coronavirus hotspot, with 52,398 total cases and 4,935 deaths currently recorded. Ontario, the site of Canada\u2019s second largest hotspot, has closed schools for the remainder of the school year. An IMF team has agreed a one-year, $5.2 billion financing package for Egypt to help the country alleviate the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. The IMF board must still approve the financing from the fund\u2019s Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI), which allows nations to circumvent the lengthy negotiations usually needed to secure a full economic assistance program. The new funding comes on top of $2.8 billion the IMF board approved a month ago, although at the time officials acknowledged that more help would be needed. Cairo requested the aid, known as a Standby Arrangement, to support its efforts \u201cto maintain macroeconomic stability amid the Covid-19 shock while continuing to advance key structural reforms,\u201d IMF mission chief Uma Ramakrishnan said in a statement. \u201cThis will safeguard the gains achieved by Egypt over the past three years and put the country on strong footing for sustained recovery as well as higher and more inclusive growth and job creation over the medium term,\u201d she said. It also will open the doors to financing from other lenders and help support job creation by the private sector. The IMF team held virtual negotiations with Egyptian officials on the terms of the package, which the fund\u2019s board is expected to approve in \u201ccoming weeks,\u201d she said. Egypt has suffered over 1,100 Covid-19 fatalities with over 31,000 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University\u2019s tally. Wall Street surged on Friday after a strikingly upbeat May jobs report unexpectedly provided the clearest evidence yet that the US economy is headed for a quicker-than-anticipated recovery. The Dow Jones rose 829.16 points, or 3.15%, to 27,110.98, the S&amp;P gained 81.58 points, or 2.62%, to 3,193.93 and the Nasdaq added 198.27 points, or 2.06%, to 9,814.08. Joe Biden has argued that President Trump deserved no credit for the US jobs report which showed unemployment had dropped slightly to 13.3% from 14.7% a month earlier. The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee said Trump had still failed to acknowledge how his response to the coronavirus pandemic had hampered the country\u2019s economy. \u201cHe has no idea the depth of the pain that so many people are still enduring. He remains completely oblivious to the human toll of his indifference,\u201d the former vice president said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for him to step out of his own bunker, take a look around the consequences of his words and his actions.\u201d Biden added: \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: a president who takes no responsibility for costing millions and millions of American their jobs deserves no credit when a fraction of them return.\u201d More than a third of Americans misused cleaners and disinfectants to try to prevent infection by the coronavirus, according to a survey taken shortly after Donald Trump publicly asked whether injecting such products could treat Covid-19, reports Reuters. Washing food with bleach, using household cleaning or disinfectant products on bare skin, and intentionally inhaling or ingesting the products were some of the most commonly reported \u201chigh-risk\u201d practices in a 4 May online survey of 502 US adults, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported. The survey\u2019s lead author said it was undertaken following a \u201csharp increase\u201d in calls to poison control centres. In late April, Trump asked scientists during one of his coronavirus task force briefings whether inserting disinfectant into the bodies of people infected with the virus might help clear the disease, horrifying health experts. Makers of household cleaners were compelled to urge people not to drink or inject their products. Some 39% of people surveyed reported intentionally engaging in at least one high-risk practice, including using bleach to clean food or misting the body with a disinfectant spray. Four per cent drank or gargled with diluted bleach solutions, soapy water or disinfectants. The World Health Organization has updated its stance on masks to curb the spread of Covid-19. People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot physically distance, according to new guidance from the WHO, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask. The UK became the second country to officially record more than 40,000 coronavirus-related deaths, as officials said another 357 people who had tested positive for the virus had died. So far, 40,261 virus deaths have been recorded, giving the UK the world\u2019s second-highest death toll behind the United States. Hydroxychloroquine does not work against Covid-19 and should not be given to any more hospital patients around the world, say the leaders of the biggest and best-designed trial of the drug. \u201cIf you are admitted to hospital, don\u2019t take hydroxychloroquine. It doesn\u2019t work,\u201d said Martin Landray, deputy chief investigator of the Recovery trial and professor of medicine and epidemiology at Oxford University. There were 85 new coronavirus fatalities in Italy on Friday, down from 88 on Wednesday, while new infections leapt by 518, up from 177 within the last 24 hours. The majority of the new infections \u2013 402 \u2013 were in the worst affected Lombardy region. A judge in Australia banned a Black Lives Matter protest planned to take place in Sydney on Saturday, citing the coronavirus crisis, after a legal application from police. New South Wales state Supreme Court Justice Des Fagan ruled the rally was not an authorised public assembly. The environmental and economic impact of coronavirus in Europe can now be seen using satellite data provided by the European Space Agency. The ESA and the European Commission launched an internet-based programme that compares pollution levels during the health crisis with a baseline scenario, measures chlorophyll concentrations or illustrates economic parameters such as harvests. The Rapid Action Coronavirus Earth observation (RACE) dashboard uses the Copernicus Sentinel satellite network, partner company data and artificial intelligence to make an interactive map of Europe that compares current industrial and transport activity with that of previous years. The platform will \u201cmeasure the impact of the coronavirus lockdown and monitor post-lockdown recovery,\u201d it said. RACE tracks \u201ckey environmental parameters - such as air and water quality changes, economic and human activities including industry, shipping, construction, traffic, as well as agricultural productivity\u201d in 22 ESA member countries. Air pollution is monitored worldwide, as is the asparagus harvest near Berlin, air traffic in Barcelona, Mediterranean water quality or concentrations of chlorophyll in a chosen region. Satellite images are accompanied by various tables of information and commentary by specialists. Some indicators go back to 2014, and are to be updated through the end of this year, according to Yves-Louis Desnos, head of the ESA\u2019s Earth Observation Science and Applications Department. Saudi Arabia has announced a renewed lockdown in the city of Jeddah starting from Saturday to counter a new spike in coronavirus cases. \u201cAfter reviewing the epidemiological situation and the high occupancy rates of intensive care departments, it was decided to take strict health precautions in the city of Jeddah for two weeks\u201d, the health ministry said. The measures include a curfew running from 3 pm to 6 am, a suspension of prayers in mosques and a stay-at-home order for public and private sector workers in the Red Sea city whose airport serves Mecca pilgrims. After an easing of precautions in the kingdom in late May, the ministry said that strict measures could also soon return to Riyadh, which was \u201cwitnessing a continuous increase during the last days\u201d of critical cases of the pandemic. Saudi Arabia has declared almost 96,000 coronavirus infections and 642 deaths from the Covid-19 respiratory disease, the heaviest toll in the Gulf. It has suspended the year-round Umrah pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina over fears of the coronavirus pandemic spreading to Islam\u2019s holiest cities. Authorities are yet to announce whether they will proceed with this year\u2019s hajj, scheduled for the end of July, but have urged Muslims to temporarily defer preparations for the annual pilgrimage. Estonia has developed an app that could serve as a digital \u201cimmunity passport\u201d, allowing users with antibodies to show employers and others their reduced risk of spreading coronavirus. The Immuunsuspass (ImmunityPassport) app being tested out this month was developed by tech firms Transferwise and Guardtime in cooperation with health specialists for the Back to Work non-governmental organisation. \u201cThe app we\u2019ve created can provide necessary data to schools and employers to help them make decisions,\u201d TransferWise cofounder Taavet Hinrikus told AFP. \u201cHowever, before it\u2019s adopted for widespread use, we need to achieve a scientific consensus on COVID-19 immunity.\u201d The app allows users to access their COVID-19 test results for an hour after proving their identity. They can also share the results with others using a QR-code that expires after a minute. The developers say this ensures that the immunity results are up-to-date and protected against unauthorised sharing. In the future, users will also be able to access their vaccination data. The World Health Organization issued a warning in late April that there was \u201cnot enough evidence\u201d to give people \u201crisk-free certificates,\u201d but hours later appeared to backpedal with a modified statement. In the follow-up, WHO said it expected that people who are infected with COVID-19 \u201cwill develop an antibody response that will provide some level of protection\u201d but added that \u201cwhat we don\u2019t yet know is the level of protection or how long it will last\u201d. Estonia, known as E-stonia, has made a name for itself as a trailblazer in technology over the years. It pioneered e-voting in 2005 and hosts NATO\u2019s elite cyber defence centre. On Sunday, the European Union will launch a humanitarian air bridge to support the fight against coronavirus in the Democratic Republic of Congo, officials said. France\u2019s foreign minister, Jean-Yves le Drian, his Belgian counterpart Philippe Goffin and European commissioner for crisis management Janez Lenarcic will travel to Kinshasa on the flight from Brussels. On Monday, they will meet president Felix Tshisekedi in the capital before travelling to the eastern city of Goma, in the troubled region on the border with Rwanda. More flights will carry at least 40 tonnes of aid such as water purifiers, and medical supplies. provided by the EU, governments and humanitarian agencies. So far, Africa has been spared the worst of the pandemic, with 4,755 deaths recorded and 170,286 cases compared to more than 180,000 deaths and two million cases in Europe. But poorer countries like the DRC would struggle to cope if the outbreak intensifies and Brussels has set aside 3.25 billion euros ($3.67 billion) in grants and 1.4 billion euros in loans to help countries through the crisis. The Chinese city of Wuhan has announced it had cleared all hospital cases of coronavirus where patients have shown symptoms. State newspaper Global Times said that \u201cthe last three Covid-19 patients in Wuhan have recovered and been discharged from hospital\u201d. However, China omits from its data any cases where patients have tested positive for Covid-19 but have not exhibited symptoms. It began recording these separately from 1 April. AstraZeneca\u2019s cancer drug Calquence has shown initial signs of helping hospitalised Covid-19 patients get through the worst of the disease, according to tests. Results from the preliminary research involving 19 patients, which was backed by the United States National Institutes of Health, encouraged the British drugmaker to explore the drug\u2019s new use in a wider clinical trial announced in April. Eleven patients had been on oxygen when they started the 10-14 day Calquence course and eight of them could afterwards be discharged, breathing independently, according to results in a paper co-authored by Astra\u2019s head of oncology research, Jose Baselga. Eight patients were on mechanical ventilation when they were put on Calquence, and four of them could be discharged, though one died of pulmonary embolism. \u201cThese patients were in a very unstable situation, they would have had a dire prognosis ... Within one to three days the majority of these patients got better in terms of ventilation and oxygen needs,\u201d Astra\u2019s Baselga told Reuters. Severe cases of Covid-19 are believed to be triggered by an over-reaction of the immune system known as cytokine storm and initial research has brought Calquence, and other drugs that suppress certain elements of the immune system, into play. Police in Kenya have been involved in the killing of 15 people since the country put a nighttime curfew in place in March to combat coronavirus, the policing oversight body said in a statement seen by AFP. The Independent Policing Oversight Body (IPOA) said it had received 87 complaints against police since the dusk to dawn curfew and heightened security measures were put in place on March 27. \u201cAfter preliminary investigations, 15 deaths and 31 incidents where victims sustained injuries have directly been linked to actions of police officers during the curfew enforcement.\u201d According to the statement, the complaints include deaths, shootings, harassment, assaults, robbery, inhumane treatment and sexual assault. Kenya\u2019s police force is often accused by rights groups of using excessive force and carrying out unlawful killings, especially in poor neighbourhoods. In April Human Right Watch accused the police of imposing the curfew in a \u201cchaotic and violent manner from the start\u201d, sometimes whipping, kicking and teargassing people to force them off the streets. \u201cPolice brutality isn\u2019t just unlawful; it is also counterproductive in fighting the spread of the virus,\u201d the rights watchdog said. Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: The World Health Organization has updated its stance on masks to curb the spread of Covid-19. People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot physically distance, according to new guidance from the WHO, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask. The UK became the second country to officially record more than 40,000 coronavirus-related deaths, as officials said another 357 people who had tested positive for the virus had died. So far, 40,261 virus deaths have been recorded, giving the UK the world\u2019s second-highest death toll behind the United States. Sweden reported another large rise in new cases of coronavirus on Friday, with the 1,056 positive tests reported by the public health agency marking the third day the country\u2019s caseload had increased by more than a thousand. Sweden has now recorded 42,939 cases of coronavirus, and 4,639 deaths. All hospital visitors and outpatients in England will need to wear face coverings from 15 June, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said. All hospital staff will also be required to wear surgical masks. He also made a plea for people to be mindful of attending protests over the death of George Floyd. A study linked vitamin K deficiency with Covid-19, after researchers found that patients who had died or been admitted to intensive care with Covid-19 have been found to be deficient in the vitamin, which is found in spinach, eggs and hard and blue cheeses. Covid-19\u2019s impact on the US economy waned in May as the unemployment rate dipped to 13.3% and the US added another 2.5m jobs. The surprise news follows the loss of 20m jobs in April when unemployment hit 14.7%. Economists were expecting a rise to as high as 20%. US billionaires gained half a trillion dollars in wealth during outbreak. Even as more than 42 million people have signed on as unemployed in the US, the country\u2019s billionaires have added half a trillion dollars to their combined wealth, according to a think tank report. During the 11 weeks from 18 March, when US lockdowns started, the wealth of America\u2019s richest people surged by over $565bn. Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, saw his wealth increase by $36.2bn. Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg was the second biggest beneficiary, increasing his net worth by $30.1bn. A judge in Australia banned a Black Lives Matter protest planned to take place in Sydney on Saturday, citing the coronavirus crisis, after a legal application from police. New South Wales state Supreme Court Justice Des Fagan ruled the rally was not an authorised public assembly. Police in Paris cited ongoing health risks related to the coronavirus pandemic as they banned a demonstration against police brutality planned to take place outside the city\u2019s US embassy on Saturday. Trouble broke out at another anti-police demonstration in the French capital on Wednesday. On Monday, more than half of Spain will enter the fourth and final phase of the country\u2019s lockdown de-escalation, the government announced. However, the 52% of Spaniards in the last stage will not include those in the Madrid region or the Barcelona metropolitan area \u2013 the two parts of the country hit hardest by Covid-19. That\u2019s it from me, Damien Gayle, for another day. I\u2019ll be back with you on Monday. Hydroxychloroquine does not work against Covid-19 and should not be given to any more hospital patients around the world, say the leaders of the biggest and best-designed trial of the drug, which experts will hope finally settle the question, writes Sarah Boseley, the Guardian\u2019s health editor. \u201cIf you are admitted to hospital, don\u2019t take hydroxychloroquine,\u201d said Martin Landray, the deputy chief investigator of the Recovery trial and professor of medicine and epidemiology at Oxford University. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Many countries have permitted emergency use of the drug for Covid-19 patients in hospitals, following claims from a few doctors, including Didier Raoult in France, that it was a cure and the ensuing clamour from the public. President Donald Trump backed the drug, saying it should be given to patients and later said he was personally taking it to protect himself from the virus. Landray said the hype should now stop. \u201cIt is being touted as a game-changer, a wonderful drug, a breakthrough. This is an incredibly important result because worldwide we can stop using a drug that is useless.\u201d The first results from the Recovery trial, which has been testing seven therapies for Covid-19, swiftly followed the retraction of a paper in the Lancet medical journal on Thursday night that claimed hydroxychloroquine was linked to an increased risk of death in Covid-19 patients. The authors of the paper withdrew it after the US company Surgisphere refused to cooperate with an independent audit of the data it had supplied for the study. A Guardian investigation had showed serious errors in the data and raised questions about Surgisphere and its CEO. The World Health Organization\u2019s eastern Mediterreanean office has tweeted a breakdown of coronavirus statistics from member states. The politicisation of the coronavirus crisis and the Brazilian government\u2019s deliberate \u201ctorpedoing\u201d of social distancing efforts has condemned South America\u2019s largest country to a historic tragedy that will most punish the poor, Brazil\u2019s most respected medical voice has said, writes Tom Phillips, the Guardian\u2019s Latin America correspondent, in Rio de Janeiro. As Brazil\u2019s death toll surpassed that of Italy, Drauzio Varella told the Guardian that historians would be unkind to president Jair Bolsonaro, who is facing international condemnation for his handling of the pandemic. \u201cI think history will ascribe to him a level of guilt that I really wouldn\u2019t want for myself,\u201d said Varella, an oncologist, author and broadcaster who is a household name thanks to decades of public health activism. Only two countries, the US and the UK, have lost more lives, and Brazil seems poised to overtake the latter. Brazil has confirmed 615,000 cases, second only to the US. \u201cBecause in Brazil we are already the third country in the world in terms of deaths, we will soon become the second, and we are going to come close to the level of mortality in the US, which has 330 million citizens \u2013 that\u2019s 60% larger than Brazil\u2019s population,\u201d predicted Varella. \u201cThe situation couldn\u2019t be worse. It just couldn\u2019t.\u201d The coronavirus crisis \u201cis not over\u201d and will not be \u201cuntil there is no virus anywhere in the world,\u201d the World Health Organization said on Friday, as it warned of \u201cupticks\u201d in some countries. The epicentre of the pandemic is currently in countries of central, south and north America, particularly the United States, WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris was quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency. \u201cOn upticks (in cases), yes we have seen in countries around the world - I\u2019m not talking specifically about Europe - when the lockdowns ease, when the social distancing measures ease, people sometimes interpret this as \u2018OK, it\u2019s over\u2019,\u201d Harris told a UN briefing in Geneva. \u201cIt\u2019s not over. It\u2019s not over until there is no virus anywhere in the world,\u201d she said. Referring to demonstrations since the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis 10 days ago, Harris said that protesters must take precautions. \u201cWe have certainly seen a lot of passion this week, we\u2019ve seen people who have felt the need to be out and to express their feelings,\u201d she added. \u201cWe ask them to remember still protect yourself and others.\u201d There were 85 new coronavirus fatalities in Italy on Friday, down from 88 on Wednesday, while new infections leapt by 518, up from 177 within the last 24 hours, writes Angela Giuffrida, the Guardian\u2019s Rome correspondent. The majority of the new infections \u2013 402 \u2013 were in the worst affected Lombardy region, according to the figures from the civil protection authority. Over 19,000 tests were carried out in Lombardy in a day, compared to 3,410 on Thursday. Since 18 May, people have been able to go to bars, restaurants and shops and since Wednesday they have been free to travel beyond their regions. The infection rate across Italy\u2019s 19 other regions has so far been steadily declining, with several registering zero daily cases. The number of people currently infected with the virus decreased by 1,453 to 36,976 on Friday. Italy has so far registered 234,531 coronavirus cases, including 33,774 deaths 163,781 recoveries. A major trial of hydroxychloroquine has found it has \u201cno benefit\u201d for patients hospitalised with the coronavirus, researchers said Friday, announcing they had stopped tests of the drug. The chief investigators in the Recovery trial, which is run by the University of Oxford and is testing a number of potential treatments for the new coronavirus, said in a statement: We have concluded that there is no beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalised with Covid-19. We have therefore decided to stop enrolling participants to the hydroxychloroquine arm of the Recovery trial with immediate effect. We are now releasing the preliminary results as they have important implications for patient care and public health. Hydroxychloroquine, an old malaria and rheumatoid arthritis drug, has been touted by many, including the US president, Donald Trump, as a potential treatment or prophylactic for coronavirus infection. The announcement comes in the same week that the World Health Organization (WHO) restarted its trials of hydroxychloroquine after they were temporarily halted because of a now-retracted study in The Lancet medical journal. The UK became the second country to officially record more than 40,000 coronavirus-related deaths on Friday, as health officials said another 357 people who had tested positive for the virus have died. So far, 40,261 deaths due to the virus have been recorded, giving the UK the world\u2019s second-highest pandemic death toll behind the United States. The actual Covid-19 death toll is widely considered to be higher as the total only includes those who have tested positive for the virus. According to the department of health, 1,650 more people were recorded as testing positive for the coronavirus, pushing the country\u2019s total caseload up to 283,311. On Friday, leading medics and scientists called on the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to order a public inquiry to prepare Britain for a second wave of the coronavirus this winter, warning that many more will die unless the country improves its response. Universities and colleges will reopen in Zambia next week, more than two months after they were closed as part of measures to contain the spread of coronavirus. On Friday the minister for higher education, Brian Mushimba, said classes would resume from 8 June, with graduating students who are writing final examinations the first to go back. Other students would have to continue with online learning for the time being, Mushimba was quoted as saying by China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency. Covid-19 preventative measures would still be mandatory, including instructions to students to bring their own face masks, hand sanitisers and soap with them to campus. Police in Paris cited ongoing health risks related to the coronavirus pandemic as they banned a demonstration against police brutality planned to take place outside the city\u2019s US embassy on Saturday, Reuters reports. Trouble broke out at another anti-police demonstration in the French capital on Wednesday. Thousands had turned up despite a police ban on the event in memory of Adama Traore, a 24-year old black Frenchman who died in a 2016 police operation which some have likened to Floyd\u2019s death. On Monday, more than half of Spain will enter the fourth and final phase of the country\u2019s lockdown de-escalation, the government announced on Friday, writes Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent. However, the 52% of Spaniards in the last stage will not include those in the Madrid region or the Barcelona metropolitan area - the two parts of the country hit hardest by Covid-19. Along with many other regions, they will instead proceed to the penultimate phase, in which groups of up to 15 people can meet. People living in areas in the final phase, such as Andaluc\u00eda, the Balearic islands and the Canary islands, can once again eat inside restaurants as long as social distancing is practised, while shops, cinemas and theatres can open at 50% capacity. Spain\u2019s health minister, Salvador Illa, appealed for people to continue to behave responsibly so that the progress made during the lockdown was not squandered, adding: \u201cThe virus is still around.\u201d On Wednesday, the Spanish congress approved a sixth and final extension of the state of emergency, which is now set to end on June 22. Spain is due to reopen to foreign tourists from 1 July. People over 60 or with health issues should wear a medical-grade mask when they are out and cannot socially distance, according to new guidance from the World Health Organization, while all others should wear a three-layer fabric mask, writes Sarah Boseley, the Guardian\u2019s health editor. The UK may have to rethink its advice following the significant change of stance by the WHO, which until now has been reluctant to advocate the wearing of masks by the public because of limited evidence that they offer protection. On Thursday, UK ministers announced it would be mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport from 15 June, but these coverings can be simply T-shirts or scarves. The new WHO guidance, announced on Friday, is a result of research commissioned by the organisation. It is still unknown whether the wearers of masks are protected, say its experts, but the new design it advocates does give protection to other people if properly used. The fashion question de nos jours would have been unimaginable four months ago,. Namely: how do I quickly find a face mask that does not scare my children or make me look like Bane in the Dark Knight Rises? Clearly the use of face masks is primarily a public health issue, and not a style one writes Hannah Marriott, the Guardian\u2019s fashion editor. But it would be better if your face mask \u2013 your de facto first impression for the next who-knows-how-long \u2013 did not make you feel any weirder than you already do. In the US, Donald Trump is giving a press conference to celebrate the unexpectedly good unemployment news there. You can follow that live on our US live blog here: Figures released today showed Covid-19\u2019s devastating assault on the US economy waned in May as the unemployment rate dipped to 13.3% and the US added another 2.5m jobs. The latest tally follows the loss of 20m jobs in April when unemployment hit 14.7%. In February the unemployment rate was just 3.5%. Some had predicted an increase in unemployment to about 20% today. Ireland is accelerating the relaxation of lockdown restrictions by expanding the travel limit and reopening shops, playgrounds, libraries and other facilities from Monday. The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, struck an upbeat tone in Ireland\u2019s fight against Covid-19 by quoting Samwise Gamgee, a hobbit in Lord of the Rings. \u201cBut in the end, it\u2019s only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.\u201d The announcement on Friday came amid a sharp fall in new cases - fewer than a hundred each day for the past 12 days \u2013 and evidence the reproduction number remains well below 1. Some business leaders, politicians and commentators had voiced concern that the lockdown exit strategy was too slow and conservative. Varadkar said the roadmap will be speeded up and shortened from five to four phases. \u201cSummer is not lost and this can be a summer of hope if we keep the virus at bay.\u201d From Monday, the start of the second phase, all retail stores can reopen, but with staggered opening times. The 5km travel limit will expand to let people travel within their county or up to 20km from home, whichever is greater. Groups of up to 6 people will be able to interact indoors or outdoors as long as they keep at least 2m apart. Groups of up to 15 can meet for outdoor sporting activities. Those aged over 70 or medically vulnerable can receive a small number of visitors at home. Public libraries, playgrounds, outdoor camps for children, marts and greyhound racing can also resume. Up to 25 people will be allowed to attend funerals. Hairdressers, beauticians and barbers must wait until 20 July to reopen. In earlier, more sombre pandemic-related speeches Varadkar quoted Seamus Heaney. On Friday he quoted Cicero before channeling JRR Tolkien. Patients who have died or been admitted to intensive care with Covid-19 have been found to be deficient in a vitamin found in spinach, eggs and hard and blue cheeses, raising hopes that dietary change might be one part of the answer to combating the disease, writes Daniel Boffey in Brussels. Researchers studying patients who were admitted to the Canisius Wilhelmina hospital in the Dutch city of Nijmegen have extolled the benefits of vitamin K after discovering a link between deficiency and the worst coronavirus outcomes. Covid-19 causes blood clotting and leads to the degradation of elastic fibres in the lungs. Vitamin K, which is ingested through food and absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, is key to the production of proteins that regulate clotting and can protect against lung disease. The Dutch researchers are now seeking funding for a clinical trial, but Dr Rob Janssen, a scientist working on the project, said that in light of the initial findings he would encourage a healthy intake of vitamin K, except to those on blood-clotting medications such as warfarin. He said: \u201cWe are in a terrible, horrible situation in the world. We do have an intervention which does not have any side effects, even less than a placebo. There is one major exception: people on anti-clotting medication. It is completely safe in other people.\u201d The EU has pledged to lift border controls inside its territory by the end of the month while extending a ban on travellers coming from outside the bloc until 1 July. The extension of the ban on non-essential travel by foreign nationals into the EU\u2019s border free-travel zone was approved by the EU\u2019s 27 home affairs ministers on Friday by video conference. The travel ban, which had been due to expire on 15 June, applies to all non-EU countries, with exemptions for citizens from EU-associated countries \u2013 Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. British travellers also remain exempt from the ban but face two-week quarantine requirements from some European governments. The EU\u2019s home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, told journalists that \u201calmost all member states\u201d had expressed \u201ca strong preference for a further but short prolongation\u201d of the travel ban. Countries had agreed a \u201cgradual and strictly coordinated lifting\u201d of the restriction from July, she said. The commander of US forces in Japan has accused China of using the coronavirus crisis as a cover for a surge in naval activity to push territorial claims in the South China Sea. In a telephone interview with the Reuters news agency, Lieutenant General Kevin Schneider said there had been a surged of activity by China, with navy ships, coast guard vessels and a naval militia of fishing boats in harassing vessels in waters claimed by Beijing. \u201cThrough the course of the Covid crisis we saw a surge of maritime activity,\u201d he told Reuters in a phone interview. He said Beijing had also increased its activity in the East China Sea, where it has a territorial dispute with Japan. Beijing\u2019s increased level of activity would likely continue, predicted Schneider: \u201cI don\u2019t see troughs, I see plateaus,\u201d he said. China says its maritime activities in the area are peaceful. The press office at the Chinese embassy in Tokyo was not immediately available to comment outside of normal business hours, Reuters said. Japan hosts the biggest concentration of US forces in Asia, including an aircraft carrier strike group, an amphibious expeditionary force and fighter squadrons. In addition to defending Japan, they are deployed to deter China from expanding its influence in the region, including in the South China Sea. Peru is beginning the second phase of its economic reopening on Friday, even as its ongoing coronavirus outbreak showed little signs of slowing, with 4,284 new confirmed cases reported on Thursday. The president, Martin Vizcarra, announced the second phase of lockdown easing on Thursday, after his council of ministers approved a presidential decree calling for the restart of economic activity. Peru is the second-worst affected country in Latin America, the region which the World Health Organisation has said is now at the centre of the global coronavirus pandemic. In spite of an early and strictly enforced lockdown it has so far reported a total of 183,198 coronavirus infections and 5,031 deaths from Covid-19 - 137 of which were reported on Thursday. The economic shutdown has caused widespread hardship in Peru, where much of the population survives from working in the informal economy. Vizcarra\u2019s plan is for 80% of the country\u2019s economy to resume operation from Friday. During lockdown, the economy has been operating at 50% capacity, which Vizcarra said was \u201cnot enough to sustain 100%\u201d of the country\u2019s needs. \u201cWe want to raise it to 100% and then even see growth on top of that,\u201d Chinese news agency Xinhua quoted Vizcarra as saying. Among the sectors scheduled to return to work from Friday were small and medium-size mining enterprises, feed-making for animals, alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, footwear production, printing, and medical tools manufacturing and repair, services including legal and accounting firms, architecture and engineering companies, as well as some retail. Sweden reported another large rise in new cases of coronavirus on Friday, with the 1,056 positive tests reported by the public health agency marking the third day the country\u2019s caseload had increased by more than a thousand. While a bumper report of 2,214 cases on Wednesday was partly explained by a lab releasing a backlog of results, on Thursday, after another 1,084 cases were reported, the public health agency said the rise in cases could not wholly be explained by increased testing. The agency\u2019s chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, told a news conference on Thursday that the increases in new cases was seen primarily in Western Sweden and among younger people. Sweden has now recorded 42,939 cases of coronavirus, and 4,639 deaths after another 77 deaths were reported on Friday - not all of which will have occurred within the past 24 hours due to reporting delays from local areas. The death rate remains well below a peak reached towards the end of April. The Swedish approach to tackling the coronavirus has been described as \u201clight touch\u201d, with shops, gyms and restaurants allowed to stay open, and the public simply asked to avoid non-essential travel or venturing out if unwell. Lockdown sceptics who thought that the kinds of lockdown measures seen elsewhere in Europe had gone to far have hailed the strategy. But criticism has been mounting after the per capita death rate in the country far exceeded its close neighbours. Earlier this week, Sweden\u2019s coronavirus death rate surpassed that of France. However, it remains well below the UK, Italy, Spain and Belgium - all countries which have enforced curbs on freedoms in attempts to contain the spread of the disease. Covid-19\u2019s devastating assault on the US economy waned in May as the unemployment rate dipped to 13.3% and the US added another 2.5m jobs, writes Dominic Rushe, for the Guardian US, in New York. The surprise news follows the loss of 20m jobs in April when unemployment hit 14.7%. Economists had been expecting a rise to as high as 20%. But the rate is still historically high. In February the unemployment rate was just 3.5%. A decade\u2019s worth of gains made in the labor market since the last recession have been erased in just three months. All 50 states have now begun easing quarantine restrictions and the pace of this unprecedented hollowing has now slowed as some have returned to work but uncertainties remain. Weekly unemployment claims have plummeted from a frightening peak of 6.6m in April to 1.9m last week but Jason Reed, a professor of finance at the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Mendoza College of Business, said the numbers were still huge. He worried America is now witnessing a shift from temporary to permanent layoffs. While the unemployment rate remains well above the 10% peak in the last recession, president Donald Trump was quick to hail victory. \u201cGreat going President Trump (kidding but true)!\u201d he wrote on Twitter. Mosques, churches and other places of worship reopened in Jakarta for the first time in nearly three months on Friday, as the Indonesian capital loosened a partial lockdown, AFP reports. Jakarta\u2019s governor announced the easing of restrictions on Thursday, with offices, restaurants, shopping malls and tourist attractions also scheduled to reopen in the coming weeks. While mosques have remained open in some other parts of Indonesia, the world\u2019s biggest Muslim majority country, for many residents of Jakarta, a megacity that is home to about 30 million people, it was their first time attending Friday prayers since mid-March. Mohamad Fathi, 35, said he was \u201cfull of happiness\u201d at the news. \u201cIt cheered me up and satisfied my longing for mass prayers,\u201d he told AFP. \u201cI\u2019m very happy we\u2019re now allowed to return to pray.\u201d However, the weekly service was shorter than usual as part of efforts to lower the risk of COVID-19 infections, he said. Mosque-goers were also ordered to bring their own prayer mats and abide by social-distancing rules with temperature checks at the door. On Friday, Indonesia reported 703 new cases of coronavirus and 49 coronavirus-related deaths. There have now been a total of 29,521 infections in the country of 274 million people, and 1,770 deaths. US clothing retailer Gap has reported a quarterly loss of almost $1bn, after it had to close the vast majority of its stores worldwide during the coronavirus shutdown, writes Joanna Partridge, for the Guardian\u2019s business desk. The company, based in San Francisco, made a loss of $932m (\u00a3738m) for the three months to 2 May, compared with $227m profit during the same period in 2019. The retailer, know for its denim, chinos and T-shirts, included in its quarterly loss a $484m write-down on its stores and operating lease assets, and a $235m charge on excess stock. Like many of its competitors, Gap has been left with mountains of seasonal clothing that it has not been able to sell while 90% of its global stores were temporarily forced to close during lockdown. Retailers of non-essential goods, such as clothing, have been significantly affected by store closures across many territories, which were designed to slow the spread of Covid-19. The pandemic triggered several high-profile retail insolvencies in the US, including fashion chain JCrew, and department store chains JC Penney and Neiman Marcus. The group, which also owns the Old Navy and Banana Republic brands, said that customers were focused on buying casual clothes while staying at home, hitting sales at Banana Republic, which offers more workwear. For the first time in 75 years, there will be no D-day veterans on the beaches of Normandy to mark the anniversary of the Allied landings on Saturday, writes Kim Willsher, the Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent. Official commemorations have been cancelled except for a limited gathering of representatives from nine countries \u2013 including the British ambassador to France \u2013 for a short ceremony. A year after the fanfare of the 75th anniversary of the 1944 landings that marked the beginning of the end of Nazi Germany, many of this year\u2019s events will be relayed by livestream to the dwindling number of elderly former soldiers who took part in Operation Overlord. A website will transmit events commemorating the day when 150,000 troops swarmed ashore at strategic points along 50 miles of France\u2019s west coastline. That day in 1944 they were met with a hail of machine gun fire and bombardments, leaving 10,000 casualties, among them 2,500 dead. Saturday\u2019s commemorations will include a flypast by the French air force\u2019s air acrobatic team, the Patrouille de France. \u201cSince 1945, every year we have paid homage to the men who fought for our freedom,\u201d said Jean-Marc Lefranc, president of the Comit\u00e9 du D\u00e9barquement (D-day Landing Committee). \u201cThis year, for the first time it will not be open to the public.\u201d More than 3,000 shops and markets across Pakistan were closed down on Friday in a series of raids for violating social distancing regulations, the Associated Press reports, as the country drew close to 90,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus. On Friday, health authorities reported 68 more coronavirus-related deaths, raising its overall death toll to 1,838. Meanwhile 4,896 more people tested positive in the past 24 hours, the highest single-day rise in infections, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 89,249. The pace of the virus\u2019s spread has increased since the prime minister, Imran Khan, eased lockdown measures in May. Doctors are now bracing for a surge of Covid-19 patients and some hospitals are already turning back those with mild infection, asking them to quarantine themselves at home. Critics say Khan eased restrictions prematurely, but the government has blamed the public for the spread in infections, saying people failed to adhere to social distancing guidelines. Despite his wealth having increased by $14bn in the past 11 weeks (see previous post), the billionaire Elon Musk is still cranky enough for a Twitter spat with a rival billionaire. On Thursday, Musk tweeted Jeff Bezos to call for the break up of Bezos\u2019s online retail empire, Amazon, in the latest row over censorship related to the coronavirus outbreak. The Tesla chief executive lashed out after an author complained on social media about being unable to self-publish a book entitled \u201cUnreported Truths about COVID-19 and Lockdowns: Part 1: Introduction and Death Counts and Estimates.\u201d \u201cThis is insane @JeffBezos,\u201d Musk tweeted at Bezos. \u201cTime to break up Amazon. Monopolies are wrong!\u201d According to Reuters, Amazon had no comment on Musk\u2019s call for its dissolution but said the book in question, by author Alex Berenson, had been blocked in error and was now available for sale via its Kindle e-reading service. The decision to allow the book\u2019s sale was not due to Musk, Amazon said. According to preview text on the Amazon website, Berenson\u2019s book \u201cprovides a counterweight to media hysteria about coronavirus.\u201d Musk has been a prominent lockdown sceptic, lashing out on Twitter about shelter-at-home restrictions and trying to reopen his factories even as orders remained in place. They are this season\u2019s must-have accessory. Surgical masks are in demand all over the world as people take precautions to avoid catching and spreading the coronavirus. Now the environmental impact of these single-use, disposable items is beginning to be felt, according to this news report from the French news agency AFP. A judge in Australia has banned a Black Lives Matter protest planned to take place in Sydney on Saturday, citing the coronavirus crisis, after a legal application from police to stop it taking place. New South Wales state Supreme Court Justice Des Fagan ruled the rally was not an authorised public assembly. Under restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus, outdoor gatherings in Sydney are restricted to 10 people, while up to 50 people can go to funerals, places of worship, restaurants, pubs and cafes. \u201cI don\u2019t diminish the importance of the issues and no one would deny them in normal circumstances,\u201d Fagan was reported as saying by the Associated Press. \u201cNo one denies them that but we\u2019re talking about a situation of a health crisis.\u201d His decision came after thousands of people indicated they would join the rally in in Australia\u2019s largest city on Saturday afternoon to remember George Floyd, the victim of a police killing in Minneapolis last week, and to protest against the deaths of indigenous Australians in custody. The state premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said organisers initially proposed a protest far smaller rally. She said protesters could not guarantee social distancing protocols would be followed. \u201cAll of us have given up so much and worked so hard to make sure we get on top of the virus,\u201d Berejiklian told reporters. Restaurants are opening, parks are full and people are getting back to work: parts of Europe, Asia and much of the Middle East are enjoying the benefits of flattened coronavirus curves. Meanwhile, parts of the US, India and Latin America are still recording thousands of new cases every day. The first wave of the coronavirus is not over. The future shape of the pandemic will be decided both by human action, in the form of social distancing, testing and other traditional methods of disease control, and also several unanswered questions about the nature of the virus itself. Experts say there are several possibilities, Michael Safi, the Guardian\u2019s international correspondent, reports. Even as more than 42 million people have signed on as unemployed in the US, the country\u2019s billionaires have added half a trillion dollars to their combined wealth, according to a thinktank report. During the 11 weeks from 18 March, when US lockdowns started, the wealth of America\u2019s richest people surged by over $565bn, the Institute for Policy Studies calculated in a report published on Thursday. Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, has benefited the most, as orders at his online delivery service soared, with his wealth increasing by an eye-watering $36.2bn. Mark Zuckerberg was the second biggest beneficiary, increasing his net worth by $30.1bn. Even Bill Gates, who has positioned himself as global health saviour by backing a number of Covid-19 vaccine projects, has ended up $11.8bn better off. Jeff Bezos \u2013 up $36.2bn Mark Zuckerberg \u2013 up $30.1bn Elon Musk \u2013 up $14.1bn Sergey Brin \u2013 up $13.9bn Larry Page \u2013 up $13.7bn Steve Ballmer \u2013 up $13.3bn MacKenzie Bezos \u2013 up $12.6bn Michael Bloomberg \u2013 up $12.1bn Bill Gates \u2013 up $11.8bn Phil Knight \u2013 up $11.6bn Larry Ellison \u2013 up $8.5bn Warren Buffett \u2013 up $7.7bn Michael Dell \u2013 up $7.6bn Sheldon Adelson \u2013 up $6.1bn Chuck Collins, a co-author of the report, said: These statistics remind us that we are more economically and racially divided than at any time in decades. The number of new cases of coronavirus in Iran slid slightly from its new peak yesterday, with 2,886 more people in the country testing positive for the virus in the past 24 hours, according to the health ministry. On Thursday, Iran reported a new record in transmissions detected in a single day, suggesting that the country could be experiencing a second wave of the epidemic. The previous daily record in Iran, which was one of the first countries in the Middle East to be gripped by the disease, was 3,186 on 30 March. In spite of a steadily rising infection rate, authorities have been progressively lifting controls on shops, mosques, schools, offices and travel. The border with Turkey was also being opened for haulage traffic on Thursday. In his latest update, Kianoush Jahanpour, the health ministry spokesman, said 63 more Iranians had died from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported. There are currently 2,573 people in critical condition. So far, Jahanpour said, 129,741 people out of a total of 167,156 infected with the virus have recovered. More than 168,000 people have so far tested positive for the coronavirus in Africa \u2013 an increase of about 6,000 since Thursday \u2013 according to the latest figures circulated by the World Health Organization on Friday. After a couple of days\u2019 unexplained hiatus, the UN health agency\u2019s regional office for the continent has resumed its tweets giving the rundown of the latest figures from the 54 countries in Africa. Of the official confirmed cases so far, more than 73,000 people have so far recovered and 4,700 have died. This is Damien Gayle taking the reins now on the live blog, bringing you the latest headlines and news on the global coronavirus outbreak as it happens. If you have any comments, or tips or suggestions for coverage, please drop me a line, either via email to damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or via Twitter direct message to @damiengayle. That\u2019s it for me today. Thanks to those who got in touch with their comments and suggestions \u2013 I\u2019m now handing over to my colleague Damien Gayle. Covid-19 deaths pass 390,000 worldwide. The number of confirmed deaths now stands at 391,439, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Meanwhile, known cases passed 6.6 million across the globe, with 6,651,047 currently confirmed. Brazil\u2019s death toll overtakes Italy\u2019s to become third highest worldwide. Brazil\u2019s Covid-19 death toll passed that of Italy on Thursday, as the health ministry reported 1,437 deaths in the last 24 hours and 30,925 additional coronavirus cases. The Latin American nation has now reported 34,021 deaths from the coronavirus, trailing only the United States and the United Kingdom. First Covid-19 case recorded among persecuted Rohingya in Myanmar. The 38-year-old man in Rakhine state had returned to Myanmar from Bangladesh, officials told Radio Free Asia. Rights groups are concerned about the squalid conditions in camps in Rakhine, where around 130,000 internally displaced Rohingya remain trapped. South Africa sees record rise in coronavirus cases. South Africa has recorded 3,267 coronavirus cases in 24 hours, the biggest increase since the pandemic hit the country. Africa\u2019s biggest industrial power now has a total of 40,792 infections, the health ministry said. It saw a rise of 56 deaths, bringing the total to 848. More than half of the cases are in the Western Cape region, where health services are under pressure. Covid-19 \u2018under control\u2019 in France, says government adviser. The head of the government\u2019s scientific advisory council, Jean-Francois Delfraissy, told France Inter radio: \u201cWe can reasonably say the virus is currently under control. The virus is still circulating, in certain regions in particular \u2026 but it is circulating slowly.\u201d Turkey cancels weekend lockdown after backlash. President Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has cancelled a lockdown, announced late on Thursday, after a public backlash, but warned of a rise in the number of daily coronavirus cases. British pharma giant \u201con track\u201d to roll out 2bn vaccine doses if trials successful. AstraZeneca will begin rolling out the vaccine in September if ongoing trials prove successful, its chief executive said. The company is partnering with Oxford University, which has pioneered the vaccine, and is already manufacturing doses before seeking final regulatory approval once testing concludes in the coming months. US pandemic jobless claims passed 42m after another 1.9 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week. The pace of layoffs has slowed dramatically from its peak of 6.6m at the start of April as states begin to relax quarantines. Last week was the ninth consecutive week of declines. Death of man after face mask arrest shines light on Mexican police brutality. Mexicans have responded with outrage after a man was found beaten to death hours after he was arrested by police officers for not wearing a face mask in public. Video of the incident emerged on Wednesday, and shows the police officers with assault rifles forcing Giovanni L\u00f3pez, a 30-year-old bricklayer, into a police pickup truck as bystanders plead for his release. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, will hold a video conference on Thursday to discuss the coronavirus pandemic, economic policy and international issues, a German government spokesman has said. Malaysia has reported 19 new confirmed coronavirus cases on Friday, taking the cumulative total to 8,266 infections. The health ministry also reported its first death in two weeks, raising the number of fatalities to 116. Earlier on Friday, Malaysia\u2019s prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, unveiled an additional economic stimulus package worth around $8.2bn in an effort to revitalise industries badly hit by the pandemic. Mining sites in Canada, the US and around the world have become hotspots for the spread of coronavirus, and approximately 4,000 mine workers in 18 countries have tested positive, according to a report by an international coalition of non-profit groups. The report links mining sites to virus outbreaks in several Indigenous and remote communities. In a separate statement more than 330 organisations around the world called mining \u201cone of the most polluting, deadly, and destructive industries\u201d and accused the industry of ignoring the threats of pandemic and using it to weaken regulations. \u201cWe reject the central claim that mining represents an essential service,\u201d it reads. The mining industry pushed governments to declare them \u201cessential\u201d and many continue to operate throughout the pandemic in the US and Canada, said Kirsten Francescone of MiningWatch Canada, one of the non-profit groups that authored the report. Mine workers and members of nearby Indigenous and remote rural communities are at grave risk. At least 45 infected workers from a fly-in, fly-out work camp housing thousands at Exxon\u2019s Imperial Oil Kearl Lake oil sands mine project in northern Alberta flew home in mid-April unknowingly spreading the virus in five Canadian provinces. This triggered an outbreak in a remote northern Saskatchewan Dene village, killing two elders, and in a long-term care home in British Columbia. The Kearl Lake outbreak has expanded to 107 cases as the mine continues to operate. In mid-May another Alberta oilsands operation reported an outbreak but Alberta government officials insist these operations must remain open to protect the economy, said Francescone. \u201cThese outbreaks are hardly surprising with mine workers living together in camps.\u201d The British pharma giant AstraZeneca is \u201con track\u201d to begin rolling out up to 2bn doses of a coronavirus vaccine in September if ongoing trials prove successful, its chief executive said on Friday. The company is partnering with Oxford University, which has pioneered the vaccine, and is already manufacturing doses before seeking final regulatory approval once testing concludes in the coming months. The AstraZeneca chief executive, Pascal Soriot, told the BBC: So far we\u2019re still on track \u2026 we are starting to manufacture this vaccine right now, and we have to have it ready to be used by the time we have the results. Our present assumption is that we will have the data by the end of the summer, by August, so in September we should know whether we have an effective vaccine or not. The firm announced this week it had struck agreements with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi the Vaccine Alliance, and the Serum Institute of India to double production capacity of the Covid-19 vaccine to 2bn doses. The partnership with the Indian institute \u2013 one of the world\u2019s largest vaccine manufacturers \u2013 will help supply it to a large number of low- and middle-income countries. AstraZeneca has established separate supply chains for the vaccine in Europe, the United States, and India and is also looking at setting up production in China, Soriot said. He added AstraZeneca, which is undertaking the work on a non-profit basis, could lose money if trials prove disappointing. But he said the company was sharing the financial risk with organisations such as CEPI. \u201cWe\u2019re manufacturing indeed at risk \u2013 and that\u2019s the only way to have the vaccine ready to go if it works,\u201d he added. Oxford University began initial trials of its Covid-19 vaccine with hundreds of volunteers in April, and is now expanding them to 10,000 participants. It said last month they were \u201cprogressing very well\u201d. Researchers announced this week they would also start tests in mid-June in Brazil, the first country outside Britain to take part in the study, as the South American country\u2019s virus infection rate spirals while the UK\u2019s falls. French winemakers are to turn unsold wine into hand gel and ethanol to make room for this year\u2019s production, the country\u2019s farming agency has said. The government agency FranceAgriMer said around 3m hectolitres needed distilling as a result of lower sales during the coronavirus crisis. Winemakers have been hit by the closure of bars and restaurants in France and abroad. Exports to the US, which halved after the Trump administration introduced punitive 25% tariffs last October, fell further after the Covid-19 outbreak. FranceAgriMer said that from Friday, 33 distilleries had been authorised to collect 2m hectolitres of unsold wine to transform it into ethanol or hydro-alcoholic gel in order to free up room in vintners\u2019 caves for this year\u2019s production. The exceptional measure has been approved by Brussels, and the EU will finance the distillation, the agency added. Similar measures are being employed in Spain and Italy to deal with an excess of wine and to destroy young grapes. The alcohol produced through the distilling process will be used by the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry and for the production of hand sanitising gel. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has cancelled a weekend lockdown announced late on Thursday after a public backlash, but warned of a rise in the number of daily coronavirus cases. On Thursday, Turkey\u2019s interior ministry announced the stay-at-home order in 15 cities to prevent the spread of the virus, continuing the country\u2019s policy of weekend lockdowns. In a series of tweets, Erdo\u011fan said the government had to impose the weekend lockdown after daily new Covid-19 cases rose from around 700 to nearly 1,000. \u201cHowever, the reactions we received from our people pushed us to re-evaluate the decision,\u201d and the lockdown is now revoked, he said, urging citizens to follow social distancing and hygiene measures. The Philippines\u2019 health ministry has confirmed three new coronavirus deaths and 244 more infections, the lowest single-day increase in cases in two weeks. The ministry said total deaths had reached 987 while confirmed cases had risen to 20,626. There are 4,330 patients who have recovered. A professional rugby union team that set off for an away match on 23 February have still not made it home, the BBC have reported. The Manuma Samoa team set off for a match in Perth, Australia over 100 days ago, and were forced to quarantine in New Zealand on their way home - where they ended up stuck when the country closed its borders. They lived in a church compound in Auckland for three months, with 20 players sharing one room. \u201cWhen we arrived in New Zealand it was summer,\u201d the team\u2019s video analyst, Hari Junior Narayan, told the BBC. \u201cWhen we left it was winter.\u201d The squad is now back in Samoa, halfway through a two-week quarantine, after which they will finally be reunited with their families. \u201cMy daughter is four months old,\u201d said Narayan. \u201cThe last time I saw her, she was one month, so I\u2019ve missed a lot.\u201d All air traffic at Israel\u2019s principal airport was shut down on Friday after workers walked off the job to demand compensation for wages lost due to the coronavirus crisis. Global demand for air travel has plummeted amid the pandemic and Ben Gurion airport, near Tel Aviv, put about 2,500 airport workers on unpaid leave in early March. The Israel Airports Authority\u2019s workers\u2019 union has demanded the country negotiate a compensation package with airport workers. \u201cThe workers that were placed on unpaid leave have now stopped receiving unemployment benefits. We need the government to find a solution,\u201d the union spokeswoman Gali Gabbay said. Most flights at the airport had already been halted due to the pandemic, save for a handful of daily passenger and cargo services. The workers\u2019 strike will affect 37 flights on Friday, 17 outbound and 20 inbound, the airport said. It did not say how many were passenger or cargo flights. Israel has not said when it will end Covid-19 border restrictions. A US aircraft carrier ship, whose captain was removed for scathing remarks about a coronavirus outbreak onboard, has returned to service in the Pacific Ocean, authorities said. Brett Crozier lost his command in early April as punishment for the leak of a letter he sent to superiors seeking tougher action against the spread of Covid-19 on his ship, the USS Theodore Roosevelt. Hailed as a hero by his crew, Crozier\u2019s case is now being reconsidered by the US navy, which has recommended his reinstatement to the defense secretary, Mark Esper. The massive carrier was sidelined for about 10 weeks because of the outbreak, which infected a fifth of its 5,000 sailors, but set sail again from the US Pacific territory of Guam on Thursday, the ship\u2019s public affairs office said. It had a famous navy battle cry \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t Give Up The Ship\u201d \u2013 flying from the port yardarm. The ship returned to the US 7th Fleet area of operations to provide maritime security with new social distancing rules including staggered mealtimes, the navy said. \u201cWe have returned Theodore Roosevelt to sea as a symbol of hope and inspiration,\u201d said the new Captain, Carlos Sardiello. Thailand is positioning itself as a trusted destination for international tourists after travel restrictions ease, capitalising on its relative success in containing the coronavirus outbreak, industry officials say. The south-east Asian country, the first to report a virus case outside of China, wants to build on its reputation and remake its popular image as a destination for big tour groups. \u201cAfter Covid eases, we plan to refresh the country\u2019s image to a trusted destination where tourists will have peace of mind,\u201d Tanes Petsuwan, the Tourism Authority of Thailand\u2019s (TAT) deputy governor for marketing and communications, told Reuters. The campaign, to be launched later in the year, will be aimed at young, affluent travellers from places that are considered low-risk such as China, South Korea and Taiwan, Tanes said. It will highlight scenic beaches and parks, part of a \u201ctourism bridge\u201d that could emerge in Asia including Hong Kong and Japan. The government has rolled out a health certification system for hotels and restaurants so that travellers can be reassured. South-east Asia\u2019s second-largest economy has so far reported just over 3,100 cases and 58 deaths - far less than other major regional economies, except for Vietnam. Local transmission has waned, with the last recorded case on 25 May. The tourism industry, which accounts for 12% of the economy, collapsed after the outbreak escalated. Thailand welcomed 39.8 million foreign tourists last year but projects as few as 14 million for 2020. Thailand has banned international flights until at least 30 June, and foreign tourists aren\u2019t expected until later in the year. In the meantime, the government is drawing up a stimulus package to promote domestic tourism from July to October. But when international travel resumes, Thailand will promote the \u201ctrust\u201d concept, as hotels emphasise measures they are taking for safety and offer special packages. Central Plaza Hotel, which manages 46 hotels and resorts across Thailand, will seal rooms once they are cleaned and disinfected so guests will be confident, the deputy CEO Markland Blaiklock told Reuters. \u201cWe may limit occupancy at 50% on some properties so guests experience social distancing that they are comfortable with,\u201d he said. But it\u2019s unclear if travellers will be at ease before a coronavirus vaccine is available, which experts say is at least a year away. The Czech Republic said it would fully open borders with Austria and Germany, as well as travel with Hungary, on Friday, 10 days earlier than planned, almost three months after they were shut to curb coronavirus. Travellers will be free to enter from noon (10:00 GMT) without submitting a negative virus test or going into quarantine. Czechs still require people from countries including Britain and Sweden to submit negative test results before being allowed in. Having closed all borders on 16 March to stem coronavirus infections, the Czechs reopened the Slovakia frontier on Thursday and lifted all travel restrictions with their neighbour. Officials said on Monday they would open the border for the citizens of \u201csafe\u201d countries, including their neighbours but also Switzerland, Finland and the Baltic states, from 15 June. \u201cWe have brought the opening forward with these countries,\u201d the prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, told reporters, referring to Austria, Germany and Hungary, without explaining why the move was being made earlier than planned. The government also announced on Monday that Czechs would be free to travel to less-safe countries including Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain. But foreigners arriving from these countries would have to submit a negative test result upon entry, just like those from the least safe countries - Britain and Sweden. Czechs returning from Britain and Sweden will have to provide negative tests too. As of Friday morning, the Czech Republic had registered almost 9,500 confirmed cases of Covid-19, including 326 deaths, in a population of 10.7 million people. Surgical masks are washing up in growing quantities on the shores of Hong Kong, a city that has overwhelmingly embraced face coverings to fight the coronavirus. Conservationists say the masks are adding to already alarmingly high levels of plastic waste in the waters around the finance hub. \u201cThe single use plastic mask is just another additional burden that we are leaving behind for the future generations on the beach,\u201d Gary Stokes, co-founder of OceansAsia, told AFP. During a recent visit, conservationists counted and removed 70 masks from a 100 metre stretch of beach. A week later, another 30 masks had washed up. \u201cEver since society started wearing masks, the cause and effects of it are now being seen on the beaches,\u201d Stokes said. Hong Kong\u2019s 7.5 million inhabitants produce six million tonnes of waste each year, only around 30% of it recycled. Even before the coronavirus emerged, residents often wore face masks on the daily commute, especially during the winter flu season. But the emergence of the deadly Covid-19 disease has made mask wearing near ubiquitous. A growing number of companies are now offering reusable masks and the government has also launched an initiative to send all residents a fabric mask that can be washed. But disposable masks remain by far the most popular choice. Stokes said: What I\u2019ll be waiting to see is when we\u2019ll get a dead porpoise or dolphin washed out with masks inside their stomach. Obviously these are another thing that enters into the marine environment and could be mistaken for food. The Covid-19 pandemic is now \u201cunder control\u201d in France, the head of the government\u2019s scientific advisory council has said, as the country cautiously lifts a lockdown imposed in March. Jean-Francois Delfraissy told France Inter radio: We can reasonably say the virus is currently under control. The virus is still circulating, in certain regions in particular \u2026 but it is circulating slowly. Delfraissy, an immunologist, and his colleagues were appointed to the coronavirus advisory panel as authorities sought to contain an outbreak that has killed more than 29,000 people in France. The number of daily deaths has fallen off, however, with just 44 reported by the health ministry on Thursday. Delfraissy said around 1,000 new cases were currently being reported in France per day, down from around 80,000 in early March, before the nationwide stay-at-home orders and business closures were issued. In its latest summary of findings published on Thursday, the Sante Publique France health agency estimated that the country had 151,325 confirmed Covid-19 cases as of 2 June, when restaurants across France were allowed to reopen. But it cautioned that at the height of the outbreak, patients with suspected coronavirus infections were not systematically tested, meaning the actual number of cases exceeds the official estimate. Russia has reported 8,726 new cases of Covid-19, pushing the total number of infections in the country to 449,834. Officials said 144 people had died in the last 24 hours, bringing the official nationwide death toll to 5,528. An influential medical journal article that found hydroxychloroquine increased the risk of death in Covid-19 patients was retracted on Thursday, adding further controversy to the drug championed by US president Donald Trump. Three of the authors of the article retracted it, citing concerns about the quality and veracity of data in the study, following a Guardian investigation into the data and US company Surgisphere which provided it. The anti-malarial drug has been controversial in part due to support from Trump, as well as implications of the study published in British journal The Lancet last month, which led several Covid-19 studies to be halted. The three authors said Surgisphere would not transfer the dataset for an independent review and they \u201ccan no longer vouch for the veracity of the primary data sources\u201d. The fourth author of the study, Dr Sapan Desai, chief executive of Surgisphere, declined to comment on the retraction. The Lancet said on Thursday it \u201ctakes issues of scientific integrity extremely seriously, and there are many outstanding questions about Surgisphere and the data that were allegedly included in this study\u201d. It said institutional reviews of Surgisphere\u2019s research collaborations were urgently needed. Another study in the New England Journal of Medicine that relied on Surgisphere data and shared the same lead author, Harvard Medical School professor Mandeep Mehra, was retracted for the same reason. The observational study published in The Lancet on 22 May said it looked at 96,000 hospitalised Covid-19 patients, some treated with the decades-old malaria drug. It claimed that those treated with hydroxychloroquine or the related chloroquine had higher risk of death and heart rhythm problems than patients who were not given the medicines. The World Health Organization, which paused hydroxychloroquine trials after The Lancet study was released, said on Wednesday it was ready to resume trials, and dozens of other trials have resumed or are in process. The study\u2019s lead author, professor Mehra, said in a statement: I did not do enough to ensure that the data source was appropriate for this use. For that, and for all the disruptions - both directly and indirectly - I am truly sorry. Many scientists voiced concern about the study, which had already been corrected last week because some location data was wrong. Nearly 150 doctors signed an open letter to The Lancet calling the article\u2019s conclusions into question and asking to make public the peer review comments that preceded publication. The episode highlights how studies to prevent and treat the virus are being conducted at unprecedented speed while garnering high levels of attention that could give findings unwarranted weight. Singapore has confirmed another 261 coronavirus cases, the city-state\u2019s smallest increase in nearly two months, taking its tally to 37,183. The lower number of cases was partly due to the fact that fewer swab-tests were conducted, the health ministry said. Afghanistan has recorded its biggest one-day rise of new coronavirus cases as around 60% of tests over the last 24 hours came back positive, with a continued surge of transmission in Kabul and record high in Helmand. According to the latest update, the health ministry has detected 915 new cases out of 1,570 tests, marking the war-torn country\u2019s biggest one-day rise of new infections. Nine patients also died overnight, with the total number of infections now standing at 18,969 and the death toll at 309. There have been 1,763 recoveries. Most new cases have been reported in the capital city of Kabul, where the health ministry detected 423 new cases out of 811 tests. Kabul is the country\u2019s worst affected area with 7,556 cases. The western province of Herat recorded 201 new cases out of 243 tests in the last 24 hours. Testing capacity remains low in Afghanistan and experts warn that real Covid-19 figures may be much higher. Earlier this week, the International Rescue Committee warned about the low capacity of testing and said the Afghan health ministry has the capacity to test 2,000 suspected patients each day, but is receiving between 10,000 - 20,000 samples daily. The IRC said: That means between 80 - 90% of potential cases are not being tested. Afghanistan has one of the highest test positivity rates (40%) of all the countries where the IRC works, suggesting a high level of undetected population infection. Helmand province recorded 20 new cases after more than a month without new reports. On Thursday, a newly introduced acting minister of public health, Ahmad Jawad Osmani, said in a press conference that he would bring reforms to the health sector. Osmani said the coronavirus must be fought, but that reforms in hospitals and in other service areas must also be made. He said current health services do not meet the people\u2019s standards and need to be increased. New orders for German manufacturing firms saw their sharpest fall on record in April during the coronavirus shutdown, official data has shown, plunging a worse-than-expected 25.8% from March. The closely-watched indicator of future industrial activity saw \u201cthe biggest fall since the beginning of the data series in 1991\u201d just after German reunification, federal statistics authority Destatis said. The reading was down 36.6% year-on-year, it added. Destatis had previously flagged March\u2019s 15% month-on-month plunge as the worst in the history of the industrial orders measure. \u201cThe collapse in new industrial orders worsened again in line with expectations in April,\u201d the economy ministry in Berlin said, as \u201crestrictions against the corona pandemic were in place during the whole month\u201d. Other indicators of German industrial output have also plummeted in recent months. Since January, carmakers have built fewer than one million vehicles, down more than one-third compared with the first five months of 2019. Ministers in chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s coalition government this week agreed a new \u20ac130bn ($148bn) stimulus package to get the country moving again as it gradually emerges from infection control lockdowns. The country\u2019s biggest post-war package, includes cuts to VAT, handouts to families, and subsidies for greener transport options. However the economy ministry said that the \u201cgiven gradual loosening (of lockdowns) the worst of the industrial recession should be behind us\u201d. Dozens of protesters in Hong Kong marched through a shopping mall on Friday, chanting pro-democracy slogans a day after thousands defied a police ban to hold a vigil for the anniversary of China\u2019s Tiananmen crackdown in 1989. Protesters of all ages joined the march in the heart of the city\u2019s financial district, which ended peacefully after an hour. Some held banners that read \u201cHong Kong independence\u201d and \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times,\u201d as well as the former British colonial flag, while others chanted \u201cGlory to Hong Kong\u201d, the unofficial anthem of the protests. Thursday\u2019s anniversary of Chinese troops opening fire on student-led protests in and around Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square was particularly sensitive this year as the central government drafts national security laws for the Asian financial hub. It was the first time in 31 years that scuffles briefly disrupted what is usually a solemn day in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, which traditionally organises the world\u2019s biggest memorial for the crackdown. Officers would not have intervened if protesters had not blocked roads in the district of Mong Kok, police said on Twitter on Thursday. They had rejected the application for the vigil over concerns about the coronavirus. Governments must rebuild their economies after the coronavirus crisis to withstand the next shock heading their way - climate change - the central bank governors of Britain and France have said. \u201cUnless we act now, the climate crisis will be tomorrow\u2019s central scenario and, unlike Covid-19, no one will be able to self-isolate from it,\u201d Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey and his French counterpart, Fran\u00e7ois Villeroy de Galhau, wrote in a joint article published in the Guardian. They said countries around the world were far from meeting their climate goals and the coronavirus pandemic had shown that reacting to a crisis at its height brought huge costs. They said: To address climate breakdown, we can instead take decisions now that reduce emissions in a less disruptive manner. That requires us to be strategic. To build back better. Central banks have increasingly put the risks of climate change into their assessments of the health of the financial services firms that they monitor. A group representing central bankers and regulators - the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) - will publish climate reference scenarios in the coming weeks which Bailey and Villeroy said would \u201craise the bar for the financial sector\u201d. The article was co-written with Frank Elderson, chair of NGFS who is an executive board member of the central bank of the Netherlands, and with former BoE governor Mark Carney, who is the United Nations\u2019 special envoy for climate action and finance. The first case of Covid-19 has been recorded among the Rohingya minority in Myanmar, adding to concerns that the virus could spread rapidly among the persecuted group. Rohingya have faced decades of oppression in Myanmar, where they are denied citizenship, face severe restrictions on their movement, and have extremely limited access to health care. Rights groups are particularly concerned about the squalid conditions in camps in central Rakhine state where around 130,000 internally displaced Rohingya remain trapped. Human Rights Watch recently reported that the Burmese authorities are using the Covid-19 response measures as a pretext to further harass and extort Rohingya, and are \u201cdoubling down on a system in which they are already effectively incarcerating the population\u201d. In 2017, more than 700,000 Rohingya fled over the border to Bangladesh, following brutal campaign by the Myanmar military that has since led to a genocide case in the UN\u2019s top court. Around 600,000 Rohingya remain in Myanmar, where the UN warns they face a continued risk of genocide. The 38 year-old man in Rakhine state who is confirmed to have the virus was tested on Monday and had returned to Myanmar from Bangladesh, officials told Radio Free Asia. This week, authorities in Bangladesh confirmed the first death from Covid-19 in the country\u2019s refugee camps, where there are also major concerns about overcrowding, poor sanitation and limited medical facilities. The man, aged 71, died on 31 May while undergoing treatment at the camp\u2019s isolation center. So far, 29 people have tested positive in the camps, which host about one million Rohingya. The Norwegian economy contracted 4.7% in April from March but the outlook for the rest of the year now looks less bleak than it did in late April, Statistics Norway has said. The mainland economy, which excludes the volatile offshore oil and gas production, is now forecast to drop 3.9% for the full year compared to the 5.5% fall predicted on 24 April when Norway was in lockdown. Hello, this is Jessica Murray, I\u2019ll be steering the live blog for the next few hours. If you have any stories or suggestions you\u2019d like to share, feel free to get in touch: Email: jessica.murray@theguardian.com Twitter: @journojess_ A quick look at the Guardian UK\u2019s front page, which is leading on a pandemic exclusive: \u201cRevealed: NHS test and trace not fully operational until September\u201d. Britain\u2019s test-and-trace system could take another four months before it is working properly, the Guardian has learned, raising concerns about how the country might cope with a second wave of coronavirus infections. Tony Prestedge, a banker drafted in to run the NHS scheme, told staff that the programme would be \u201cimperfect\u201d at launch and won\u2019t be world class until September or October. Boris Johnson had said the \u201cworld-beating\u201d scheme would be in place by 1 June. You can read more about this and get up to speed with all the developments in our UK Morning Briefing with Martin Farrer below. Fuji Rock Festival, Japan\u2019s biggest annual music event, will be cancelled for the first time ever due to the coronavirus pandemic, organisers said, disappointing thousands of rock-and-roll fans who flock to the outdoor festivities every year. Since its inception in 1997, headliners at the event have included The Red Hot Chilli Peppers, The Cure and Kendrick Lamar. Last year, the event, held in the summer, attracted 130,000 people over four days. \u201cWe had hoped the pandemic would abate in time to hold this summer\u2019s festival as scheduled and were moving forward with planning,\u201d the organisers said on their website. \u201cWe apologise for taking so long to inform everyone of this decision.\u201d This year\u2019s festival had been scheduled for three days from 21 August, with American rock band The Strokes among the acts. Japan has been hit by around 18,000 infections and 900 deaths from the coronavirus pandemic. US unemployment figures are due out on Friday, with some economists predicting the rate may shoot up to almost 20%. Reuters reports that =while layoffs remained very high in the US, they eased considerably in the second half of May as businesses reopened after shuttering in mid-March to slow the spread of Covid-19. The employment report is compiled from two separate surveys. According to a Reuters poll of economists, the survey of households is likely to show the unemployment rate jumped to 19.8% in May from 14.7% in April, which was the highest since 1948 when the government started keeping records. The survey of establishments is forecast showing non-farm payrolls dropped by 8m jobs after a record 20.537m plunge in April. That would bring total job losses to 29.4m since March. If borne out by the new figures, that would be more than three times the jobs lost during the 2007-09 GFC, and it took six years recoup the jobs lost during that downturn. Singapore plans to soon launch a wearable device for coronavirus contact tracing that, if successful, it will distribute to all of its 5.7 million residents, the government said on Friday. The city-state has already developed the first-of-its-kind smartphone app to identify and alert people who have interacted with novel coronavirus carriers, but the bluetooth technology has been beset with glitches and the app is not widely used. \u201cWe are developing and will soon roll out a portable wearable device that will ... not depend on possession of a smartphone,\u201d foreign minister Vivian Balakrishnan told parliament on Friday. \u201cIf this portable device works. We may then distribute it to everyone in Singapore ... This will be more inclusive, and it will ensure that all of us will be protected.\u201d The device being developed can be worn on a lanyard or kept in a handbag and will be battery-operated, Balakrishnan said last month in an interview with Sky News Australia. Known cases pass 6.6 million worldwide. The number of known coronavirus infections has passed 6.6 million, with 6,601,349 currently confirmed, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Deaths are approaching 390,000, with the current toll at 389,645. Brazil\u2019s death toll overtakes Italy\u2019s to become third-highest worldwide. Brazil\u2019s total Covid-19 death toll blew past that of Italy on Thursday, as the Health Ministry reported 1,437 deaths in the last 24 hours and 30,925 additional coronavirus cases. The Latin American nation has now reported 34,021 deaths from the coronavirus, trailing only the United States and the United Kingdom. Ebola drug remdesivir endorsed as a coronavirus treatment in Australia. The antiviral drug remdesivir has been recommended for the treatment of Covid-19 patients in Australia, by the national taskforce bringing together the country\u2019s peak health groups. South Africa sees record rise in coronavirus cases. South Africa has recorded 3,267 coronavirus cases in 24 hours, the biggest increase since the pandemic hit the country. Africa\u2019s biggest industrial power now has a total of 40,792 infections, the health ministry said. It saw a rise of 56 deaths, bring the total to 848. More than half of the cases are in the Western Cape region where health services are under pressure. New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, urged protestors to get tested for coronavirus, saying several days and nights of demonstrations in the state after the killing of George Floyd could accelerate the spread. He noted that an estimated 30,000 people have protested in the state. Death of man after face mask arrest shines light on Mexican police brutality. Mexicans have responded with outrage after a man was found beaten to death hours after he was arrested by police officers for not wearing a face mask in public.Giovanni L\u00f3pez, a 30-year-old bricklayer, was detained on 4 May by municipal police officers in the town of Ixtlahuac\u00e1n de Los Membrillos near Guadalajara.Video of the incident emerged on Wednesday, and shows the police officers with assault rifles forcing L\u00f3pez into a police pickup truck as bystanders plead for his release. Covid-19 causing 10,000 dementia deaths beyond infections, UK research says. There were almost 10,000 unexplained extra deaths among people with dementia in April, according to official figures that have prompted alarm about the severe impact of social isolation on people with the condition. The data, from the Office for National Statistics in England and Wales, reveals that, beyond deaths directly linked to Covid-19, there were 83% more deaths from dementia than usual in April, with charities warning that a reduction in essential medical care and family visits were taking a devastating toll. Argentina extends lockdown. Argentina has extended a mandatory lockdown in Buenos Aires, the capital, and some other parts of the country until 28 June, as confirmed coronavirus cases continue to rise, surpassing 20,000 earlier in the day. Virus patients with high blood pressure twice as likely to die: study. Patients with high blood pressure admitted to hospital with coronavirus infections are twice as likely to die as those without the condition, researchers said on Friday. Tokyo Olympics exec says must watch virus situation for Games decision. A Tokyo 2020 executive board member said on Friday that organisers will need to monitor the coronavirus situation until next spring to decide whether to hold the Summer Olympics next year, Kyodo News reported. Turkey announces weekend lockdown in 15 cities. Turkey will impose a weekend lockdown in 15 cities as part of efforts to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, the interior ministry said.In a statement, the ministry said bakeries and certain shops could operate during the lockdown.Turkey has had 167,410 Covid-19 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. Low Covid-19 figures for Africa are \u201cbroadly accurate\u201d, the World Health Organization\u2019s director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, has said. There were concerns that low levels of testing, poor infrastructure and a lack of cooperation from some governments may be disguising the true extent of the disease\u2019s spread. US pandemic jobless claims passed 42m after another 1.9 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week. The pace of layoffs has slowed dramatically from its peak of 6.6m at the start of April as states begin to relax quarantines. Last week was the ninth consecutive week of declines. Politicians may need to reimpose lockdown restrictions if there is a resurgence in coronavirus cases, a leading intensive care specialist has said. Maurizio Cecconi, head of intensive care at the Humanitas research hospital in Milan and the incoming president of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, was one of three Lombardy doctors who warned the rest of Europe to \u201cget ready\u201d for Covid-19 in the early days of the outbreak. Now he says society will have to \u201clearn how to live\u201d with coronavirus until there is a vaccine. While he is optimistic about European health authorities\u2019 efforts to monitor the virus, he doesn\u2019t exclude a return to tighter social controls. \u201cIf there is an increase in transmission we need to be ready to slow down again, and maybe to put [in place] restrictive measures again,\u201d he said. The Nikkei Asian Review reports that Japan plans to allow business travellers from certain countries to bypass the country\u2019s two-week quarantine requirement, starting in summer this year \u2013 if they have proof of a negative test result: The government plans to hold talks with countries with similarly low infection rates to renegotiate immigration restrictions on both sides. Discussions will begin as early as this month with Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand, with new rules to be implemented once an agreement is reached. The changes, which come after Japan lifted its nationwide coronavirus state of emergency, would likely cover corporate executives, engineers and other specialists, internal company transfers, and technical trainees, among others, according to details of a government proposal seen by Nikkei. The number of known coronavirus infections has passed 6.6 million, with 6,601,349 currently confirmed, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Deaths are approaching 390,000, with the current toll at 389,645. The figures, which are based on official and media reports, are likely to significantly underestimate the scale of the pandemic due to differing testing and recording regimes, as well as suspected under-reporting. A Tokyo 2020 executive board member said on Friday that organisers will need to monitor the coronavirus situation until next spring to decide whether to hold the Summer Olympics next year, Kyodo News reported. The comment by lawmaker Toshiaki Endo, one of six vice presidents on the board and a former Olympics minister, marks the first time an executive from the organising committee has commented on the timing for a decision on going through with the Games, the news agency said. The Games were postponed from this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Australia\u2019s most populous state has lodged a legal application to stop a Black Lives Matter protest occurring in Sydney, state Premier Gladys Berejiklian said on Friday, over coronavirus restriction concerns. NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller says he lodged an injunction because the numbers of those attending the protest kept growing online. Protests in groups of 10 are allowed under the health order, but that if the supreme court outlaws the protest, a gathering of hundreds would be illegal. Thousands of people have pledged to attend a protest organised in Sydney on Saturday in the wake of death of black American George Floyd in US police custody. The protest had secured permission as it originally planned to have fewer than 500 people present. But Berejiklian said when it became clear that thousands planned to attend, the legal application was made to the state\u2019s Supreme Court. Fuller said: If ten people turn up in Pitt St tomorrow, we wish them well. But if hundreds and thousands of people turn up, then they\u2019re in breach of the health order and if they haven\u2019t complied with the Supreme Court, then obviously all of the police powers available to us can be used. Berejiklian spoke directly to those intending to attend: I\u2019m asking, appealing and pleading with those thousands of people who\u2019ve indicated they\u2019re turning up to a protest \u2013 please, do not do it. Stay at home. Express yourself in a different way.\u201d A bubbly tale from Australia now ... A group of schoolchildren in the state of Queensland have sent fan mail to a lonely aquarium fish in Cairns to help him overcome his coronavirus lockdown-induced despondence, AAP reports. But since the aquarium was closed due to the pandemic, one Queensland grouper began retreating to dark corners of his tank, and even stopped eating for a few weeks. Students from Torbanlea State School empathised with Chang\u2019s plight, and made it their mission to cheer him up. \u201cOut of nowhere we received this package in the mail, and it was addressed to Chang the Lonely Grouper,\u201d aquarium boss Daniel Leipnik told AAP. Inside were scores of self portraits drawn by the year one class, and a letter addressed to Chang. \u201cWhen we couldn\u2019t come to school, some of us were feeling gloomy too,\u201d the letter read. The aquarium was under strict instructions to attach the pictures to the other side of the acrylic. \u201cI thought, \u2018oh maybe they might put the letter up in the staff room or something\u2019. I never imagined in my wildest dreams that they would actually do it,\u201d teacher Di McRae told AAP. But the aquarium did as they were told, and \u201cit did the trick\u201d. \u201cHe was in a cave the whole day, but then when we put the pictures up against the acrylic, he actually came out, and was watching it,\u201d Mr Leipnik said. \u201cPeople can relate to what an individual may feel like in an isolation type setting,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people see themselves in this giant fish.\u201d Japan\u2019s household spending slumped again in April, falling 11.1% from a year earlier, government data showed Friday, as the world\u2019s third-largest economy struggled with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, AFP reports. The figure released by the internal affairs ministry was largely in line with market expectations of a 12.75% drop. It was the seventh straight month of declines since October, when the government hiked a sales tax. The April drop was partly attributed to declines in spending on transport and telecommunications, and well as on leisure activities. The latest figures come after official data last month confirmed Japan dived into its first recession since 2015, shrinking by 0.9% in the first quarter as it wrestles with the fallout from the coronavirus. The drop in gross domestic product followed a 1.9% decline in the fourth quarter of 2019 as the tax hike and typhoons hit Japan hard - even before the pandemic shut down much of the economy. Fears about the economic impact of the virus have shaken global and Japanese financial markets and the Bank of Japan last month expanded its emergency monetary easing and cut growth forecasts for the country. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 394 to 183,271, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Friday. The reported death toll rose by 26 to 8,613, the tally showed. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador urged the country to remain calm Thursday as Mexico registered the second straight day of escalating coronavirus death numbers that rivaled those coming out of Brazil or the United States, AP reports. The Health Department announced 816 more confirmed Covid-19 deaths, one day after officials reported a toll of 1,092 deaths, which was more than double the highest previous toll reported in a single day. Officials said an additional 1,033 suspected Covid-19 deaths were awaiting confirmation, suggesting daily tolls would remain high. Newly confirmed coronavirus cases also continued to rise by record amounts, with 4,442 reported Thursday. Assistant Health Secretary Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell sought to allay fears over the new numbers, saying that daily deaths had peaked 17 May. He said many of the Covid-19 deaths reported this week actually occurred in May but were not tallied until now because of backlogs in reporting or testing. But with total deaths standing at 12,545, he acknowledged the pandemic could wind up costing as many as 35,000 lives in Mexico, local media reported. Experts said the reason for this week\u2019s sudden jump in deaths was attributable to a number of factors, including confirmation and inclusion of deaths stretching back as far as 25 days. But the country is also passing through the pandemics most critical moment with a dramatically increasing number of confirmed and suspected infections. South Africa has dehorned dozens of rhinos in three popular game parks, aiming to prevent armed poachers taking advantage of empty parks to kill them for their horns. The exercise in Pilanesburg National Park and the Mafikeng and Botsalano game reserves \u2013 all northwest of Johannesburg \u2013 leaves the rhinos with horn rumps too small for poachers to bother with, Nico Jacobs, helicopter pilot and founding member of non-profit Rhino 911 told Reuters. As Jacobs flew a helicopter over Pilanesburg last month with Reuters journalists, they spotted a lioness eating the carcass of a rhino that had been poached days earlier. Experts fear the absence of tourists may already have spurred a poaching spike. On Monday, scientists published a study showing that humans are causing mass extinction on a scale unseen since a meteor wiped out the land dinosaurs 65 million years ago, the sixth large-scale extinction in Earth\u2019s history. Decades of hunting and habitat loss have reduced Rhino numbers to about 27,000 today, according to the International Rhino Foundation. A poaching surge has wiped out thousands in the past three years. Rhino horn sells for $60,000 a kilogram, more than cocaine or gold. In East Asia, it is used in medicinal potions, despite containing the same key component as human fingernails. Dehorning is controversial, especially as it makes male rhinos vulnerable in fights. But they are not essential for survival, and, like fingernails, they grow back. As Brazil\u2019s toll passed Italy\u2019s, President Jair Bolsonaro cracked jokes in a 45 minute Facebook broadcast with foreign policy adviser Filipe Martins. During the broadcast, Bolsonaro barely mentioned victims of the virus, choosing instead to attack his political enemies, as well as the protestors who have been mobilising against him. He called demonstrators \u201caddicts\u201d and \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201cfools\u201d. Despite the worsening situation in Brazil, many parts of the region are moving towards reopening, against the advice of most medical experts. Miguel Lago, the director of Brazil\u2019s Institute for Health Policy Studies, said reopening was a mistake that was likely to cause an explosion of infections and pile further pressure on hospitals that were already struggling to cope with the pandemic. \u201cI am very worried \u2026 We are going to witness hospitals collapsing in almost every state,\u201d Lago warned. \u201cI think the worst is still to come.\u201d Coronavirus cases have now been detected in more than 70% of Brazilian cities, with the south-eastern states of Rio and S\u00e3o Paulo particularly badly hit. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. In Brazil, in an online broadcast shortly before the numbers were released, Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro made almost no mention of the victims but continued to publicly attack efforts to slow the advance of coronavirus with quarantine measures and social distancing. \u201cWe can\u2019t go on like this. Nobody can take it anymore,\u201d Bolsonaro said of the shutdown efforts being implemented by state governors and mayors across Brazil. \u201cThe collateral impact will be far greater than those people who unfortunately lost their lives because of these last three months here,\u201d Bolsonaro said. The numbers \u2013 which came after Mexico reported a record daily tally of more than 1,000 deaths on Wednesday \u2013 reinforced fears that Latin America\u2019s two biggest economies, and other countries in the region, were facing a bleak few months. Brazil\u2019s total COVID-19 death toll blew past that of Italy on Thursday, as the Health Ministry reported 1,437 deaths in the last 24 hours and 30,925 additional coronavirus cases. The Latin American nation has now reported 34,021 deaths from the coronavirus, trailing only the United States and the United Kingdom. Patients with high blood pressure admitted to hospital with coronavirus infections are twice as likely to die as those without the condition, researchers said on Friday. For in-patients with the virus who had stopped taking medication for high blood pressure, the risk of dying doubled again, they reported in the European Heart Journal. \u201cIt is important that patients with high blood pressure realise that they are at increased risk of dying from Covid-19,\u201d said senior author Fei Li, a cardiologist at Xijing Hospital in Xian, China. For the study, researchers in China and Ireland retroactively examined cases admitted to Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan between 5 February and 15 March. Nearly 30% - 850 patients - had a history of hypertension, another term for high blood pressure. 4% of those patients died, compared with just over one percent of the 2,027 patients without hypertension. After adjusting for age, sex and other medical conditions, the researchers calculated that having high blood pressure increased the risk of dying two-fold. Mexico\u2019s health ministry reported a record 4,442 additional cases of the novel coronavirus in the country on Thursday, and 816 more deaths, bringing the total to 105,680 cases and 12,545 deaths. Argentina extended on Thursday a mandatory lockdown in Buenos Aires, the capital, and some other parts of the country until 28 June, as confirmed coronavirus cases continue to rise, surpassing 20,000 earlier in the day. The three-week extension of the lockdown, which had been due to expire June 7, will impact the capital city, the province of Buenos Aires and some other areas that account for the highest concentration of confirmed infections, President Alberto Fernandez said during a press conference. The rest of the country will move to a phase of \u201cmandatory and preventive social distancing.\u201d The next phase will include new permissions, including outdoor exercise during certain hours in the city of Buenos Aires, which has the highest concentration of cases, officials said. Argentina recorded 929 new infections on Thursday, one of the highest daily counts since the pandemic began. The country has 20,197 cases, mostly in the city Buenos Aires and the province of Buenos Aires. The death toll is at 608. \u201cOur results are still good, but we have not yet overcome the problem,\u201d Fernandez said. Argentina has been under mandatory lockdown since March 20, though officials already relaxed restrictions in some areas of the country. Argentina has a commercial flight ban until 1 September, one of the world\u2019s strictest travel measures during the pandemic. Mexicans have responded with outrage after a man was found beaten to death hours after he was arrested by police officers for not wearing a face mask in public. Giovanni L\u00f3pez, a 30-year-old bricklayer, was detained on 4 May by municipal police officers in the town of Ixtlahuac\u00e1n de Los Membrillos near Guadalajara. Video of the incident emerged on Wednesday, and shows the police officers with assault rifles forcing L\u00f3pez into a police pickup truck as bystanders plead for his release. \u201cJust for not a wearing a mask?\u201d asks one witness, incredulously. \u201cHe was resisting,\u201d answers an officer. L\u00f3pez\u2019s relatives went looking for him at the police station, but were told he had been taken to a public hospital in Guadalajara. When they reached the hospital they found his dead body. He had a bullet would in his foot, and an autopsy later revealed that he died of a blunt trauma to the head. China reported five new Covid-19 cases and three new asymptomatic infections for June 4, the health commission said on Friday. The National Health Commission said all five of the new cases were imported, involving travellers from overseas. For 3 June, China had reported one confirmed case and four asymptomatic cases. China does not count asymptomatic cases, people who test positive for the coronavirus but do not exhibit Covid-19 symptoms, as confirmed infections. The total number of infections in China stands at 83,027. The death toll remained unchanged at 4,634. There were almost 10,000 unexplained extra deaths among people with dementia in April, according to official figures that have prompted alarm about the severe impact of social isolation on people with the condition. The data, from the Office for National Statistics, reveals that, beyond deaths directly linked to Covid-19, there were 83% more deaths from dementia than usual in April, with charities warning that a reduction in essential medical care and family visits were taking a devastating toll. \u201cIt\u2019s horrendous that people with dementia have been dying in their thousands,\u201d said Kate Lee, chief executive officer at Alzheimer\u2019s Society. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen the devastating effect of coronavirus on people with dementia who catch it, but our [research] reveals that the threat of the virus extends far beyond that.\u201d Charlotte Graham McLay reports from Wellington: As health officials announce each new day of no new Covid-19 cases, social media explodes with New Zealanders celebrating the news. \u201cThat feeling like you got away with something that seemed impossible and you can\u2019t quite believe it even though you want to believe it,\u201d wrote one, on Twitter. \u201cBut for an entire country.\u201d Twenty-two New Zealanders have died of Covid-19, ; thousands have lost their jobs and the nation\u2019s largest export sector, tourism, lies in tatters. But as New Zealanders look to the hundreds of thousands of deaths recorded in other countries, there is a sense that the rest of the world faced a different pandemic, the disastrous scale of which never fully arrived here. Now, providing there are no new and unexpected cases to marr the country\u2019s 13-day streak of zero fresh instances of Covid-19, scientists say they expect to be able to declare next week that the virus has been eliminated from New Zealand \u2013 making it the first country among the OECD group of wealthy nations, and the first country that has recorded more than 100 cases to make such a statement, analysts said. The antiviral drug remdesivir has been recommended for the treatment of Covid-19 patients in Australia, by the national taskforce bringing together the country\u2019s peak health groups. The National Covid-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce said Australian doctors treating adults with moderate, severe or critical Covid-19 should consider using the drug to aid recovery times. The antiviral drug is the first medication to be recommended as a considered treatment for patients treated in hospital after contracting coronavirus. Originally developed for the treatment of Ebola, clinical trials have shown remdesivir may improve recovery time for people with moderate to critical Covid-19 symptoms. The taskforce\u2019s executive director, Associate Professor Julian Elliott, said while it was early days it was a significant step forward. \u201cThis is the first information we have that a drug has a beneficial effect as a treatment for Covid-19,\u201d he said. \u201cThe preliminary data published so far from two clinical trials indicate that it can reduce the time for someone to recover from Covid-19. \u201cHowever, we do not yet have definitive information that remdesivir will reduce the risk of dying from the disease.\u201d The thousands of people protesting the death of George Floyd have a \u201ccivic duty\u201d to be tested for the coronavirus and help New York avoid a spike in new cases as it slowly restarts its economy, Governor Andrew Cuomo said Thursday. There\u2019s widespread concern that people packing in tightly for demonstrations, sometimes without faces coverings, could lead to more Covid-19 cases. Cuomo was particularly concerned about daily mass demonstrations in New York City, which is poised to relax some restrictions amid an intense, monthslong effort to tame the outbreak. \u201cIf you were at a protest, go get a test, please,\u201d Cuomo said at his daily briefing. \u201cThe protesters have a civic duty here also. Be responsible, get a test.\u201d An estimated 20,000 people have demonstrated in New York City alone, the governor said, as he expanded the state\u2019s testing criteria to include people who attended recent protests across the state. Around 30,000 have protested across the state. \u201cNew York City had the highest number of protesters,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWe have to be smart.\u201d South Africa has recorded 3,267 coronavirus cases in 24 hours, the biggest increase since the pandemic hit the country. The country now has a total of 40,792 infections, the health ministry said. It saw a rise of 56 deaths, bring the total to 848. More than half of the cases are in the Western Cape region where health services are under pressure. South Africa is the sub-Saharan African country hardest hit by the pandemic. President Cyril Ramaphosa on March 27 ordered South Africans to observe a lockdown aimed at slowing the disease\u2019s spread. The move sharply limited people\u2019s freedom of movement while slowing an economy already in recession. But Ramaphosa has gradually eased the lockdown measures and allowed most of the economy to restart. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live global coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Helen Sullivan. As always, I welcome your questions, comments and tips on Twitter @helenrsullivan or email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com. South Africa, which has the highest number of coronavirus cases on the continent, has recorded a record increase in confirmed infections, with more than 3,000 in 24 hours. More than half of all cases are in the Western Cape province. The country imposed a strict, nationwide lockdown that included the banning of alcohol and cigarette sales, but has since eased restrictions. Meanwhile in New York, where an estimated 30,000 people joined demonstrations following the death of George Floyd, governor Andrew Cuomo has urged protestors to get tested for coronavirus. \u201cI\u2019m not a nervous Nellie, I\u2019m just looking at the numbers,\u201d he said. \u201cMany wear masks. But there is no social distancing. Police are in their face ... If you were at a protest, get a test, please.\u201d Here are the key developments from the last few hours: South Africa sees record rise in coronavirus cases. South Africa has recorded 3,267 coronavirus cases in 24 hours, the biggest increase since the pandemic hit the country. Africa\u2019s biggest industrial power now has a total of 40,792 infections, the health ministry said. It saw a rise of 56 deaths, bring the total to 848. More than half of the cases are in the Western Cape region where health services are under pressure. New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, urged protestors to get tested for coronavirus, saying several days and nights of demonstrations in the state after the killing of George Floyd could accelerate the spread. He noted that an estimated 30,000 people have protested in the state. Turkey announces weekend lockdown in 15 cities. Turkey will impose a weekend lockdown in 15 cities as part of efforts to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, the interior ministry said.In a statement, the ministry said bakeries and certain shops could operate during the lockdown.Turkey has had 167,410 Covid-19 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. The UK unveiled a $2bn (\u00a31.5bn) fund aimed at ensuring poorer countries can access doses of a potential coronavirus vaccine. The announcement was made at the third Gavi vaccine alliance replenishment summit, a virtual pledging event that raised $8.8bn. The UK\u2019s transport secretary, has announced that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport in England from 15 June. Grant Shapps added that people can be refused permission to travel if they do not comply and could be fined. Low Covid-19 figures for Africa are \u201cbroadly accurate\u201d, the World Health Organization\u2019s director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, has said. There were concerns that low levels of testing, poor infrastructure and a lack of cooperation from some governments may be disguising the true extent of the disease\u2019s spread. US pandemic jobless claims passed 42 million after another 1.9 million people filed for unemployment benefits last week. The pace of layoffs has slowed dramatically from its peak of 6.6m at the start of April as states begin to relax quarantines. Last week was the ninth consecutive week of declines.",
