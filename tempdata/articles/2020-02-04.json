And he is right on that point, even if he is so wrong for any leadership position in very many ways. But if the sports rorts saga has raised any one single question, it is: what is the actual point of the National party these days? Don\u2019t get me wrong. I absolutely see a need for a strong country party. But the National party is not doing the job that a country party needs to do. Rural Australia is experiencing unprecedented conditions including drought and bushfires. Communities and landscapes are running out of water. There are changing global trade conditions challenging those of us in export industries, what with Brexit, the spreading coronavirus and the US-China trade stand off. Rural people are feeling under siege. In some cases they are scared. They need to know rural leaders have their back. They need to know their leaders will be steady and trustworthy. There are farmers and townspeople who have lost everything to the bushfires. There are small towns where they have lost half the houses. Meanwhile Barnaby Joyce is focused on getting his old job back. As one farmer texted on Monday, \u201cfarmers going broke in drought and burning and the idiots are having a chest-pumping competition\u201d. This whole leadership spill was kicked off by the so-called #sportsrorts story, the arc of which is familiar by now. There was clear evidence of a Nationals minister funding less-deserving cases (according to Sport Australia) in marginal Liberal and Labor seats, while doing some of the National party\u2019s most merit-worthy and loyal voters in the eye. After the ballot, McCormack said he did not expect Joyce to challenge again and kept repeating \u2013 like a mantra \u2013 \u201cwe will move on and work hard together\u201d. But the instability will continue. And now McCormack has another putative leader as deputy, David Littleproud. McKenzie was not a leadership threat because she is a senator and could not have visibility as a leader from that house. McCormack has worked hard to keep Littleproud at arm\u2019s length. So with Joyce on one side and Littleproud on the other, McCormack\u2019s job is not going to get any easier. But what is that job exactly? Rural electorates are tinder dry, as dry as the parched paddocks that their voters deal with. As dry as the Australian landscapes that have burned since winter. As Joyce said, the party\u2019s threats include largely state-based parties on the right but also the outbreak of more centrist independents who are agitating for action on the climate crisis. They are making inroads into safe electorates, pushing voters not accustomed to having wide electoral competitions to make a choice. The big take-home lesson from the sports rorts was that these sporting clubs failed to get funding because they were too safe. Nationals have told their voters in no uncertain terms to make them marginal. There are fundamental policy challenges ahead for rural Australia, yet the National party has no answers and has done no work. Their climate change policy is non-existent as farmers increasingly deal with drought, bushfires and floods. Most of their electorates are significant producers of food, yet there is no coherent policy on food production, just plenty of talk about coal. As he resigned from cabinet this week to back Joyce, the former resources minister Matt Canavan said that regional Australians had \u201cstruggled to get our voice heard\u201d and the Nationals needed to stop \u201ccity-based commentators\u201d dominating debates affecting regional constituents, such as the future of coal. Remember last year, under questioning from The Project\u2019s Waleed Aly, McCormack could not think of a single time he backed farmers over miners. This party is about coal. Not food production. Then there is the personality club. Since the rise of Joyce, the party has splintered and factionalised. Joyce has used those factions to his advantage. His challenge was about fulfilling his own ambition. There is no show without Barnaby. As he said before the ballot: \u201cWhat I will look for is the future with the party. Two years out from an election and two years from the previous change and before we go back to parliament, if there is a time for consideration, this is it.\u201d So here is yet another fork in the road \u2013 a chance to consider what we want out of our rural representation. The lesson for rural Australia and for the National party is this: the crossbench has proved the power of independent influence, mustering the major parties by using tight numbers.

The weather chaos in the picturesque Fiordland area of Southland \u2013 at the bottom of the South Island \u2013 hit during the peak summer tourist season and generated a state of emergency for the region. \u201cWe\u2019ve got quite widespread flooding across the whole region,\u201d said Angus McKay, the group controller for Emergency Management Southland. \u201cIt\u2019s exceptional even for a very wet place.\u201d Fiordland is deluged by about 10 metres of rain a year \u2013 and 1.1 metres had fallen in the past three days alone. The tourists stuck in Milford Sound were safest there, McKay said, because so many highways were closed. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of accommodation, plenty of food,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil we can get them out safely there\u2019s no rush with that.\u201d The road the township is located on \u2013 State Highway 94 \u2013 will be closed at least until the weekend and potentially into next week, said New Zealand\u2019s transport agency in a statement. Those who had been rescued by helicopter included travellers stuck on the closed Milford Road, and 31 people who had been spending the night in a Department of Conservation hut for hikers when it was hit by a landslide in the early hours of Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a shock, but everyone seems to have done the right thing,\u201d McKay said. The weather woes came two months after tourists were trapped in Franz Josef, an alpine town further up the South Island, when floods washed out roads there too. At the time, local business owners complained that infrastructure servicing the town, part of a popular tourist region, had not been sufficiently maintained. Tourism operators would struggle with the latest events, said Caroline Orchiston from the Centre for Sustainability at the University of Otago. \u201cThe fact this event is taking place alongside the coronavirus outbreak is especially challenging, given many tourism operators are already experiencing cancellations and business disruption,\u201d she said.",

Two separate evacuation flights have been confirmed by the Australian government, as of Tuesday \u2013 with a potential third to be conducted if the Chinese government approves it. The first flight, from Wuhan to Australia, arrived in China on Monday morning and picked up 243 Australians. It landed in Western Australia that evening, where 241 were then transferred to Christmas Island for a 14-day quarantine period, and a pregnant woman and her partner were transferred to Perth. A second flight was announced on Tuesday, conducted in partnership with the New Zealand government. The Guardian understands it will carry roughly 70 New Zealanders, and 50 Australians, as well as Samoan and Tongan citizens. The flight will land in New Zealand and Australians will then be flown to Christmas Island. A third flight, conducted by the Australian government, is being proposed but is dependent on the approval of the Chinese government.

Guardian Australia has been told of one involving a young mother who was racially abused on a Sydney train. The body representing Australian doctors working in emergency departments called for a calm and fact-based response to the new coronavirus, and to avoid \u201cpanic and division\u201d amid the spread of misinformation. Racist incidents have been reported in the UK, France, Canada and other countries as the number of cases of the novel coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan in China, rises. A Sydney resident, Angela Prendergast, told Guardian Australia she had witnessed and intervened in an incident in which a woman was yelled at and told to stand in the corner of a train because she was \u201cspreading viruses\u201d. Prendergast was on a suburban train on Saturday afternoon when a middle-aged white passenger boarded and began harassing a young Asian-Australian mother who was travelling with her child. \u201cI heard her yelling, saying, \u2018You need to cough over there.

The Australasian College for Emergency Medicine issued a statement on Monday warning against racist responses to the new virus, and advocating a fact-based approach.

In Queensland an image made to look like a Queensland Health warning was circulated, telling residents to avoid \u201call populated areas with Chinese nationals of ratio of 1 to 3 non-Chinese Australians [sic]\u201d. In NSW a viral post circulated claiming that various Asian foods, some of which did not exist, carried the coronavirus.

      "bodyText": "Tomorrow is the first official day of parliamentary proceedings \u2013 we\u2019ll have question time and legislation to discuss, and we\u2019ll probably even manage to get through the day without a leadership spill, so that should be great. Parliament starts at 9, but the blog will be up and running before that, so I do hope you\u2019ll tune in. I\u2019ll need the company and the laughs. A very big thank you to everyone who came along today \u2013 and especially to Mike Bowers, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp for helping me through the mess this morning. Katharine Murphy is in Sydney for a work event but she is, as always, keeping her fingers on the pulse. We\u2019ll wrap up early while we have the chance \u2013 tomorrow we will see a return to the usual scheduling, and who in 2020 knows what that actually means. Thanks again \u2013 and take care of you. Tim Wilson is now getting upset about not being able to give the government talking points on what it is doing on reducing emissions. He is pulled up by Patricia Karvelas for giving \u201ca list\u201d saying her viewers deserve more, but Wilson says that means he won\u2019t be able to answer the question. He then moves on to the Kyoto credits, as Karvelas request: I don\u2019t think we need to use our Kyoto carryover credits. The whole argument about Kyoto carryover credits is frankly absurd. Carryover credits were a condition the Labor party put in, in terms of the negotiations. The whole point of carryover credits is to encourage countries to take action earlier than they commit internationally. Because it means there\u2019s actually value and incentive to do so. Removing it an argument for governments to invest in less reduction. It\u2019s the most bizarre logic I think I have heard. In the end, I don\u2019t think we need to use them. We\u2019ll be in a position to cut our emissions consistent with our international obligations but as I\u2019ve said, if people want to delay and encourage countries not to take action, by scrapping carryover credits, all they\u2019re doing is saying that for accounting purposes, they would rather countries did less. Ed Husic, who looks like he has been put into the ABC\u2019s smaller studio (Tim Wilson is in the big one) also has some things to say about the Nationals\u2019 actions today: Firstly, I would like to have a chance to comment on what\u2019s happened today. I mean, today was about commemorating, it was about respecting, it was about thanking those who fought the bushfires and all we had was this disgraceful self-indulgence from the Nationals that turned this into a farce leading into what was supposed to be a day that all sides of politics got together to talk about the very things just mentioned a few moment ago, the human story of the bushfires and we didn\u2019t have that because of the Nationals. Then you go into a Coalition party room where some of the Nationals want to, including Barnaby Joyce, again, defy community sentiment and the concern that is palpable and real that climate change is having an impact on people\u2019s living environments, it\u2019s impacting on their ability to survive in their areas, and having real life consequences, life and death consequences on people. And they still want to maintain that nothing should be done, very little should be done, on this. And I think, people are saying, loud and clear, as they have for quite some time, one, we should be taking climate change seriously and doing what we can to reduce emissions and to play a part as a nation in tackling this issue. I just think what we saw today, as I said before, was utter disgraceful self indulgence by the Nationals. Tim Wilson is now on Afternoon Briefing on the ABC. He is asked about the Nationals hijacking today \u2013 which was meant to be about the bushfire victims: I suspect they acknowledge it themselves. I don\u2019t think their desire was particularly to deal with this way. But what\u2019s been done has been done. And soon as it\u2019s over, the focus is rightly on bushfire victims, the families, the communities affected by the awful fires over this summer period. A number of members of parliament now are making sure they\u2019re giving speeches, talking about the human stories, families who lost their homes, the small businesses that have lost customers, the communities that have lost much of both their physical and their emotional structures, and the need and necessity to rebuild. And the prime minister, I think, gave a very good speech talking about how today is not the day to talk about policy, as much as possible, the focus should be on the experiences people have had, and what we need to do to make sure we rebuild as a community and a country. For those who wanted to see more of the leaders\u2019 speeches today: Anthony Albanese also gives a hint of where Labor will go this year, in terms of attack: You\u2019ve got pattern of behaviour here \u2013 and interestingly, with the sports rorts saga, you have just such an obvious, blatant, industrial-scale rort, and you have the government saying, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to see here.\u201d You have a government that\u2019s prepared to say, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about what the auditor-general said, we\u2019ll worry about what the prime minister\u2019s former chief of staff says\u201d and continuing to justify this behaviour. \u2026 Even though the government has released its talking points for today to the entire press gallery and everyone else, and I\u2019ve got a copy of that, we tend to not release our tactics pack a day in advance. We\u2019ll have a discussion tomorrow morning, but I would be very surprised if sports rorts don\u2019t get a reasonable run over the next week, and indeed, months, because there has been no transparency here. We still don\u2019t have a list of those clubs that missed out that had high scores in favour of clubs that basically got almost zero \u2013 one club got four out of 100, and got funding, and another club who made an application got 98 and didn\u2019t get funding. So work out that. On the Greens leadership change (Richard Di Natale resigned yesterday, to spend more time with his family), Anthony Albanese tells Patricia Karvelas: Look, our opponent is the coalition, and that is what we\u2019re focused on. The Greens remain essentially a Senate-based party. We\u2019ll see how it works having their only member of the House of Representatives as the leader. But I don\u2019t see that it will make an enormous difference. From time to time, Adam Bandt\u2019s rhetoric is more extreme than Richard Di Natale\u2019s rhetoric was, but we\u2019ll wait and see how that plays out. The truth is that I\u2019m running for Prime Minister against Scott Morrison, not against the Greens or Clive Palmer or One Nation or anyone else. For those desperate to see them. But honestly \u2013 you do see them. They say this stuff almost verbatim. On climate action, Anthony Albanese says: My view is that climate change is a serious issue and the public want action on it. What they want is action that is practical, that makes a difference, that reduces emissions \u2013 that\u2019s what my framework is. They want to see emissions going down, because they understand that also Australia can\u2019t do it by ourselves. Australians want our nation to speak up strongly in international forums \u2013 we\u2019re not doing that at the moment. We went to Madrid and argued for a weaker target, not stronger action, by arguing that somehow you could have carry-over credits and do an accounting trick, rather than actually reduce emissions. But one thing Australians have been doing for some time, Patricia, is voting with their wallets. They\u2019re putting solar panels on their roofs. They\u2019re taking action to reduce their own carbon footprint, because they know that just as good action on climate change is good for jobs, lowers emissions and lowers prices, their own individual action is lowering their household bills as well. Anthony Albanese says he was surprised to not be consulted over the head of the royal commission, given the bipartisan way the parties have been working together on the fires: I am, frankly. I would have thought that common courtesy should mean that that occur. During recent months, the opposition \u2013 we have put forward a range of constructive suggestions. We wrote, of course \u2013 I wrote to the prime minister on 22 November last year, calling for a Coag meeting to get better national coordination, calling for greater involvement of the defence force, calling for economic compensation for volunteer firefighters, for a range of measures including an increase in our aerial firefighting capacity \u2013 all measures that were eventually, with the exception of Coag, the meeting, eventually happened. After \u2013 at the beginning of the process being rejected by the prime minister. Even today sitting in the parliament and the nature of it is something that I wrote to Scott Morrison about at the beginning of January, and called for, so we\u2019ve continued to put forward a constructive suggestion. I would have thought that consultation about the terms of reference was a very basic thing that should happen. Anthony Albanese is speaking to Patricia Karvelas on Afternoon Briefing on the ABC. He is asked about the bushfire royal commission: Well, I think there is some doubt over it, but it is a decision for the government rather than the parliament. Certainly the Prime Minister didn\u2019t have the courtesy of consulting Labor about the appointment of Mark Binskin. He is obviously a very distinguished person, but I would have thought that on an issue like this, the opposition should have been at least consulted. Certainly there is a range of inquiries, there is the official ones from New South Wales and Victoria, but of course the loss of life means that there will be coronial inquiries as well, and we have a range of other reports and inquiries that have been held in the past. What we need to do is to make sure that the starting point is looking at what the recommendations have been, looking forward in terms of what \u2013 what issues might need to be taken up, taken further, and the opposition also hasn\u2019t been consulted on the terms of reference. So we\u2019ll wait and see what the terms of reference of any such royal commission would be. Hilariously, a lot of One Nation\u2019s policies also fall under the umbrella of socialism. No one tell them. The PMO talking points, which go out to ministers and MPs as a \u201cthis is what you need to say in answer to any questions on these topics\u201d have been found for today. No big red flags so far \u2013 it is as you would expect \u2013 and the government loves when we run its talking points, so you won\u2019t get giant slabs Greg Hunt has thanked New Zealand for its assistance in evacuating Australians from Wuhan: Immediately prior to coming here, the advice I had at this stage we\u2019re anticipating over 50 Australians. And again, special thanks to New Zealand for their cooperation. And the advice I have is that if they are to come to Australia, if they\u2019re not housed in New Zealand, then again, prior to coming here, the anticipated plan is we\u2019ll be supporting them on Christmas Island. The UK\u2019s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, is on their way for a visit. From Marise Payne: It is Mr Raab\u2019s first overseas trip since the UK left the European Union on Saturday, in a clear demonstration of the strength of the enduring partnership between our two countries. With the UK\u2019s exit from the EU, we enter a new era of strategic and economic cooperation. There is much to discuss, and to look forward to, in deepening our relationship, not least a comprehensive and ambitious free trade agreement. Together, Australia and the UK will continue to protect and promote the rules-based international order, in the face of an increasingly complex strategic environment. We will find new opportunities for enhanced engagement with the UK in the Indo-Pacific, including on infrastructure, development, security and promoting human rights and the rule of law. We will strengthen our cooperation in the Pacific, harnessing the growth of both our diplomatic footprints in the region. Despite our geographic distance, we have clear strategic interests in common, including a secure and prosperous Indo-Pacific. Australia is ready to launch negotiations on a high-quality UK FTA as soon as the UK is in a position to do so. We want to pursue an agreement that creates new commercial opportunities for Australian exporters and further deepens investment ties with our fourth-largest source of foreign direct investment. Australia is grateful for the support and solidarity the UK has shown us during our ongoing bushfire crisis. A UK team was in Australia in January to look at how best to assist with our recovery and how we might cooperate on managing future fire seasons. Such help, readily offered between close friends, epitomises the enduring partnership between our two nations. Jim Chalmers has responded to the RBA rate decision \u2013 it remains unchanged at 0.75%. Interest rates are just a quarter of what they were during the depths of the Global Financial Crisis and yet the Morrison Government continues to leave all the heavy lifting to the Reserve Bank. In his statement today, the RBA Governor noted that \u201cThe household sector has been adjusting to a protracted period of slow wages growth\u201d which \u201cis expected to remain at around its current rate for some time yet\u201d. Australians are struggling, weak consumption is being driven by stagnant wages, household debt is at record highs, almost two million Australians are looking for work or for more work, but the Liberals and Nationals have no plan to turn things around. For too long the Prime Minister and Treasurer have recklessly left the Reserve Bank to do all the work instead of coming up with a plan to support the economy. Greg Hunt has an update on the coronavirus situation: ... It remains there are 12 confirmed cases in Australia. Two in South Australia, two in Queensland, four in Victoria, and four in New South Wales. And three of those in New South Wales are clear of the virus and have been discharged. As the cases of suspected or potential coronavirus emerge, they\u2019re being tested by the state authorities. I want to thank and acknowledge the work of all the state and territory authorities. I want to give a status on the flight from Christmas Island, and I have just been briefed prior to coming in, into this room, by the head of the National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre. They run the Ausmat team, the Australian medical assistance team, on the ground on Christmas Island and was part of the flight crew attending to passengers. All travellers, I\u2019m advised, are examined, have been examined, and there are no cases of confirmed coronavirus. Fourteen were looked at more closely to ensure they were in an acceptable condition and they have now all been cleared of the virus. A further two are being tested as a precaution. The advice from the Ausmat team on the ground is, however, they regard the likelihood, or the probability, of coronavirus in that case as being minimal, but nevertheless they are being tested. A pregnant woman and her partner on the flight are now in isolation in Perth. That sort of glowing tribute from a resources lobby group is to be expected \u2013 you may remember the first time Matt Canavan resigned from cabinet (during the section 44 stuff) he said it had been an \u201chonour to represent the mining sector\u201d. The Minerals Council of Australia have released a statement, paying tribute to Matt Canavan: Senator Canavan delivered untiring and passionate support for Australia\u2019s minerals companies and workforce and regional communities as a Cabinet Minister in the Morrison Government. He worked closely with the MCA and our member companies to secure and maintain the growth and success of Australia\u2019s resources industry to create new jobs, strengthen regional communities and drive economic growth. In particular, mine workers from pits to ports across the country appreciated Senator Canavan\u2019s staunch support for their jobs and industry. Most recently, he established the Critical Minerals Facilitation Office to help Australia become a global supplier of rare earths and critical minerals. Advances in computing, manufacturing, energy and transport are being made possible by critical minerals found in Australia. The next minister for resources and northern Australia will have big shoes to fill as they build on Senator Canavan\u2019s passionate advocacy for the development of Australia through a globally competitive and sustainable minerals sector. Back to China\u2019s response to Australia\u2019s travel ban, this is what the embassy official had to say about why Beijing believes its citizens should be compensated: I mean, if, for example, they suffer if they suffer a loss, for the rejection by February 2, they were rejected, they have to pay their ticket back but they were not properly alerted on February 1 \u2013 it\u2019s not reasonable, right? But if, after February 2, I think most students and Chinese citizens learned about the restriction measures. It\u2019s not technically feasible to enact a decree on the day of its announcement. We understand the anxiety of the Australian government and society but, for measures, they need to be reasonable. Under preventative measures, actually we think WHO \u2013 when it announced this coronavirus epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern, it didn\u2019t recommend any restrictions over international travel and trade. Actually, it opposes such measures. We are not happy that United States took the lead in enacting such a strict restriction measures over Chinese citizens. The RBA has held interest rates at 0.75% [cont from previous post] It is also understood that in the earlier meeting of Liberal MPs, MP for the Queensland seat of Bowman, Andrew Laming, slapped down other conservative MPs for publicly denying the science of climate change. Morrison thanked local MPs for being there for Australians who were doing it tough as a result of the summer bushfire crisis and said today\u2019s sitting of parliament was a \u201csolemn\u201d occasion to acknowledge those affected by fires. \u201cThey are our absolute focus going into this year,\u201d Morrison said. Following the turmoil in the Nationals party room, Morrison also urged harmony between the Liberals and Nationals, saying they had joined forces to \u201cdo things together\u201d. \u201cAustralians demand us to continue to be a team working together. Together is how each of us can best serve this country. McCormack acknowledged that many people were hurting, but regional Australia was full of \u201cstrong people who would bounce back\u201d. \u201cRegional Australia is not broken \u2026 they need our support and strength in line with their own strength.\u201d Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the government focus was on stable economic management to ensure the country \u201cgot through these tough times\u201d to deliver the support that people needed. There was also general discussion on the government\u2019s response to fires, the problems in the tourism sector as a result of the fires and the response to coronavirus. Nationals and Liberal MPs met this morning following the Nationals ballot, which saw Michael McCormack survive the challenge from Joyce and elected David Littleproud as deputy leader. Matt Canavan addressed the partyr oom after resigning his position from cabinet, telling colleagues he would not be seeking reappointment and extending his congratulations to McCormack and Littleproud. He used his speech to thank the party room fo the \u201chonour\u201d of serving in cabinet and said he was proud of the work he had been able to achieve in the resources portfolio. He also said he believed the Coalition parties had become the party for workers. \u201cWe have become the party of workers, workers in coalmines, workers in shipyards and workers in factories,\u201d Canavan said. \u201cWe represent those people by fighting for their jobs, and defending their jobs.\u201d Joyce also spoke. He said the leadership vote was part of the Westminster system, but he was pleased it was short and we could all move on. He added that he had faced fire and drought in his communities, and warned that some people were pursuing \u201creactionary\u201d policies, which he described as \u201cpushing their hobby-horse issues out of tragedy\u201d. The comments formed part of a broader partyroom discussion on climate change, with several MPs expressing the view that more ambition on climate change was needed. Those speaking strongly in favour of the need and importance of embracing new technologies included Katie Allen, Tim Wilson, Fiona Martin and Trent Zimmerman. Nationals MP George Christensen was the strongest voice against more ambitious climate action. The argument was put that the government needed to be \u201cmindful\u201d of the impact on regional jobs of any change to climate change policy, particularly in seats which had supported the Coalition at the last election. The official goes on to say China expects \u201cproper compensation\u201d for those caught up in the ban: Over the past few days, we were in close touch with Home Affairs, Foreign Affairs, DFAT, Immigration, and most of our Australian counterparts are quite cooperative. They understand the situation of those students. So that\u2019s why most of them were cleared and they entered Australia and they will abide by and follow the recommendations of the health authorities. At the same time, we are very concerned about the interests of the Chinese students who will not be able to come Australia over the next 14 days \u2013 12 days, actually. We are in touch with the universities and also with the education ministry to sort out a proper solution for these students. We hope their rights and interests will be safeguarded, including proper expansion of visa if the validity is over, and also maybe proper compensation for some of the financial losses during this period. A Chinese embassy official has given journalists an update on China\u2019s reaction to the coronavirus. (I missed his name at the beginning of the briefing, so apologies.) He spoke a little about Australia\u2019s travel ban and how that has affected some Chinese citizens, including students. The key takeaway: China is not happy with how it has been handled. It is the Australian government who made the decision, those restriction measures, and on February 1, after the announcement, there are still some people who already departed from China and, on February 2, about \u2013 some say 50, some say 70 people, most of them are students \u2013 were stranded in the airport in Sydney, Brisbane, and some in Melbourne. We are not happy about this situation because they were not alerted \u2013 there\u2019s not enough time to be alerted about the restriction. We get in touch with relevant authorities and ministries. As far as I know, most of them are finally cleared. Of course, we encourage all the Chinese citizens, the students, who entered Australia after February 1 to abide by the measures that\u2019s suggested by the Australian government, including the self-isolation measures. But at the same time, we hope their legitimate right and the interest will be secured. But there are still a number of people who are still stranded in Brisbane, and a few of them were actually already sent back to China, for which we are not pleased about what happened, because they were not alerted about the restrictions. Matt Canavan, who started yesterday by publicly committing to Michael McCormack as leader, before ending the day resigning from cabinet to support Barnaby Joyce as leader, has released a statement saying he will \u201cnow commit to supporting Michael and the Coalition as a senator for Queensland\u201d. For those who like the procedural side of things, there is the motion, supported by all sides, to suspend parliament procedures for today\u2019s bushfire condolence motion: Kristina Keneally is calling on the government to allow temporary migrants and backpackers to volunteer in bushfire zones, given that many won\u2019t be able to work in the regions because of the bushfire emergency, which could have a massive impact on their visa status in that they could lose it. Sarah Martin has just alerted me to more South Australian Liberal fights, as reported by InDaily: Several sources have confirmed that assembled Right members voted to exclude Barker MP Tony Pasin, Boothby\u2019s Nicolle Flint and recently-elected Senator Alex Antic from future meetings \u2013 effectively purging them from the Liberal Right. The trio, whom sources described as from the \u201cHard Right\u201d, are in Canberra this week and did not attend the meeting, although it\u2019s understood they were offered the chance to take part in a teleconference. Pasin did not respond to questions except to say: \u201cThere was a meeting last evening [and] we indicated we weren\u2019t in a position to participate.\u201d Neither Antic nor Flint responded to inquiries. You can read the article here Looks like Simon Birmingham is pushing to move the SA Libs back to the centre quite hard - and winning. So far. The Nationals president Larry Anthony just had a chat to Lucy Barbour on the ABC about the leadership spill this morning: I agree it wasn\u2019t good timing, I accept that and I do hope from right now, as they move forward to this day, which is a very important day, as you point out, to the condolences for those people who have lost their lives and lost their homes today. Look, it is messy. Sometimes democracy is messy. But this is what happened today, and we have a clear result now for Michael McCormack. On the question of whether or not he thinks there would be another spill, Anthony says: Look, I can\u2019t mind read into the ambitions of people. I certainly think in the short-term, absolutely not. I mean, there\u2019s been a decision made today. I think it\u2019s been accepted. One of the tragedies, I think, out of this, is that we\u2019ve lost Matt Canavan. And I think that he did the honorable thing yesterday - a very capable minister. But nevertheless, he\u2019s still in the Parliament and he\u2019ll continue to make a major contribution. What does Anthony think that contribution will be? Well, I think that they\u2019ll have a lot more time on their hands. I think you\u2019ve got two former Cabinet ministers in Bridget McKenzie and of course Matt Canavan, so I think that they\u2019ll apply themselves to the parliamentary places, to representing those regions. So they\u2019ll still be very active. But they are eight not going to have portfolio roles. It turns out that Black Summer is already the name of a Netflix zombie apocalypse series where \u201ccomplete strangers band together to find the strength they need to survive and get back to loved ones\u201d. It has just been pointed out that, right now, the Nationals have no ministerial representation in the Senate \u2013 the first time that has happened in 15 years. It\u2019s the Nationals centenary this year. It\u2019s going well. Scott Morrison spoke about this in his speech: The generosity of the rest of the world was also so humbling. Seventy nations offered us assistance. Over 300 firefighters sent from the United States, Canada and to New Zealand, to whom we are so grateful. We also had offers of assistance from the UAE, which is greatly appreciated. Military assistance from New Zealand, the United States, Indonesia, Malaysia, Korea, Singapore, Japan, our wonderful family in PNG and Fiji. When the 54 engineers from the Republic of Fiji military forces arrived in Melbourne, they placed their hands over their heart and they sang a hymn, \u201cAngels Watching Over Me\u201d, and they have been to us. Our Pacific family has been so incredibly generous. Labor caucus also discussed the legislative agenda, resolving to support a range of non-controversial government bills. However it will oppose the government\u2019s move to overhaul the family court system \u2013 first flagged by Christian Porter in 2018 \u2013 and the Coalition\u2019s revamped Ensuring Integrity bill. Caucus resolved to support changes to the research and development tax incentive in the House, but the party will reserve its final position until the Senate economics committee reports on the bill. Various views were put forward by MPs, including concern about how it might affect technology start-ups, and Australia\u2019s very low rate of research and development spending (1.8%) compared to the best practice of 4% in some countries. Another MP said there was a \u201chuge political opportunity\u201d to campaign on the issue, given its importance to the manufacturing industry. There was also some discussion about government plans to allow employees to opt out of the superannuation fund nominated in workplace agreements \u2013 often at the behest of unions \u2013 with shadow minister for financial services, Stephen Jones, saying the party was considering amendments. In the discussion of the bushfires, several MPs spoke about the impact on their communities, including Susan Templeman (Macquarie), Fiona Phillips (Gilmore) and Mike Kelly (Eden Monaro). Kelly said his local economy had been \u201csmashed\u201d by the fire crisis, and also expressed concern about the lack of a national climate change policy. In response, Anthony Albanese said a climate change policy would deliver \u201cmore jobs, lower emissions and lower prices\u201d. Michael McCormack is the first to go the \u201ccurrent fire season is not without precedent\u201d line. Sigh. As it does, of course, we consider what has been done well and what we can do better to protect even more lives and assets into the future. I know there are things we can and must do. This must be our focus in the months and weeks ahead. There is a legitimate policy debate to be continued. I fully accept that climate change is an important part of this. There is no single cause for the fires. I know that fuel loads and build-up must be part of our forward thinking. I stress again the actions of arsonists warrant strong discipline to discourage a repeat of such dangerous antisocial, life-threatening behaviours. This current fire season is not without precedent. We know that we\u2019ve had fires in this nation before. These have been dreadful, though. There is much to be done. Communication from fire authorities in the various states through communities and emergency service personnel has been consistently strong. We thank them for that. Of course, there is also room for improvement, but I believe our forebears would be proud of just how much we\u2019ve made the most of modern technology to keep people alert to trends, to help preparation for the fire when it does arrive. Michael McCormack is up now, and he\u2019ll be followed by Richard Marles. Then we have speeches from MPs whose electorates were directly impacted by the fires. And then the rest of the night will speeches from all other parliamentarians \u2013 practically everyone is on the list \u2013 but they will be limited to about five minutes or so, so parliament doesn\u2019t go until 2am. There was one direct mention* in Anthony Albanese\u2019s speech. He said this: So what now? Yes, fire is part of who we are. Our recorded history is heavy with its grim poetry. Ash Wednesday, Black Friday, Red Tuesday, Black Saturday, but we are at a turning point. This is not business as usual. This is not even fire as usual. We can no longer fall back on the poetry of Dorothea MacKellar and comfort ourselves with the thought that it\u2019s always been like this, that this is the price we pay for living on a beautiful but sometimes harsh and unforgiving continent. Nor can we soften reality with the fiction that we had no way of predicting this. We have no choice but to turn to face the harsh new reality, the scale and intensity of the fires has been unprecedented. But the responses to the fire from our fellow Australians has been completely as expected. There has been toughness, resilience, generosity and, amazingly, through it all, there has been a sense of humour. All of these qualities have been put to the test during this time of fire and Australians have shown their true character. In this time of upheaval, the only certainty we have is that they will be tested again. We must be ready *This has been amended from an earlier post, which said there was no direct mention of climate change. My fault, as I missed it in the transcribing. Anthony Albanese has also thanked David Littleproud for his handling of the crisis: I want to acknowledge the fact that Minister Littleproud has returned every call and has responded to every request that I have made, which has been pretty regular, it\u2019s got to be said, working with our shadow minister, Murray Watt. We are guided by a single thought, that, as Australians, we are all in this together. Working together is our only way forward. I have every confidence that, as Australians, that is what we will do. Scott Morrison has termed the bushfire emergency \u201cBlack Summer\u201d. In past times, when Australia has been tested by fire, we have given the fires a name, based on the name of the day or locality. Black Thursday, in 1851, Black Friday in 1939, Ash Wednesday in 1983, the Canberra bushfires of 2003, and Black Saturday in 2009 \u2013 just saying these words brings back such chilling memories. This year, we have faced, and we are still facing, a terrible season of fire, national in scale, fires that reached our highest mountain range and our longest beaches, fires that consumed forests, grasslands and farms, suburbs, and villages, fires that jumped rivers and highways, fires where days became night, and the night sky turned red, fires that raged into the heavens as clouds of fire \u2013 with it all, a merciless smoke that lingered across our cities, fires that still burn. And the smoke from burnt bushland that left an oppressive tightening in our chest told us that all was not right. This is the Black Summer of 2019-20, that has proven our national character and resolve, a national trauma best described by Indigenous leaders, who love our land so much, as a grief for the victims, a heartache for our wildlife, and broken heart for the scouring of our land. These fires are yet to end and danger is still before us in many, many places, but today we together to mourn, honour, reflect and begin to learn from the Black Summer that continues. And to give thanks for the selflessness, the courage, and the sacrifice and generosity that met these fires time and again and continue to. Many of the stories of our Black Summer we will never know. Anthony Albanese has begun his speech. Both leaders have paid tribute to those who died in the fires, and the firefighters \u2013 professional and volunteers \u2013 who continued to head out day after day. Scott Morrison finished his speech with some information on the royal commission which has been called to look at the bushfires: The royal commission will be led by former chief of the defence force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin AC and will shine a light on what needs to be done to make our country safer and our communities more resilient. We owe it to those we have lost. We owe it to those who have fought these fires. We owe it to our children, and the land itself, to learn from the lessons that are necessary. Mr Speaker, over a century ago, Henry Lawson wrote a poem about a bushfire in a place called Dingo Scrub. \u201cIt is daylight again and the fire has passed, and the black scrub silent and grim. Except for the blaze of an old dead tree or the crash of a falling limb.\u201d In his reminiscence, he writes about three men who wipe away tears of smoke and put themselves in harm\u2019s way to save a family and when the fire has passed, he writes of the men: \u201cWhen they\u2019re wanted again, in Dingo Scrubs, they\u2019ll be there to do the work.\u201d And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll all do, here in this house and across Australia, to do the work, to do the work of recovery to build back better. To do the work of learning, to do the work of repairing shattered hearts, broken communities. That is what we owe our country. That is what we owe each other. Australians are overcomers. Despite the scale of this disaster and the tragedies, Australia is not and will never be overwhelmed. As we face the challenges that remain active, as we confront and face the devastating drought, compounded in so many places by these fires, as we confront and contain the challenge of the fire risk that threatens the world, Australians will not be overwhelmed. We will overcome, as our national anthem encourages us with courage all, let us proclaim, advance Australia fair. So I conclude in memorial, I conclude in thanks, I conclude in honour to those we have lost, and the deepest of our sympathies and condolences to you and we just simply hope and pray that, as we\u2019ve gathered here today to acknowledge your great loss and the heroes you have lost, that this will make your journey just that little bit easier. Scott Morrison has just concluded his speech on the bushfire emergency after speaking for about 20 minutes. To my count there was one mention of climate change in the speech, which came towards the end here: Mr Speaker, following a national disaster of this magnitude, we must also heed the lessons. These fires have been be fuelled one by one of the worst droughts on record. Changes in our climate and a build-up in fuel amongst other factors. Our summers are getting longer, drier and hotter. That\u2019s what climate change does. And that requires a new responsiveness, resilience and an invigorated focus on adaptation. Today, I\u2019ve written to the premiers and chief ministers to seek their feedback on a draft terms of reference for a royal commission that I have flagged now for several weeks along the terms that I\u2019ve outlined in public. Mike Bowers has had to head to Sydney for a work engagement Over in the Senate, Bridget McKenzie has been confirmed as the Nationals senate leader. Matt Canavan will be her deputy. The Labor side of the Senate laughed at this news. Scott Morrison is delivering his condolence speech on the bushfires. I\u2019ll bring you some of that in a moment. Parliament has begun \u2013 prayers offered and now we move into the condolence motion for the bushfire victims. The rest of the day will be speeches. Anthony Albanese has addressed MPs in Canberra for the first caucus meeting of 2020. The opposition leader began by reflecting on the summer break and the widespread criticism of Morrison\u2019s leadership during the bushfire crisis. We were not critical of his trip to Hawaii but people were deeply critical of his claim that people wanted to be fighting fires. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like the behaviour of Morrison. He forced a woman to shake his hand and then turned his back on her.\u201d On sports rorts, Albanese said it was an \u201coutrage and a scandal\u201d and referred to projects that missed out, as well as our story about the rugby club that received a grant despite not having a women\u2019s team. Albanese also criticised the prime minister for relying on the report of Philip Gaetjens and not the auditor general\u2019s report in his assessment of Bridget McKenzie\u2019s conduct. Labor will pursue the issue in parliament this week. Following a briefing of MPs by the chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, Labor MPs discussed the issue of coronavirus. The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said he had sought information from the government about the economic impact of the virus and the travel ban, while Bill Shorten raised concerns about racism directed at Chinese Australians. Pretty much, yup Looks like there will be a second Australian flight from Wuhan The bells are about to ring, bringing parliament back for 2020. I mean, Belgium once went 589 days without a government and it seemed to do OK, but you know, democracy. Barnaby Joyce has released his statement: I would like to congratulate Michael McCormack in winning the leadership ballot and by so doing re-endorsement of his position as leader of the Nationals party. It is appropriate that if an issue needs resolving as to contentions held, there is a procedure to resolve it as is noted in our parliamentary system. That process has been followed and the issue is finalised. This was made as brief as possible prior to the first sitting of parliament for the year. I support the vote of the room and will strive for the re-election of a Morrison McCormack government as this is definitely the better outcome for Australia and especially of regional people. Now my first attentions go back to where they were before this week, the New England, drought, fires and now the threat of coronavirus. The RBA will make its interest rate decision today. It will most likely remain stable. It\u2019s a big week for the RBA governor though. Phil Lowe has the interest rate decision today, the Press Club address in Sydney tomorrow and on Friday it is the quarterly statement on monetary policy \u2013 and Lowe will also appear in front of the parliamentary economics committee. Barnaby Joyce is expected to issue a statement in the very near future. That leaves Matt Canavan to say and talk to whomever he wants about whatever he wants. The cabinet muzzle is off. Bridget McKenzie is reportedly the Nationals Senate leader, according to three Nationals MPs I have just spoken to. The parliament will sit at 12 \u2013 it is a day of ceremony and condolence. So there won\u2019t be any question time or legislation entered today. That fun starts tomorrow. Then we have another week of sittings next week, followed by a week\u2019s break, and then a second sitting fortnight. So plenty more days for these guys to blow up the show in another way. Adam Bandt on the Greens priorities under his leadership: A Green New Deal is a government-led plan of investment and action to build a clean economy and a caring society. And these two elements of a Green New Deal \u2013 government taking the lead to create new jobs and industries, and universal services to ensure that no one is left behind \u2013 are the values that I have been fighting for my whole adult life. I joined the Labor party at high school, and I left at university because Labor started putting up fees for education and putting people into so much debt. It was inconsistent with my values. It meant that people like my father, who was the first person in his family to go to university, were going to face barriers that no one should have to face. As a lawyer, I fought big corporations on behalf of clothing outworkers, and also represented firefighters and even coal workers battling with privatisation. And in my seat of Melbourne we have brought together people from public housing to young families, and that is what a Green New Deal is going to do as well. Because it provides a vision of the country that takes on the challenges that we are facing, that everyone is able to get behind. And we\u2019re going to talk a bit more about the Green New Deal and how it addresses these climate crises, the jobs crisis and the inequality crisis, over the coming months. But let me just give you three things at the moment that I\u2019ll be fighting for as part of the Green New Deal: first is get dental into Medicare. That is unfinished business for us in the power-sharing parliament back in 2010. We managed to get dental into Medicare for kids, and we need to do it for everyone across the country. Second, make education genuinely free. And the first cab off the rank for us at the moment is going to be targeting those fees that people who are sending their kids to public schools are being forced to pay. Adam Bandt: We are facing a climate emergency, a jobs crisis, an inequality crisis, and the government\u2019s only response is to shrug and say, \u201cWell, get used to it, because this is the new normal.\u201d Well, I refuse to adapt to kids wearing gas masks. I refuse to accept a society where people put off having children because they are feeling so insecure about their jobs and their life. And I refuse to accept people living in poverty in a country as wealthy as ours. And I refuse to accept the dismal standard of this government, led by Scotty from marketing, whose love of coal has contributed to these fires that we are seeing at the moment, and the climate emergency we are facing. And I refuse to accept the dismal standard of a Labor so-called opposition who chooses the middle of bushfires to celebrate coal, and who votes with the Liberals to give tax cuts to millionaires. We are a smart and wealthy country, and if we have the guts to take on the big corporations and the weak politicians that they have in their pocket, we can solve these crises. We need a Green New Deal. Adam Bandt: A couple of weeks ago, when I dropped my kids off at childcare, the air was so dangerous that the warning on my phone showed someone wearing a gas mask. Summer is going from a time to relax to being a time where people fear for their life and their health. People are angry and anxious because it is clear that the government does not have the climate emergency under control and has no plan to get it under control. But people are also anxious and angry because, in this country, the basics of life are no longer guaranteed. Go to Tafe, go to university, study hard, and you could find yourself underemployed in a job with insecure hours and low wages. Get yourself a job and you can find yourself unable to afford a house because the government has rigged the market against you. We are becoming a country where, even if you do the things that everyone has asked of you, you are no longer guaranteed a good life. Not exactly a happy camper \u2013 Barnaby Joyce captured by Mike Bowers. Winners aren\u2019t grinners. The numbers being floated in the Nationals leadership spill \u2013 11 to 10 \u2013 are coming from Barnaby Joyce\u2019s camp, which is obviously invested in keeping the rumblings going. We don\u2019t know the actual numbers because the whip hasn\u2019t released them. Michael McCormack\u2019s camp disputes the numbers. But they don\u2019t know them either. They have put the numbers more at 15 to 6 It would be much easier if the whip just announced it. Outside the parliament, there is a people\u2019s rally for the climate. The speaker\u2019s list is as follows: 10.30: Rebekha Sharkie, fed. Indep. MP, SA 10.45: Zali Steggall fed. Indep. MP, NSW; petition presentation from Natasha Deen, Save our Oceans 11:15: Mark Butler, fed. ALP MP, SA; former Minister for Climate Change, 2013 TBA - Mehreen Faruqi, Greens Senator for NSW 11.30*: Adam Bandt, Greens climate crisis spokesperson *Bandt has moved from 11am to 11.30 because of his press conference One Nation has not changed leaders in the past two years. Who would have thunk it. From Adam Bandt\u2019s statement (which was put out VERY quickly, pointing to the Greens knowing pretty early that there was only ever going to be one candidate for the leadership position): \u201cWe are in the middle of a climate emergency and long running jobs and inequality crises. People are angry and anxious because the government has no plan for the big problems facing the country. \u201cThat is why Australia needs a Green New Deal. \u201cA Green New Deal means government leading the country in transforming our economy, creating new jobs and industries powered by clean energy and delivering universal services like dental into Medicare and genuinely free education. This is what I will be fighting for. \u201cWe are a smart and wealthy country and if we have the guts to take on the big corporations and the weak politicians they have in their pockets, we can solve the problems we face. \u201cI call on everyone, but particularly young Australians, to join our movement for a Green New Deal so together we can fight to save the future.\u201d Adam Bandt has called his first media conference as leader: Adam will use his first media conference as leader to call for a government-led Green New Deal to tackle the climate emergency and the jobs and inequality crises. Adam will also make a strong pitch to young people to join the movement for a Green New Deal. That will be at 10.45. The Nationals are still working out who their Senate leader will be. So Nick McKim snuck in there as a surprise third candidate for the second deputy spot \u2013 he beat out both Sarah Hanson-Young and Mehreen Faruqi. Larissa Waters will be the Greens Senate leader and co-deputy. The second deputy is Nick McKim. We are still waiting on the Greens to emerge from its party room \u2013 the hold-up is the deputy decision. Adam Bandt is the leader (uncontested). The deputy fight is between Larissa Waters (a pretty sure bet) and then Sarah Hanson-Young and Mehreen Faruqi for the second deputy spot. Just a clarification on the Matt Canavan lower house tilt I mentioned a few posts below. Nothing is confirmed \u2013 it is all just Queensland chatter at the moment. I spent a few weeks in the greatest nation on earth over the summer (bung lungs meant I actually couldn\u2019t breathe in Canberra) and that is what the LNP was talking about. But nothing would happen (if it does) until a general election. We are not going to see a byelection. The LNP were also talking about the ongoing battle between Amanda Stoker and James McGrath for the one Liberal spot (even if Canavan leaves the Senate ticket, it is a Nationals spot) \u2013 that, too, is a very interesting and long-term fight. Who ever loses that has a choice: try to rebrand as a National (not fondly looked upon) or try for the lower house. If I was Andrew Laming, I would be keeping an eye on that. I just checked in \u2013 the AFP has still not decided whether or not to take up the Angus Taylor investigation. So with Bridget McKenzie out of cabinet, along with Matt Canavan, that opens two spots. Darren Chester will move up. He wanted emergency services so I think he\u2019ll probably get that, after his performance during the fires in his electorate and his unwavering backing of Michael McCormack. Keith Pitt is a strong chance for a look-in. David Littleproud is a chance to get agriculture back. He lost it to McKenzie in the reshuffle \u2013 and was sidelined by McCormack, so don\u2019t expect that to be an easy relationship. Michelle Landry is in line for a junior ministry. She was a Barnaby Joyce backer who fell in under McCormack\u2019s leadership early and hasn\u2019t budged. Michael McCormack claims it is over. (cue side eye lols) I think we need to draw a line in the sand and concentrate on the fire victims. There\u2019s been many who have lost loved ones. Our thoughts go to them. There\u2019s been many who lost their businesses, their homes, lost their farms. That\u2019s the people we\u2019re going to be concentrating on. I think today is a day where we reflect upon those. We concentrate on what we need to do for the recovery efforts, the relief efforts and providing, continuing to provide, the assistance we have already done and to that end, I know the government has acted very responsibly, very quickly, to help those fire victims and we will continue to do that. This clean-up is not going to take weeks or months, it\u2019s going to take years. The National party, the government, will be there for those people. You know the problem with lines in the sand? They are very, very easily brushed over. It seemed those prayers worked this morning \u2013 Scott Morrison will absolutely be breathing a sigh of relief after that result. On the question of Matt Canavan? Matt Canavan has resigned as resources minister, I wish him the best,\u201d says Michael McCormack. So he\u2019s out of the cabinet. Keith Pitt is probably the big winner out of that. But then they have to do something with the women as well, because \u2013 they\u2019ve just lost one. Michelle Landry is the obvious choice \u2013 and that will see two Queenslanders moved up, as well as Littleproud as leader. But Susan McDonald \u2013 another Queenslander \u2013 is an emerging talent in the Senate. Keep an eye on her. Michael McCormack on whether he expects Barnaby Joyce to challenge again: No, I don\u2019t expect him to. I\u2019ve been endorsed as leader. I was endorsed as leader when we came back here after the May election last year I was endorsed as leader when he stood down in 2018. That\u2019s three times in less than two years. I think that is enough to warrant me leading the party going forward. But there are plenty of people in the Nationals who are swearing that Michael McCormack won\u2019t survive as leader for much longer \u2013 they are all in the Barnaby camp, obviously \u2013 but still. It\u2019s not going to be fun for him. Maybe he\u2019ll finally develop a personality in all of this. Over in the Greens, Adam Bandt is the only person who has nominated for leader. Paul Karp is outside the room \u2013 he is hearing that there may be a leader in the Senate who will be deputy leader. Discussions are still being held on whether there is a second deputy leader. Michael McCormack is pissed: I\u2019d like to thank the entire National party team, and I know they will now unite. We had way too much media speculation, way too much speculation in general, about the leadership role. It\u2019s time to put all that to bed. I would also say to the media \u2013 sometimes, I think, that there\u2019s been media speculation heightened only by stories that were, quite frankly, untrue, quite frankly, backgrounding, if they\u2019re not prepared to put their name to it, I don\u2019t understand why it actually makes the paper. If people are going to be \u2013 I\u2019ve been upfront \u2013 if ever I said anything to to a journalist, I asked them to put my name to it. That\u2019s the way I am and that\u2019s the way I think we need to go forward. We need to unite, we will unite. The people of regional Australia come first, not us. We\u2019re sent here to do the job and we will do that. Basically \u2013 you can put your bread away. Michael McCormack stays. It doesn\u2019t look like it was an overwhelming win, though. Ten to 11 is what I have been told \u2013 but that is probably based on their estimates. David Littleproud: This is a proud day for me. I joined this great party 22 years ago, in my electorate, the little town of Stanthorpe. I believe very much in the values of the National party. This is about hope, this is about vision for our people in regional and rural Australia. This is about now back to business. The shenanigans are over, it\u2019s time to get back to looking after those people that are facing drought, that have faced up to the fires. It\u2019s time for us to focus on them, not us. The party has to focus on that. We will, we have a commitment from everyone in the room, that we have a responsibility as being elected from regional and rural Australia, to stand here to be their hope in Canberra, to be able to articulate clearly their needs and wants and their desires because regional and rural Australia has a great future. The story of regional and rural Australia and particularly of agriculture is just to have rain. It will rain. We shouldn\u2019t talk ourselves down. There\u2019s been too much of that. We\u2019re doing it tough, yes, in some parts but we will through and it\u2019s important we have a policy framework to support our future and those that we have lost over many generations. We\u2019ve lost too many young people out of regional and rural Australia, it\u2019s time to bring them home, time for them to believe in regional Australia and the National party is the party to lead them. Michael McCormack: It\u2019s a great honour and a privilege to continue to serve as the leader of the National party. I congratulate David Littleproud for his election to the deputy leader\u2019s position. Also, I look forward to working and continuing to work with Barnaby Joyce, who put his hand up for the leadership. I also continue to look forward to working with Keith Pitt and David Gillespie, who put their hands up for the deputy leader\u2019s role. Never before has there been such an important time for the National party to continue the representation we\u2019ve done for 100 years. It\u2019s the challenge that is there. Of course, with the fires, with the ongoing drought. I commend David Littleproud as the newly elected deputy leader for the role he played this very worrying and troubling summer in drought, in bushfires and everything else that has beset regional Australia. We will continue as a united team, to put the people of regional Australia first and foremost. I want to thank my colleagues for again placing their faith in me. I also want to acknowledge that regional Australians are out there hurting. They are and we will be there for them. Their interests are our interests. First and foremost, I have never shied from the responsibility of making sure that every waking minute of every day I work hard for regional Australians, as does David, as does the entire National party team. We will continue to serve in a very good government. We have been very responsive to the needs and wants and expectations this summer and particularly for regional Australia. Michael McCormack has won the vote \u2013 Damian Drum (the chief whip) says we will \u201cnever find out\u201d what the numbers were. Michael McCormack and David Littleproud are the new leadership team. If Barnaby Joyce doesn\u2019t win this though, then Matt Canavan also loses. The word from Queensland is Canavan is looking at a lower house move \u2013 Ken O\u2019Dowd\u2019s Flynn seat has been floated as the most likely \u2013 which would be part of a long-term plan to win the leadership himself and become deputy prime minister. Nothing concrete yet but the chats are being had. But Canavan will be on the backbench after this if Joyce loses. Which leaves him free to talk as much as he wants. It might be a win for Keith Pitt though \u2013 he is in line to move into the ministry, with Canavan out. But let\u2019s just remember that this is a leadership spill with 21 people, and none of us actually know what the numbers are until they are counted. Although I hear Peter Dutton has the numbers in the Nationals party room. The ballot has been taken from the Nationals party room \u2013 looks like the deputy leadership vote is being held. The problem is, if Michael McCormack just flops across the line, with 13 votes, and the disgruntled Nationals continue to rumble \u2013 which they will \u2013 then it only takes a couple of people to change their mind. That\u2019s a little tougher in a smaller party room: there are only 21 Nationals and moving one chess piece usually moves sacrificing another, so the moves are a little more difficult. But. If the government continues to struggle to gain traction \u2013 and the budget isn\u2019t going to help, with the prime minister and the treasurer already moving to lower expectations of a surplus (which never really existed, because, come on \u2013 you are relying on iron ore prices and other outside factors which have nothing to do with government policy and everything to do with world exports) it is only going to get worse. So we\u2019ll have a bunch of agitators with a grudge and a leader who has shown he doesn\u2019t know how to respond. Fun times. Barnaby Joyce resigned as deputy prime minister on 26 February 2018. That was just 708 days ago. Or 23 months and nine days. He doesn\u2019t look to have the numbers at the moment. He looks like falling short. But the act of the spill is enough to unsettle the party \u2013 it won\u2019t be over. The Greens are also holding their party room meeting now. Adam Bandt will be the leader. But there are three people for two deputy spots \u2013 Larissa Waters, Sarah Hanson-Young and Mehreen Faruqi. Bridget McKenzie walked into the room with the NT senator Sam McMahon and the NSW senator Perin Davey (who Jim Molan tried to beat with a below-the-line campaign after he lost the Senate preselection. He returned after Arthur Sinodinos left for the US.) That\u2019s important. Because if you don\u2019t think that this Nationals spill isn\u2019t the direct result of McKenzie being forced to resign over #sportsrorts, then you are not paying attention. The view within half the Nationals is that McKenzie was forced to be the scapegoat for doing what she was directed to do and Michael McCormack didn\u2019t save her. How better to get back at Scott Morrison then to deliver him Barnaby Joyce as his deputy? Up until late last week, the Nationals were convinced McKenzie would survive. And then she didn\u2019t. Given that none of us will ever see the PM&amp;C report (it has been made cabinet in confidence) into the affair, it would have been pretty easy to find that McKenzie didn\u2019t breach ministerial standards (which is what she went down for). But it didn\u2019t. And less than 24 hours later \u2013 we have a leadership spill. Michael McCormack has made his address to MPs \u2013 Barnaby Joyce was out of the room. Joyce is back in there now and making his address. McCormack left. (This is normal \u2013 it\u2019s easier to talk about how terrible your opponent is when your opponent isn\u2019t in the room.) I have just been reminded (thank you) that Jim Molan, who admitted on Q&amp;A last night that he wasn\u2019t relying on evidence for his climate scepticism views, was also the director of the National Aerial Firefighting Centre for three years. Probably not great to have someone who admits to not relying on evidence to form his climate views, making judgments on what waterbombing forces we need to fight fires. Mike Bowers caught #thoughtsandprayers in action. Sarah Martin says when asked if he had the numbers, Michael McCormack replied: \u201cAll good.\u201d Sarah Martin tells me he was flanked by Andrew Gee, Michelle Landry and Mark Coulton. Barnaby Joyce, much like the cheese, walks in alone. See? Mehreen Faruqi had wanted co-leaders. Larissa Waters will also want to stay on as deputy \u2013 there is already a co-deputy system in place in the Greens, so this doesn\u2019t change much. Oh, and the Greens are holding its leadership vote today. Adam Bandt will win that one. It is, as they say, done. Anthony Albanese spoke just ahead of this morning\u2019s church service: Look, this is a day which parliament has set aside to deal with a condolence motion for the bushfires, the terrible impact, the loss of life, the loss of property. And what we have here is the most self-indulgent act of the National party. The Coalition\u2019s problem for this government is that they\u2019re too focused on themselves rather than on the Australian people. And today is the ultimate self-indulgence that just reinforces that. This government needs to actually concentrate on what the Australian people need rather than on itself. It\u2019s all about politics. One of Michael McCormack\u2019s problems is highlighted right here \u2013 Queensland is supposed to be National party heartland. Even in a country where \u201cmale, pale and stale\u201d tends to be the rule for politics, McCormack fades into the walls. The Nationals are walking in to their party room meeting. We expect a statement at 9.45am to say the spill has been called. We should have a result around 10.30am. At this stage, the numbers still seem locked at about 9/10 each. There are claims Barnaby has 12 \u2013 one more than is needed in a 21-strong party room \u2013 but people lie. But it doesn\u2019t matter for Michael McCormack, unless he wins conclusively \u2013 which is very, very unlikely. A split party room shown to be split doesn\u2019t tend to hold on for long. Scott Morrison finished with this: Those matters [the Nationals] will be sorted out properly this morning and the attention of the nation will be on the condolence motion. And the parliament has been reserved for the full day today to give total focus on that. That\u2019s the focus of the day. That\u2019s my focus. And he also gave special mention to the Abdallah family, who lost three of their four children in the horrific and tragic Oatlands crash at the weekend. But again to the Abdallah family, my thoughts and prayers. My heartfelt, sincere condolences are to them. We love you and you have a God who loves you, you know beyond the measure. Asked if he could work with Barnaby Joyce as his deputy, Scott Morrison says: The Coalition is between the Liberals and the Nationals. And that Coalition has always provided very stable and very good government for this country. And, in fact, that Coalition government has been the majority form of government for most of our time since certainly the Liberal party was formed. And that Coalition is always strong. Scott Morrison spoke outside the church service, which is held before the first parliamentary sitting, about what the day is supposed to be about: Today for the parliament is very much a focus on the reflecting on the terrible losses over the summer, to reflect on the lessons of the summer, and to say very clearly that Australians are not overcome, Australians are not overwhelmed, and Australians are strong, and the government will be there with them each step of the way as they rebuild, and they rebuild back better. And Australia will go forward in what has been a very difficult start to the year with the strength and character that it\u2019s well known for. And the government will do the same. He was then asked about the Nationals \u2013 which is what today is actually about, because they decided that\u2019s what today should actually be about \u2013 and Morrison had this to say when asked if the Nationals were a distraction: Not to me. I\u2019m focused very much on the important business we have to do today in this parliament, and to honour those who have given so much for their country and, in many cases, have lost everything. Reminded by Laura Jayes that his problems in the past have arisen from things he had not declared (his relationship and citizen status are just a couple which come to my mind), Barnaby Joyce is asked if there is anything, anything at all, he hasn\u2019t previously declared and might need to. He says, conclusively, there is nothing he needs to declare. Asked if he will survive the coming auditor general\u2019s report into water buybacks, Joyce says he will. Barnaby Joyce is being pushed very hard by Laura Jayes on Sky News about what is his actual plan to lower power prices and get investment back in regional towns (among other things) \u2013 and what he is promising that Michael McCormack has not. The short answer is: there is no concrete plan. There are a lot of motherhood statements and a lot of callbacks to what he did when he was last in charge of the Nationals \u2013 which was a time when the economy was looking a hell of a lot better than it is now. \u201cLaura, Laura, Laura you are talking to a backbencher \u2013 how about we have this discussion after the ballot?\u201d Joyce says. \u201cWho wants to be a leader, who wants to be deputy prime minister,\u201d Jayes says. \u201cI will stand by my record, Laura, on what we have achieved in the past.\u201d Asked on ABC Breakfast about the rural women who have urged the Nationals not to reinstall Barnaby Joyce as leader (as reported by Sarah Martin on Monday) Joyce had this to say: Well, it\u2019s all the case, isn\u2019t it, that you just have to deal with it. Politics is a game where if people can\u2019t beat you on policy, they\u2019re going to try to beat you personally. And they\u2019ll be organised by others to roll on out. That is the unfortunate art form of some in politics, and they\u2019ve had to deal with it before, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see it again. On the policy issues, I\u2019m happy to have that discussion. You can read Martin\u2019s full story here: #thoughtsandprayers That\u2019ll fix it Darren Chester appeared on Sky News a little earlier this morning, and the ABC just a few moments ago. Props to Chester for continuing to front up to all the cameras. A lot of Nationals have gone dark after agitating to create this situation. Chester, who is firmly in Michael McCormack\u2019s camp (and is no fan of Barnaby Joyce, a feeling which is very mutual), told the ABC he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by the leadership spill and apologised for it. Well, I believe Michael McCormack has the numbers, and I\u2019ve gotta say I\u2019m frustrated, I\u2019m disappointed, I\u2019m somewhat embarrassed that we\u2019re going through this today. I mean, I want to offer an apology to the Australian people. I know a lot of regional Australians watch your program. Those people who are suffering the consequences of drought or bushfires, on a day when the parliament was due, and is due, to debate a condolence motion, to have us talking about ourselves is embarrassing. I apologise for that. I want to reassure them there are a lot of people here in Canberra who are fighting to make sure the recovery goes as quickly and as well as it possibly can. Meanwhile, the first episode of Q&amp;A with Hamish Macdonald at the helm gave bushfire victims (the ones we are supposed to be focused on in parliament today, until the Nationals made it all about themselves \u2013 and they accuse the media of living in a \u201cCanberra bubble\u201d) a chance to speak to politicians and experts about what Australia is facing moving forward. The Liberal senator Jim Molan, who moved heaven and earth to get back into the parliament for one last three-year go-around, and who was supported by a group of Liberals who were willing to blow the whole show up if necessary to get him back in, admitted he doesn\u2019t believe the science is settled on climate change. And then, when pressed on what evidence he was relying on to form his views by Macdonald, Molan went further. I\u2019m not relying on evidence, Hamish. At least he was honest. But the climate will keep changing if we don\u2019t do something, no matter how many feelpinions Senator Jim Molan has. (It\u2019s also a very disconcerting admission from a man who was a general in our armed forces.) Well, we enter the first day of parliament \u2013 which was supposed to be all about the summer bushfire emergency and its victims \u2013 talking about the Nationals, because they decided to hold a leadership spill today. The leaders and a lot of the MPs of the moment are at church this morning for the traditional opening of parliament service, which means there is a lot of Old Testament floating around. Michael McCormack opened with: \u201cThere is a time to tear down and a time to build. Now is a time to build,\u201d as he fights to keep his job. There are only a couple of votes in this at the moment. Even if McCormack holds on by one or two, the vote will show just how divided the party is. And that, as we know, is not sustainable long term. Barnaby Joyce on the other hand, says he has spent the past two years in backbench purgatory learning from his mistakes \u2013 and he now has the \u201cpersonal infrastructure\u201d in place to succeed. He told the ABC: I\u2019ve [been in a] steady relationship, I\u2019ve got two boys here. The infrastructure, the personal infrastructure around me is such that I believe I\u2019m in a better position to go forward. And what I\u2019ll be focusing on is to make sure that the National party, as a team, has the best candidates in the key positions, and to make sure that we have the best capacity to deliver a policy outcome, because that is what our people require. Joyce has also pointed out that he has \u201cbeen in politics longer than Scott Morrison\u201d and he has been in \u201cleadership longer than Scott Morrison\u201d. So this is great for the Liberals too. They must be absolutely loving this. Just as much as they must have loved Matt Canavan going on Sky News and telling Andrew Bolt last night that there haven\u2019t been enough people standing up for coal in the government. So, as we wait for the Nationals to head into their party room meeting at nine, the numbers are looking very tight. Both McCormack and Joyce\u2019s camps are claiming they have about nine or 10 votes locked in. People lie, obviously, and as Darren Chester told Laura Jayes on Sky this morning, the only people you can believe are the ones who tell you they would never vote for you. Still, that seems about right from the phone calls we have all been making. Which means it will take just two of the newbies to decide this. We\u2019ll bring you everything as it happens. Mike Bowers is already out and about and filing. I\u2019ll bring you some of that very soon. You also have Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp and a three-coffee Amy. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories from the Guardian today.</p> \n<p>The outcome of the all-important Iowa Democratic caucuses may not be known until later today amid what officials called \u201cquality checks\u201d on the data and reports of problems with a phone app used to relay vote tallies.

Elizabeth Warren told her campaign workers and backers that \u201cdreams were still possible\u201d before she rushed to catch her campaign plane to New Hampshire for the next primary.

The outcome of the all-important Iowa Democratic caucuses may not be known until later today amid what officials called \u201cquality checks\u201d on the data and reports of problems with a phone app used to relay vote tallies. With the announcement of the result delayed, the 11 candidates vying to challenge Donald Trump for the US presidency in November were left in limbo and forced to make their scheduled speeches to supporters without knowing the outcome. Elizabeth Warren told her campaign workers and backers that \u201cdreams were still possible\u201d before she rushed to catch her campaign plane to New Hampshire for the next primary. Bernie Sanders predicted to his team that he had done \u201cvery well\u201d but recent polls show him neck and neck with Warren, Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg.

He has not been pictured visiting hospitals, doctors or patients. In the days after officials acknowledged the gravity of the crisis it was the premier, Li Keqiang, who visited Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak. While photos of a long convoy prompted rumours over the weekend that Xi was on his way to Wuhan, he has yet to turn up.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0a09a661-0ee2-41ea-b0a0-9e1deefd9268\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is Covid-19?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Instead, state media have portrayed him as in command from a distance, issuing pledges to overcome the \u201cdevil virus\u201d and approving measures such as the deployment of 1,400 military medics at a new hospital in Wuhan. On Monday, Xi chaired a meeting of the Communist party\u2019s ruling politburo standing committee and ordered officials to work together to improve the country\u2019s emergency response system and public health regime.</p> \n<p>For a leader whose face and words decorate banners and signs across the country and feature in state media daily, the low-key approach during a time of national crisis seems out of character.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is clearly one of the most serious issues to confront China in decades. Xi has heavily centralised power in himself, cultivated a populist image, and vested himself with the title of \u2018people\u2019s leader\u2019,\u201d said Carl Minzner, a professor of Chinese law and politics at Fordham University. \u201cFailing to publicly address the issue would seem likely to harm his populist image.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some experts say the approach may be deliberate. Xi, who has aggressively centralised power and made himself the core of the Communist party, may be more at risk to the political fallout of the coronavirus. Local government officials have so far borne the brunt of criticism, but as the central government handles the crisis more scrutiny will be placed on top officials.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf the situation improves, he will take credit. If it worsens the blame will be pinned on Li Keqiang,\u201d said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p> \n<p>Some of the central-level efforts were approved by Xi, such as a lockdown in Wuhan and surrounding cities when there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/23/coronavirus-panic-and-anger-in-wuhan-as-china-orders-city-into-lockdown\">not enough medical supplies and hospital capacity</a> to cope with the number of patients.</p> \n<p>Xi\u2019s absence from the scene has been noticed. \u201cHe has not visited places hard hit by the virus,\u201d Lam said. \u201cThis has been criticised in part because Xi claims to be the core of the leadership, the all-powerful leadership \u2026 and he doesn\u2019t have the guts to go the epidemic-stricken areas.\u201d</p> \n<p>Previously available comments about Xi\u2019s absence that mockingly used the term \u201cpersonally commanding\u201d appear to have been removed from the Chinese social media platforms Weibo and Douban.</p> \n<p>A post titled \u201cWhat Xi Dada has been doing these days\u201d on the site Pincong.rocks, a Chinese-language discussion forum hosted overseas, included a timeline of his meetings and directives given in relation to the virus.</p> \n<p>\u201cMaybe he\u2019s already found a safe place to hide and quarantine himself,\u201d a commentator said in response to the post. \u201cMaybe he is with all those face masks that have gone missing in Wuhan,\u201d another said, in reference to the city\u2019s shortage.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 February 2020. The original wrongly attributed the comments from Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, to Vivienne Shue, a professor at the University of Oxford.

      "bodyText": "The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has been noticeably absent from public view as his government scrambles to fight the coronavirus outbreak that claimed more than 400 lives and infected more than 20,000 people. His most recent public appearance was on 28 January when he met the director general of the World Health Organization in Beijing and said he was \u201cpersonally commanding\u201d the response to the outbreak. Yet Xi does not appear to be the face of the government\u2019s fight against the virus. He has not been pictured visiting hospitals, doctors or patients. In the days after officials acknowledged the gravity of the crisis it was the premier, Li Keqiang, who visited Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak. While photos of a long convoy prompted rumours over the weekend that Xi was on his way to Wuhan, he has yet to turn up. Instead, state media have portrayed him as in command from a distance, issuing pledges to overcome the \u201cdevil virus\u201d and approving measures such as the deployment of 1,400 military medics at a new hospital in Wuhan. On Monday, Xi chaired a meeting of the Communist party\u2019s ruling politburo standing committee and ordered officials to work together to improve the country\u2019s emergency response system and public health regime. For a leader whose face and words decorate banners and signs across the country and feature in state media daily, the low-key approach during a time of national crisis seems out of character. \u201cThis is clearly one of the most serious issues to confront China in decades. Xi has heavily centralised power in himself, cultivated a populist image, and vested himself with the title of \u2018people\u2019s leader\u2019,\u201d said Carl Minzner, a professor of Chinese law and politics at Fordham University. \u201cFailing to publicly address the issue would seem likely to harm his populist image.\u201d Some experts say the approach may be deliberate. Xi, who has aggressively centralised power and made himself the core of the Communist party, may be more at risk to the political fallout of the coronavirus. Local government officials have so far borne the brunt of criticism, but as the central government handles the crisis more scrutiny will be placed on top officials. \u201cIf the situation improves, he will take credit. If it worsens the blame will be pinned on Li Keqiang,\u201d said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Some of the central-level efforts were approved by Xi, such as a lockdown in Wuhan and surrounding cities when there was not enough medical supplies and hospital capacity to cope with the number of patients. Xi\u2019s absence from the scene has been noticed. \u201cHe has not visited places hard hit by the virus,\u201d Lam said. \u201cThis has been criticised in part because Xi claims to be the core of the leadership, the all-powerful leadership \u2026 and he doesn\u2019t have the guts to go the epidemic-stricken areas.\u201d Previously available comments about Xi\u2019s absence that mockingly used the term \u201cpersonally commanding\u201d appear to have been removed from the Chinese social media platforms Weibo and Douban. A post titled \u201cWhat Xi Dada has been doing these days\u201d on the site Pincong.rocks, a Chinese-language discussion forum hosted overseas, included a timeline of his meetings and directives given in relation to the virus. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s already found a safe place to hide and quarantine himself,\u201d a commentator said in response to the post. \u201cMaybe he is with all those face masks that have gone missing in Wuhan,\u201d another said, in reference to the city\u2019s shortage. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 February 2020. The original wrongly attributed the comments from Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, to Vivienne Shue, a professor at the University of Oxford. We apologise for the error.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Su, who has been running her stall for 15 years, said some traders held a meeting to ban her from reopening the shop in Aberystwyth Market Hall.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen I arrived at the hall and got to my own stall the man who works opposite mine immediately asked me to leave the building,\u201d said Su. \u201cHe stressed that every member of the hall all think I must leave the building otherwise he will contact the council to force me out.\u201d She said another trader next to him supported his demand.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was really upset, it was very emotional and upsetting, and I\u2019m angry,\u201d said Su. \u201cThere are so many cases of the virus in the rest of this world, so why did this trader target me?

Opinion Absent any actual results, all of the top Democratic presidential hopefuls took to the stage in Iowa on Monday night to declare a kind of victory. The botched caucuses were an unfortunate, if appropriate, metaphor for the political moment, says Richard Wolffe. It may be true that every Democrat is running to cleanse the stain of Donald Trump. But it\u2019s also true that ignoring the facts to declare victory is the most Trumpian move of them all.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Several people described profound anxiety, insufficient food and a lack of information.

Nearly 2 billion animals a year are transported around the world on journeys which, in some cases, can take more than 40 days. The Middle East is a focal point of the trade, with live animal exports to the region rising steadily over the past two decades, particularly from Europe. The trade is driven by rising demand for meat and dairy and water shortages in the region, which limits domestic production. Saudi Arabia imported 7 million cattle and sheep in 2017. In just one year, Turkey went from importing $600m (\u00a3457m) worth of animals in 2016 to $1.2bn in 2017. The risk of disease transmission from live animals has been in the headlines recently with the coronavirus outbreak linked to a wet market in Wuhan, eastern China.

Doubts have been raised as to whether countries are properly reporting suspected disease outbreaks. Saudi Arabia temporarily blocked sheep imports from Sudan after an outbreak of Rift Valley fever. Live animal exports are a vital source of income for Sudan, worth approximately $500 million in 2018. During our week-long focus on the live export trade we\u2019ve also been reporting on: Europe\u2019s booming trade: Economics are trumping animal welfare standards in the EU as a decline in the numbers of slaughterhouses has seen the trade treble in value from $1bn in 2000 to $3bn in 2018. Animal welfare failings: Injured animals left to die and sheep melting in the heat on old and inferior ships. Secret decks found on a ship that capsized last year killing more than 14,000 sheep travelling from Romania to Saudi Arabia \u2013 the discovery of which has led to questions on whether overloading was to blame for the capsize. Europe\u2019s biggest exporter of live animals: the story of Romania and the \u00a318 sheep The UK\u2019s chicken loophole: UK\u2019s proposed ban on live exports may not stop export of tens of millions of chicks every year. News from around the world One of the world\u2019s biggest meat companies, JBS, has signed a deal to supply beef, poultry and pork to China in a deal that could generate up to $700 million a year. JBS, a Brazilian company - linked to deforestation in the Amazon \u2013 slaughters 13 million animals every single day and has annual revenue of $50 billion. China is set to report record pork imports in 2020 as it continues to suffer from an outbreak of African swine fever (ASF). ASF has spread to Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, Cambodia, the Philippines, South Korea and Indonesia. The outbreak is expected to increase pork production in Brazil and the US. The average Chinese person gets through about 30kg of pork a year (by comparison, people in US eat about 26kg of beef a year and UK consumers about 18kg). The temporary ban on wildlife markets in China should be made permanent, says an expert. Coronavirus is believed to have emerged from Huanan seafood market in the industrial city of Wuhan, where wild animals such as snakes, porcupines and pangolins are sold. \u201cWe have had similar diseases caused by illegal wildlife trafficking and if we don\u2019t ban the trade these diseases will happen again,\u201d said Jinfeng Zhou, secretary general of the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation. The European Commission has suspended imports of poultry meat from Ukraine after an outbreak of the highly contagious H5N8 bird flu. Outbreaks have been reported in the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. Separately, more than 18,000 chickens have been culled following an outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza in Hunan, China. The European Parliament is being asked this week to debate a meat tax that could generate \u20ac32bn (\u00a327bn) in revenue a year. The campaign group behind the proposal says the revenues generated should be split between helping farmers invest in more sustainable agricultural practices, reducing VAT, subsidising fruit and vegetables, supporting low-income households, and funding greenhouse gas reductions and climate change adaptation in developing countries. More than one-fifth of fish sold in markets in Buenos Aires province is not the fish it is labelled as, according to DNA testing by Argentinian researchers. The authors of the study say mislabelling is not just an issue of food fraud and public health, but also a conservation problem, due to the overfishing of threatened species. British company Cranswick has opened a \u00a375m chicken slaughter facility capable of processing 15,000 birds per hour in Suffolk. It will be supplied with birds from Cranswick-owned and run farms across Norfolk and Suffolk and is expected to produce 1 million chickens a week.

      "body": "<h2>Asia-Pacific</h2> \n<p>On Tuesday night, at least 144 people who have been trapped in Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, are expected to arrive in <strong>Thailand</strong> on an evacuation flight. They will remain in isolation for 14 days, reportedly at a navy base in Chonburi province. The exact details of where they will be quarantined has not been made public in case there is opposition from local people, according to the broadcaster Thai PBS news.</p> \n<p>The country is one of the most popular holiday destinations for Chinese people during the lunar new year break, and officials have warned that an outbreak is possible in its tourist areas. All arrivals from China are being screened at airports, while temperature scanners are being used in malls, and hand sanitiser given out in shops and on the transport system.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, it was announced that six more people in Thailand had been infected with the new coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases recorded so far to 25. The country confirmed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/31/coronavirus-thailand-confirms-first-human-to-human-transmission\">its first case of human-to-human transmission of the virus </a>last week, after a taxi driver was apparently infected by a traveller.</p> \n<p>Hundreds more people have been undergoing investigation in hospitals, though most have been found to have seasonal influenza, according to the ministry of public health. Of the 25 cases recorded so far in Thailand, eight have since been discharged from hospital.</p> \n<p>Not all countries in south-east Asia are offering to evacuate their citizens. <strong>Cambodia</strong> has refused to do so, prompting criticism that the country was prioritising economic interests and diplomatic relations over public health. Its leader, Hun Sen, said that an evacuation flight \u201cwould strain relations between the countries\u201d. Cambodia has introduced screening at airports, though some reports have questioned how effectively this is being implemented.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0a09a661-0ee2-41ea-b0a0-9e1deefd9268\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is Covid-19?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In <strong>Indonesia</strong>, 238 nationals were sprayed with disinfectant by staff in protective suits as they disembarked from an evacuation flight on Sunday. After an examination, they were flown to Natuna island, where they have been placed in quarantine at Raden Sadjad airbase for two weeks. Indonesia has temporarily banned flights to and from mainland China, and said it won\u2019t allow those who have been there in recent weeks to enter or transit. The country has also urged citizens to temporarily stop travelling there.</p> \n<p><strong>Malaysia</strong> evacuated 107 people from Hubei on Monday, with aircraft staff donating 500,000 pairs of rubber gloves as a gift to the Chinese government. Two people, who did not pass a health screening upon arrival, were sent to Kuala Lumpur hospital. Others were taken to a surveillance centre at an education academy, where they will remain for 14 days. The country has suspended all visas on arrival for travellers from Hubei, but not elsewhere.</p> \n<p>Following growing public pressure, the <strong>Philippines</strong> president, Rodrigo Duterte, banned arrivals from across China, as well as Hong Kong and Macau. On Sunday, a 44-year-old Chinese man visiting the Philippines became the first person to die from the new coronavirus outside China. Authorities are now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/02/philippines-races-to-trace-those-linked-to-first-coronavirus-death-outside-china\">racing to trace those who had contact with the man</a>, who had visited three provinces.</p> \n<p><strong>Vietnam</strong> has also halted all flights to and from China, as well as its autonomous regions, and stated that it will stop issuing visas for foreign visitors who have been in China in the past two weeks. As of Tuesday, Vietnam had recorded nine cases of the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>In <strong>Myanmar</strong>, no cases have been recorded so far. However, the country lacks capacity to test for the virus, and results take about five days to arrive from Bangkok. Some 59 students who were evacuated in Wuhan remain under quarantine at Kandawnadi hospital, Mandalay, according to local media.</p> \n<p>The 20 people confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus in <strong>Japan </strong>are being treated at several hospitals that are among 400 medical institutions designated by the government to treat the illness. Japan\u2019s government drew criticism for allowing two men who were among the first group of evacuees from Wuhan to refuse to be tested last week \u2013 although they later agreed. Officials said Japanese law did not allow them to forcibly quarantine patients.<br><br>That policy changed at the weekend with the introduction of emergency measures allowing authorities to forcibly quarantine people who test positive, with penalties applying to those who refuse to be tested. Most of the evacuated people are staying in lodgings provided by the government, including a hotel and a training facility.<br><br><strong>South Korea</strong> has recorded 16 cases, including two that appear to involve people who have not travelled to China: a 42-year-old woman who had recently returned to South Korea from Thailand, and a 48-year-old Chinese man who had been working as a tour guide in Japan.<br><br>About 700 South Koreans evacuated from Wuhan in recent days have been taken to two quarantine centres about 80km south of Seoul, where they will be kept in isolation for at least two weeks. Plans to quarantine evacuees at the centres, which are usually used to train civil servants, initially met with opposition from local residents who demanded that people returning from Wuhan be quarantined in more remote locations.<br><br>On Monday, South Korea said it would start testing everyone who develops even mild symptoms, such as a fever or cough, within 14 days of returning from any part of mainland China, Yonhap news agency said. In addition, those who have been in close or casual contact with a confirmed case will be made to self-quarantine for two weeks. </p> \n<p>The first batch of an estimated 500 <strong>Taiwan </strong>residents stranded in Wuhan were allowed to return home late on Monday. The self-governing island has reported 10 cases of the virus and said it would deny entry to all foreign nationals who had been to China during the past 14 days. It has been in dispute with Beijing over coronavirus, saying it is excluded from the World Health Organization because of China\u2019s objections and as such prevented from receiving timely information about the outbreak \u2013 a claim both China and the WHO have denied.</p> \n<p><strong>India</strong> has had three reported cases of coronavirus, all in Kerala, which has declared a \u201cstate calamity\u201d. A total of 645 evacuees were flown to Delhi from Wuhan over Saturday and Sunday and are now in two mountain quarantine centres being managed by the army where they will be kept for two weeks.</p> \n<p>In Kerala, 2,239 people are under observation and 84 have been admitted to various hospitals \u2013 the vast majority of the 2,815 people are presently under community surveillance across India\u2019s 29 states.</p> \n<p>The Indian government has revised the travel advisory asking the public to refrain from travelling to China and ordered that anyone who has travelled to China since 15 January 2020 should report themselves and be put in quarantine. The government has also temporarily suspended the e-Visa facility for Chinese passport holders and e-Visas already issued to Chinese nationals are also not valid temporarily.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5dcbc6c2412f2c86259f8008f73cdf4444f960e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5dcbc6c2412f2c86259f8008f73cdf4444f960e/0_418_3051_1831/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sign in the airport arrival hall on Christmas Island, Australia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sign in the airport arrival hall on Christmas Island, Australia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Wainwright/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Foreigners who have flown from or transited through China are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/03/coronavirus-outbreak-new-zealand-bans-foreign-travellers-from-china\">barred from </a><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/03/coronavirus-outbreak-new-zealand-bans-foreign-travellers-from-china\">New Zealand</a></strong> for two weeks beginning Monday, and the government has raised its warning level for the country to \u201cdo not travel\u201d. The national carrier, Air New Zealand, has suspended its Auckland-Shanghai route until late March.</p> \n<p>Citizens, permanent residents and their families returning to New Zealand from China are subject to additional checks by nurses at the border, and required to isolate themselves for 14 days upon returning.</p> \n<p>Those who wanted to leave Wuhan province have faced a longer wait and an impending quarantine period: a plane carrying about 250 people \u2013 New Zealanders, Australians, and people from the Pacific Islands \u2013 is due to land in Auckland on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Those onboard will be quarantined at a military base on New Zealand\u2019s North Island for two weeks, where officials said they would have access to remote working, education, and recreation facilities. </p> \n<p><strong>Australia</strong> has separately evacuated 243 people, including 89 children, who were in Wuhan to an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/03/coronavirus-qantas-evacuation-of-australians-in-wuhan-under-way\">immigration detention centre on remote Christmas Island</a>, where they will be quarantined for 14 days.</p> \n<p>There have been no recorded cases of the virus in <strong>North Korea</strong>, but the country has taken measures to guard against the disease amid warnings that an epidemic could put an intolerable strain on its poor healthcare infrastructure.<br><br>North Korea has suspended flights from China and Russia and closed train routes across its borders with those two countries. It has also imposed a ban on foreign tourism and suspended operations at a liaison office it runs with South Korea just north of the demilitarised zone, the heavily armed border separating North and South Korea.<br><br>The country\u2019s authorities have stepped up border inspections and health screenings of North Koreans returning from overseas business trips, according to the Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of the ruling Workers\u2019 party.<br><br>The newspaper said 30,000 health workers had been mobilised to monitor residents and distribute advice on how to avoid becoming infected.</p> \n<h2>Europe</h2> \n<p><strong>Italy</strong> has evacuated 56 people from Wuhan and is quarantining them for two weeks at a military facility near Rome. A passenger who was expected to be on the flight remained in Wuhan after coming down with a fever. The condition of a Chinese couple being treated for coronavirus at Rome\u2019s Lazzaro Spallanzani institute for infectious diseases health has worsened, the hospital has said.</p> \n<p>Italy has a state of emergency in place for the next six months, allowing authorities to unlock investment to try and prevent the spread of the virus. Flights between Italy and China have also been suspended. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/31/spate-of-anti-chinese-incidents-in-italy-amid-coronavirus-panic\">Panic over the virus continues in Italy</a>, with general practitioners and hospital emergency units overwhelmed with people suffering flu symptoms or simply seeking information from professionals. Codacons, the consumers\u2019 group, has called for group tours at popular sites including the Colosseum to be banned.</p> \n<p>Two flights bringing repatriated citizens from China have arrived in <strong>France</strong>. The first flight brought back 180 French citizens from the Wuhan region. A second flight brought back 250 passengers, mostly EU citizens, including 65 French nationals. The repatriated French people are being held in quarantine for two weeks either at a specially prepared centre in a firefighters\u2019 training school at Aix-en-Provence, or a holiday centre at Carry-le-Rouet, in the Bouches-du-Rhone.</p> \n<p>France has six reported cases of coronavirus. Two patients, a man of 31 and a woman of 31, are in a Paris hospital in a serious but not life-threatening condition. A 48-year-old man of \u201cChinese origin\u201d is in hospital in Bordeaux in a stable condition, a Chinese tourist aged 80 is in intensive care in a Paris hospital, and his daughter, who tested positive for the virus, is also in hospital. The first reported case of human-to-human transmission in France is a GP said to have contracted the virus after examining one of the above in Paris. </p> \n<p>A total of 12 people have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/28/germany-confirms-first-human-coronavirus-transmission-in-europe\">tested positive with the virus</a> in <strong>Germany</strong> so far. Eight of them are employees of car part supplier Webasto, headquartered in Stockdorf, Bavaria; two are the children of one of the employees. Four of the infected Webasto employees had taken part in a training workshop that was run by a Chinese employee who had only started to feel ill on her return flight to China, where she was subsequently tested positive for the 2019-nCov virus.<br><br>The company\u2019s headquarters in Stockdorf have been disinfected by experts over the weekend and are to remain closed until 11 February. A further 140 employees were tested for the virus, and 80 of them have been ordered to stay indoors and avoid human contact even though their test results had returned negative.<br><br>People arriving in Germany from Wuhan are being assessed at Frankfurt airport\u2019s medical assessment centre, and then brought to German army barracks in Germersheim, near Heidelberg, where they are put into quarantine for 14 days from arrival or outbreak of the virus. Two German citizens were tested positive after being flown from Wuhan to Frankfurt on a chartered Luftwaffe flight.<br></p> \n<p>The <strong>United Kingdom</strong> flew back 83 people from Wuhan on Friday with 11 arriving via France on Sunday. All are being quarantined at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/31/families-uneasy-at-proximity-to-coronavirus-quarantine-site\">Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral</a>, where they will stay in staff accommodation and be monitored around the clock for 14 days.</p> \n<p><strong>Ireland</strong> has no confirmed case of coronavirus and is not quarantining people but officials in hazmat suits escorted a passenger from an airplane as a precaution.</p> \n<p>The man, believed to be from China, was transferred to an ambulance on Saturday after arriving in Dublin on an Aeroflot flight from Russia. He had flu-like symptoms but a test revealed he did not have coronavirus. Last week test results had to be sent to the UK but Ireland\u2019s National Virus Reference Laboratory now has kits, speeding up tests. </p> \n<p>A military cargo plane from <strong>Turkey</strong> on Saturday airlifted 34 Turkish citizens, seven Azerbaijanis, seven Georgians, and one Albanian from Wuhan after medical checks confirmed they were not infected. They are all under a 14-day quarantine at a hospital in Ankara. A Chinese citizen suspected of infection was held in quarantine on arrival in Istanbul for 36 hours then voluntarily returned home after that.</p> \n<p>Seven people evacuated from Wuhan arrived in <strong>Hungary</strong> on Sunday and will be quarantined for two weeks.</p> \n<p><strong>Russia</strong> has sent planes to China as it begins its evacuation from Wuhan and Hubei province. More than 700 Russians are said to be living in the region, of whom 132 had expressed a desire to return to Russia, the country\u2019s embassy in Beijing has reported. They will be subject to a two-week quarantine period at a sanatorium in Tyumen region with a guarded perimeter.</p> \n<p>In the past few days, Russia has quickly stepped up travel restrictions to and from China. Late Monday night, the government announced a temporary ban on direct travel for foreigners from China to Russia, except via Moscow\u2019s Sheremetyevo airport.</p> \n<p>Two cases of infection have been reported in Russia, one in Siberia and the other in Russia\u2019s far east. Both of the victims are Chinese citizens. One of the men, Yan Wunbin, wrote in a letter to the Chita.ru website that he was never given his test results and only learned that he had been diagnosed with the coronavirus from media reports. He complained about conditions at the hospital in Russia\u2019s Zabaykalsky Krai region about 240 miles from the Chinese border. There were not enough doctors on call and he was worried for the health of his two-year-old daughter, who was ill and in quarantine with him.</p> \n<h2>Middle East</h2> \n<p>The <strong>United Arab Emirates</strong> has recorded five cases of coronavirus, four of whom are Chinese tourists from the same family. Emirates officials say the family, along with a fifth patient, have been quarantined in local hospitals in rooms that have lower air pressure than normal. Air can flow into these rooms, but not out, minimising the risk of the virus spreading.</p> \n<p>As one of the world\u2019s most important transit hubs, with major airports in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, an outbreak of the virus there would be of particular concern. Authorities say they are confident in their ability to contain its spread, and on Tuesday took further measures to do so \u2013 banning most flights to and from mainland China and introducing strict protocols, involving up to eight hours of vetting and health checks for anyone wanting to travel from Beijing, which remains the only route still flown, and only by Emirates Airlines.</p> \n<p>Officials in the UAE say the threat from Middle East respiratory syndrome six years ago sparked a comprehensive response this time round. Mers was an even more potent form of coronavirus, killing up to 17% of those who contracted it. By contrast the current virus has a death rate of closer to 3%. The five patients in the UAE will be quarantined for 14 days in government-run hospitals.</p> \n<h2>Africa</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e10c72e50606a7e30876bf848afacdcae20a1920\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e10c72e50606a7e30876bf848afacdcae20a1920/0_154_4744_2847/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coronavirus screening at Ethiopian airport.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coronavirus screening at Addis Ababa airport in Ethiopia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STR/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There have been no verified infections in Africa to date, but several countries, including <strong>Ethiopia</strong>, <strong>Kenya</strong>, <strong>Angola</strong>, <strong>Botswana</strong> and <strong>Ivory Coast</strong>, have signalled possible infections. Confirming or ruling out coronavirus in the continent can take time, as health authorities lacking expertise have to send samples to labs in countries such as South Africa.</p> \n<p>The WHO has identified 13 top priority countries on the continent, including much of eastern, central and southern Africa, which either have direct links or a high volume of travel to China. All the concerned states have put in place controls at airports, using thermal cameras to detect potentially infected passengers, and have readied isolation units. At the weekend, Air Tanzania joined five other African airlines in suspending or restricting flights to China, though Ethiopia\u2019s national flag carrier, which carries almost half of all passengers, has maintained flights.</p> \n<p><strong>Nigeria</strong> has urged any person arriving from China to \u201cself-isolate\u201d for at least two weeks, even if they are not ill, and in <strong>Mozambique</strong>, the government has suspended visas for Chinese citizens and forbidden its citizens from travelling there. Authorities in <strong>South Africa</strong> said they had set up an emergency operations centre and were monitoring passengers at 36 entry points.</p> \n<p>The one confirmed case of an African with coronavirus is a 21-year-old student from <strong>Cameroon</strong> living in Jingzhou city, one of more than 80,000 students from the continent in Africa. At least 4,000 of that number are believed to be in Wuhan.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/04/african-students-stranded-in-wuhan-coronavirus\">African students stranded in coronavirus heartland plead with embassies</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Americas</h2> \n<p>The Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/31/us-coronavirus-budget-cuts-trump-underprepared\">declared the coronavirus a public health emergency</a> and has severely limited who can enter the <strong>United States</strong> based on their travels to China. People who recently travelled to mainland China and are neither permanent residents nor immediate relatives of permanent residents will not be allowed to enter the country. It is the most severe travel restriction since a smallpox outbreak prompted mandatory quarantines five decades ago.</p> \n<p>Citizens and permanent residents returning from Hubei, the province including Wuhan, will be quarantined on military bases for two weeks. Americans returning from other parts of mainland China will be subject to a two-week at-home quarantine.</p> \n<p>All three major US airlines have cancelled services to China and US officials are \u201cfunnelling\u201d all travellers from China to just seven airports in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Honolulu, Seattle and Atlanta.</p> \n<p>To date, 11 people in the US have been diagnosed with the coronavirus, two of whom live outside Chicago.</p> \n<p><strong>Canada</strong> has chartered an aircraft to evacuate 304 citizens from Wuhan. Upon arrival in Canada, all passengers on the flight will be quarantined for two weeks at CFB Trenton, a military base in Ontario.</p> \n<p>Instead of barring travellers from China, Canada has instead requested that they self-report any symptoms related to the coronavirus, resisting calls for broader screening measures. Of the four confirmed cases in Canada \u2013 all of which were self-reported \u2013 one patient has been discharged from hospital following a successful recovery.</p> \n<p>So far no cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Latin America, but there are particular fears over how <strong>Venezuela</strong>\u2019s collapsed health service might cope with any outbreak.

      "bodyText": "Asia-Pacific On Tuesday night, at least 144 people who have been trapped in Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, are expected to arrive in Thailand on an evacuation flight. They will remain in isolation for 14 days, reportedly at a navy base in Chonburi province. The exact details of where they will be quarantined has not been made public in case there is opposition from local people, according to the broadcaster Thai PBS news. The country is one of the most popular holiday destinations for Chinese people during the lunar new year break, and officials have warned that an outbreak is possible in its tourist areas. All arrivals from China are being screened at airports, while temperature scanners are being used in malls, and hand sanitiser given out in shops and on the transport system. On Tuesday, it was announced that six more people in Thailand had been infected with the new coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases recorded so far to 25. The country confirmed its first case of human-to-human transmission of the virus last week, after a taxi driver was apparently infected by a traveller. Hundreds more people have been undergoing investigation in hospitals, though most have been found to have seasonal influenza, according to the ministry of public health. Of the 25 cases recorded so far in Thailand, eight have since been discharged from hospital. Not all countries in south-east Asia are offering to evacuate their citizens. Cambodia has refused to do so, prompting criticism that the country was prioritising economic interests and diplomatic relations over public health. Its leader, Hun Sen, said that an evacuation flight \u201cwould strain relations between the countries\u201d. Cambodia has introduced screening at airports, though some reports have questioned how effectively this is being implemented. In Indonesia, 238 nationals were sprayed with disinfectant by staff in protective suits as they disembarked from an evacuation flight on Sunday. After an examination, they were flown to Natuna island, where they have been placed in quarantine at Raden Sadjad airbase for two weeks. Indonesia has temporarily banned flights to and from mainland China, and said it won\u2019t allow those who have been there in recent weeks to enter or transit. The country has also urged citizens to temporarily stop travelling there. Malaysia evacuated 107 people from Hubei on Monday, with aircraft staff donating 500,000 pairs of rubber gloves as a gift to the Chinese government. Two people, who did not pass a health screening upon arrival, were sent to Kuala Lumpur hospital. Others were taken to a surveillance centre at an education academy, where they will remain for 14 days. The country has suspended all visas on arrival for travellers from Hubei, but not elsewhere. Following growing public pressure, the Philippines president, Rodrigo Duterte, banned arrivals from across China, as well as Hong Kong and Macau. On Sunday, a 44-year-old Chinese man visiting the Philippines became the first person to die from the new coronavirus outside China. Authorities are now racing to trace those who had contact with the man, who had visited three provinces. Vietnam has also halted all flights to and from China, as well as its autonomous regions, and stated that it will stop issuing visas for foreign visitors who have been in China in the past two weeks. As of Tuesday, Vietnam had recorded nine cases of the coronavirus. In Myanmar, no cases have been recorded so far. However, the country lacks capacity to test for the virus, and results take about five days to arrive from Bangkok. Some 59 students who were evacuated in Wuhan remain under quarantine at Kandawnadi hospital, Mandalay, according to local media. The 20 people confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus in Japan are being treated at several hospitals that are among 400 medical institutions designated by the government to treat the illness. Japan\u2019s government drew criticism for allowing two men who were among the first group of evacuees from Wuhan to refuse to be tested last week \u2013 although they later agreed. Officials said Japanese law did not allow them to forcibly quarantine patients. That policy changed at the weekend with the introduction of emergency measures allowing authorities to forcibly quarantine people who test positive, with penalties applying to those who refuse to be tested. Most of the evacuated people are staying in lodgings provided by the government, including a hotel and a training facility. South Korea has recorded 16 cases, including two that appear to involve people who have not travelled to China: a 42-year-old woman who had recently returned to South Korea from Thailand, and a 48-year-old Chinese man who had been working as a tour guide in Japan. About 700 South Koreans evacuated from Wuhan in recent days have been taken to two quarantine centres about 80km south of Seoul, where they will be kept in isolation for at least two weeks. Plans to quarantine evacuees at the centres, which are usually used to train civil servants, initially met with opposition from local residents who demanded that people returning from Wuhan be quarantined in more remote locations. On Monday, South Korea said it would start testing everyone who develops even mild symptoms, such as a fever or cough, within 14 days of returning from any part of mainland China, Yonhap news agency said. In addition, those who have been in close or casual contact with a confirmed case will be made to self-quarantine for two weeks. The first batch of an estimated 500 Taiwan residents stranded in Wuhan were allowed to return home late on Monday. The self-governing island has reported 10 cases of the virus and said it would deny entry to all foreign nationals who had been to China during the past 14 days. It has been in dispute with Beijing over coronavirus, saying it is excluded from the World Health Organization because of China\u2019s objections and as such prevented from receiving timely information about the outbreak \u2013 a claim both China and the WHO have denied. India has had three reported cases of coronavirus, all in Kerala, which has declared a \u201cstate calamity\u201d. A total of 645 evacuees were flown to Delhi from Wuhan over Saturday and Sunday and are now in two mountain quarantine centres being managed by the army where they will be kept for two weeks. In Kerala, 2,239 people are under observation and 84 have been admitted to various hospitals \u2013 the vast majority of the 2,815 people are presently under community surveillance across India\u2019s 29 states. The Indian government has revised the travel advisory asking the public to refrain from travelling to China and ordered that anyone who has travelled to China since 15 January 2020 should report themselves and be put in quarantine. The government has also temporarily suspended the e-Visa facility for Chinese passport holders and e-Visas already issued to Chinese nationals are also not valid temporarily. Foreigners who have flown from or transited through China are barred from New Zealand for two weeks beginning Monday, and the government has raised its warning level for the country to \u201cdo not travel\u201d. The national carrier, Air New Zealand, has suspended its Auckland-Shanghai route until late March. Citizens, permanent residents and their families returning to New Zealand from China are subject to additional checks by nurses at the border, and required to isolate themselves for 14 days upon returning. Those who wanted to leave Wuhan province have faced a longer wait and an impending quarantine period: a plane carrying about 250 people \u2013 New Zealanders, Australians, and people from the Pacific Islands \u2013 is due to land in Auckland on Wednesday. Those onboard will be quarantined at a military base on New Zealand\u2019s North Island for two weeks, where officials said they would have access to remote working, education, and recreation facilities. Australia has separately evacuated 243 people, including 89 children, who were in Wuhan to an immigration detention centre on remote Christmas Island, where they will be quarantined for 14 days. There have been no recorded cases of the virus in North Korea, but the country has taken measures to guard against the disease amid warnings that an epidemic could put an intolerable strain on its poor healthcare infrastructure. North Korea has suspended flights from China and Russia and closed train routes across its borders with those two countries. It has also imposed a ban on foreign tourism and suspended operations at a liaison office it runs with South Korea just north of the demilitarised zone, the heavily armed border separating North and South Korea. The country\u2019s authorities have stepped up border inspections and health screenings of North Koreans returning from overseas business trips, according to the Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper of the ruling Workers\u2019 party. The newspaper said 30,000 health workers had been mobilised to monitor residents and distribute advice on how to avoid becoming infected. Europe Italy has evacuated 56 people from Wuhan and is quarantining them for two weeks at a military facility near Rome. A passenger who was expected to be on the flight remained in Wuhan after coming down with a fever. The condition of a Chinese couple being treated for coronavirus at Rome\u2019s Lazzaro Spallanzani institute for infectious diseases health has worsened, the hospital has said. Italy has a state of emergency in place for the next six months, allowing authorities to unlock investment to try and prevent the spread of the virus. Flights between Italy and China have also been suspended. Panic over the virus continues in Italy, with general practitioners and hospital emergency units overwhelmed with people suffering flu symptoms or simply seeking information from professionals. Codacons, the consumers\u2019 group, has called for group tours at popular sites including the Colosseum to be banned. Two flights bringing repatriated citizens from China have arrived in France. The first flight brought back 180 French citizens from the Wuhan region. A second flight brought back 250 passengers, mostly EU citizens, including 65 French nationals. The repatriated French people are being held in quarantine for two weeks either at a specially prepared centre in a firefighters\u2019 training school at Aix-en-Provence, or a holiday centre at Carry-le-Rouet, in the Bouches-du-Rhone. France has six reported cases of coronavirus. Two patients, a man of 31 and a woman of 31, are in a Paris hospital in a serious but not life-threatening condition. A 48-year-old man of \u201cChinese origin\u201d is in hospital in Bordeaux in a stable condition, a Chinese tourist aged 80 is in intensive care in a Paris hospital, and his daughter, who tested positive for the virus, is also in hospital. The first reported case of human-to-human transmission in France is a GP said to have contracted the virus after examining one of the above in Paris. A total of 12 people have tested positive with the virus in Germany so far. Eight of them are employees of car part supplier Webasto, headquartered in Stockdorf, Bavaria; two are the children of one of the employees. Four of the infected Webasto employees had taken part in a training workshop that was run by a Chinese employee who had only started to feel ill on her return flight to China, where she was subsequently tested positive for the 2019-nCov virus. The company\u2019s headquarters in Stockdorf have been disinfected by experts over the weekend and are to remain closed until 11 February. A further 140 employees were tested for the virus, and 80 of them have been ordered to stay indoors and avoid human contact even though their test results had returned negative. People arriving in Germany from Wuhan are being assessed at Frankfurt airport\u2019s medical assessment centre, and then brought to German army barracks in Germersheim, near Heidelberg, where they are put into quarantine for 14 days from arrival or outbreak of the virus. Two German citizens were tested positive after being flown from Wuhan to Frankfurt on a chartered Luftwaffe flight. The United Kingdom flew back 83 people from Wuhan on Friday with 11 arriving via France on Sunday. All are being quarantined at Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral, where they will stay in staff accommodation and be monitored around the clock for 14 days. Ireland has no confirmed case of coronavirus and is not quarantining people but officials in hazmat suits escorted a passenger from an airplane as a precaution. The man, believed to be from China, was transferred to an ambulance on Saturday after arriving in Dublin on an Aeroflot flight from Russia. He had flu-like symptoms but a test revealed he did not have coronavirus. Last week test results had to be sent to the UK but Ireland\u2019s National Virus Reference Laboratory now has kits, speeding up tests. A military cargo plane from Turkey on Saturday airlifted 34 Turkish citizens, seven Azerbaijanis, seven Georgians, and one Albanian from Wuhan after medical checks confirmed they were not infected. They are all under a 14-day quarantine at a hospital in Ankara. A Chinese citizen suspected of infection was held in quarantine on arrival in Istanbul for 36 hours then voluntarily returned home after that. Seven people evacuated from Wuhan arrived in Hungary on Sunday and will be quarantined for two weeks. Russia has sent planes to China as it begins its evacuation from Wuhan and Hubei province. More than 700 Russians are said to be living in the region, of whom 132 had expressed a desire to return to Russia, the country\u2019s embassy in Beijing has reported. They will be subject to a two-week quarantine period at a sanatorium in Tyumen region with a guarded perimeter. In the past few days, Russia has quickly stepped up travel restrictions to and from China. Late Monday night, the government announced a temporary ban on direct travel for foreigners from China to Russia, except via Moscow\u2019s Sheremetyevo airport. Two cases of infection have been reported in Russia, one in Siberia and the other in Russia\u2019s far east. Both of the victims are Chinese citizens. One of the men, Yan Wunbin, wrote in a letter to the Chita.ru website that he was never given his test results and only learned that he had been diagnosed with the coronavirus from media reports. He complained about conditions at the hospital in Russia\u2019s Zabaykalsky Krai region about 240 miles from the Chinese border. There were not enough doctors on call and he was worried for the health of his two-year-old daughter, who was ill and in quarantine with him. Middle East The United Arab Emirates has recorded five cases of coronavirus, four of whom are Chinese tourists from the same family. Emirates officials say the family, along with a fifth patient, have been quarantined in local hospitals in rooms that have lower air pressure than normal. Air can flow into these rooms, but not out, minimising the risk of the virus spreading. As one of the world\u2019s most important transit hubs, with major airports in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, an outbreak of the virus there would be of particular concern. Authorities say they are confident in their ability to contain its spread, and on Tuesday took further measures to do so \u2013 banning most flights to and from mainland China and introducing strict protocols, involving up to eight hours of vetting and health checks for anyone wanting to travel from Beijing, which remains the only route still flown, and only by Emirates Airlines. Officials in the UAE say the threat from Middle East respiratory syndrome six years ago sparked a comprehensive response this time round. Mers was an even more potent form of coronavirus, killing up to 17% of those who contracted it. By contrast the current virus has a death rate of closer to 3%. The five patients in the UAE will be quarantined for 14 days in government-run hospitals. Africa There have been no verified infections in Africa to date, but several countries, including Ethiopia, Kenya, Angola, Botswana and Ivory Coast, have signalled possible infections. Confirming or ruling out coronavirus in the continent can take time, as health authorities lacking expertise have to send samples to labs in countries such as South Africa. The WHO has identified 13 top priority countries on the continent, including much of eastern, central and southern Africa, which either have direct links or a high volume of travel to China. All the concerned states have put in place controls at airports, using thermal cameras to detect potentially infected passengers, and have readied isolation units. At the weekend, Air Tanzania joined five other African airlines in suspending or restricting flights to China, though Ethiopia\u2019s national flag carrier, which carries almost half of all passengers, has maintained flights. Nigeria has urged any person arriving from China to \u201cself-isolate\u201d for at least two weeks, even if they are not ill, and in Mozambique, the government has suspended visas for Chinese citizens and forbidden its citizens from travelling there. Authorities in South Africa said they had set up an emergency operations centre and were monitoring passengers at 36 entry points. The one confirmed case of an African with coronavirus is a 21-year-old student from Cameroon living in Jingzhou city, one of more than 80,000 students from the continent in Africa. At least 4,000 of that number are believed to be in Wuhan. Americas The Trump administration declared the coronavirus a public health emergency and has severely limited who can enter the United States based on their travels to China. People who recently travelled to mainland China and are neither permanent residents nor immediate relatives of permanent residents will not be allowed to enter the country. It is the most severe travel restriction since a smallpox outbreak prompted mandatory quarantines five decades ago. Citizens and permanent residents returning from Hubei, the province including Wuhan, will be quarantined on military bases for two weeks. Americans returning from other parts of mainland China will be subject to a two-week at-home quarantine. All three major US airlines have cancelled services to China and US officials are \u201cfunnelling\u201d all travellers from China to just seven airports in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Honolulu, Seattle and Atlanta. To date, 11 people in the US have been diagnosed with the coronavirus, two of whom live outside Chicago. Canada has chartered an aircraft to evacuate 304 citizens from Wuhan. Upon arrival in Canada, all passengers on the flight will be quarantined for two weeks at CFB Trenton, a military base in Ontario. Instead of barring travellers from China, Canada has instead requested that they self-report any symptoms related to the coronavirus, resisting calls for broader screening measures. Of the four confirmed cases in Canada \u2013 all of which were self-reported \u2013 one patient has been discharged from hospital following a successful recovery. So far no cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Latin America, but there are particular fears over how Venezuela\u2019s collapsed health service might cope with any outbreak. But regional governments have begun taking steps to identify any possible cases and evacuate citizens from Wuhan. Private companies are also acting. Uber this week said it had suspended the accounts of two drivers and 240 users in Mexico after discovering that a Chinese man who was later diagnosed with coronavirus in the United States had used the ride-hailing service while visiting the capital. In the northern city of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez the Taiwanese tech giant Foxconn reportedly placed 45 Chinese business people in informal quarantine at one of its factories as a precautionary measure since many employees had visited Wuhan. But Mexican newspapers have raised concerns that citizens returning from China are not being screened on arrival. Mexico\u2019s health ministry says only those arriving from Hubei province are being examined. Brazil said on Sunday that it would evacuate its citizens from Wuhan by plane after facing criticism for its slow response. Once back in Brazil, those evacuated are expected to be placed in quarantine on a military base.

      "bodyText": "African countries are rushing to reinforce their defences against the rapidly spreading coronavirus, as health officials say many countries on the continent are ill-equipped to combat the potentially lethal disease. There have been no verified infections in Africa to date, but porous borders, a continuing flow of travellers and poorly resourced healthcare systems have raised fears that the virus could spread rapidly if the precautions of local authorities prove inadequate. Dr Ambrose Otau Talisuna from the World Health Organization\u2019s Africa office said on Tuesday that the risk of an outbreak on the continent was \u201cvery, very high\u201d and that there were significant concerns about the ability of \u201cfragile health systems\u201d to cope with the epidemic. There have been 20,438 confirmed infections in China, including 425 deaths, as well as at least 185 confirmed cases in 25 countries, and two deaths outside China. On Friday, the WHO sent out a guidance note to all countries on how to prepare for a possible outbreak, warning that speed was essential to ensure the \u201cnovel coronavirus does not overwhelm health systems\u201d. The organisation has identified 13 top priority countries on the continent, including much of eastern, central and southern Africa, which either have direct links or a high volume of travel to China. All the concerned states have put in place controls at airports, using thermal cameras to detect potentially infected passengers, and have readied isolation units. At the weekend, Air Tanzania joined five other African airlines in suspending or restricting flights to China, though Ethiopia\u2019s national flag carrier, which carries almost half of all passengers, has maintained flights.

A 21-year-old student from Cameroon living in Jingzhou city was reported on Tuesday to be among new cases. \u201cOur greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems,\u201d Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the organisation, said last week. J Stephen Morrison, the director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies in Washington, said the disease risked taking root if it reached certain African countries. He warned that such a scenario could lead to a \u201cglobal pandemic\u201d. A further worry is a shortage of protective equipment for frontline healthworkers and masks as demand soars. Many poor African states have experience of disastrous viral outbreaks such as the Ebola virus, which killed more than 11,000 between 2014 and 2016, and have reinforced their defences. Serufusa Sekidde, a Ugandan public health specialist who was in China during the 2003 (Sars epidemic, said many countries were much better prepared than before, though there were \u201cstill lots of loopholes\u201d. \u201cCommunication and coordination varies from place to place. Tracking and surveillance is better in some countries, especially those with experience of Ebola and polio,\u201d Sekidde said. In Kenya, the ministry of health has moved to reassure citizens and has dealt rapidly with reports of suspected cases, including one at a Chinese construction company in the west of the country. \u201cI think, as in most developing countries, the weakness is ultimately in the entire health system: the ability to rapidly detect and then isolate the cases that occur,\u201d said Dr Rudolf Richard Eggers, the WHO country representative in Nairobi. \u201cIf the numbers are small, then that can probably be done reasonably efficiently. If the numbers rise like they did in Ebola in west Africa, the health systems get overwhelmed pretty quickly.\u201d Nigeria has urged anybody arriving from China to \u201cself-isolate\u201d for at least two weeks, even if they are not ill, and in Mozambique, the government has suspended visas for Chinese citizens and forbidden its citizens from travelling there. Authorities in South Africa said they had set up an emergency operations centre and were monitoring passengers at 36 entry points. The South African post office has stopped sending or receiving parcels from China. More than 40 alerts in the country have been investigated so far.

A cut of 1m and up towards 2m barrels a day is probably what the market is expecting.<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If [the coronavirus outbreak] does accelerate outside of China, then clearly OPEC has a totally different situation on its hands.

Max Jones, of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking\u2019s infrastructure and construction team, says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Conversations on the ground suggest that a more stable political atmosphere is already providing cause for optimism. If a raft of major infrastructure projects get the green light, especially those in the Midlands and the north following recent promises, then this will be heightened. This will boost order books in the long run and persuade others to invest, although recent rumblings around the fate of the biggest project of all \u2013 HS2 \u2013 will still be of concern in boardrooms.</p> <p>Contractors are acutely aware that construction is a cyclical sector and is generally aligned to the wider economy.

Some construction firms cited a lack of tender opportunities to help replace completed infrastructure contracts.</p> <p>Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit, which compiles the construction survey, says: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The construction sector downturn lost intensity in January amid slower reductions in house building, commercial work and civil engineering activity. Measured overall, the latest dip in construction output was much shallower than in December, with survey respondents often commenting on improved willingness to spend among clients since the general election. </p> <p>Commercial work dropped at the slowest pace since the start of 2019 and was the main beneficiary of receding political uncertainty. UK construction companies also commented on signs of a turnaround in demand conditions across the residential development category during January. </p> <p>Despite concerns about prospects for work on infrastructure projects, latest data revealed a strong rebound in business optimism across the construction sector as a whole in January. The degree of positivity reached its highest level since April 2018, driven by hopes that improving confidence among clients will continue to translate into new contract awards over the course of 2020.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3eb621acadd215639ed7e69cfa861f6039a6804\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3eb621acadd215639ed7e69cfa861f6039a6804/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A worker positions brickwork at a Willmott Dixon housing development construction site at Ashton Rise, near Bristol.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A worker positions brickwork at a Willmott Dixon housing development construction site at Ashton Rise, near Bristol.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e393b348f08e1332473cb60\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-04T09:41:16.429Z\">9.41am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">UK construction falls at slowest pace since May</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here in the UK, the latest monthly snapshot on the construction sector from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply is out.

The FTSE 100 index in London is 1.48% ahead while Germany\u2019s Dax is 1.52% higher and France\u2019s CAC has gained 1.42%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones has climbed 1.32%, the Nasdaq is up 1.23% and the S&amp;P 500 has risen 1.17%. Asian markets saw similar gains.

A stronger construction survey helped lift the pound. And in Vienna, technical experts from the Opec oil cartel and its allies including Russia are meeting to discuss potential production cuts. Chinese fuel consumption has slumped following the virus outbreak. Any cuts to supply would only be announced at a meeting of energy ministers, according to Iraq\u2019s oil ministry spokesman Assem Jihad. Ministers could hold an emergency meeting in mid-February. With this, we are saying good-bye. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Members of the Opec oil cartel and their ally Russia are discussing a further cut to crude oil output at their meeting in Vienna due to China\u2019s coronavirus epidemic, according to Iraq\u2019s oil ministry. Crude prices have tumbled since the deadly outbreak in China, the world\u2019s biggest importer of oil. Iraq is Opec\u2019s second-biggest oil producer. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are holding a meeting of a \u201cjoint technical committee\u201d in Vienna today and tomorrow to assess the situation. Iraq\u2019s oil ministry spokesman Assem Jihad told AFP: Depending on the needs of the market and how it\u2019s been affected by the coronavirus, will a cut be necessary? This is being discussed as the technical reports are presented. The technical committees are discussing the recommendations, which they will elevate to their ministers. Any further cut to outputs would only be announced in a ministerial meeting. Jihad said those gathered would also consider bringing forward a March ministerial meeting to February \u201cdepending on the market\u2019s needs and what happens with the virus\u201d. Russian energy minister Alexander Novak also said the schedule could be changed. He told reporters: We have a meeting in March but we can hold it earlier if necessary. The new coronavirus has killed more than 400 people and infected a further 20,000 in China since emerging in December, and has also spread to more than 20 other countries. Brent crude has fallen by around 20% since early January while the US benchmark oil contract, WTI, has fallen by around 18% over the past month. Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s top oil exporter, said this week that the impact of the virus on oil demand was \u201cextremely limited\u201d and \u201cdriven by psychological factors\u201d. But if the virus continues to spread, there could be a more severe hit to the market, said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com in London. \u201cThis kind of oil demand shock has not been seen for over a decade.

The Chinese industrial firm Jingye, run by a former Communist party official, is in the final stages of negotiations to buy British Steel, including the Hayange plant in northern France. But the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has reportedly told the UK chancellor, Sajid Javid, that Paris is opposed to a Chinese firm owning a plant that supplies track to France\u2019s vast rail network.

In other retail news, supermarket sales of no- and low-alcohol beer jumped nearly 40% in \u201cdry January\u201d. The food industry estimates 4.2 million Britons cut out booze in January this year. Others opted for Veganuary, cutting out all animal products. This boosted sales of meat substitutes such as soya mince and vegetarian burgers by 14% and lentils by 6%. US stock index futures are pointing to a higher open on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 expected to open 1.3% higher and the Nasdaq seen rising 1.5%. Last week the S&amp;P 500 had it worst weekly fall in six months. Buoyant US factory data helped lift US stocks yesterday. The Institute for Supply Management\u2019s monthly snapshot showed a surprise rise in US factory activity in January, ending five months of declines. In China, fresh intervention by the central bank has helped calm nerves. The People\u2019s Bank of China has injected 1.7 trillian yuan ($243bn) into money markets over the past two days, boosting Chinese stocks. The Shanghai composite rose 1.3% while the blue-chip CSI 300 climbed 2.6% after a near-8% slide yesterday when markets reopened after the extended lunar new year break. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng gained 1.2%. Markets seem less concerned about the coronavirus, even though Hong Kong recorded its first death today \u2013 which is only the second fatality outside mainland China. Bloomberg has drawn up this useful chart looking at the drivers of oil prices so far this year, splitting them into supply and demand issues. Britain has told its citizens to leave China if they can (airlines have suspended flights), Reuters is reporting. The Foreign Office has updated its travel advice. It also said some staff and their families from the British embassy and consulates are being withdrawn from China. Essential staff, such as people providing consular assistance, will remain in situ. The Opec+ meeting was due to start at noon London time. Michael Burns, oil and gas partner at law firm Ashurst, says: The oil industry faces both the immediate issue of the coronavirus but also a longer term challenge of market sentiment around oil as an energy resource of the future. These are two significant challenges with varying impacts on demand profiles, but it is not surprising that OPEC and its partners are looking to meet to decide what actions they can take to mitigate the impacts of the challenge perceived as the most immediate in the form of the coronavirus. Here is a chart from financial markets data firm Refinitiv that shows sterling\u2019s moves over the past year. Officials from the world\u2019s biggest oil producing nations are meeting in Vienna today and tomorrow. Technical experts from the Opec oil cartel and its allies such as Russia (a group known as Opec+) are discussing the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the oil market. Chinese fuel consumption is estimated to have fallen by 1m (BP\u2019s estimate) to 3m barrels a day. The oil price has fallen sharply since early January and entered a bear market yesterday. Opec+ officials are thought to be considering whether to cut oil output by a further 500,000 barrels a day. This has boosted oil prices today. Brent crude is up 39 cents or 0.72% at $54.84 a barrel, while US crude is up 75 cents, or 1.5%, at $50.86. World equity markets are pushing higher for a second day, amid hopes that the spread of the deadly virus can be contained, and after the People\u2019s Bank of China acted to inject more liquidity into China\u2019s money markets. FTSE 100 index in London up 109 points, or 1.49%, at 7435 Germany\u2019s Dax up 1.1% at 13,203 France\u2019s CAC up 1.31% at 5909 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 1.86% at 23.905 On currency markets, sterling fell through $1.30 earlier today on fears of a hard Brexit, but has reversed its declines and is now 0.1% higher against the dollar at $1.3008. Against the euro, it has strengthened by 0.26% to \u20ac1.1777. Ikea has announced its first-ever big store closure in the UK. It plans to shuts its Coventry city centre store this summer and has pointed to high operating costs and changes in customer behaviour, which have led to \u201cconsistent losses\u201d. The move puts 350 jobs at risk. It is one of 22 Ikea stores in the UK and was opened in 2007. Ikea says: Given its location and the size of the land available at the time, the store was built over seven levels, which resulted in a significant impact on the operating costs of the store and the shopping experience for customers. In addition, the changing behaviour of customers in the area who prefer to shop in retail parks and online has resulted in visitor numbers being substantially lower than expected and continuing to decrease over time. These factors have led to the store making consistent losses. Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at the Nordic bank SEB, the leading Nordic corporate bank, says the market seems content that China will contain the coronavirus situation and that OPEC+ will act to prevent a surplus of oil. Technical experts from Opec and its allies, including Russia, are meeting in Vienna today and tomorrow to assess the demand situation. The continued daily growth rate in coronavirus infections will be key to how severe the outbreak will become. Ten days ago, the daily growth rate was more than 50%, but the daily growth rate today is 18.6% versus 19.5% yesterday. A slightly slowing daily growth rate in infections and no signs of an acceleration outside of China is probably calming markets. Wuhan is China\u2019s biggest inland transportation hub and today it is close to a ghost town with more than 40m people in lock-down. Chinese refineries are cutting throughput by 10% to 20%, with some located in central China cutting as much as 40%. How large the run-cuts will be through February 2020 remains to be seen, but somewhere between 10% to 20% seems like a fair bet. That means 1.4 -2.8m barrels a day in lost crude oil processing and crude demand for February. Schieldrop says if Opec+\u2019s technical committee concludes there is only a need for a cut of 500,000 barrels a day, the market will probably be disappointed. A cut of 1m and up towards 2m barrels a day is probably what the market is expecting. If [the coronavirus outbreak] does accelerate outside of China, then clearly OPEC has a totally different situation on its hands. For now, the market seems content that China will contain and manage the virus situation, and that the worst will soon be over with no accelerated spreading outside of China, and that OPEC+ will step in with cuts and prevent a surplus and a stock building. Goldman Sachs estimates the coronavirus outbreak will only have a modest impact on 2020 global growth \u2013 assuming the travel restrictions and other measures taken by authorities in China and elsewhere reduce the rate of new infections by the end of March. Economists at Goldman are forecasting a hit to global GDP growth this year of 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points. Producer prices in the eurozone fell year-on-year in December for the fifth month in a row, but the decline slowed from November, according to figures from the EU statistics office. Eurostat said prices at the factory gate in the 19 countries sharing the euro dropped by 0.7% in December from a year earlier, following a 1.4% fall in November. Prices were flat month-on-month, after a 0.1% rise in November. Producer prices eventually feed through to consumer prices. The European Central Bank wants to keep consumer inflation close to 2% over the medium term but it has been far below that rate, despite the central bank\u2019s bond-buying programmes. Headline inflation picked up to 1.4% in January from 1.3% in December. The credit ratings agency S&amp;P has published its research on the economic impact of the coronavirus. While the situation is obviously a fluid one, our base-case projection is that the coronavirus crisis will stabilise globally in April 2020, with virtually no new transmissions in May. Our worst-case projection holds that the virus stops spreading in late May, and optimistically in March. In turn, this suggests that the peak impact on economic activity across Asia-Pacific will be in the first and second quarters. Growth should stabilise later in 2020 and recover through early 2021 as the temporary effect on activity wanes. In China, lockdowns and quarantines have depressed passenger flows in air and rail, and have closed property sales offices. This supports our view that the economic hit will be felt most keenly in household-related spending. Relief measures including tax cuts and subsidies are likely. However, if the disease is not swiftly brought under control, slower economic growth would exacerbate already weaker fiscal performance in many parts of the Asia-Pacific. Back to UK construction, which improved somewhat in January to decline at the slowest pace since May. Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement &amp; Supply, has sounded a note of caution. Job losses are still in evidence overall and with an increase in sub-contractor use, it appears the sector is looking for short-term fixes to manage current workloads. Construction firms are not yet ready to scale up plans to increase workforces in the coming months without a stronger economic and political recovery clearly in sight. So, though this rebound is a welcome sign, as with all sudden improvements, the danger remains the sector could easily recoil and shrink again. The domestic political situation and the UK\u2019s attempt to find its place in the world remains littered with obstacles so businesses could find themselves on this see-saw of good and bad news for some time yet. The pound has just staged a small recovery, after falling through $1.30 earlier this morning to trade at levels last seen before the general election in mid-December. Sterling suffered sharp declines yesterday when Boris Johnson and the EU\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier set out their negotiating positions ahead of next month\u2019s trade talks. The UK prime minister\u2019s comments revived fears of a no deal. Against the dollar, sterling is now up 0.1% at $1.3006 and versus the euro, it is 0.14% higher at \u20ac1.1764. Sterling is the worst performer this month on Bloomberg\u2019s world index of major currencies. The new year has brought some cheer to Britain\u2019s struggling construction sector, the latest PMI survey suggests. Max Jones, of Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking\u2019s infrastructure and construction team, says: Conversations on the ground suggest that a more stable political atmosphere is already providing cause for optimism. If a raft of major infrastructure projects get the green light, especially those in the Midlands and the north following recent promises, then this will be heightened. This will boost order books in the long run and persuade others to invest, although recent rumblings around the fate of the biggest project of all \u2013 HS2 \u2013 will still be of concern in boardrooms. Contractors are acutely aware that construction is a cyclical sector and is generally aligned to the wider economy. However, there is usually a lag so even if recent forecasts of a more buoyant economy this year come to fruition, it may take time to show up in the construction data. House building was the best performing area, where output fell only slightly in January. Commercial construction also improved, while civil engineering was the worst performing category. Some construction firms cited a lack of tender opportunities to help replace completed infrastructure contracts. Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit, which compiles the construction survey, says: The construction sector downturn lost intensity in January amid slower reductions in house building, commercial work and civil engineering activity. Measured overall, the latest dip in construction output was much shallower than in December, with survey respondents often commenting on improved willingness to spend among clients since the general election. Commercial work dropped at the slowest pace since the start of 2019 and was the main beneficiary of receding political uncertainty. UK construction companies also commented on signs of a turnaround in demand conditions across the residential development category during January. Despite concerns about prospects for work on infrastructure projects, latest data revealed a strong rebound in business optimism across the construction sector as a whole in January. The degree of positivity reached its highest level since April 2018, driven by hopes that improving confidence among clients will continue to translate into new contract awards over the course of 2020. Here in the UK, the latest monthly snapshot on the construction sector from IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply is out. It suggests things have improved somewhat on Britain\u2019s building sites. Construction output fell last month at the slowest pace since last May, with the headline PMI index rising to 48.4 from 44.4 in December, still below the 50 mark that divides expansion from contraction. Firms\u2019 new business volumes were close to stabilisation, after sharp declines in the fourth quarter of last year. The survey says: Looking ahead, construction companies are now the most optimistic about their growth prospects since April 2018. A number of firms noted that clients\u2019 willingness to spend had picked up after the general election, which should translate into rising workloads over the course of 2020. Stock markets appear unfazed, however, and are pushing higher across Europe. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 up 1.43% at 7430, a gain of more than 100 points Germany\u2019s Dax up 0.98% at 13,173 France\u2019s CAC up 1.07% at 589 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB up 1.53% at 23,817 The number of people infected with the coronavirus now exceeds 20,000 in China, and Hong Kong has reported its first death \u2013 only the second outside mainland China. The death toll in China from the virus has climbed to 425. It has also emerged that a British passenger who was evacuated to the UK from Wuhan on Sunday was taken ill on the plane and escorted directly to hospital on landing. You can read the latest on the outbreak here: Russia is \u201cready to cooperate\u201d with the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the world\u2019s biggest oil cartel, to restore stability on the global oil market, a Kremlin spokesman said, according to Reuters. The Kremlin said Russian president Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman spoke by phone. However, there were no comments on whether Russia supports further cuts to supply. Technical experts from Opec and its allies, including Russia, known as Opec+, are meeting in Vienna today and tomorrow to discuss the coronavirus outbreak and potential oil production cuts. There could then be an emergency meeting of energy ministers on 14 and 15 February. His comments came as BP reported a 21% drop in 2019 profits to 10bn (\u00a37.7bn), due to weaker oil and gas prices. Last year the global oil price averaged $64.36 a barrel, down sharply from an average of just over $71 in 2018. This has fallen further to around $54 a barrel this week. The outgoing BP chief executive, Bob Dudley, agreed to bump up dividend payouts to shareholders despite the sharp fall in the oil giant\u2019s profits, as he prepares to retire after a decade at the helm. There seems little doubt that oil demand in China has dropped since the coronavirus outbreak started, but different figures are being bandied around. Bloomberg reported that fuel consumption could be down as much as 3m barrels a day, a 20% drop. BP\u2019s chief financial officer Brian Gilvary has just said that the virus outbreak has reduced Chinese oil demand by 1m barrels a day so far. Globally, he reckons that the economic slowdown \u2013 caused by a drop in industrial activity and flight cancellations \u2013 in the wake of the deadly virus outbreak has reduced oil demand so far by 200,000 to 300,000 barrels a day, and this could rise to 300,000 to 500,000 barrels a day over 2020. Oil entered a bear market yesterday. A bear market refers to a price decline of 20% or more from recent highs, typically over a period of two months. Brent crude, the global benchmark, fell by over 4% to a low of $54.17 a barrel yesterday, its weakest level in more than a year. This took since early January to more than 20%. However, today oil prices have bounced back a bit, ahead of the Opec+ meeting in Vienna. Brent crude is up 0.5% at $54.74 a barrel while US crude has gained 1% to $50.61 a barrel. There are hopes that the Opec oil cartel and its allies could agree to cut oil output by a further 500,000 barrels a day. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a note: Oil prices are now at levels where we would expect a supply response from both Opec and shale producers, and where China would likely seek to build crude inventories. European shares have risen at the opening bell. The FTSE 100 index in London is now up nearly 100 points to 7425, a 1.37% gain. France\u2019s CAC rose 0.5% and Spain\u2019s Ibex advanced 0.6%. Global equity markets started their recovery yesterday following last week\u2019s sell-off, with the exception of Chinese markets, which reopened after the extended lunar new year break \u2013 they fell nearly 8%. Today, all Asian markets are in the green, as are European indices. Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, says: Extra liquidity courtesy of Chinese central bankers, instructions from authorities \u2018not to panic\u2019 and perhaps some state-backed institutional buying seems to have done the trick. China became the world\u2019s biggest oil importer in 2016 when it overtook the US. It consumes about 14m barrels a day \u2013 equivalent to the combined consumption of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, Japan and south Korea, according to Bloomberg. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A degree of calm has returned to world stock markets, after the coronavirus outbreak in southern China sparked heavy selling last week. In China, the Shanghai composite closed 1.34% higher while the Shenzhen share index rose 1.8% after the People\u2019s Bank of China acted to stabilise markets. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rose 1.23% while Japan\u2019s Nikkei gained 0.49%. European stock markets are also expected to rise at the open. Officials from the world\u2019s largest oil producers are meeting in Vienna, the headquarters of the Opec oil cartel, today and tomorrow to discuss the sharp slide in the crude oil price following the coronavirus outbreak. Technical experts from Opec and its allies, including Russia, will be there (a group known as Opec+). They will discuss whether to hold an emergency meeting at ministerial level in mid-February, bringing forward a meeting scheduled for early March. Further production cuts are on the agenda, of 500,000 barrels a day. The New York Times reported that energy ministers could consider a bigger cut of up to 1m barrels a day \u2013 or 1% of world supplies. China is the world\u2019s biggest oil importer and fuel consumption appears to have plummeted by as much as 20%, with travel curbs in place and cities quarantined, Bloomberg reported. It said Chinese oil demand has dropped by about 3m barrels a day \u2013 probably the biggest demand shock in the oil market since the financial crisis of 2008/9. Brent crude, the global benchmark, is trading at $54.60 a barrel this morning while US crude is at $50.5, after falling below $50 yesterday. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, says oil is in a \u201cproper bear market\u201d now after the latest steep falls. What initially was thought to be a temporary hit to the market now looks demand destruction proper. This kind of oil demand shock has not been seen for over a decade. The longer the lockdown in China and travel restrictions globally the greater the impact. OPEC and allies are worried and are bringing forward the March meeting to this month. There is talk of OPEC+ adding 500,000 barrels per day to cuts of 1.8m bpd, but they\u2019re just getting crushed by this market. Too much uncertainty to see a turn yet - traders are getting burned trying to call the bottom.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>For many, a decision to leave could have significant personal, financial and professional ramifications, as it seems increasingly likely that the outbreak may last weeks or even months, so any absence would be long-term.</p> \n<p>Those who have set up or run businesses may worry about how they will operate without key staff.

Are we now in a better position to tackle and ultimately contain this virus? The answer is both yes and no.</p> <p>Yes, because the Chinese response was relatively swift, open and helpful, compared with 17 years before. The viral DNA signature was determined and published in record time, as were case reports about the illness. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/23/coronavirus-panic-and-anger-in-wuhan-as-china-orders-city-into-lockdown\" title=\"\">Locking down Wuhan</a> and curtailing the mass movement of citizens during a major holiday period look to have been wise moves. But also no, because before coming to its senses the initial government response did hark back to Sars: a kneejerk cover-up, presumably born of an unwillingness to admit that a major crisis could be in the offing. As a result, the scourge went unchecked for days, allowing people to spread the disease widely within China\u2019s borders and, inevitably, outside them. </p> <p>And though its exact genesis is unclear, the virus emerged in the fertile breeding ground of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/23/animal-trade-in-spotlight-as-china-seeks-source-of-coronavirus\" title=\"\">wild animal market</a>. Despite knowing full well that these places are outbreak incubators, the Chinese authorities failed to regulate them out of existence after Sars. For all we know, they never will.</p> <p>Yet it is wrong to assume that had China only played by the rules this epidemic would never have happened. Viruses do not respect rules, and they do not always act predictably. They have one sole purpose: to create copies of themselves and to pass them on. They have no innate malevolence, but simply the imperative to find a new host in which to survive, as without such protection they will perish. A \u201chot\u201d virus in a remote village may kill off all of its potential hosts before it has a chance to spread; a pandemic virus has to be more subtle.</p> <p>To an emerging pathogen, hosts of a different species present both a threat and an opportunity. Faced with a wild west of unfamiliar tissues and inhospitable docking points, the cross-species incursion is often a very short ride. Yet a potential paradise awaits those that can adapt: an immune system that will give it an initial pass because it has never encountered it before, and an entire population for further onward transmission. Thrust into a crucible of pure natural selection, the virus can throw off millions of slight mutants of itself in the hope that one of them will \u201cstick\u201d \u2013 allowing safe passage into accommodating tissue, subverting our cells into dutiful photocopiers, tickling the lungs into coughing fits to propel its progeny towards the next victim. Viruses can mutate in real time: the Wuhan virus, which at the moment has not moved far beyond those intially exposed to it, may at any point become more virulent.</p> <p>You also don\u2019t need a wild animal market to stumble across a new pathogen. As we slash through virgin forests, we will rub shoulders with animals that have never seen humans before (bearing viruses that are similarly naive). As our planet warms, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/24/climate-change-thawing-deadly-diseases-anthrax\" title=\"\">melting permafrost could release viruses</a> held in stasis for millennia, and disease vectors will push into territories once too cold for them. Our ever-increasing appetite for global travel, and the growth of super-cities, will amplify the number of chance encounters, many of which, in a less complex era of fewer people, would have simply burned out.</p> <p>While it is almost certainly the case that there will be more frequent coronavirus outbreaks in the future, it\u2019s impossible to know which viral class will cause the next Big One: our old nemesis influenza, a retrovirus like HIV, a haemorrhagic virus like Ebola, a flavivirus like dengue, West Nile and Zika \u2013 or something entirely unknown to science. This is why we must avoid the temptation to put all our eggs in one basket; it would surely be a mistake to blow the budget on coronavirus research when the next thing may well turn out to be something entirely different.</p> <p>As we can\u2019t predict which pathogen will give us grief, the most important thing we can do is to invest in preparedness itself. Don\u2019t get me wrong: great science is compelling stuff, and I\u2019ve been impressed with how quickly the scientific community has responded. Advances in so-called <a href=\"https://www.who.int/biologicals/areas/vaccines/dna/en/\" title=\"\">DNA vaccines</a> circumvent the need for virus isolation and biological experimentation: all you need is the blueprint, and you\u2019re good to go. Within days of the Chinese sequencing the virus, a number of labs used the published code to start crafting a vaccine based on genetic material. It\u2019s early days, as no DNA vaccine has yet been licensed for use, but it\u2019s clear that in a relatively short time this technology will become a lifesaver.</p> <p>But as amazing as our science has and will become, it is probably public health and prevention that will do the lion\u2019s share of keeping us safe. Worthy, boring activities such as legislating against situations where people can come into contact easily with exotic animals; increasing the availability and uptake of hand sanitisers; developing more effective mass-produced masks; enhanced port-of-entry surveillance; incentivising open communication about outbreaks in cultures in which such candour is problematic; getting better at hospital management, triage and life-support of the critically ill.</p> <p>None of this comes cheaply \u2013 the world\u2019s governments need to set aside significant funding. Much as for climate change, countries will have to accept the need to ringfence money even though the worst has not yet happened. Although the Wuhan virus shows that this imperative has never been stronger, such provision has been slashed in recent years. For example, in the United States federal investment has <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/09/28/the-next-pandemic-will-be-arriving-shortly-global-health-infectious-avian-flu-ebola-zoonotic-diseases-trump/\" title=\"\">declined</a> by 50% since 2014, and the Trump administration has overseen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/31/us-coronavirus-budget-cuts-trump-underprepared\" title=\"\">cuts</a> to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with the effect of reducing or stopping epidemic-prevention efforts in 39 out of the 49 countries it had been involved in. A recent report from the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board <a href=\"http://apps.who.int/gpmb/annual_report.html\" title=\"\">painted</a> a bleak portrait of \u201cgaps, weaknesses and inefficiencies\u201d in the world\u2019s response systems. In short, most experts admit that we just aren\u2019t ready for the next highly lethal pandemic.</p> <p>We can only hope that the lessons of Wuhan will be learned in a way that those of Sars were not. For we are all linked, developed nations and developing, democracies and dictatorships alike. Viruses know no borders and respect no ideology: only openness, cooperation, readiness and plenty of money can keep them at bay.</p> <p>\u2022 Jennifer Rohn is a cell biologist at University College London</p>",

Viruses can mutate in real time: the Wuhan virus, which at the moment has not moved far beyond those intially exposed to it, may at any point become more virulent. You also don\u2019t need a wild animal market to stumble across a new pathogen. As we slash through virgin forests, we will rub shoulders with animals that have never seen humans before (bearing viruses that are similarly naive). As our planet warms, melting permafrost could release viruses held in stasis for millennia, and disease vectors will push into territories once too cold for them. Our ever-increasing appetite for global travel, and the growth of super-cities, will amplify the number of chance encounters, many of which, in a less complex era of fewer people, would have simply burned out. While it is almost certainly the case that there will be more frequent coronavirus outbreaks in the future, it\u2019s impossible to know which viral class will cause the next Big One: our old nemesis influenza, a retrovirus like HIV, a haemorrhagic virus like Ebola, a flavivirus like dengue, West Nile and Zika \u2013 or something entirely unknown to science. This is why we must avoid the temptation to put all our eggs in one basket; it would surely be a mistake to blow the budget on coronavirus research when the next thing may well turn out to be something entirely different. As we can\u2019t predict which pathogen will give us grief, the most important thing we can do is to invest in preparedness itself. Don\u2019t get me wrong: great science is compelling stuff, and I\u2019ve been impressed with how quickly the scientific community has responded. Advances in so-called DNA vaccines circumvent the need for virus isolation and biological experimentation: all you need is the blueprint, and you\u2019re good to go. Within days of the Chinese sequencing the virus, a number of labs used the published code to start crafting a vaccine based on genetic material. It\u2019s early days, as no DNA vaccine has yet been licensed for use, but it\u2019s clear that in a relatively short time this technology will become a lifesaver. But as amazing as our science has and will become, it is probably public health and prevention that will do the lion\u2019s share of keeping us safe. Worthy, boring activities such as legislating against situations where people can come into contact easily with exotic animals; increasing the availability and uptake of hand sanitisers; developing more effective mass-produced masks; enhanced port-of-entry surveillance; incentivising open communication about outbreaks in cultures in which such candour is problematic; getting better at hospital management, triage and life-support of the critically ill. None of this comes cheaply \u2013 the world\u2019s governments need to set aside significant funding. Much as for climate change, countries will have to accept the need to ringfence money even though the worst has not yet happened. Although the Wuhan virus shows that this imperative has never been stronger, such provision has been slashed in recent years. For example, in the United States federal investment has declined by 50% since 2014, and the Trump administration has overseen cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with the effect of reducing or stopping epidemic-prevention efforts in 39 out of the 49 countries it had been involved in. A recent report from the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board painted a bleak portrait of \u201cgaps, weaknesses and inefficiencies\u201d in the world\u2019s response systems. In short, most experts admit that we just aren\u2019t ready for the next highly lethal pandemic. We can only hope that the lessons of Wuhan will be learned in a way that those of Sars were not. For we are all linked, developed nations and developing, democracies and dictatorships alike. Viruses know no borders and respect no ideology: only openness, cooperation, readiness and plenty of money can keep them at bay. \u2022 Jennifer Rohn is a cell biologist at University College London",

Firstly, Starmer has proposed ending the ability of the NEC to impose its preferred parliamentary candidates on CLPs; secondly, he wants to force the NEC to publish details of its decisions on the Labour Party website; and thirdly, Starmer will appoint independent bodies to investigate complaints rather than allowing an NEC committee to decide ...</p> <p>The symbolism of these announcements matters almost as much as the substance. Most MPs sympathetic to Starmer believe that he could shape the NEC in his own image if he so wished. They have calculated that the Corbynite wing of the party currently has a majority on the NEC of around six. If elected, Starmer would be able to replace the three positions allocated to shadow cabinet members with his own three appointments. At a stroke, the majority for the party\u2019s left would be wiped out ... </p> <p>The accuracy of these calculations is up for debate. But, if we do believe the maths, and Starmer does have a good chance of refashioning the NEC, then why has he risked antagonising the party\u2019s left by announcing structural changes during the leadership contest?

He says he wants to make the party more \u201copen, respectful, creative and engaging\u201d.</p> <p>Although internal party reform is a relatively niche topic, it is important, particularly in the context of an opposition party leadership election. Candidates have been announcing policy, even though they are unlikely to have any say over government policy for the next four years at least. But whoever wins the leadership election will, potentially, be able to do quite a lot to change Labour. (I say potentially because power is dispersed in Labour, and until the new leader gets control of the national executive committee and party conference, his or her room for manoeuvre may be limited.)</p> <p>Two of Starmer\u2019s proposals are particularly significant.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Starmer says Labour HQ should give up imposing candidates on local parties.</strong> This is something that does not happen routinely, but does happen close to an election when vacancies occur. In the past, under all leaders, this system has allowed the leadership to effectively gift safe seats to favoured candidates. Starmer says he will stop this. In his press release, he says:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Local party members should select their candidates for every election. The NEC should not impose candidates on local parties. More widely, we must improve our selection process. The current system is impenetrable, with too much reliance on who people know rather than what they can do. It costs too much and takes too much time, effectively ruling out potentially excellent candidates. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He says he would set up an independent body to deal with complaints about members.</strong> The national constitutional committee (NCC), the body that currently deals with serious complaints, would be scrapped. His press release says:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our current system does not work to this principle and it should be replaced by an independent panel with experts on racism, sexual harassment and poor personal conduct cases. All members and communities must have confidence in the rigour and independence of our disciplinary procedures. We should extend auto-exclusion to include expressions of clear-cut racism, including anti-semitism.</p> </blockquote> <p>The six other proposals are:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Making candidates more representative.</strong> Starmer says he would like Labour to be able to have all-BAME shortlists, but he says parliament would have to legislate for this first.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Providing better access for disabled members.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Promoting innovative campaigning.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Making policy-making more democratic.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Making Labour decision-making more transparent.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Strengthening links between Labour and the trade unions.</strong></li> </ul>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d162b9316e187ce9f5ef47afd1671bc1e41a562\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d162b9316e187ce9f5ef47afd1671bc1e41a562/0_152_4554_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keir Starmer.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keir Starmer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Hawkins/Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-04T12:43:08.141Z\">at 12.43pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e3954fa8f08e1332473cc18\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-04T11:41:02.349Z\">11.41am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Dominic Cummings,</strong> the PM\u2019s chief adviser, was photographed carrying <a href=\"https://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/chinese-spies/\">a book called Chinese Spies</a> this morning as he arrived at Downing Street.

Mark Carney, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England, who will be a UN climate envoy this year, was also there, along with the Commonwealth secretary general, Lady Scotland, the climate economist Lord Stern, the actor and activist Lily Cole, and the prime minister\u2019s father and long-time environmentalist Stanley Johnson.</p> <p>The Italian prime minister made a brief speech, as Italy is the joint host of COP 26 with the UK and will be holding a pre-COP in Milan and a further meeting in the autumn to prepare the ground for a potential deal. Missing, however, was the UN\u2019s top climate official, Patricia Espinosa.</p> <p><strong>Boris Johnson</strong> did not take questions, there was no press conference, and under the original plan for the launch, media were to be excluded, until a last-minute reversal late on Monday allowed some media to attend.</p> <p>Johnson spent most of his speech on a discussion of the UK\u2019s pioneering inventor of electric taxis, who came up with a prototype late in the 19th century which was briefly adopted in the capital before being replaced by the internal combustion engine.</p> <p>While this gave plenty of opportunity to showcase the new commitment to bring forward the phasing out of diesel and petrol vehicles, and for jokes at the expense of Transport for London, there was little clue as to how the UK\u2019s diplomatic effort to forge a global consensus on tougher carbon targets will be achieved.</p> <p>Central to that effort will be the appointment of a replacement to Claire O\u2019Neill, whose blistering performance on the Today programme (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/feb/04/voters-should-not-trust-johnson-to-keep-his-promises-says-former-tory-minister-sacked-from-climate-conference-role-live-news?page=with:block-5e393f5b8f08e1332473cb7f#block-5e393f5b8f08e1332473cb7f\">10.25am)</a> was the chatter of the assembled climate great and good as they awaited the prime minister\u2019s appearance.

It was an odd story, not least because at international meetings delegations are normally seated according to precedence, or alphabetical order, not personal preference. At the WTO this morning Braithwaite was sitting next to his US counterpart.</p> <p><em>UPDATE:</em> I\u2019ve amended the first paragraph of this post. Originally it said that Braithwaite would be addressing the WTO meeting as the representative of an independent country for the first time since the WTO was set up in the 1990s. That was based on what the Department for International Trade was saying in its tweet. (See above.) But that was misleading. The UK has always been a member of the WTO. But in the past it was represented by the European commission.

In her letter she said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>C02 levels are over 415ppm and climbing. The last time we saw numbers like this was 3 million years ago when sea levels were 20 metres higher than now and beech trees grew in Antarctica. The world\u2019s attempts to get to grips with this epic tragedy of the commons are failing. Almost 50% of our collective emissions have been pumped out since the first meeting of global leaders on climate at the Rio Earth summit in 1992 and emissions are 4% higher than in 2015 when the Paris agreement was signed at COP 21. Global scientists are clear that unless we break this trend now and start sustained reduction in global emissions with a clear net zero landing zone by 2050 or shortly afterwards, we will be dealing with unprecedented climate conditions and vast economic and human consequences within decades, not centuries.</p> </blockquote> <p>But she used the letter and the interview to make a series of specific complaints about the PM. Here is a summary.<br></p> <ul> <li><strong>O\u2019Neill said Johnson has failed to show leadership over COP 26.</strong> In her letter she said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When you asked me to be your COP president (and to combine it with remaining in your cabinet as a minister, an offer I declined) you promised to \u201clead from the front\u201d and asked me what was needed \u201cmoney, people, just tell us!\u201d Sadly, these promises and offers are not close to being met. </p> </blockquote> <p>And in her interview she said there had been \u201ca huge lack of leadership and engagement\u201d on this issue.</p> <ul> <li><strong>She said Johnson once admitted to her that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/04/sacked-cop-26-chair-claire-oneill-berates-boris-johnson-over-climate-record\">he did not really understand climate change</a>. </strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She said Johnson had rejected her suggestion that Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, should be given a role in organising COP 26.</strong></li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>She said Johnson was someone who could not be trusted to keep his promises.

Boris Johnson is calling on countries around the world to follow the UK in pledging to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, as part of the government\u2019s presidency of the UN\u2019s climate talks this year. He was speaking in London this morning, at a event held to mark the formal launch of the COP 26 global climate change conference that the UK will host in Glasgow in November. But Johnson refused to take questions from journalists at the event, and his handling of the summit has been strongly criticised. The Green party said it was turning into a farce (see 1.31pm), and the Lib Dems have said that Johnson is failing to deliver (see 4.47pm.) Claire O\u2019Neill, who was sacked last week as head of the COP 26 conference, has said that voters should not trust Johnson to keep his promises. (See 9.11am.) Michael Gove has said some terrorism offenders should be jailed indefinitely \u201cif necessary\u201d as the government was warned that it faces legal challenges to emergency legislation proposed in the wake of the Streatham attack. MPs have raised concerns that Johnson is undermining press freedom after certain reporters were banned by his top media adviser from attending a government briefing on the EU. One of the UK\u2019s leading pollsters has warned that Brexit has put the union at risk after another survey showed a narrow lead for Scottish independence. Ministers have accused opposition MPs of scaremongering over universal credit after being forced to delay the full roll-out of their flagship benefit system for a further nine months at a cost of \u00a3500m. The Foreign Office has urged Britons in China to leave if they can. My colleague Damien Gayle has more on this on his coronavirus outbreak live blog. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. The Liberal Democrats have put out this about the COP 26 conference. George Grylls has written a very good piece for the New Statesman on the implications of the proposals for Labour party reform announced by Sir Keir Starmer today. (See 12.09pm.) Here\u2019s an extract. Of the eight policies, three seek to undermine the influence of Labour\u2019s national executive committee (NEC) \u2014 on which the party\u2019s left currently has a majority. Firstly, Starmer has proposed ending the ability of the NEC to impose its preferred parliamentary candidates on CLPs; secondly, he wants to force the NEC to publish details of its decisions on the Labour Party website; and thirdly, Starmer will appoint independent bodies to investigate complaints rather than allowing an NEC committee to decide ... The symbolism of these announcements matters almost as much as the substance. Most MPs sympathetic to Starmer believe that he could shape the NEC in his own image if he so wished. They have calculated that the Corbynite wing of the party currently has a majority on the NEC of around six. If elected, Starmer would be able to replace the three positions allocated to shadow cabinet members with his own three appointments. At a stroke, the majority for the party\u2019s left would be wiped out ... The accuracy of these calculations is up for debate. But, if we do believe the maths, and Starmer does have a good chance of refashioning the NEC, then why has he risked antagonising the party\u2019s left by announcing structural changes during the leadership contest? Well, it is a statement of intent. Starmer is telling parliamentarians \u2013 along with the few Labour members who pay attention to Kremlinology \u2013 that he is his own man. From the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has written to Boris Johnson about the COP26 climate change summit being held in Glasgow in November. She proposes that the Scottish government\u2019s environment secretary, Roseanna Cunningham, should attend UK cabinet meetings dealing with the conference. And, to counter claims that the Scottish government is being obstructive (see 10.43am), she says \u201cconstructive discussions\u201d are under way about freeing up an extra building that the UK government wants to use for the event. The Guardian is holding a Labour leadership hustings live event on Tuesday 25 in Manchester. Our chair, Anushka Asthana, will put questions to the candidates Keir Starmer, Lisa Nandy, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Emily Thornberry. You can book tickets here. In her Today interview this morning Claire O\u2019Neill, who was sacked as president of the COP 26 climate change conference, complained, among other things, that Boris Johnson was ignoring her advice. See 10.25am. But perhaps her influence over him is greater than she realises. One of the lines in his speech this morning at the COP 26 launch seemed to be lifted straight out of her resignation letter. In her letter (see 10.25am) she said: The last time we saw [carbon emission] numbers like this was 3 million years ago when sea levels were 20 metres higher than now and beech trees grew in Antarctica. And in his speech this morning (full text here) Johnson said: CO2 levels today are at a level not seen since 3 million years ago when there were trees on Antarctica. The speech is not one of Johnson\u2019s finest, but it is probably worth reading just for the story Johnson tells about how a Victorian inventor, Walter Bersey, developed a fleet of battery-powered taxi cabs that operated on the streets of London in the 1890s. In the Commons Chloe Smith, the Cabinet Office minister, says that David Frost, who was due to hold the Brexit briefing yesterday that was boycotted by journalists, is a special adviser, and hence a political appointee, and not a regular civil servant. Sir Keir Starmer has now published full details of his plans for internal Labour party reform summarised earlier. (See 12.09pm.) Damian Green, the Tory former first secretary of state, says what we seem to be seeing is a \u201cmass outbreak of snowflakery\u201d. (Green was forced to resign as a result of events triggered by press coverage about his behaviour.) The SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart says Smith sounded like \u201ccomical Ali\u201d in her remarks. What will happen next? Talk of fake news, and banning broadcasters? But those things are happening already, Wishart says. Smith says Alex Salmond, the former SNP leader, routinely used to exclude journalists from his briefings. Sir Peter Bottomley, the Conservative MP and father of the house, says nothing this government has done compares with what Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s press secretary, did. He tried to get journalists sacked, Bottomley says. But he says he thinks there is a problem. No 10 should speak to senior journalists and sort it out. Smith is responding to Brabin. She says successive governments have held selective briefings. She says Labour would like to licence the press. And a BBC journalist had to have protection when covering the Labour conference, she says. She says the government supports a free press. Tracy Brabin is responding now. She says the journalists were excluded yesterday from a briefing by David Frost, the PM\u2019s EU adviser. She asks who decided who could attend. And she asks if the decision to exclude some journalists was consistent with the civil service code and the code for special advisers. She says the government\u2019s behaviour damages the principle of a free press. In the Commons Tracy Brabin, the shadow culture minister, is now asking an urgent question about No 10\u2019s decision to ban certain journalists yesterday from a government briefing. Chloe Smith, the Cabinet Office minister, is responding. She says the government is committed to media freedom and to being open to the lobby. Yesterday was a good example of this, she says. She says that yesterday the PM took questions after his speech. And after that the PM\u2019s official spokesman held a briefing open to all, she says. She says that, in addition to normal lobby briefings, the government also sometimes holds \u201cadditional, technical, specialist briefings\u201d. One of these was scheduled yesterday. And Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, says Boris Johnson\u2019s own words this morning at the COP 26 event show that he does not properly understand the climate crisis. Jonathan Bartley, the Green party co-leader, has said the government\u2019s handling of COP 26 is turning into a farce. In a statement after this morning\u2019s launch, Bartley said: Boris Johnson\u2019s speech on the climate rings hollow once again. We need to hear less bluster and see more concrete action to tackle the biggest emergency this and future generations face. COP 26 - which has been described many as pivotal - is turning into a farce. Following [Claire] O\u2019Neill\u2019s sacking and her scathing attacks on the organisation of this event it is vital that her successor is a qualified expert in both diplomacy and climate change, to begin to restore confidence in the process. Bringing forward the banning of petrol and diesel cars to 2035 is nowhere near enough if we want to \u2018lead the way\u2019 in tackling climate chaos. I urge the government to put forward a credible plan to reach net-zero by 2030. COP 26 should be something which the entire country feels part of. At the moment it looks more like the latest addition to Johnson\u2019s long list of failures. At the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning No 10 did not rule out derogating \u2013 effectively partially suspending \u2013 the European convention on human rights in order to apply the new sentencing arrangements for terrorist offenders announced after the Streatham attack. As the Press Association reports, asked if the government would derogate from the ECHR, the PM\u2019s spokesman said: We are going to ensure that we will bring forward the necessary legislation to protect the public because that\u2019s the right thing to do. Asked if the government remained committed to upholding the ECHR the spokesman said: \u201cWe are signatories to the ECHR.\u201d Last month Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, gave a far stronger commitment to the ECHR when he was asked about it in the Commons. He said the UK would never withdraw from it in any circumstances. But there has been speculation that Cox could be sacked in the reshuffle, which is now expected next week. Ed Miliband, the former Labour leader and a former secretary of state for energy and climate change, has dismissed Boris Johnson\u2019s handling of the COP 26 climate change conference as amateurish. At the lobby briefing this morning Downing Street was evasive when asked if Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, would be attending the COP 26 climate change conference. This is from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh. That has prompted this response from Sturgeon. These are from Simon Fraser, a former head of the Foreign Office, on the government statement issued yesterday about its plans for the UK-EU trade talks. According to today\u2019s Financial Times splash (paywall), Sajid Javid, the chancellor, is facing a black hole in his accounts. Chris Giles, the FT\u2019s economics editor, says: Britain\u2019s public finances face a black hole in three years if the economy follows the path forecast by the Bank of England, breaking chancellor Sajid Javid\u2019s new rules to guarantee a current budget surplus. Financial Times calculations suggest that the lower rates of sustainable economic growth forecast by the BoE would leave the chancellor with a \u00a312bn deficit by 2022-23, instead of the \u00a35bn surplus laid out in the Conservative election manifesto. The projections, based on modelling by the Office for Budget Responsibility, would see Mr Javid facing the difficult task of having to consider tax rises and more austerity before his first budget on 11 March to ensure the fiscal watchdog gives his new budgetary rules a pass mark. Responding to the report, Sir Ed Davey, the acting Lib Dem leader, said: This grim forecast for the nation\u2019s coffers is a warning that his plan to hollow out our vital trading relationships with Europe is nothing short of reckless. Johnson\u2019s Brexit is taking Britain\u2019s public finances to the brink. He must halt his charge to a no deal or hard Brexit and guarantee instead the closest trading relationship possible with the EU. Otherwise there\u2019ll be no money in the future for the NHS, schools and police. These are from my colleague Kate Proctor on Boris Johnson not taking questions at the COP 26 event this morning. (See 11.26am.) Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary and favourite in the Labour leadership contest, has just released an eight-point plan for internal Labour party reform. He says he wants to make the party more \u201copen, respectful, creative and engaging\u201d. Although internal party reform is a relatively niche topic, it is important, particularly in the context of an opposition party leadership election. Candidates have been announcing policy, even though they are unlikely to have any say over government policy for the next four years at least. But whoever wins the leadership election will, potentially, be able to do quite a lot to change Labour. (I say potentially because power is dispersed in Labour, and until the new leader gets control of the national executive committee and party conference, his or her room for manoeuvre may be limited.) Two of Starmer\u2019s proposals are particularly significant. Starmer says Labour HQ should give up imposing candidates on local parties. This is something that does not happen routinely, but does happen close to an election when vacancies occur. In the past, under all leaders, this system has allowed the leadership to effectively gift safe seats to favoured candidates. Starmer says he will stop this. In his press release, he says: Local party members should select their candidates for every election. The NEC should not impose candidates on local parties. More widely, we must improve our selection process. The current system is impenetrable, with too much reliance on who people know rather than what they can do. It costs too much and takes too much time, effectively ruling out potentially excellent candidates. He says he would set up an independent body to deal with complaints about members. The national constitutional committee (NCC), the body that currently deals with serious complaints, would be scrapped. His press release says: Our current system does not work to this principle and it should be replaced by an independent panel with experts on racism, sexual harassment and poor personal conduct cases. All members and communities must have confidence in the rigour and independence of our disciplinary procedures. We should extend auto-exclusion to include expressions of clear-cut racism, including anti-semitism. The six other proposals are: Making candidates more representative. Starmer says he would like Labour to be able to have all-BAME shortlists, but he says parliament would have to legislate for this first. Providing better access for disabled members. Promoting innovative campaigning. Making policy-making more democratic. Making Labour decision-making more transparent. Strengthening links between Labour and the trade unions. Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s chief adviser, was photographed carrying a book called Chinese Spies this morning as he arrived at Downing Street. It\u2019s by the journalist Roger Faligot, and it says China has the largest intelligence service in the world, although the Times\u2019 reviewer (paywall) says Faligot\u2019s account left him wondering \u201cif there is such a thing as an over-devious secret service. In their constant quest to discover the imagined layers of meaning underpinning the actions of their enemies, the Chinese spooks may just be tying themselves in knots, consumed by paranoia.\u201d Perhaps Cummings is looking for tips. At the weekend the Sunday Times (paywall) claimed that he had recruited his own network of \u201cspies\u201d working in Westminster restaurants who will tip him off if they see special advisers having unauthorised meetings with journalists. The launch of COP 26 at London\u2019s Science Museum this morning was a gathering of academics, business leaders, civil society groups and a few politicians, including the environment secretary, Theresa Villiers, and Zac Goldsmith, an environment minister. Mark Carney, the outgoing governor of the Bank of England, who will be a UN climate envoy this year, was also there, along with the Commonwealth secretary general, Lady Scotland, the climate economist Lord Stern, the actor and activist Lily Cole, and the prime minister\u2019s father and long-time environmentalist Stanley Johnson. The Italian prime minister made a brief speech, as Italy is the joint host of COP 26 with the UK and will be holding a pre-COP in Milan and a further meeting in the autumn to prepare the ground for a potential deal. Missing, however, was the UN\u2019s top climate official, Patricia Espinosa. Boris Johnson did not take questions, there was no press conference, and under the original plan for the launch, media were to be excluded, until a last-minute reversal late on Monday allowed some media to attend. Johnson spent most of his speech on a discussion of the UK\u2019s pioneering inventor of electric taxis, who came up with a prototype late in the 19th century which was briefly adopted in the capital before being replaced by the internal combustion engine. While this gave plenty of opportunity to showcase the new commitment to bring forward the phasing out of diesel and petrol vehicles, and for jokes at the expense of Transport for London, there was little clue as to how the UK\u2019s diplomatic effort to forge a global consensus on tougher carbon targets will be achieved. Central to that effort will be the appointment of a replacement to Claire O\u2019Neill, whose blistering performance on the Today programme (see 10.25am) was the chatter of the assembled climate great and good as they awaited the prime minister\u2019s appearance. A decision on her replacement is understood to depend on a wider government reshuffle, which is widely expected in the next fortnight. The Cabinet Office COP 26 team are moving ahead with meetings and strategy discussions, but there is a sense that the government\u2019s real push has not yet started. There are two urgent questions in the Commons later. In an interview shortly after the general election Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister who has been in charge of no-deal planning, said he was confident that the UK would negotiate a trade deal with the EU before the end of 2020. Now he does not seem sure. In an interview with Sky\u2019s Kay Burley this morning, he said the government would like to get a trade deal with the EU, but that it was not essential. He said: When we talk about needing \u2013 everything is a matter of preference. It is better to have a good trading relationship with the United States, better to have the best trading relationship with the EU, but most of all it\u2019s right to stand up for Britain, and not to accept terms from other countries if those terms aren\u2019t right for us. Yesterday Rishi Sunak, the chief secretary to the Treasury, also said the UK did not have to have a trade deal with the EU. Julian Braithwaite, the UK\u2019s ambassador to the World Trade Organisation, has been addressing a WTO meeting for the first time since the UK left the EU on Friday. At the weekend it was reported in the Sunday Times that Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, had ordered British diplomats to \u201csit separately\u201d from their former EU colleagues at international meetings following the UK\u2019s departure from the union on Friday. It was an odd story, not least because at international meetings delegations are normally seated according to precedence, or alphabetical order, not personal preference. At the WTO this morning Braithwaite was sitting next to his US counterpart. UPDATE: I\u2019ve amended the first paragraph of this post. Originally it said that Braithwaite would be addressing the WTO meeting as the representative of an independent country for the first time since the WTO was set up in the 1990s. That was based on what the Department for International Trade was saying in its tweet. (See above.) But that was misleading. The UK has always been a member of the WTO. But in the past it was represented by the European commission. DIT says what is different now is that the UK is \u201cable to speak independently\u201d. In her Today interview Claire O\u2019Neill, who was sacked last week as president of the COP 26 climate change conference in Glasgow later this year, claimed the Scottish government was being obstructive. She said: One of the things you would hope to have organised by now is an absolute firm location. And the prime minister himself chose Glasgow, which is a wonderful site, and the city council have been absolutely amazing. And of course I have not been party to the numbers and the negotiations, quite rightly. But I am told by those involved that the original analysis was hundreds of millions of pounds off track, that the Scottish government has absolutely behaved disgracefully, and has been contracting buildings, for example, from the COP site that should be absolutely made available to the conference, and that there is a complete standoff. In response, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, rejected the suggestion that her government was trying to sabotage the conference. She said: At the COP 26 launch this morning Boris Johnson swerved questions on the sacking of Claire O\u2019Neill and the candidates for her replacement as he moved to reassure climate campaigners and governments that the UK is fully committed to making the summit a success. He said: Unless we take urgent action we will get three degrees hotter. The bushfires, the melting ice caps, the acidification of the oceans are evidence. Climate change is taking its toll on the most vulnerable populations. Sir David Attenborough said it was time to change the planet\u2019s direction on the climate crisis. He said: We all know the potential catastrophe. Five years ago the world came together in Paris. That was a step forward. But though we now all agree we have to do something about it, the time to do that is at COP 26. The longer we go on takling about it without action, the worse it is going to get. Unless we do something, it becomes insoluble. That\u2019s why Glasgow is extremely important. In her letter to Boris Johnson written after she was sacked as president of the COP 26 climate change conference (which has been obtained by the Financial Times), and in her Today interview, Claire O\u2019Neill said that it was not just Johnson and the UK government, but the world generally, that was failing to respond fast enough to the climate crisis. In her letter she said: C02 levels are over 415ppm and climbing. The last time we saw numbers like this was 3 million years ago when sea levels were 20 metres higher than now and beech trees grew in Antarctica. The world\u2019s attempts to get to grips with this epic tragedy of the commons are failing. Almost 50% of our collective emissions have been pumped out since the first meeting of global leaders on climate at the Rio Earth summit in 1992 and emissions are 4% higher than in 2015 when the Paris agreement was signed at COP 21. Global scientists are clear that unless we break this trend now and start sustained reduction in global emissions with a clear net zero landing zone by 2050 or shortly afterwards, we will be dealing with unprecedented climate conditions and vast economic and human consequences within decades, not centuries. But she used the letter and the interview to make a series of specific complaints about the PM. Here is a summary. O\u2019Neill said Johnson has failed to show leadership over COP 26. In her letter she said: When you asked me to be your COP president (and to combine it with remaining in your cabinet as a minister, an offer I declined) you promised to \u201clead from the front\u201d and asked me what was needed \u201cmoney, people, just tell us!\u201d Sadly, these promises and offers are not close to being met. And in her interview she said there had been \u201ca huge lack of leadership and engagement\u201d on this issue. She said Johnson once admitted to her that he did not really understand climate change. She said Johnson had rejected her suggestion that Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, should be given a role in organising COP 26. She said Johnson was someone who could not be trusted to keep his promises. (See 9.11am.) She said the decision to sack her as president of COP 26 was unfair. In her letter she said: I was given three separate explanations for the decision, none of which could be clearly articulated or supported with evidence, apart from needing someone more senior. You did, of course, know my seniority and experience when you offered me the job. She claimed that, following her sacking, No 10 was responsible for false and negative briefings against her. In her letter she said: It was very disheartening in this context to learn that No 10 is rumoured to be behind the media briefings put out to support your decision, which variously contained awful, false and distorted defamatory allegations. Boris Johnson and Sir David Attenborough met primary schoolchildren at the Science Museum in London before speaking to experts, campaigners and politicians at an event to launch the COP 26 climate change conference being hosted by the UK later this year. According to the Press Association, Johnson told the children: We are trying to get people focusing on what this country is doing to tackle climate change and how to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, which as I understand it is swaddling the planet like a tea cosy. We want to get everybody to agree to use new technology, such as electric batteries, wind turbines, solar panels, all that kind of thing, so they stop producing so much greenhouse gases. Johnson said the UK wanted to get to net zero emissions, and that \u201cwe think we\u2019ve got to do it\u201d, pointing to Britain\u2019s role as a leader in the industrial revolution. Sir Keir Starmer, the favourite in the Labour leadership contest, has written to Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, urging him to investigate what happened yesterday when a number of journalists were banned from a No 10 briefing. Starmer says this should never happen again. He says: Banning sections of the media from attending important briefings about important matters of government is damaging to democracy. In an interview with Sky News this morning Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, rejected Claire O\u2019Neill\u2019s claims that the government has shown a lack of leadership on the issue of climate breakdown. Gove, a former environment minister, said: The cabinet has discussed climate change. The very first item on the agenda in the new year when the cabinet met was the conference in Glasgow in November. We have been working hard in order to ensure we do three things \u2013 that Britain sets an example: the prime minister is explaining today alongside David Attenborough some of steps we are taking like, for example, banning the sale of petrol and diesel cars from 2035. The second thing is making sure countries come together and live up to their promises to reduce carbon emissions, and the third thing is extending the range of things that we do to deal with this so it is not just about transport and energy. Good morning. Last week Claire O\u2019Neill, the former environment minister elected to parliament as Claire Perry but who stood down at the general election, was sacked from her role as head of the COP 26 climate change conference. To be held in Glasgow in November the conference is supposed to agree new greenhouse gas emission targets. Her surprise sacking was accompanied by some negative briefing from the government, with one source claiming she had \u201cseriously underperformed\u201d and that her behaviour was \u201cerratic\u201d. O\u2019Neill, however, is not going quietly. With Boris Johnson due to attend the formal launch of the conference in London this morning, the Financial Times has mysteriously managed to get hold of her resignation letter, in which she is scathing about Johnson\u2019s leadership. And she was on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme this morning, scattering criticism with ever more abandon. It was quite a performance. While paying lip service to the government\u2019s worthy ambitions, and the importance of its diesel and petrol vehicles announcement today, and doing her best to sound reasonable, not bitter, she hammered Johnson\u2019s record on COP 26. As Rowena Mason and Fiona Harvey report in their story, O\u2019Neill said Johnson had shown a \u201chuge lack of leadership and engagement\u201d over COP 26, and she claimed that he admitted he did not understand the issue. She also said that Johnson could not be trusted to keep his promises. She told the programme: My advice to anybody to whom Boris is making promises \u2013 whether it is voters, world leaders, ministers, employees or indeed, to family members \u2013 is to get it in writing, get a lawyer to look at it and make sure the money is in the bank. I will post more on her criticisms soon. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Boris Johnson and Sir David Attenborough speak at the official launch of the COP 26 global climate change conference which is taking place in Glasgow in November. 11.30am: Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 1pm: Lord Sumption, the former supreme court justice, and Gina Miller, the anti-Brexit campaigner, speak at an Institute for Government event on the constitution. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>He was not concerned about the Coronavirus when he first heard of the outbreak but has now decided to leave China.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think what Dominic Raab has said is a logical solution to the current issue.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The virus has killed at least 426 people, exceeding the 349 mainland deaths from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) outbreak of 2002-03, which killed nearly 800 globally.</p> \n<p>The total number of infections in China also rose, to more than 20,000.

A 39-year-old man with an underlying health condition died in Hong Kong on Tuesday morning, according to the public broadcaster RTHK. His death is the second outside the mainland after a Chinese national from Wuhan was confirmed on Sunday to have died in the Philippines.

The coastal city of Wenzhou, hundreds of miles east of Wuhan, was the first to bring in \u201cspecial measures\u201d, Reuters reported. On Sunday it had 291 confirmed cases of coronavirus, the highest number of any city outside Hubei. Since then the city of Taizhou, and several districts in the cities of Ningbo and historic Hangzhou have also been locked down.

He pointed out that, alongside financial responsibilities such as continuing to pay rent for their Chinese homes, some British nationals simply can\u2019t afford a ticket out. He said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The recent advice from the government - for UK nationals to leave China as soon as we are able - has come at an already tense time for many of us in Chengdu. As you will already know, the Chinese authorities have prolonged the spring festival until the 10th February, however, my company has put in place systems whereby we can, or rather have to, work from home. This mainly involves correcting students\u2019 oral presentations or reading practice on the Chinese messaging app WeChat. </p> \n   <p>At the same time, many foreign teachers have chosen to take unpaid leave in order to return home. The company has not yet made it clear to us when classes will resume in earnest (though early March has made its way through the rumour mill) and this has left many of us in a state of limbo. Do we follow the precedent set by others, potentially leaving China for an uncertain length of time, which might in some way jeopardize our contracts, or do we hold out for further information from the company or the Chinese authorities, by which time it might be even more difficult to leave. </p> \n   <p>The advice from the UK government is therefore somewhat of an unwelcome intervention as no new information on the virus has been provided. It also ignores the fact that many of us in China have financial responsibilities, paying rent being chief amongst them, that we cannot simply ignore or afford to neglect. This is beside the fact that some of us simply can\u2019t afford the price of a flight home at the moment. </p> \n   <p>We\u2019re in a bind with no new information from either the Chinese or British governments with regards to the severity or spread of the virus and a lack of transparency from our company as to the future conditions of our employment. Many staff are understandably scared of the recent outbreak and what it might mean for our health but I would say that concerns regarding our employment are of equal if not greater immediate importance and unfortunately the government\u2019s advice offers no easy solution pertaining to this issue. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-04T17:11:36.115Z\">at 5.11pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e399c9a8f0811db2faf14af\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-04T16:48:41.601Z\">4.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Six more cases of coronavirus have been detected in Singapore, including four with no recent travel history to China, bringing the total number of infected patients in the city state up to 24, reports the English-language local news channel <a href=\"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wuhan-coronavirus-singapore-virus-new-cases-local-transmission-12390118\">CNA</a>. </p> \n  <p>CNA\u2019s report cites Singapore\u2019s health ministry as saying that the four cases of local transmission are linked to travellers from China, whilst the other two were Singaporeans repatriated from Wuhan on 30 January. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e39951a8f086a28115a5705\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-04T16:32:01.572Z\">4.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Levels of concern over the spread of coronavirus remain high in York, where the UK\u2019s only two positive-tested cases of the illness were detected last week. </p> \n  <p>York Central\u2019s MP, Rachael Maskell, raised concerns in a Commons debate about the coronavirus on Monday, in particular raising concerns about how MPs, the NHS, the council and other statutory agencies have been briefed over Coronavirus developments in the city, reports York paper <a href=\"https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/18209048.coronavirus-york-mp-hits-poor-communication/\">The Press</a>.

The advice is not an indicator of a change in what we understand of the virus or its virulence, it is a decision made on the proportionate risk to British citizens in light of the scale of the epidemic. While the risk to British citizens in China remains low, the continued spread of the virus in large cities increases the chances of infection and potentially the risk of implementation of transport restrictions in the future.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong> <br></strong>Prof Jonathan Ball, Professor of Molecular Virology, University of Nottingham, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cClearly the government is getting concerned about the increasing number and spread of the novel coronavirus within China and the risk that this might pose to UK residents living or planning to visit China.\u201d</p> \n   <p>\u201cThis is a judgement call \u2013 and not an easy one to make.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong> <br></strong>Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in Global Health, University of Southampton, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cThis move will probably be reassuring to UK citizens in China. There may be significant local uncertainty as to how much risk there is of being exposed to this new coronavirus, and so it seems reasonable to makes attempts to support their removal from the country, until the spread of cases within China has reduced.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong> </strong>Prof Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine, University of East Anglia, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cIt should be noted that this is advice and not a legal restriction. The World Health Organization still says \u2018WHO advises against the application of any restrictions of international traffic based on the information currently available on this event\u2019. Given that the new advice is not an absolute restriction, the UK\u2019s position does not conflict with that of the WHO.</p> \n   <p>\u201cIt is still not yet possible to know how the outbreak will develop over the coming weeks and months but the current risks to British Nationals resident in most of mainland China remains low.</p> \n   <p>\u201cIf this current epidemic does develop into a pandemic with outbreaks in multiple countries then travel restrictions will become increasingly difficult to implement and less relevant towards the control of international spread.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>These comments were compiled by the<a href=\"https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/\"> Science Media Centre</a>. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-04T16:38:29.506Z\">at 4.38pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e397a358f08e1332473ce09\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-04T14:23:39.590Z\">2.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">414 people tested negative in the UK</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The number of people who have tested negative for the virus in the UK is now up to 414, according to the latest daily update from the Department of Health and Social Care. </p> \n  <p>Two people who tested positive are being treated at a special unit in Newcastle. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DHSCgovuk/status/1224694116451332096\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">UPDATE on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#coronavirus</a> testing in the UK:<br><br>As of 2pm on Tuesday 4 February 2020, a total of 416 tests have concluded:<br><br>414 were confirmed negative.<br>2 positive.<br><br>Updates will be published at 2pm daily until further notice.<br><br>For latest information visit:<br>\u25b6\ufe0f <a href=\"https://t.co/CZh5JdyN2Q\">https://t.co/CZh5JdyN2Q</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/RqQWvRKjti\">pic.twitter.com/RqQWvRKjti</a></p>\u2014 Department of Health and Social Care (@DHSCgovuk) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DHSCgovuk/status/1224694116451332096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 4, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e3977098f0811db2faf12db\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-04T14:04:10.477Z\">2.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.info-coronavirus.be/fr/2020/02/04/un-de-nos-compatriotes-rapatries-teste-positif-au-nouveau-coronavirus/\">A Belgian woman who has just tested positive for coronavirus</a> was on the same French repatriation flight that brought back 11 UK evacuees from Wuhan.</p> \n  <p>The woman was one of nine Belgians on board the flight, <a href=\"https://www.info-coronavirus.be/fr/2020/02/02/neuf-belges-rapatries-depuis-wuhan-chine-en-toute-securite/\">Belgium\u2019s health agency said</a>. </p> \n  <p>It was a French chartered flight evacuated more than 250 people from 30 countries including the UK. <a href=\"https://in.reuters.com/article/china-health-france/french-plane-brings-more-than-250-foreign-nationals-from-epidemic-hit-wuhan-to-france-idINKBN1ZW0IM\">The French plane first landed at a military airbase in Istres</a>, southern France.

      "bodyText": "The head of the World Health Organization has written to all health ministers urging them immediately to improve data-sharing on coronavirus. Britons in China have criticised updated advice from the Foreign Office urging them to leave China if they can. Canada is preparing to repatriate about 300 of its citizens from Wuhan this Thursday. The number of people who have tested negative for the virus in the UK is now up to 414. Two people who have tested positive are in hospital in Newcastle. The death toll in China from the virus has increased to 425, and confirmed cases have passed 20,000. The mortality rate stands at 2.1%. The new hospital in Wuhan, built in 10 days, has accepted its first patients. Macau says it will shut its casinos for two weeks to try to stop spread of virus. Japan has prevented passengers from leaving a cruise ship after a male passenger was found to be infected with the coronavirus when he disembarked in Hong Kong late last month. Taiwan bans entry of foreign nationals who have visited China in previous 14 days. The US has reported its second human-to-human case of transmission. Belgian has reported its first coronavirus case, in a woman who was on a repatriation flight from Wuhan. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday he had written to all health ministers urging them immediately to improve data-sharing on coronavirus and said he would send a team of international experts to work with Chinese counterparts, Reuters reports. So far 22 nations have officially reported trade or travel-related measures linked to the coronavirus, which WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said should be \u201cshort in duration, proportionate\u201d and reviewed regularly. Chen Xu, China\u2019s ambassador to the UN in Geneva, told the WHO executive board that some restrictions went against the UN agency\u2019s advice, and he told countries \u201cnot to over-react\u201d. So far 27 cases of person-to-person spread of the virus have been documented in nine countries outside of China, WHO officials said. The overall public health cost of the outbreak response from February to April is estimated at $675m, which does not include the social or economic consequences of the outbreak, they added. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has said it is taking steps to speed up the development of vaccines and treatments for coronavirus. In a statement on the agency\u2019s website, Guido Rasi, its executive director, said it had activated its plan for \u201cmanaging emerging health threats\u201d. He said: \u201cThe new coronavirus has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization, and we are drawing on the strong expertise of the European medicines network to provide fast-track scientific advice and give prompt feedback on any proposed medicine developments.\u201d More Britons have been contacting the Guardian with their responses to the Foreign Office\u2019s call for them to leave China. David, a teacher and poet in Shanghai, who preferred to keep his surname private, said: The announcement by Dominic Raab has certainly caused a stir, but feels particularly like something said as though in order to get excuses in early. The UK government was strongly criticised for its lamentable handling of the evacuations from Wuhan, and it\u2019s announcement today feels a bit like \u201cleave, because we won\u2019t come and help you\u201d. For many of us this has put us in an impossible position. I\u2019m gay, my partner is Chinese. We met in the UK and have been together many years, but we are not married. It would be very unlikely he\u2019d be able to leave China with me \u2013 and I can\u2019t exactly see our government handing out visas to partners and dependants. It\u2019s all a bit of a shocker really. Tom Styles, a teacher at a language school in Huizhou, Guangdong province, said: I\u2019ve lived in China for the past 7 years ... and myself and fellow Brits have been left baffled by today\u2019s announcement by Dominic Raab. It seemed such a generic blanket statement ... How long should we go back for? What to do about our jobs (all of which have been very understanding and supportive giving us updates, free masks, advice etc). Why now? There seems to be no great spike in numbers compared to previous days, do they know something we don\u2019t? Unless there\u2019s a good reason for this it doesn\u2019t help with the general sense of paranoia at the moment and will add further worry to our friends and family back home. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, has sharply criticised the government\u2019s advice to British nationals in China that they should return to the UK. From the very start of this outbreak, the government\u2019s response has been a total shambles, and now they appear to be telling British nationals in China simply to fend for themselves in terms of getting out of the country. How on earth has the Foreign Office not got plans and protocols in place for how these crises are managed? The first duty of any government is to protect its citizens, at home and abroad, and Boris Johnson is manifestly failing to do that. The AFP agency reports that the foreign ministers of France and Germany are considering the possibility that Europe could impose a US-style ban on foreign visitors who have recently been to China, in an effort to battle the spread of coronavirus. \u201cIndeed, there is the question of possible travel restrictions or at least increased examination [of travellers) at the border,\u201d Germany\u2019s Jens Spahn said at a meeting in Paris with his French counterpart Agnes Buzyn. He was responding to a question about whether Europe would consider a ban similar to that imposed by the United States, which China has accused of spreading \u201cpanic\u201d. \u201cIt makes no sense that a single country takes measures\u201d on a continent with border-free travel between most nations, said Spahn. The new coronavirus has killed more than 400 people and infected a further 20,000 in China since emerging in December and has now spread to more than 20 other countries. Buzyn agreed that travel restriction \u201cis one of the questions for European ministers. We must have a coherent vision in the [passport-free] Schengen area. There is no sense in one country taking this type of decision while citizens move around freely.\u201d Buzyn said they would ask the Croatian presidency of the EU council to call a meeting of health ministers within days to discuss further measures needed in the face of the coronavirus crisis. \u201cWe would like \u2026 closer cooperation so that we have exactly the same measures in all countries in order to be consistent in Europe since there is this free movement of people, and we wish to maintain this free movement.\u201d An eight-year-old boy has been diagnosed with coronavirus in Queensland, bringing Australia\u2019s total number of patients with the illness up to 13, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reports. The child is Chinese and from Wuhan, where the outbreak began, and had been travelling in the same tour group as Queensland\u2019s two other confirmed coronavirus patients, a 44-year-old man and a 42-year-old woman. He has been placed in isolation at the Gold Coast university hospital and is in a stable condition, according to ABC. The updated advice from the Foreign Office warning all British nationals to leave China has left many Britons wondering what to do. With many holding down jobs and relationships, keeping pets or even raising children in the country, it is not simple to up sticks and leave. Robin Mitchell, a 38-year-old lecturer in Xiamen, Fujian province, has a six-year-old daughter with his Chinese partner. He said: I have just read that the Foreign Office has advised us Brits to leave China, and that Professor Head thinks this move will be reassuring. I\u2019d just like to assure the professor that this news is about as far from reassuring as possible. For most expats, leaving China is not like cutting a holiday short. We have jobs, houses, pets and (most importantly of all) family here. I, and presumably hundreds or possibly thousands like me, have a child with a Chinese partner, which complicates matters even further as visa applications take months. Since the outbreak the consulate has not made any attempt to contact any expat I know, and appears to have completely jumped ship (if media reports are to be believed). If Dominic Raab is serious about our safety as his priority, he could start by assuring us that Chinese parents of British nationals will be allowed to enter the UK if we follow his advice and leave China. Another Briton, a recent graduate who is working as an English teacher in Chengdu, and who preferred not to be named, called the Foreign Office advice an \u201cunwelcome intervention\u201d. He pointed out that, alongside financial responsibilities such as continuing to pay rent for their Chinese homes, some British nationals simply can\u2019t afford a ticket out. He said: The recent advice from the government - for UK nationals to leave China as soon as we are able - has come at an already tense time for many of us in Chengdu. As you will already know, the Chinese authorities have prolonged the spring festival until the 10th February, however, my company has put in place systems whereby we can, or rather have to, work from home. This mainly involves correcting students\u2019 oral presentations or reading practice on the Chinese messaging app WeChat. At the same time, many foreign teachers have chosen to take unpaid leave in order to return home. The company has not yet made it clear to us when classes will resume in earnest (though early March has made its way through the rumour mill) and this has left many of us in a state of limbo. Do we follow the precedent set by others, potentially leaving China for an uncertain length of time, which might in some way jeopardize our contracts, or do we hold out for further information from the company or the Chinese authorities, by which time it might be even more difficult to leave. The advice from the UK government is therefore somewhat of an unwelcome intervention as no new information on the virus has been provided. It also ignores the fact that many of us in China have financial responsibilities, paying rent being chief amongst them, that we cannot simply ignore or afford to neglect. This is beside the fact that some of us simply can\u2019t afford the price of a flight home at the moment. We\u2019re in a bind with no new information from either the Chinese or British governments with regards to the severity or spread of the virus and a lack of transparency from our company as to the future conditions of our employment. Many staff are understandably scared of the recent outbreak and what it might mean for our health but I would say that concerns regarding our employment are of equal if not greater immediate importance and unfortunately the government\u2019s advice offers no easy solution pertaining to this issue. Six more cases of coronavirus have been detected in Singapore, including four with no recent travel history to China, bringing the total number of infected patients in the city state up to 24, reports the English-language local news channel CNA. CNA\u2019s report cites Singapore\u2019s health ministry as saying that the four cases of local transmission are linked to travellers from China, whilst the other two were Singaporeans repatriated from Wuhan on 30 January. Levels of concern over the spread of coronavirus remain high in York, where the UK\u2019s only two positive-tested cases of the illness were detected last week. York Central\u2019s MP, Rachael Maskell, raised concerns in a Commons debate about the coronavirus on Monday, in particular raising concerns about how MPs, the NHS, the council and other statutory agencies have been briefed over Coronavirus developments in the city, reports York paper The Press. She said: I particularly thank Public Health England for the advice it has provided throughout the weekend, but levels of concern remain high in York. Not only is that impacting on the local economy, but people are concerned. That concern could be alleviated by better communication and if the statutory bodies \u2014 including the local authority, the university, the police and other authorities \u2014 are kept better informed about what is happening. A reader from York emailed me to say he senses a huge disparity between what was happening in York, where the patients were detected, in Newcastle, where they have been taken for treatment, and in the Wirral, where British nationals repatriated from Wuhan have been taken to quarantine. He said: In the Wirral there is military grade assistance to care for people suspected with Corona virus, whereas in York there is nothing, and we\u2019ve actually had it here. There is huge concern about whether the virus was passed onto anyone. PHE are not giving out any information and it\u2019s impossible to know if we are at risk or not. We don\u2019t know when the two individuals arrived, how they got here?, how long they stayed?, where did they go?, where did they eat? York City Council even announced that York was \u2018safe and open for business\u2019 shortly after the coronavirus discovery was published. This careless statement filled the streets over the weekend. York has given every opportunity possible to spread this virus. Rachael Maskell, our local MP, has voiced her concerns over the lack of information whereas York city council have a blas\u00e9 attitude of \u201cjust sneeze into your elbow and essentially keep calm and carry on.\u201d The people of York want answers so we can make informed decisions. Canadian police have arrested a man on a charge of \u201cmischief\u201d after he falsely told passengers and crew on a Jamaica-bound flight he was infected with coronavirus, forcing the plane to turn back mid-flight, reports Leyland Cecco from Toronto. The WestJet plane departed Toronto Monday morning for Montego Bay. Two hours into the flight\u2014 halfway to its destination\u2014 the 29 year old man told passengers he had recently visited China and contracted the virus. Flight crews quickly gave the man a mask and rubber gloves, requesting he move to the back of the plane. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, our crew followed all protocols for infectious disease on board, including sequestering an individual who made an unfounded claim regarding coronavirus,\u201d WestJet said in a statement. After the pilot was made aware of the situation, the plane turned around midair. Because the passenger\u2019s claims of recently visiting China barred the flight from landing in the US, the pilot was forced to return back in Toronto, where police and medical crews were waiting. Peel police told reporters the man\u2019s claim of a coronavirus infection were determined to be \u201cunfounded\u201d. He was subsequently charged with mischief and is set to appear in court 9 March. WestJet apologized to frustrated passengers, placing them on a new flight that departed early Tuesday morning. Canada is preparing to repatriate about 300 of its citizens from Wuhan this Thursday, a Canadian government source has told Reuters. Canadians in the city received an email from their government\u2019s foreign ministry saying a plane was expected to leave on 6 February, according to a report by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. However, a Canadian government source said the Chinese government had yet to give final consent for the flight, Reuters says. Residents of Wuhan and Hubei have been under quarantine for a few weeks as China attempts to contain the spread of the virus. According to a portion of the letter the CBC posted online, not everyone who is eligible for a seat will get one. Canadian evacuees will be flown first to Vancouver, where the plane will refuel, and then on to Trenton Air Force base in southern Ontario, where they will be placed in quarantine for 14 days. Damien Gayle taking over the reins on the liveblog now. As usual I want to hear your news, experiences and questions, from wherever you are in the world, to make sure our coverage is comprehensive. You can email me at damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or reach me through my Twitter profile, @damiengayle. Experts have described the Foreign Office\u2019s decision to advise British nationals to leave China as \u201cprudent\u201d but say it should not be seen as sign that virus has become any more risky. Dr Nathalie MacDermott, clinical lecturer, King\u2019s College London, said: \u201cGiven the increasing number of cases of 2019-nCoV in China and the spread to multiple large cities within China, which have now also demonstrated increasing numbers of cases and localised transmission within those cities, this advice is prudent. The advice is not an indicator of a change in what we understand of the virus or its virulence, it is a decision made on the proportionate risk to British citizens in light of the scale of the epidemic. While the risk to British citizens in China remains low, the continued spread of the virus in large cities increases the chances of infection and potentially the risk of implementation of transport restrictions in the future.\u201d Prof Jonathan Ball, Professor of Molecular Virology, University of Nottingham, said: \u201cClearly the government is getting concerned about the increasing number and spread of the novel coronavirus within China and the risk that this might pose to UK residents living or planning to visit China.\u201d \u201cThis is a judgement call \u2013 and not an easy one to make.\u201d Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in Global Health, University of Southampton, said: \u201cThis move will probably be reassuring to UK citizens in China. There may be significant local uncertainty as to how much risk there is of being exposed to this new coronavirus, and so it seems reasonable to makes attempts to support their removal from the country, until the spread of cases within China has reduced.\u201d Prof Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine, University of East Anglia, said: \u201cIt should be noted that this is advice and not a legal restriction. The World Health Organization still says \u2018WHO advises against the application of any restrictions of international traffic based on the information currently available on this event\u2019. Given that the new advice is not an absolute restriction, the UK\u2019s position does not conflict with that of the WHO. \u201cIt is still not yet possible to know how the outbreak will develop over the coming weeks and months but the current risks to British Nationals resident in most of mainland China remains low. \u201cIf this current epidemic does develop into a pandemic with outbreaks in multiple countries then travel restrictions will become increasingly difficult to implement and less relevant towards the control of international spread.\u201d These comments were compiled by the Science Media Centre. The number of people who have tested negative for the virus in the UK is now up to 414, according to the latest daily update from the Department of Health and Social Care. Two people who tested positive are being treated at a special unit in Newcastle. A Belgian woman who has just tested positive for coronavirus was on the same French repatriation flight that brought back 11 UK evacuees from Wuhan. The woman was one of nine Belgians on board the flight, Belgium\u2019s health agency said. It was a French chartered flight evacuated more than 250 people from 30 countries including the UK. The French plane first landed at a military airbase in Istres, southern France. The non-French evacuees were then flown to their respective countries. Twenty evacuees presented some coronavirus symptoms and stayed at the military airbase to allow test to be carried out. The Belgian woman who has tested positive showed no signs symptoms of the virus. Earlier the WHO reported that the virus was stable and there was no evidence it was mutating, but Chinese scientists have reported \u201cstriking\u201d mutations between family members, the South China Post reports. Researchers studying a cluster of infections within a family in the southern province of Guangdong said the genes of the virus went through some significant changes as it spread within the family. Viruses mutate all the time, but most changes are synonymous or \u201csilent\u201d, having little effect on the way the virus behaves. Others, known as nonsynonymous substitutions, can alter biological traits, allowing them to adapt to different environments. Two nonsynonymous changes took place in the viral strains isolated from the family, according to a new study by Professor Cui Jie and colleagues at the Institut Pasteur of Shanghai. This case indicated \u201cviral evolution may have occurred during person-to-person transmission\u201d, they wrote in the paper published in the journal National Science Review on 29 January. Here\u2019s a summary of what we know so far: The Foreign Office has urged UK citizens to leave China if they can. In updated travel advice it said: \u201ccommercial airlines are still operating, but it may become harder to access departure options over the coming weeks\u201d. The World Health Organization said the virus is not yet a pandemic. It added that it was showing no evidence of mutating. The death toll in China from the virus has increased to 425, with confirmed cases passing 20,000. The mortality rate currently stands at 2.1%. The new hospital in Wuhan, built in 10 days, has accepted its first patients. Macau says it will shut its casinos for two weeks to try to stop spread of virus Japan has prevented passengers from leaving a cruise ship after a male passenger was found to be infected with the coronavirus when he disembarked in Hong Kong late last month. Taiwan bans entry of foreign nationals who have visited China in previous 14 days. The US has reported its second human-to-human case of transmission. Belgian has reported its first case in a woman who was on a repatriation flight from Wuhan. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, has been noticeably absent from public view as his government scrambles to fight the coronavirus outbreak that claimed more than 400 lives and infected more than 20,000 people. His most recent public appearance was on 28 January when he met the director general of the World Health Organization in Beijing and said he was \u201cpersonally commanding\u201d the response to the outbreak. Yet Xi does not appear to be the face of the government\u2019s fight against the virus. He has not been pictured visiting hospitals, doctors or patients. In the days after officials acknowledged the gravity of the crisis it was the premier, Li Keqiang, who visited Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak. While photos of a long convoy prompted rumours over the weekend that Xi was on his way to Wuhan, he has yet to turn up. Foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has confirmed that his officials are now urging UK citizens to leave China (see earlier). Raab said: \u201cWe now advise British nationals in China to leave the country if they can, to minimise their risk of exposure to the virus. \u201cWhere there are still British nationals in Hubei province who wish to be evacuated, we will continue to work around the clock to facilitate this.\u201d The Foreign Office said that commercial flights departing China were available throughout the country, except in Hubei where the virus originated. Russia has sent planes to China as it begins its evacuation of Russian citizens from Wuhan and Hubei province, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak. More than 700 Russians are said to be living in the region, of which 132 had expressed a desire to return to Russia, the country\u2019s embassy in Beijing has reported. They will be subjected to a two-week quarantine period, possibly at a Russian military hospital. The quarantine site has not been made public. In the past few days, Russia has quickly stepped up travel restrictions to and from China. Late Monday night, the government announced a temporary ban on direct travel for foreigners from China to Russia, except via Moscow\u2019s Sheremetyevo airport. Two cases of infection have been reported in Russia, one in Siberia and the other in Russia\u2019s Far East. Both of the victims are Chinese citizens. One of the men, Yan Wunbin, wrote in a letter to the Chita.ru website that he was never given his test results and only learned that he had been diagnosed with the coronavirus from media reports. He complained about conditions at the hospital in Russia\u2019s Zabaykalsky Krai region about 240 miles from the Chinese border. There were not enough doctors on call and he was worried for the health of his two-year-old daughter, who was ill and in quarantine with him. \u201cIf I am indeed infected, I want to apologise to everyone,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI am hoping for help, because my child has a temperature and diarrhoea. I understand from Chinese media that this is very dangerous, but the conditions in the hospital are not sufficient for our rehabilitation.\u201d Here\u2019s a map showing where the virus has spread: The Foreign Office has urged UK citizens to leave China if they can. In updated travel advice it says: The British Consulates-General in Wuhan and Chongqing are currently closed. If you\u2019re in China and able to leave, you should do so. The elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions may be at heightened risk ... Some airlines, including British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, have announced a suspension of flights to and from mainland China. Other commercial airlines are still operating, but it may become harder to access departure options over the coming weeks. There is no evidence so far that the virus is mutating, Briand is also reported to have said. \u201cIt is quite a stable virus\u201d, China Global Television Network quoted her . The World Health Organization has said the outbreak does not yet constitute a \u201cpandemic\u201d. The head of WHO\u2019s global infectious hazard preparedness, Dr Sylvie Briand, said: \u201cCurrently we are not in a pandemic. We are at the phase where it is an epidemic with multiple foci, and we try to extinguish the transmission in each of these foci.\u201d Briand said that while there is rapid spread of transmission in Hubei, the cases outside the province are mainly \u201cspillover cases\u201d with sporadic clusters of transmission. At the same time, authorities in China have taken dramatic measures to halt transmission, while other affected countries have also taken steps to avoid the spread of the virus. \u201cWe hope that based on those measures in Hubei but also in other places where we have had spillover, we can stop transmission and get rid of this virus,\u201d she said. Thousands of African students in Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus epidemic, face dwindling food supplies, limited information and lockdowns restricting them to their campuses or hostels. Two weeks after restrictions on movement were imposed, residents are running short of basic necessities, say students in the central Chinese city. Several people described profound anxiety, insufficient food and a lack of information. Many complained about the lack of assistance received from their own embassies, but refrained from criticising Chinese authorities. African countries are rushing to reinforce their defences against the rapidly spreading coronavirus, as health officials say many countries on the continent are ill-equipped to combat the potentially lethal disease. There have been no verified infections in Africa to date, but porous borders, a continuing flow of travellers and poorly resourced healthcare systems have raised fears that the virus could spread rapidly if the precautions of local authorities prove inadequate. \u201cOur greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems,\u201d Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization\u2019s director general, said last week. Another British university has been hit by a coronavirus scare as a student returning from China was \u201cself-isolated\u201d amid fears they may have contracted the deadly illness. The University of Southampton revealed the unnamed student felt \u201cunwell\u201d after landing in the UK yesterday, Solent News reports. Fearing they had contracted the disease, the student went straight from the airport to their flat in the city and called an ambulance which took them to Southampton General hospital. The student was kept in overnight. They were discharged this morning but only after being told they would have to \u201dself-isolate\u201d until further notice. The university said it had carried out a \u201cdeep clean\u201d on the communal areas of the building including the lift to stop the spread of any potential outbreak. A spokesman for the University of Southampton said: \u201cWe have spoken to the student\u2019s flatmates and, also following the guidance from PHE, they have agreed to self-isolate until we receive further clarification from local health services.\u201d A London man who has just flown back from Shanghai to Gatwick said he was alarmed by the relaxed approach of British officials who refused to accept forms detailing where he had travelled in China. Speaking to the Guardian, the man who did not want to be named, said China Air staff were very insistent that he fill in the two-page form, which asked for contact details and where he had been and where he planned to go next. He said: \u201cI was surprised to see that these were not accepted on arrival. I tried to hand them to staff, who said they had never seen these forms before and not to bother.\u201d He reported the incident to Public Health England. He said: \u201cWhen I passed through passport control, the guy said he\u2019d never seen the form before. He said: \u2018don\u2019t bother with that, because if there\u2019s any problems they would have told you directly\u2019.\u201d \u201cWhen I got to the customs I asked again and everyone was let through. I could have left other regions that have confirmed cases, including Shanghai, where there are also confirmed cases. He added: \u201cOn the Shanghai side we were sprayed with aerosol disinfectant. Everyone\u2019s made to wear a mask and the gloves, etc.\u201d The man contrasted the stringent virus controls being imposed in China with the relaxed approach in the UK. \u201cEveryone here is kind of blaming Chinese people, but they\u2019re taking precautions and when you come here you are just let through. There is this self-righteous British tone from other media outlets constantly looking at how China is reacting to it, without asking what we could be doing. I\u2019m not saying that we should automatically close the borders, but there\u2019s middle steps that are not happening, and that just seems lazy and not planned out at the moment.\u201d \u201cI was surprised because I know there has been concern to track the 2,000 people who flew to the UK from Wuhan before the outbreak was known. The fact they had not managed to find these 2,000 people sounded alarming to me. It has been declared a world public emergency, and the UK authorities still don\u2019t seem to care about where people are going and where you\u2019ve been.\u201d \u201cIn the district I live in there were no cases until yesterday, the day that I flew out. I\u2019m happy to be back. \u201cBefore I flew back I had self quarantine for 16 days. And on the journey I wore a mask, goggles, gloves and had alcohol handle gel.\u201d He still has the form and photographed a section to illustrate the tone of the document: One of the infected Thai drivers, a 70-year-old, also had tuberculosis and was transferred into government care from a private hospital on Monday in a worse condition than the others. The other driver was tracked down by Thai authorities after being identified as one of the people in contact with an infected Chinese tourist, Suwannachai said. Thailand confirmed its first case of human-to-human transmission on Friday when a taxi driver tested positive. The country\u2019s 25 cases consist of six Thais and 19 Chinese. Seventeen remain in hospital and eight have gone home, according to the health official. Earlier on Tuesday, South Korea reported a 42-year-old woman has tested positive for coronavirus after visiting Thailand. It was not clear yet where she had contracted the virus. China\u2019s national health commission announced on Tuesday that the national mortality rate of coronavirus is running at 2.1%. In Hubei province, which accounts for 97% of all fatalities, the rate is 3%. The commission said 80% of deaths were of people over the age of 60 and 75% had underlying conditions. The Guardian\u2019s explainer on the virus points out that the current death rates are likely to be an overestimate. This is because more people are likely to have been infected by the virus but not suffered severe enough symptoms to attend hospital, and so have not been counted. For comparison, seasonal flu typically has a mortality rate below 1% and is thought to cause about 400,000 deaths each year globally. Sars had a death rate of more than 10%. More patients have been transferred to a rapidly built new hospital in Wuhan. The first 50 patients were moved into Huoshenshan hospital, a prefabricated structure on the outskirts of Wuhan. The 1,000-bed facility is equipped with state-of-the-art medical equipment, including negative-pressure isolation wards to prevent the virus from breaking the air seal. A second hospital, Leishenshan, is due to be ready soon and will provide a further 1,600 beds. The virus has created a rare opening in domestic media coverage for debate and criticism \u2013 some from government bodies such as the supreme people\u2019s court or the usually pro-government editor of Global Times. But analysts say the outbreak is just as likely to justify more surveillance and invasive methods by the government. \u201cThe epidemic has given the authorities an excuse to boost control over the country,\u201d said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. \u201cDefinitely we will see more control and surveillance.\u201d Hong Kong\u2019s hospital authority says hospitals in the territory have admitted 64 people in the last 24 hours showing symptoms of coronavirus. It comes after Hong Kong reported its first death from the virus \u2013 a 39-year-old man believed to have had underlying health issues. An official also revealed that of the 17 confirmed case of the virus in Hong Kong, four are likely to have been locally transmitted. The authorities in Shanghai have confirmed that a seven-month-old baby girl has contracted the virus. She is the youngest person in the city to catch it, according to the Shanghai Daily. The girl\u2019s maternal grandparents came back to Shanghai from a trip to Wuhan on 20 January, an official said. He said the case underlined the need for anyone who has travel to Wuhan to disclose their movements to the authorities. There are also reports of a confirmed case in a one-month-old in Guizhou. Officials from the world\u2019s largest oil producers are meeting in Vienna, the headquarters of the Opec oil cartel, today and tomorrow to discuss the sharp slide in the crude oil price following the coronavirus outbreak. Brent crude fell to its lowest level in more than a year yesterday, at $54.17 a barrel, while US crude dropped below $50 a barrel. Prices have bounced back a little this morning on hopes of further production cuts. Technical experts from Opec and its allies, including Russia \u2013 a group known as Opec+ \u2013 are expected to debate a cut of about 500,000 a barrels a day in Vienna, and whether to hold an emergency meeting of energy ministers in mid-February. Analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a note: \u201cOil prices are now at levels where we would expect a supply response from both Opec and shale producers, and where China would likely seek to build crude inventories.\u201d At the same time, some calm has returned to world stock markets following last week\u2019s heavy losses. Chinese central bankers have pumped extra liquidity into markets and perhaps instructions from authorities not to panic are working. All Asian and European stock markets are higher. Chinese stocks rose between 1.3% and 1.8% and in London the FTSE 100 index is up 1.5% at 7434.39, a gain of more than 100 points. Business Live has more: Adam Bridgeman and his wife and baby son were among 11 UK evacuees flown from Wuhan on a French-chartered flight, and are in now in quarantine at Arrowe Park in Wirral. He missed a UK evacuation flight on Friday after confusion about whether his wife, Su, a Chinese national, would be allowed to travel. He told BBC Breakfast that all three of them were relieved to be back in the UK after an anxious flight. Bridgeman said: \u201cIt was very stressful because we have a young young child, who is only one month old. We\u2019re very worried about taking him to a place with lots of people who possibly have the virus, so it was it was an ordeal.\u201d He added: \u201cAs soon as we got here the NHS staff were very friendly and made us very comfortable. It really put us at ease, so we\u2019re very relieved. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be tested soon. I\u2019m not exactly sure. At the moment, we\u2019re just in quarantine, and we\u2019re isolated from anyone else. We have a little kind of apartment area. We\u2019re not supposed to leave that. So I haven\u2019t had a chance to sort of look around or see what how things are outside.\u201d A London-based woman is in Wuhan with a suspected case of coronavirus after her father was tested positive for the virus on Monday. Speaking to BBC Breakfast via video phone from a hospital in the city, Muying Shi said she was feeling \u201cshort of breath now and coughing a lot\u201d. But she was most concerned about her father. She said: \u201cMy dad is more serious than I am. He got his result back yesterday. And it was positive so he was transferred to a proper quarantine hospital yesterday afternoon. \u201cHis oxygen level is dropping, which means he is deteriorating. So I\u2019m worried.\u201d Shi said it was difficult to get information about her condition and that of her father. Shi said: \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to reach out to doctors because they are in full suits and cannot take any phone calls. So the only information I\u2019m getting is from my calls with my dad. And he is finding it hard to speak. I\u2019m not very sure when he would be cured, or if he would be cured. Speaking about her own condition, Shi said: \u201cFor now, my oxygen level is OK. It\u2019s normal, but I still feel that is hard to breathe. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything from the nurses or the doctors. So I\u2019m still waiting. And when I asked them they they are not sure, they\u2019re waiting as well. I\u2019m quarantined in theory. \u201cThe hospital prescribed us with some antibiotics and anti-virus medications and we also found ourselves some medications that are said to be working on this virus, but so far we don\u2019t have any confirmed information about which kind of medication would work. We\u2019re just trying everything. \u201cI have thought about going back to London a lot. But now I\u2019m not very hopeful because now we don\u2019t even have any public transportation on the street, not to mention whether they would let people fly out of Wuhan.\u201d A Belgian woman who was on a repatriated flight from Wuhan on Sunday has tested positive for the coronavirus, Belgium\u2019s health agency has announced. In a statement, it said: The person tested who tested positive shows no signs of illness at the moment. She was transferred last night to Saint Pierre University hospital in Brussels, one of the two reference centres in our country. This hospital has all the expertise and support necessary to guarantee the best care. The agency said all nine Belgian on the flight had undergone a series of tests in a military hospital in the capital, Brussels. Eight of them tested negative. A further person, from Denmark, who had not been able to return home on Sunday, had also tested negative, the agency said. From gassy passengers to viral anthems: how Beijing is seeking to lighten the mood amid the coronavirus crisis. This includes state media striking an upbeat or humorous tone, in line with President Xi Jinping\u2019s call for \u201cpublic opinion guidance\u201d. Read the full story below: Reports that a South Korean person has tested positive for coronavirus following a visit to Thailand are likely to cause great concern to Thai officials. The outbreak has already dealt a massive blow to Thailand\u2019s tourism industry, which relies upon Chinese visitors. The Tourism Authority of Thailand said it expects 2 million fewer Chinese tourists this year than last year, when 11 million visited. It is feared that tourists from elsewhere may also be deterred from travelling. Thailand\u2019s public health ministry has warned that an outbreak in a tourist area is possible, and last week the first case of human-to-human transmission was recorded when a taxi driver caught the virus from a traveller. Here\u2019s a summary of what we know so far about the coronavirus today. Hong Kong has reported its first death from the coronavirus \u2013 a 39-year-old man believed to have had underlying health issues Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, closed all but three border crossings with the mainland The death toll in China from the virus rose to 425, with confirmed cases passing 20,000 Macau says it will shut its casinos for two weeks to try to stop spread of virus Wuhan\u2019s new hospital built in 10 days accepted its first patients The US has reported its second human-to-human case of transmission The ratings agency Moodys says the economic impact of the virus on China will be \u201cmarked\u201d Japan has prevented passengers from leaving a cruise ship after a male passenger was found to be infected with the coronavirus when he disembarked in Hong Kong late last month Australia is considering a second evacuation flight to get its remaining nationals out of Wuhan Taiwan bans entry of foreign nationals who have visited China in previous 14 days Taiwan\u2019s foreign ministry has said the island will deny entry to all foreign nationals who had been to China during the past 14 days starting from Friday, due to the increasing threat from the coronavirus epidemic, Reuters reports. The new incoming travel ban includes all foreign nationals who have been in China since 7 February, Taiwan\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement. It extends an existing ban on visitors from China but does not include visitors from Hong Kong and Macau. South Korea has confirmed its 16th case of the coronavirus, reportedly involving a woman who recently returned from Thailand but had not visited China. The Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said the patient, a 42-year-old South Korean woman, started feeling ill on 25 January, six days after she returned from Thailand, according to the Yonhap news agency. After her condition failed to improve, she was transferred to a general hospital in the city of Gwangju and tested positive for the illness. The KCDC said the patient had been placed in quarantine while authorities attempt to determine her recent movements and track down people with whom she came into contact. The case, which South Korean media is describing as one of human-to-human transmission, is reportedly the second involving a person who has not been to China. The first was a 48-year-old Chinese man who worked as a tour guide in Japan who tested positive after arriving in South Korea, Yonhap said. Public health authorities in South Korea have so far tested 607 people, 462 of whom were given the all-clear. Among the total, 129 are undergoing further health checks. In addition, more than 1,300 people who have been in contact with patients who tested positive are being monitored for symptoms. South Korea, like neighbouring Japan, is barring foreign nationals who are from or have passed through Hubei province. The travel ban, which came into effect on Tuesday, applies to all non-Koreans who have been to the Chinese province in the past 14 days. Macau will shut down all casinos for two weeks in an attempt to contain the coronavirus. Macau\u2019s Chief Executive, Ho Iat Seng, told a press conference the government would meet with gaming operators to discuss the suspension, which is expected to include \u201ccasinos and related entertainment\u201d. There is no date for the suspension to start. Macau has reported 10 cases of the virus and residents have been instructed to wear masks when travelling around the city and have been advised to stay home as much as possible. China has rejected Taiwan\u2019s accusation that Beijing has restricted the island\u2019s access to the WHO during the coronavirus outbreak. The Chinese state tabloid Global Times report says: \u201cWe always care about the health and well-being of our Taiwan compatriots. There have been no barriers for Taiwan to get the latest information on the coronavirus outbreak, said Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesperson for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, at a news conference on Tuesday.\u201d The Chinese women\u2019s football team have been forced to train in hotel corridors ahead of their Olympic qualifying opener in Sydney on Friday. The team has been in isolation at a Brisbane CBD hotel since their arrival in Australia last week due to strict protocols in response to the coronavirus outbreak. You can read our full story below. The city of Taizhou, 860km east of Wuhan, and three districts of the city of Hangzhou (capital of China\u2019s Zhejiang province) \u2013 including the area with the main office of Chinese tech giant Alibaba \u2013 will now only allow one person per household to go outside every two days to buy necessities, AFP is reporting officials saying. I have just been looking at figures of daily increases in deaths from the virus in China and of new infections. The state-run Global Times has put the figures from the National Health Commission into a useful graphic. South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency is reporting that South Korean airlines have suspended more than half of their flight services to China. As of Tuesday, industry leader Korean Air Lines Co. and seven other carriers have temporarily suspended 55 out of their 100 routes to the neighbouring country, it says. The airlines have also decided to reduce flights on 17 routes to Chinese cities, including the capital Beijing. Taiwan\u2019s foreign ministry said on Tuesday China was \u201cvile\u201d for restricting the island\u2019s access to the WHO during the coronavirus outbreak, adding to tensions with Beijing over the growing health crisis. China, where the outbreak began, said on Monday that it had shared full information on the virus with authorities in Taiwan, where there have been 10 confirmed cases, and that channels of communication were \u201cunblocked\u201d. The Chinese state news agency Xinhau reports that China\u2019s President Xi has made an important speech to the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee on Monday to address the coronavirus outbreak. The outcome of the epidemic prevention and control directly affects people\u2019s lives and health, the overall economic and social stability and the country\u2019s opening-up, Xinhau says. Xinhau says Xi demanded \u201cresolute opposition against bureaucratism and the practice of formalities for formalities\u2019 sake in the prevention work\u201d. Those who disobey the unified command or shirk off responsibilities will be punished, Xi said. The report said that the party and government leaders supervising them would also be held accountable in severe cases. A plane sent by Thailand to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan left Bangkok this morning. Around 144 people have reportedly registered to board. They will be flown home tonight and transferred to a navy base in Chonburi province, where they will remain in quarantine for 14 days. Anyone who boarded the flight will also have been screened by Chinese medical authorities. Thailand, which reported its first case of human-to-human transmission last week, has stepped up surveillance measures at airports, tourism hotspots and in its shopping malls. Information signs have also been placed on public transport systems in Bangkok, where many commuters are wearing masks. On Tuesday, the government also announced it would be placing face masks and alcohol-based hand sanitiser on the state price control list, following a surge in demand for both items Greg Hunt is being asked about the Chinese embassy\u2019s news conference earlier, in which Wang Xining, Minister and Deputy Head of Mission of the Chinese Embassy in Australia, criticised Australia\u2019s decision to restrict entry to Australia of foreigners who have been in China in the past 14 days. He said it left some Chinese students stranded in Australia. Hunt doesn\u2019t give a very clear answer, apart from saying the Australian government is following advice of medical experts. A fall in consumer spending as large parts of China continues to be shut down will cause a \u201cmarked\u201d impact on the economy, according to economists at the rating agency Moodys. The shut down will lower discretionary consumer spending on transportation, retail, tourism and entertainment, they said, and could also disrupt domestic supply chains if the outbreak persists, resulting in a broader hit to the economy. They added that while China has the financial resources to absorb the shock, the country\u2019s economy may not find it as easy to bounce back as it did during the Sars outbreak in 2003. This is because, as our financial editor Nils Pratley has pointed out, the makeup of China\u2019s economy is quite different now and much more dependent on consumer spending than it was 17 years ago. Moodys says: The amplified role of consumer demand as a driver of growth raises the risk that the economic dampening effect of the current coronavirus outbreak could be greater than in 2003. In addition, the fact that the epidemic broke out just ahead of the Lunar New Year, a period of very high seasonal consumption and travel, will exacerbate the economic impact. Hunt says at this stage there are expected to be 50 Australians on New Zealand\u2019s evacuation flight from Wuhan. He says Australian citizens who are flying to NZ will be repatriated by Australia: \u201cIt will be our responsibility,\u201d he says. The Australian health minister Greg Hunt is holding a news conference. He says there are 12 confirmed cases in Australia. \u201cTwo (cases) in South Australia, two in Queensland, four in Victoria, and four in New South Wales. And three of those in New South Wales are clear of the virus,\u201d Hunt says. Regarding the evacuations of Australians to Christmas Island where they are being held in quarantine, Hunt says all travellers have been examined and there are no cases of confirmed coronavirus. A pregnant woman and her partner who were on the flight are now in isolation in Perth. He says an Air New Zealand flight will arrive in Wuhan in the next 24 hours. Australians may be on that flight. Discussions are underway about a possible second flight to evacuate Australians from Wuhan. Radio New Zealand is reporting that two people are in isolation at a Fiji hospital with what the health ministry describes as mild symptoms of the coronavirus. If confirmed, these would be the first two cases in the Pacific. The Hong Kong resident who died had reportedly returned from Wuhan on 23 January via a high-speed rail link after a two-day trip. Hong Kong Free Press reports that the man did not visit a wet market or medical facility during his time in Wuhan. He said he had felt muscle pain since 29 January and a fever since 31 January. He died on Tuesday at Princess Margaret Hospital in Kwai Chung His death comes at a time when Hong Kong enters a second day of phased strikes by hundreds of medical workers, amid fierce debate over whether Hong Kong should seal its border with the mainland. The China Development Forum, a major international conference, has been postponed until further notice, organisers have said. It usually takes place in mid-March. Last year, the event proved a meeting point between dozens of central government officials, more than 100 overseas business delegates and nearly 30 scholars. Wang Xining talked about the impact of the travel restrictions on Chinese students studying in Australia. He says some students were caught in transit after the changed travel restrictions were announced. \u201cThere were still some people who already departed from China and, on February 2, about- some say 50, some say 70 people - most of them are students - were stranded in the airport in Sydney, Brisbane, and some in Melbourne. We are not happy about this situation because they were not alerted - there\u2019s not enough time to be alerted about the restriction,\u201d he says. We are just seeing a news conference in Australia being held by the Chinese embassy in Canberra. The speaker, Wang Xining, Minister and Deputy Head of Mission of the Chinese Embassy in Australia, has said that President Xi Jingping is \u201cin personal command\u201d of efforts to combat the epidemic. \u201cAll the governments (in China) - at different levels - are mobilised to carry out the request from the central government,\u201d he said. He paid tribute to the medical workers treating patients and recounts measures Beijing has taken to control the virus, including extending lunar new year holidays. \u201cChina has been very open, transparent, and responsible in working with the international community and other countries to prevent the virus from further outbreak. So we shared information from the very beginning with other countries and the international health institutions, including WHO, which have won wide commendation from WHO leadership, from Director-General Tedross himself, and from many other leaders from other countries. We will continue to do that,\u201d he said. Asked about restrictions in Australia on the entry of foreign nationals who have been in China in the past 14 days, he says: \u201cIt is our hope that theAustralian government contemplates and implements preventive measures on the basis of scientific, comprehensive, objective assessment of this situation in China, with a reference of the recommendations made by the international health institutions including WHO,\u201d he said. This appears to be a thinly-veiled swipe at Australia\u2019s travel restrictions, and a call for countries to fall in line with WHO recommendations, which \u201cadvises against the application of any restrictions of international traffic based on the information currently available on this (coronavirus) event\u201d. And some more details on that reported death in Hong Kong. The South China Morning Post is reporting that the man had lived in Whampoa Garden with his mother. It says the mother was confirmed on 2 February as Hong Kong\u2019s 15th case, but did not have a recent history of travel. We are waiting for a press conference from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority (HA), but in the meantime the HA has said due to the absence of a \u201clarge number of medical staff in public hospitals today\u201d, some emergency services have been severely affected. This follows industrial action that began on Monday calling for Hong Kong to close its border with China. The statement says emergency departments of public hospitals can only focus on manpower to provide emergency services. It calls on patients with mild illnesses to go to private hospitals or clinics. Specialist clinics can only provide a limited amount of services. Patients can call to change the appointment appointment later. If there is a need for supplementary medicine, they can go to the specialist clinic to add medicine. \u201cThe Hospital Authority calls on all absent health care workers to return to work as soon as possible with the patient\u2019s well-being as the main premise to provide patients with the services they need.\u201d Chinese state media has reported that a 39-year-old man diagnosed with coronavirus has died in Hong Kong, citing local media. He would be only the second death outside mainland China from the virus. A local outlet in Hong Kong, HK01 has reported that the man also had a \u201clong-term illness and is known to have a cardiac arrest\u201d at the Princess Margaret Hospital on Tuesday morning. Details will be announced at a press conference of the Department of Health and the Hospital Authority at 4.30pm local time. HK01 says is understood that a man was the 13th confirmed case in Hong Kong and had been diagnosed on 31 January. Another outlet in Hong Kong, RTHK, said the man had taken the high-speed train from Hong Kong to Wuhan on 21 January and from Changshanan to Hong Kong on 23 January. RTHK reports that the Centre for Health Protection as saying he hadn\u2019t visited any health care facilities, wet markets or seafood markets, nor had any exposure to wild animals during the incubation period. Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, has closed all but three border crossings with the mainland, but insisted some checkpoints must stay open. Here\u2019s today\u2019s front page from the South China Morning Post. There\u2019s been huge demand for face masks with many outlets running out and long queues at shops in the city. We are getting reports that there has been a death from coronavirus in Hong Kong. The Reuters news agency is quoting TVB news. I\u2019ll bring you confirmation of this as soon as I have it. Yesterday medical workers in Hong Kong when on strike, calling for the border with China to be shut. Hong Kong currently has 15 declared cases, according to Johns Hopkins University\u2019s virus tracker. Trading has resumed again on the Chinese stock markets and they are looking m,uch healthier than yesterday. The Shanghai Composite \u2013 the country\u2019s benchmark \u2013 is up 0.3% after 30 minutes trading, comparing favourably with yesterday\u2019s falls of 8%. The Shenzhen Component index is up 1.2%. It\u2019s harder to say what will happen from here. Our financial editor Nils Pratley points out that assuming the markets will bounce back in the same as they did after Sars in 2003 is dangerous. China has changed a lot since then, becoming more interconnected with the world, so the impact will be magnified. We just don\u2019t know should be the starting point, he says. Here\u2019s his column: China\u2019s Global TV network, CGTN, is reporting that the Huoshenshan hospital, a SARS treatment-model makeshift hospital in Wuhan, started admitting patients on Tuesday morning. It was built in around 10 days. CGTN has also published a video story of a patient\u2019s journey from fever to diagnosis. The city of Wuhan at the heart of the coronavirus outbreak, has been in lockdown as it attempts to control the spread virus. You can see our picture gallery of life in the city below. Japan is preventing passengers from leaving a cruise ship after a male passenger was found to be infected with the coronavirus when he disembarked in Hong Kong late last month, the health ministry said. Several dozen quarantine officers were checking the health of the 2,500 passengers and 1,000 crew members, Japan\u2019s health ministry said on Tuesday. The vessel arrived at Yokohama, south of Tokyo, on Monday evening, with passengers informed that their departure would be delayed for 24 hours while tests were carried out, according to Kyodo news agency. At least seven people on the vessel said they felt unwell, Kyodo said. The results of their tests will be available on Tuesday. The infected passenger, a Hong Kong resident in his 80s, tested positive for the virus last weekend after returning home on the vessel on 25 January, authorities in Hong Kong said. He had boarded the cruise liner at Yokohama on 20 January. The ship has since made stops in Vietnam, Taiwan and the southern Japanese island of Okinawa. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said Japan would work closely with the World Health Organization to ensure that the virus, which has infected 20 people in Japan, does not disrupt preparations for this summer\u2019s Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics. \u201cWe will closely work with the World Health Organization and others to make sure that preparations for the Olympics and Paralympics proceed without any impact from the outbreak,\u201d Abe told MPs. The Olympics minister, Seiko Hashimoto, said the Games\u2019 organisers and sports associations could meet this week to discuss their response to the outbreak, days after organisers addressed false online rumours that the Games would be cancelled. MPs in Japan, where 20 people have tested positive for the respiratory illness, have called on the Abe administration to do more to protect the public, including making tests more widely available. Testing is currently conducted only at government-run or public institutions, such as the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo. \u201cWe have already started developing a simple test kit,\u201d Abe said, adding that improving the testing regime was an \u201curgent task\u201d. Japan is preventing foreign nationals who have been to Hubei in the previous two weeks from entering the country, joining other countries in imposing travel restrictions in an attempt to contain the spread of the virus. Holders of Chinese passports issued in Hubei are also barred. The government\u2019s chief spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said eight people had been prevented from entering Japan over the weekend. There has been a lot of discussion social media and from emails from Guardian readers about how many people have had the virus and recovered. This has been quite a difficult figure to pin down globally. The latest figure that I have from the National Health Commission is that 632 people in China have so far recovered from the virus. Outside of China the most up-to-date figures I have on recoveries (from Johns Hopkins University) are: Australia 2 Japan 1 Vietnam 1 Chinese state media is reporting that a one-month-old baby has been confirmed as having the coronavirus in Guizhou province. Just breaking down those figures for the virus in China, the National Health Commission says: Of the 3,235 newly confirmed cases, 2,345 cases are in Hubei province. This includes 492 severe cases,442 of which are in Hubei province All 64 new deaths are in Hubei province Of 5,072 new suspected cases, 3,182 are in Hubei province There are 23,214 suspected cases nationally It says \u201cat present, 221,015 close contacts have been tracked\u201d. 171,329 are currently undergoing medical observation and 12,755 were released from medical observation on the same day Chinese state media has confirmed that confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the country have passed 20,000. The People\u2019s Daily says there are now 20,438 cases confirmed on the Chinese mainland. The death toll in China remains at 425. The outlook on the financial markets is calmer today after stocks rallied around the world on Monday despite the spectacular falls of 8% on Chinese markets. This morning the ASX200 in Sydney is up slightly and while the Nikkei in Tokyo is off about 0.35%, shares in Seoul are up 0.7%. It could all change again when the Shanghai and Shanzhen bourses open later today. But the feeling among investors in Europe and the US on Monday was that the virus was being brought under control and would not have too great an impact on the world economy. In addition, Brent crude oil futures crashed to $54.11 a barrel, bringing losses for the year so far to 18%. US crude sank to $49.99. Seema Shah, the chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, said: \u201cIf the Sars episode is anything to go by, we should expect markets to bounce back sharply once the outbreak has peaked.\u201d Read the full story from economics editor Larry Elliott here: I am seeing on the Chinese site Tencent News that confirmed coronavirus infections in China have passed 20,000. The agency is owned by Tencent, the major technology company based in Shenzhen that owns the social media platform WeChat. It has been extremely accurate with its figures throughout this virus outbreak. I\u2019m trying to confirm the numbers with the Chinese Health Commission but their site is understandably heavily overloaded and often difficult to access. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have announced second case of transmission of the new coronavirus within the country. \u201cWe expect to see more cases of person-to-person spread,\u201d said the CDC\u2019s Dr Nancy Messonnier. It takes the US total number of cases to 11. Washington has taken some of the most stringent measures in terms of airport arrivals from China, something that has been criticised by Beijing. Foreign nationals who have been in China in the past 14 days are banned from entering the US. Citizens and permanent residents arriving in the United States on commercial airlines are being directed to one of 11 US airports for additional health assessments. If they show virus symptoms such as fever, US citizens and those who are exempt will be transferred for medical evaluation, and will not be allowed to complete their travel plans. First up, let\u2019s have a look at the death toll. It has jumped 64 from this time yesterday, to a total of 425 inside China, according to the latest figures (one death has also been recorded in the Philippines). This Chinese figure is an increase of just under 18% in 24 hours. The confirmed cases of infection have gone up to 19,726, an increase of 2,521, which rounds up to a 15% increase over a day. While these figures are significant, it\u2019s worth noting that the rate of increase in both deaths and infections is lower on a day-by-day basis than it was on some occasions last week (where the death-toll increase was 29% on one day). It\u2019s obviously hard to tell if this represents a trend of any kind, given the relatively few days of data to look at, but I thought it was interesting, none-the less. This image from the Johns Hopkins below shows the trend visually. If you want to check in with the tracker later, you can find it here. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak, with me Alison Rourke. We have just had the latest figures from the Chinese authorities on the virus which show: The death toll inside China is 425, a jump of 19% on this time yesterday (more on that later) Confirmed infections are 19,726 inside China Global infections currently stand at 185. This includes Hong Kong (15), Macau (8) and Taiwan (10) There has been one death outside of China, in the Philippines, of a man from Wuhan A few other key points before we kick off our coverage: China\u2019s leadership has admitted \u201cshortcomings\u201d in its coronavirus response Chinese authorities said they \u201curgently\u201d needed medical equipment and surgical masks, protective suits and safety goggles as it battles to control the outbreak The US has announced a second case of transmission of the new coronavirus within the United States China\u2019s new hospital in Wuhan, built in around 10 days, opened on Monday You can find our most up-to-date coverage below, including: China\u2019s leadership admits \u2018shortcomings\u2019 in coronavirus response Coronavirus: British evacuee falls ill during flight from China How to protect yourself Hundreds of Canadians await evacuation flight from Wuhan As always, you can contact me at alison.rourke@theguardian.com.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, earlier accused the government of abandoning Britons. \u201cFrom the very start of this outbreak, the government\u2019s response has been a total shambles, and now they appear to be telling British nationals in China simply to fend for themselves in terms of getting out of the country,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>\u201cHow on earth has the Foreign Office not got plans and protocols in place for how these crises are managed.

The child remains in isolation at the Gold Coast University hospital in a stable condition. A group of 241 Australians have been moved into quarantine in the barely used immigration detention centre on Christmas Island. Some of those quarantined have complained the conditions in the detention centre are unhygienic, particularly the allocation of shared bathrooms, exacerbating the potential for transmission of an outbreak of coronavirus. Evacuee Belinda Chen told the ABC: \u201cI understood that there would be very limited facilities here, but the actual condition is no facilities at all. It\u2019s thousands of times worse than I imagined.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>Facebook has failed to stop a coordinated far-right operation profiting from disinformation and anti-Islamic hate</strong> almost two months after it was publicly exposed. The Guardian revealed in December that a network of Facebook\u2019s largest far-right pages were part of a coordinated commercial enterprise that for years had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/06/inside-the-hate-factory-how-facebook-fuels-far-right-profit\">harvesting Islamophobic hate for profit</a>, prompting promises from the social media giant that it would crack down on the network. Two months after Facebook was made aware of the scheme, an analysis by the Guardian has confirmed that a number of the pages are still feeding off anti-Islamic content to drive readers to the same for-profit, third-party websites.</p> \n<p><strong>Democrats are heading to New Hampshire with no frontrunner after the Iowa debacle. </strong>The candidates had hoped the Iowa caucuses would begin to sort out a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/04/democrats-new-hampshire-no-frontrunner-iowa-catastrophe\">chaotic primary field</a>, identifying clear frontrunners.

Top stories An eight-year-old boy has become the 13th confirmed case of coronavirus in Australia, as the government prepares to evacuate more Australian nationals from Wuhan.

Here\u2019s a quick guide to the chaos. And with the proviso that this may all change once we have some actual results \u2013 who can we say are the initial winners and losers from this mess? Scientists are racing to save endangered fish from bushfire ash. A desperate rescue mission to the only known habitat of the stocky galaxias, in Kosciuszko national park, may be the last hope for the species. The effect of the ash is compounded by dead leaves washing into waterways. As organic matter decomposes it draws oxygen from the water, potentially triggering mass fish kills.

Global heating is a serious threat to the world\u2019s climate refuges. Biodiversity hotspots that have given species a safe haven from changing climates for millions of years will come under threat from human-driven global heating, a new study has found. Nearly 10,000 people have now signed up to join a class action demanding compensation over the botched robodebt scheme, almost twice as many as were on board when the government ditched the most controversial aspect of the scheme last year. Aboriginal drivers in Western Australia are more likely to get fines from police officers than traffic cameras. Senior police in Western Australia were warned 12 months ago of a \u201cclearly disturbing\u201d trend of Aboriginal drivers being overrepresented in police-initiated traffic stops. Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX satellite broadband service has taken its first step into the Australian market. The communications regulator has added the company to a list of satellite operators allowed over Australian airspace. The world Dominic Raab has urged all British nationals in China to leave the country if they can as the coronavirus continues to spread. These are the coronavirus quarantine precautions around the world. Senators began a round of speeches on how they think the third presidential impeachment trial in US history should end, before a final vote scheduled for Wednesday afternoon on whether to convict Donald Trump. Boris Johnson has promised \u201curgent action\u201d on the climate crisis, taking personal leadership of this year\u2019s UN climate talks after a blistering attack by the sacked former minister who was to lead them. Sinn F\u00e9in has stepped up its criticism of Ireland\u2019s political establishment as polls show the party poised for a historic breakthrough in Saturday\u2019s general election. The first same-sex couple to dance at Vienna\u2019s Opera Ball say they are continuing rather than destroying the event\u2019s 200-year-old traditions, since they are \u201cgood dancers and stick to the dress code\u201d.

Media roundup The Australian reports that \u201cNationals leader Michael McCormack is being warned he could face another challenge before the election if he doesn\u2019t improve his performance.\u201d The ASX is set to rise as Wall Street and European investors are reassured by China\u2019s central bank intervening to curb the economic impact of the coronavirus, according to the Australian Financial Review. On the ABC: urban farms in the Hunter Valley are feeling the impact of climate change. Coming up Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe will deliver a speech to the National Press Club in Sydney.

      "bodyText": "Thirty-five Australians on board an Air New Zealand evacuation flight from Wuhan will be transferred directly to a flight back to Christmas Island after they arrived in Auckland on Wednesday. The flight left Wuhan, the global centre of the coronavirus outbreak, with 193 passengers, among them 98 New Zealanders and 70 nationals of Pacific countries including Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Kiribati, Tonga, Fiji and the Federated States of Micronesia, and others from the UK, the Netherlands and Uzbekistan. Of the Australians, 23 are citizens and 12 permanent residents travelling on Chinese passports. Doctors and paramedics are also on the flight. One passenger was prevented from boarding the flight because they showed signs of illness, Radio NZ reported. The 9,800km, 12-hour flight landed in Auckland at6.15pm local time (4.15pm AEDT). New Zealanders and Pacific islanders will be quarantined for a fortnight at Whangaparaoa military base, just north of Auckland, but the Australians will be put straight on another flight, travelling 7,500km back across the country to Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean, taking at least nine hours. \u201cThey\u2019ll go to Auckland, then be transferred back to Christmas Island,\u201d Scott Morrison confirmed in a press conference on Wednesday morning. It was unclear whether the return flight would need to land at the Learmonth base in Western Australia, where the first Australians brought from Wuhan changed planes, because the runway at Christmas Island is not large enough to accommodate the 747 that flew them from China. New Zealand foreign minister Winston Peters said the Australian officials did not ask to use Auckland base for quarantining. \u201cWe didn\u2019t make the offer because the Australians had already said what they wanted us to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re a small country doing the best we can with lesser resources than big countries have. Peters said New Zealand was happy to help its neighbour out, but did not want to divert the Auckland-bound flight. \u201cThe Australians were, because of their original numbers, looking to see whether we could help them out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe said \u2018that\u2019s not a problem but we don\u2019t want to go through Christmas Island you\u2019ll have to, when they arrive here, take them off to Australia and look after them yourself.\u2019 \u201cIn every other respect it\u2019s been a total picture of cooperation.\u201d On Wednesday an eight-year-old boy was identified as the 13th confirmed case of coronavirus in Australia. The boy, the youngest infected in Australia so far, is a Chinese citizen and from Wuhan. He was travelling in a group with a 44-year-old man and a 42-year-old woman who have been confirmed as Queensland\u2019s other cases of coronavirus. The child remains in isolation at the Gold Coast University hospital in a stable condition. Several hundred Australian citizens and permanent residents remain trapped inside Wuhan, in China\u2019s central Hubei province, which is subject to a military-enforced lockdown. More people had registered to be evacuated on the NZ flight, but typically with international evacuation flights of Wuhan over the last week, the final flight manifest numbers are lower because people are unable to get through roadblocks to reach the airport, or because they don\u2019t pass Chinese screening processes or health checks. Seventeen countries have now run rescue missions out of Wuhan. The Australian government is also negotiating a second Australian evacuation flight, which could bring 200 more citizens and permanent residents out of the lockdown zone. Australian government officials are confident approval can be won, but discussions are ongoing with Chinese authorities about when a flight might be permitted to land and take off. Globally, the 2019-nCov novel coronavirus has infected more than 20,000 people and killed 427. All but two of those deaths occurring in mainland China. It has now surpassed the death toll in China of the 2002-03 Sars outbreak, which ran for more than nine months. There are 241 Australians who have already been moved into quarantine in the barely used immigration detention centre at the isolated north-west end of Christmas Island. The health minister, Greg Hunt, said all evacuees to Australia have been examined, and there were no confirmed cases of coronavirus in the cohort. \u201cFourteen were looked at more closely to ensure that they were in an acceptable condition, and they have now all been cleared of the virus.
