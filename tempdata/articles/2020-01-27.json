Its National Health Commission has said there are more than 2,700 infections recorded and 6,000 suspected \u2013 it has included Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan in these numbers. The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was flying to Beijing to discuss the outbreak with authorities. As China shuts down transport networks to try to limit the spread of the virus, some countries are preparing to help their citizens leave.

The death toll on such motorways has reached 38 in the last five years, including many that motoring organisations believe were avoidable after breakdowns happened in amongst fast-moving traffic. A BBC Panorama investigation to be broadcast tonight found that in five years a section of the M25 went from 72 near-misses to 1,485. The former government minister Sir Mike Penning agreed to smart motorways\u2019 expansion but now he and other MPs will publish a report accusing Highways England of \u201ca shocking degree of carelessness\u201d in implementing them.

About 200,000 unseen documents, from private emails to phone transcripts and commercial agreements, will be released during 18 months of hearings examining decisions taken in the months and years before the fire, its immediate aftermath and the role of the UK government.

The world of professional sport is in mourning after Kobe Bryant, the US basketball legend, died in a helicopter crash at the age of 41. Bryant\u2019s 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, is also believed to have died \u2013 she was among the eight others on board, and no survivors were reported. The helicopter crashed at 10am on Sunday near Calabasas, 30 miles from downtown Los Angeles, in foggy weather. Bryant lived in the area most of his life and often used helicopters because of LA\u2019s heavy road traffic. Bryant played his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers, having gone straight from school to the NBA instead of college. In that time they won five championships and he was named an All-Star 18 times. Bryant\u2019s reputation was tarnished in 2003 when he was arrested over rape allegations that he later settled out of court. Fans have been holding vigils to pay tribute. One of Bryant\u2019s fellow Lakers greats, Magic Johnson, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to accept. Kobe was a leader of our game, a mentor to both male and female players.\u201d * * * Virus death toll jumps \u2013 China\u2019s premier has visited Wuhan as the country substantially raised its coronavirus death toll to 80, up from 56 on Sunday.

About 200,000 unseen documents, from private emails to phone transcripts and commercial agreements, will be released during 18 months of hearings examining decisions taken in the months and years before the fire, its immediate aftermath and the role of the UK government.

But it appears increasingly unlikely foreign countries will be allowed to simply extricate their citizens in the face of militarily enforced lockdowns. Indonesia has said it \u201cseems to be impossible\u201d, while Australia has said it \u201cneeds to abide by the travel restrictions \u2026 placed there for precisely the purpose of containing the coronavirus\u201d. A hotline for family members of Australian citizens has received 385 calls, but the foreign minister, Marise Payne, has said it was \u201cunwise to speculate\u201d on how many citizens this represented or how quickly they could be brought out. Payne would not confirm reports there were 100 children among the Australians trapped inside Hubei province, aged from six months to 16. Australia does not have a consulate in the city at the centre of the outbreak, Wuhan. There are only a handful of trade officials, and diplomats from outside have not been allowed in to coordinate evacuation efforts. Domestically, school children in NSW who have been in contact with a confirmed case of coronavirus \u2013 anywhere in the world \u2013 have been told not to attend school for two weeks. Globally, the outbreak of coronavirus 2019-nCoV has now claimed 80 lives, all of those in China, and the vast majority in Hubei province, the epicentre of the pandemic. There are a further 2,700 people infected across China, with 461 of those in critical condition. China\u2019s National Health Commission minister Ma Xiaowei said the virus was strengthening and the number of cases was expected to continue to rise. \u201cAccording to recent clinical information, the virus\u2019s ability to spread seems to be getting somewhat stronger.\u201d Cases have also been reported in Germany, France, Finland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand, Nepal, Vietnam, Philippines, Singapore, Australia, the US and Canada.

NSW Health has said she was asymptomatic on the flight. \u201cThe student did not attend any classes at the university and stayed on her own in campus accommodation with no close contact before she was admitted to hospital.\u201d About 36 million people are covered by travel restrictions in China, centred around Wuhan city in Hubei province. The Australian government is investigating if it is possible to evacuate Australian citizens from within the quarantine zones. Payne said it was difficult to give definitive answers on the coronavirus situation, saying the outbreak was a \u201cvery serious public health emergency\u201d and a \u201cfast-moving situation\u201d. \u201cWe are looking very closely at what is possible, including consular assistance for people in those areas, and what options there are for helping them with transport out of Wuhan and Hubei province. We\u2019re exploring all opportunities to ensure when it is possible, we can assist their departure.\u201d The US has already announced it plans to fly its diplomats and other citizens at particular risk of the virus out of Wuhan and directly to the US on Tuesday, while France has indicated it wants to extricate its citizens to another part of China for quarantine. Japan and Indonesia have also said they want to get their citizens out. But it may not be possible for other countries to simply remove their citizens. \u201cThe travel restrictions placed on the region by Chinese authorities are placed there for precisely the purpose of containing the coronavirus,\u201d Payne said. \u201cWe\u2019re very conscious of that and we need to abide by the travel restrictions.\u201d Indonesia\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman Teuku Faizayah said evacuating foreign nationals now \u201cseems to be impossible\u201d. \u201cWuhan is still isolated, meaning we can\u2019t get in and out of the city,\u201d Faizasyah told Kompas. Payne said she was \u201cunwise to speculate\u201d on how many Australians may be stuck inside the locked down zones inside China, or how long it might take to get them out. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a definitive number on the number of Australians in Wuhan or in Hubei province because it will include a significant number of dual nationals, some of whom may not have travelled on Australian passports, they\u2019ve travelled on Chinese passports for example.\u201d In NSW, health authorities have instructed any children in the state who\u2019d had direct contact with a confirmed case of coronavirus to stay home from school or daycare for 14 days from the last contact with the infected person. \u201c14 days represents the internationally recognised incubation period for the disease,\u201d NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said. \u201cAfter this time the child is considered to be not be at risk of infection.\u201d Students who have travelled to Wuhan and Hubei during the school holidays can return to school but should be carefully monitored for symptoms of coronavirus infection. \u201cThe most common symptom is a fever,\u201d Chant said. \u201cOther symptoms include, cough, sore throat and shortness of breath.\u201d Any person who exhibits these symptoms should be isolated immediately from other people and should seek medical attention as soon as possible, Chant said. The Australian government\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said there was \u201cno evidence there\u2019s a risk to the Australian public\u201d of a significant outbreak of coronavirus in this country. \u201cThere\u2019s no human-to-human transmission that\u2019s been identified in this country.\u201d Murphy said that despite large numbers of travellers arriving from China daily in Australia, there was no need for large-scale quarantining of all arrivals. China\u2019s National Health Commission has said carriers of the coronavirus can be contagious during the incubation period, while being asymptomatic. But Murphy said that had not been conclusively established. \u201cIt would be very unusual because this virus is similar to the Sars and Mers viruses and they were not infectious before symptoms. The evidence \u2026 that we have seen, doesn\u2019t suggest there\u2019s clear proof of that. \u201cWe\u2019re seeking urgent advice from the World Health Organisation and international experts.

One of the lead prosecutors at Trump\u2019s Senate trial has \u201cthe country\u2019s fate is hanging\u201d on its outcome, as the president\u2019s defence team prepare to make their main arguments on Monday. WHO to meet in Beijing as coronavirus death toll jumps to 80 The World Health Organization is meeting officials in Beijing on Monday to discuss its response to the coronavirus outbreak, after the death toll from the disease rose to 80. More than 400 people are in a critical condition in China after being struck down by the virus, which experts warned may already have infected more than 100,000 people worldwide. Two cases were confirmed in California and Arizona on Sunday, bringing the total in the US to five. Simple precautions. The WHO has offered some basic advice on how to protect yourself from the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine. Cheat sheet More than 200 Auschwitz survivors are gathering at the former Nazi death camp in Poland on Monday, perhaps for the last time, to commemorate the 75th anniversary of its liberation. Despite Pete Buttigieg\u2019s efforts to distance himself from McKinsey, the consulting firm where he worked early in his career, 40 McKinsey employees \u2013 including top executives \u2013 are among the South Bend mayor\u2019s presidential campaign donors. Rockets struck the US embassy in Baghdad on Sunday, wounding at least one person in the first direct hit following months of similar attacks on American targets in Iraq, which Washington has blamed on Iran-backed military factions. Kim Jong-un\u2019s aunt, Kim Kyong-hui, has appeared in public in North Korea for the first time in more than six years \u2013 finally quashing persistent rumours that she had been purged or executed by her nephew\u2019s regime. Must-reads David Schwimmer: \u2018I don\u2019t want to do anything for the money\u2019 As he prepares to launch a new sitcom, David Schwimmer tells David Smith he has come to terms with the idea that he\u2019ll always be best known as Ross from Friends. \u201cThe older I get and the more my perspective shifts,\u201d he says, \u201cthe more you realise just how good you had it.\u201d Why US maternity policy stretches women to the limit The US is one of the only developed countries in the world that offers new mothers not a single day of national paid maternity leave. Miranda Bryant talks to the women who \u201crisked their lives\u201d by returning to work just two weeks after their children were born. Should architects work for repressive regimes? Despots have always used grand building projects to glorify their ideologies. As the progressive architect Bjarke Ingels pursues projects in Saudi Arabia and Bolsonaro\u2019s Brazil, Oliver Wainwright asks him whether he ought to be taking such controversial commissions. Bolivian Christians claim credit for ousting Morales Bolivia\u2019s fast-growing religious right has claimed the removal of the socialist leader Evo Morales was a result of divine intervention. But others are concerned that Bolivia\u2019s status as a secular state is under threat, as Tom Phillips reports from El Alto. Opinion The son of German Jews, Jason Stanley grew up in the shadow of Auschwitz. But as the world marks the 75th anniversary of its liberation, his parents\u2019 experience shows that the horrors of the Holocaust did not begin and end in the death camp. My parents\u2019 scars come from an early fear of having to hide, of having the wrong papers. They remember how they were described in the press and by the leaders \u2013 as criminals, as fundamental threats, as non-humans. They remember the rough treatment from official bureaucracies. They remember the family separations. Sport John McEnroe has described Margaret Court as the \u201ccrazy aunt\u201d of tennis over her controversial views on homosexuality and race. In a video posted to Twitter, McEnroe begged Serena Williams to win two more grand slams and break Court\u2019s all-time record of 24, as the Australian marks 50 years since her calendar grand slam. Liverpool, the apparently invincible Premier League leaders, were humbled on Sunday evening after drawing 2-2 in the FA Cup fourth round against a little-fancied League One side, Shrewsbury Town.

Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use.

      "body": "<p>January is always a struggle \u2013 cold, dark, full of broken resolutions and battered bank balances \u2013 but the beginning of 2020 has been particularly grim. From the crisis in Iran, bushfires in Australia, coronavirus and Brexit around the corner, the year could hardly have got off to a worse start. There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/dec/20/optimists-make-everything-good-writers-thinkers-hope\" title=\"\">hope</a> \u2013 of course \u2013 and there are holidays, too: this is peak booking time for the travel sector.</p> <p>Despite uncertainties around the impact of Brexit, 54% of Britons plan to travel to Europe in 2020, according to a survey by the peer-to-peer currency platform WeSwap. And the good news for anyone who has resolved to give up flying is that we are entering a new golden age of rail travel, with expanding networks, a revival of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/jun/23/five-great-interrail-rail-itineraries-across-europe\" title=\"\">sleeper trains and Interrailing</a>, along with a growing number of travel companies replacing flights with train travel. Add in improved ferry services, a boom in remote hideaways, and alternatives to traditional destinations, and the outlook for anyone wanting to escape the headlines looks positively sunny. Here\u2019s our guide to planning your own exit \u2013 albeit for just a week or two.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"06845c84f785524225fde3baf6ba8ec3a121bebe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06845c84f785524225fde3baf6ba8ec3a121bebe/0_0_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Take the coastal track in Calabria, Italy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Take the coastal track in Calabria, Italy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Panther Media GmbH/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>1 Where to start?</strong></h2> <p>Whether you already have a destination in mind, or are looking for ideas, your first port of call should be <a href=\"https://www.seat61.com/\" title=\"\">the Man in Seat 61</a> \u2013 an independent website covering every stage of booking trains in the UK, Europe and beyond. It includes everything you need to know about routes, fares, buying tickets, timetables and rail passes. The site was founded by Mark Smith in 2001, when cheap flights were booming and the typical seat61 user was, in his words, \u201cafraid of flying, medically restricted from flying or particularly liked train travel\u201d. Undeterred, Smith continued to share his tips \u2013 free \u2013 and this modest former station manager has become a guru among regular rail travellers.</p> <p>Seat61 doesn\u2019t allow you to book tickets. For that you need to go to <a href=\"https://raileurope.co.uk/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0_iczs2K5wIVgbHtCh0_CQq1EAAYASAAEgI2efD_BwE&amp;cmpid=PSB024501&amp;ef_id=EAIaIQobChMI0_iczs2K5wIVgbHtCh0_CQq1EAAYASAAEgI2efD_BwE:G:s&amp;s_kwcid=AL!9357!3!394629199820!b!!g!!%2Brail%20%2Beurope&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_keyword=%2Brail%20%2Beurope\" title=\"\">raileurope.co.uk</a> or <a href=\"https://www.thetrainline.com/\" title=\"\">trainline.com</a> \u2013 both connect to the British, French, German, Austrian, Italian and Spanish railways ticketing systems. Beyond those countries, go to the national rail operator site for the country where you want to start your journey.

Door-to-door, it is quicker or as quick by train from London to Paris, Lille, Brussels, Amsterdam or Rotterdam (all direct routes on Eurostar). The Netherlands\u2019 second largest city is tipped in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jan/04/where-to-go-on-holiday-in-2020-alternative-hotlist-ethical-destinations\" title=\"\">Guardian Travel\u2019s 2020 hotlist</a> for its architecture and progressive urban living (it\u2019s home to the world\u2019s first floating farm, and many hotels, restaurants and attractions support<a href=\"https://rotterdamcirculair.nl/en/about-rotterdam-circular/\" title=\"\"> the city\u2019s goal to be a waste-free society</a>) \u2013 plus it\u2019s less crowded than Amsterdam. Beyond that, yes, travelling by train takes longer \u2013 but that\u2019s part of the appeal. This year, more of us will embrace rail travel, not just for environmental reasons, but because it\u2019s fun. Not convinced? Pick up a copy of the latest edition of <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/europe-by-rail-9783945225028.html\" title=\"\">Europe By Rail</a>, an anthology of 52 routes, from the north of Norway to southern Sicily.</p> <p>Instead of flying direct to Spain, the slow route might include overnight stays in Cahors (Gallo-Roman ruins and excellent red wine) and Foix (\u201cone of those unsung but perfect-looking French towns\u201d) before crossing the Pyrenees and passing through the Catalan countryside to Barcelona. From there, the rest of Spain awaits. At Easter, Renfe, the Spanish rail company, is introducing<a href=\"https://elpais.com/elpais/2019/12/16/inenglish/1576486061_503754.html\" title=\"\"> a new range of low-cost, high-speed </a><a href=\"https://elpais.com/elpais/2019/12/16/inenglish/1576486061_503754.html\" title=\"\">trains</a>, aimed at getting Spanish travellers off the roads, but opening up opportunities for tourists, too. Among the routes will be Barcelona to Madrid for \u20ac10.</p> <h2><strong>3 Sleep through the journey</strong></h2> <p>After being threatened with extinction, Europe\u2019s night-train network is undergoing a renaissance. The driving force behind this is the Austrian state railway, \u00d6BB, which is expanding its <a href=\"https://www.nightjet.com/en/\" title=\"\">Nightjet network</a> across Austria, Germany, Switzerland and Italy into Belgium and the Netherlands. This month saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/20/brussels-vienna-night-train-returns-as-europe-eyes-flying-alternatives\" title=\"\">the return of a Brussels-Vienna sleeper</a>. Departing the Belgium capital at 6pm, you will be rocked to sleep and arrive in the Austrian capital the next day at 8.30am \u2013 perfect timing for a coffee in the opulent setting of <a href=\"https://www.cafegoldegg.at/\" title=\"\">Cafe Goldegg</a>, a five minute walk from the station. At the end of the year, \u00d6BB will add a route going from Amsterdam to Vienna.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0483a1498dc1e9949e565cf48f411a11bd22d9c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0483a1498dc1e9949e565cf48f411a11bd22d9c3/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Spanish Pyrenees.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Spanish Pyrenees.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jekaterina Nikitina/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>4 Interrail is not just for students</strong></h2> <p>There was a time when it looked as if the <a href=\"https://www.interrail.eu/en\">glory days of Interrail</a> were over. Happily, this is another tale of rail revival. In the past 15 years, sales of Interrail passes have almost tripled, with Scandinavia \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/17/the-guardian-view-on-flight-shaming-face-it-life-must-change\" title=\"\">birthplace of the flight-shame movement</a> \u2013 showing the highest growth rate. Young people still account for more sales than any other group, but families and older travellers are catching up.</p> <p>Unlike flights, the price of Interrail passes is fixed and children under the age of 11 go free, making it a better-value option than flying for families travelling in the peak summer months. Add in reductions for travellers under 27 and over 60, free luggage, regular deals and discounts on city attractions and Interrail looks increasingly like a modern miracle.</p> <p>As we leave the EU, plan your own ode to Europe \u2013 along the French and Italian rivieras, perhaps, before heading north into Austria, the Czech Republic and Poland, before returing via Berlin and Brussels. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/jun/23/five-great-interrail-rail-itineraries-across-europe\" title=\"\">For itinerary ideas, go to theguardian.com/travel/interrailing. </a>And remember, for some trains you have to pay an additional booking fee.</p> <h2><strong>5 If you don\u2019t want to DIY it ...</strong></h2> <p>If poring over endless rail timetables is not your idea of fun, fear not \u2013 a growing number of tour operators are incorporating rail travel into their packages. For 2020, <a href=\"https://www.sunvil.co.uk/itineraries/greece/itinerary/greece-by-train---corfu\" title=\"\">Sunvil </a>has introduced Greece by rail for the first time \u2013 offering train journeys to the islands of Corfu, Paxos or Lefkas, and Parga and Sivota on the mainland, via the French Alps, Milan and Bari, from where the ferry departs. <a href=\"https://www.justsardinia.co.uk/pages/alternate-travel-to-sardinia/\" title=\"\">Just Sardinia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.justcorsica.co.uk/pages/alternate-travel-to-corsica/\" title=\"\">Just Corsica</a> are also making it easier to reach islands without flying, building train and ferry crossings into their trips. <a href=\"https://www.inntravel.co.uk/by-rail\" title=\"\">Inn Travel</a>, the walking and cycling specialist, has made all of its European mainland holidays, plus the Balearics and Sicily, available by rail, and trebled the size of its in-house rail team to cope with demand.</p> <h2><strong>6 What about ferries?</strong></h2> <p>Ferries could hardly be called green, but emissions for each passenger are considerably less than short-haul flights and the sector is endeavouring to reduce them. This year, Brittany Ferries is launching the Honfleur, its first liquified-natural-gas-powered ship, to run on the Portsmouth to Caen route, followed by the Salamanca in 2022 and the Santo\u00f1a in 2023 on the Portsmouth-Bilbao service. South of Caen, connect to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/may/20/veloscnic-cycle-route-from-paris-to-mont-saint-michel-normandy\" title=\"\">V\u00e9losc\u00e9nic</a> cycle route that runs between Paris and Mont Saint-Michel, cutting across Normandy, stages of which are easy enough to do with kids.</p> <p>The French are masters of camping, with thousands of excellent sites offering waterparks (Brittany\u2019s Domaine des Ormes), sandy beaches (Domaine de la Bergerie between Cannes and Saint Tropez), alpine views (Campsite de Martini\u00e8re in the Chartreuse regional park, where the owner has a sideline in amazing land art) and more.

      "bodyText": "January is always a struggle \u2013 cold, dark, full of broken resolutions and battered bank balances \u2013 but the beginning of 2020 has been particularly grim. From the crisis in Iran, bushfires in Australia, coronavirus and Brexit around the corner, the year could hardly have got off to a worse start. There is hope \u2013 of course \u2013 and there are holidays, too: this is peak booking time for the travel sector. Despite uncertainties around the impact of Brexit, 54% of Britons plan to travel to Europe in 2020, according to a survey by the peer-to-peer currency platform WeSwap. And the good news for anyone who has resolved to give up flying is that we are entering a new golden age of rail travel, with expanding networks, a revival of sleeper trains and Interrailing, along with a growing number of travel companies replacing flights with train travel. Add in improved ferry services, a boom in remote hideaways, and alternatives to traditional destinations, and the outlook for anyone wanting to escape the headlines looks positively sunny. Here\u2019s our guide to planning your own exit \u2013 albeit for just a week or two. 1 Where to start? Whether you already have a destination in mind, or are looking for ideas, your first port of call should be the Man in Seat 61 \u2013 an independent website covering every stage of booking trains in the UK, Europe and beyond. It includes everything you need to know about routes, fares, buying tickets, timetables and rail passes. The site was founded by Mark Smith in 2001, when cheap flights were booming and the typical seat61 user was, in his words, \u201cafraid of flying, medically restricted from flying or particularly liked train travel\u201d. Undeterred, Smith continued to share his tips \u2013 free \u2013 and this modest former station manager has become a guru among regular rail travellers. Seat61 doesn\u2019t allow you to book tickets. For that you need to go to raileurope.co.uk or trainline.com \u2013 both connect to the British, French, German, Austrian, Italian and Spanish railways ticketing systems. Beyond those countries, go to the national rail operator site for the country where you want to start your journey. Fancy a dip in Budapest\u2019s thermal spas after wandering Prague\u2019s new art spaces? Go to the Czech rail operator \u010cesk\u00e9 Dr\u00e1hy\u2019s website, cd.cz, to book the six-to-seven-hour journey for \u20ac20 (\u00a317) for an advance purchase. To look up train times in Europe, Smith recommends the German railways website bahn.com; and, to take with you, a printed copy of European Rail Time. 2 But rail travel takes longer \u2026 Not always. Door-to-door, it is quicker or as quick by train from London to Paris, Lille, Brussels, Amsterdam or Rotterdam (all direct routes on Eurostar). The Netherlands\u2019 second largest city is tipped in Guardian Travel\u2019s 2020 hotlist for its architecture and progressive urban living (it\u2019s home to the world\u2019s first floating farm, and many hotels, restaurants and attractions support the city\u2019s goal to be a waste-free society) \u2013 plus it\u2019s less crowded than Amsterdam. Beyond that, yes, travelling by train takes longer \u2013 but that\u2019s part of the appeal. This year, more of us will embrace rail travel, not just for environmental reasons, but because it\u2019s fun. Not convinced? Pick up a copy of the latest edition of Europe By Rail, an anthology of 52 routes, from the north of Norway to southern Sicily. Instead of flying direct to Spain, the slow route might include overnight stays in Cahors (Gallo-Roman ruins and excellent red wine) and Foix (\u201cone of those unsung but perfect-looking French towns\u201d) before crossing the Pyrenees and passing through the Catalan countryside to Barcelona. From there, the rest of Spain awaits. At Easter, Renfe, the Spanish rail company, is introducing a new range of low-cost, high-speed trains, aimed at getting Spanish travellers off the roads, but opening up opportunities for tourists, too. Among the routes will be Barcelona to Madrid for \u20ac10. 3 Sleep through the journey After being threatened with extinction, Europe\u2019s night-train network is undergoing a renaissance. The driving force behind this is the Austrian state railway, \u00d6BB, which is expanding its Nightjet network across Austria, Germany, Switzerland and Italy into Belgium and the Netherlands. This month saw the return of a Brussels-Vienna sleeper. Departing the Belgium capital at 6pm, you will be rocked to sleep and arrive in the Austrian capital the next day at 8.30am \u2013 perfect timing for a coffee in the opulent setting of Cafe Goldegg, a five minute walk from the station. At the end of the year, \u00d6BB will add a route going from Amsterdam to Vienna. 4 Interrail is not just for students There was a time when it looked as if the glory days of Interrail were over. Happily, this is another tale of rail revival. In the past 15 years, sales of Interrail passes have almost tripled, with Scandinavia \u2013 birthplace of the flight-shame movement \u2013 showing the highest growth rate. Young people still account for more sales than any other group, but families and older travellers are catching up. Unlike flights, the price of Interrail passes is fixed and children under the age of 11 go free, making it a better-value option than flying for families travelling in the peak summer months. Add in reductions for travellers under 27 and over 60, free luggage, regular deals and discounts on city attractions and Interrail looks increasingly like a modern miracle. As we leave the EU, plan your own ode to Europe \u2013 along the French and Italian rivieras, perhaps, before heading north into Austria, the Czech Republic and Poland, before returing via Berlin and Brussels. For itinerary ideas, go to theguardian.com/travel/interrailing. And remember, for some trains you have to pay an additional booking fee. 5 If you don\u2019t want to DIY it ... If poring over endless rail timetables is not your idea of fun, fear not \u2013 a growing number of tour operators are incorporating rail travel into their packages. For 2020, Sunvil has introduced Greece by rail for the first time \u2013 offering train journeys to the islands of Corfu, Paxos or Lefkas, and Parga and Sivota on the mainland, via the French Alps, Milan and Bari, from where the ferry departs. Just Sardinia and Just Corsica are also making it easier to reach islands without flying, building train and ferry crossings into their trips. Inn Travel, the walking and cycling specialist, has made all of its European mainland holidays, plus the Balearics and Sicily, available by rail, and trebled the size of its in-house rail team to cope with demand. 6 What about ferries? Ferries could hardly be called green, but emissions for each passenger are considerably less than short-haul flights and the sector is endeavouring to reduce them. This year, Brittany Ferries is launching the Honfleur, its first liquified-natural-gas-powered ship, to run on the Portsmouth to Caen route, followed by the Salamanca in 2022 and the Santo\u00f1a in 2023 on the Portsmouth-Bilbao service. South of Caen, connect to the V\u00e9losc\u00e9nic cycle route that runs between Paris and Mont Saint-Michel, cutting across Normandy, stages of which are easy enough to do with kids. The French are masters of camping, with thousands of excellent sites offering waterparks (Brittany\u2019s Domaine des Ormes), sandy beaches (Domaine de la Bergerie between Cannes and Saint Tropez), alpine views (Campsite de Martini\u00e8re in the Chartreuse regional park, where the owner has a sideline in amazing land art) and more. Start your search on lefrenchtime.co.uk, which lists 78 sites from seaside to mountain, river to town, or coolcamping.com\u2019s French glampsites. Stena Line is also investing in new technology and ships. Its rail-and-sail service to Amsterdam is an alternative to Eurostar \u2013 and a good option for families. Go to little-clogs-holidays.co.uk for holiday park suggestions. The Dutch invented Center Parcs, but holiday parks are often cheaper there than in the UK. 7 The great Brexscape This month, the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) issued a statement reassuring travellers that holidays won\u2019t be affected by Brexit in 2020. Valid passports can still be used as normal, the cost of making calls, using the internet and sending texts will remain the same, and coaches and trains from the UK to the continent will be unaffected. The peaks and lakes of central Norway should help clear your head of all thoughts of the B-word. Walks Worldwide\u2019s nine-day self-guided tour follows routes through the Jotunheimen mountains, staying in a mix of hotels, cabins and a lodge (\u00a31,499 each). You are also unlikely to be bothered by the news on the biking tour of rural Albania offered by Much Better Adventures (seven nights, \u00a3774 each). Too adventurous? Switch off in comfort at the isolated Instants d\u2019Absolu Ecolodge, a former farmhouse in the Auvergne, France, with a spa, delicious farm-to-table food and limited wifi and phone signal (Neussargues station is 10km away; from \u00a3122 a night through i-escape.com). Or keep it simple \u2013 with a book by the (small) pool, wine in hand and views of the Umbrian hills at Wild Umbria, a holiday home for four (book through sawdays.co.uk). Cycling specialist BSpoke Tours has a new coastal tour along the wild coast of northern Spain\u2019s Asturias region (from \u00a31,095pp, excluding travel; take Brittany Ferries from Portsmouth to Santander). For sporty families, Adventure Creators puts together multi-activity trips in the French Pyrenees with rock climbing, high ropes and river rafting \u2013 ensuring kids will be so exhausted they may even forget about screens. 8 You could always stay in the UK If the disastrous start to the new decade has left you feeling too weary to contemplate venturing beyond our shores, set your sights on an escape closer to home. The number of secluded cottages, cabins, bothies and boltholes in the UK is on the rise. The National Trust\u2019s collection of remote cottages includes the diminutive Bird How, tucked away in Eskdale valley in the Lake District, which doesn\u2019t even have a TV. Canopy and Stars specialises in places to stay in nature, such as The Woodcock, an eco-cabin on a Norfolk farm with no electricity or wifi. Or browse the idyllic Welsh cottages on underthethatch.co.uk. In the Carmarthenshire hills, you will find T\u0177 Barddu, a modernist cottage with cedar hot tub, but no neighbours or wifi, and the rustic Bryn Eglur, a place, the website says, \u201cto step back in time\u201d \u2013 perfect for pretending the past few years never happened. For guaranteed isolation, Much Better Adventures\u2019s Castaway weekend is a chance to set sail up the Kyles of Bute in Argyll for two nights\u2019 wild camping on a remote island \u2013 and the added bonus of learning survival skills (could come in handy).

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use.

Other companies, including the banking firm Standard Chartered, imposed travel bans to the city of Wuhan. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, also restricted travel, while HSBC said it was closely monitoring the situation for the safety of its employees.</p> \n<p>In a signal of the impact on international business, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/11e019c2-fbdb-3c50-a7fe-d15cec8648c7\">Credit Suisse</a>, the Swiss bank, sent staff in Hong Kong a memo telling them to work from home and not to travel to its headquarters in the city if they had visited the mainland in the last 14 days.

      "bodyText": "Financial markets around the world have been rocked as an exodus of foreign workers from China intensified fears over the impact of the coronavirus on the world\u2019s second largest economy. Major global companies have begun pulling staff from the province of Hubei at the hear of the outbreak or imposed travel restrictions on staff across Asia, telling any workers who visited the region to stay at home. Global shares slid despite the Chinese authorities stepping up their response, with more than 2,700 cases and 81 deaths confirmed. The FTSE 100 closed down by more than 2%, or 174 points, at 7,412 and other European markets sustained heavy losses as concerns increased over China\u2019s economy as it attempts to bounce back from its long-running trade conflict with the US. Shares dropped on Wall Street and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by about 400 points, tumbling from record high levels recorded earlier this year. The French automotive group Peugeot said it was working to evacuate 38 international employees and their families from Hubei, where it has three production sites. Other companies, including the banking firm Standard Chartered, imposed travel bans to the city of Wuhan. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, also restricted travel, while HSBC said it was closely monitoring the situation for the safety of its employees. In a signal of the impact on international business, Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank, sent staff in Hong Kong a memo telling them to work from home and not to travel to its headquarters in the city if they had visited the mainland in the last 14 days. According to the Financial Times, the bank is also offering temperature checks at its main office. Standard Chartered, which is based in London but makes most of its profits and has most of its staff in Asia, is reducing face-to-face working in China and Hong Kong alongside its travel restrictions. It is also offering training on disinfecting and deep-cleansing buildings, teaching staff to recognise symptoms, and providing masks and hand sanitisers. Luxury goods makers with significant sales in China and Asia plunged on financial markets across Europe, including Burberry and LVMH. Such firms would usually stand to benefit from a rise in sales from the lunar new year celebrations last Saturday. Airlines and hotel groups, which could face losses because of travel bans, came under heavy selling pressure, while mining firms that have benefited from China\u2019s manufacturing boom in recent years also fell in value. Anglo American and Glencore also suffered, while the price of a barrel of oil fell by around 3% to below $60 amid concerns that the outbreak could exacerbate an economic slowdown in China and the rest of the world. Joshua Mahony, a senior market analyst at the financial trading group IG, said: \u201cThe further this virus spreads, the worse it will be for Chinese economic output. We are also seeing commodity stocks slump, with the prospect of a decline in Chinese growth hurting expectations of demand in the sector.\u201d Safe-haven assets such as gold and government bonds jumped. Chinese financial markets were closed for the lunar new year, while Bloomberg reported that stock markets in the country could remain closed until at least next Monday as Beijing grapples with the worsening crisis. Comparisons with the 2003 Sars outbreak have highlighted the potential for a prolonged process that could damage economic growth. After the Sars outbreak, China\u2019s annual GDP growth fell to 9.1% in the second quarter of 2003 from 11.1% in the previous three-month period, as the government imposed travel restrictions. However, GDP growth recovered to 10% in the second half of 2003. This time around, the Chinese economy is much larger and more connected to the global economy. However, analysts said the government response to the coronavirus outbreak appeared to be tougher and more transparent, which could help limit the impact. Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said Chinese GDP growth would be significantly damaged by the outbreak. Rail passenger numbers on Saturday, the first day of the lunar new year, were 42% lower than on the equivalent day in 2019 and road passengers 25% lower. The declines in May 2003, the peak month of the Sars outbreak, were 57% and 45% respectively. \u201cEven if the coronavirus outbreak is brought under control quicker than Sars was in 2003, the economic impact now looks likely to be of at least a similar scale,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "A patient presents at an emergency department somewhere in the world. They are feverish and vomiting. Doctors suspect it is influenza, but they are wrong. When the outbreak of a virulent new disease such as the coronavirus is identified, the starting gun is fired on a vast, multimillion-dollar international effort to try to contain it. But nothing can start before a health professional determines that, against the odds, they are confronting something exceptional. \u201cYou need to work through that process, establish that this is an out-of-the-ordinary disease and say, let\u2019s do lab tests on it,\u201d says Jonathan Quick, an adjunct professor of global health and author of The End of Epidemics. Sometimes the signs are clear: health workers becoming infected, or patients growing sicker or dying faster than expected. Other cases rely on a hunch. In 2003, the Italian specialist Carlo Urbani was asked to examine a patient in a Vietnamese hospital with symptoms of influenza. Urbani saw a different pattern. He commissioned tests, reinforced infection controls around the patient and alerted the World Health Organization. A global alert for a virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) was declared 12 days later. Urbani died from it the following month. Advances in medical science by the late 1960s led some experts to declare that humanity had conquered infectious diseases. It was wishful thinking. Two decades into the 21st century, viruses are breaking out more frequently than in the past, data shows. One factor is that humans are spreading into territories we have never lived in before, bringing us into contact with animal populations carrying diseases our bodies never learned to fight. The 2014 Ebola outbreak was formally identified more than two and a half months after it was first detected. The 2015\u201316 epidemic of Zika,the mosquito-borne virus that led to 3,000 severe birth defects, took 37 days. The disease always gets a head start, and not just for biological reasons. An epidemic may be a medical phenomenon, but it is social and political too. \u2018Your rate of growth needs to be less than one\u2019 In the crucible of an outbreak, sharing information is one of the most important factors in saving lives. But instincts often lead the other way. When Sars emerged in China in November 2002, it raged for several months before Beijing alerted the WHO. \u201cChina actively hid Sars from the international community and the WHO was really disempowered,\u201d says Alexandra Phelan, an adjunct professor at the Georgetown law school. The same urgent need for transparency applies to scientists studying the disease, some of whom have been incentivised in the past to withhold important findings in a crisis for fear they may not be able to publish them in medical journals later. The impulse for secrecy even extended to Liberian villages afflicted with Ebola, where out of fear and mistrust some families would hide sick or deceased relatives from medical teams. \u201cInformation sharing is what it\u2019s all about,\u201d says Rebecca Katz, the director of the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know something is happening, you can\u2019t stop it.\u201d Once an outbreak is identified, the focus can shift to stopping its spread, which in theory is straightforward. \u201cYour rate of growth needs to be less than one,\u201d says Joshua Ginsberg, the president of the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies. \u201cIf every person who gets the disease gives it to slightly less than one person, then the disease will go away.\u201d That requires determining who is already sick, and who may become so.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The disease has already spread to more than 10 countries abroad, with fresh cases continuing to emerge.

An extended lunar New Year holiday is nothing to celebrate for China, instead it represents an escalation of attempts to contain the deadly virus by restricting travel and locking down major cities. </p> <p>As the death toll rises, all eyes are on the World Health Organisation. So far it has resisted calls to declare the outbreak a health emergency.

Previous experience of global health crises does at least suggest there could be a fairly rapid recovery once the number of cases has peaked.</p> </blockquote> <p>The FTSE 100 index in London is one of the worst performers outside China because it is heavily weighted towards the resources sector, whose fortunes are closely tied to the commodity-hungry Chinese economy.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e2eea008f08a6950eb49ce1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-27T13:49:24.650Z\">1.49pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The sell-off on stock and commodity markets continues, as investors panic about the deadly coronavirus outbreak in China, which has spread to more than 10 other countries.

As for global equities, there was minimal impact at all. This time round, the Chinese economy is much larger and much more connected with the global economy.

As for global equities, the risk is clearly that the news gets worse before it gets better and the market correction could well have further to run as a result. </p> <p><strong>Indeed, corrections of 5-10% are surprisingly common. In the past, however, even when global health scares have impacted markets, the effect has been short-lived.

Consumption and travel were most affected. Retail sales growth fell to 4.3% y/y in May 2003 from an average of 9% in the previous six months ... However, [it was] quick to rebound. </p> <p>Similarly, industrial value added growth slowed to 13.7% y/y in May 2003 from 17.5% at the beginning of 2003. But it recovered to 17% in June and stayed robust for the rest of 2003. Investment and property market activities, on the other hand, were largely unaffected, in part bolstered by monetary easing. </p> </blockquote> <p>Similar to the Sars outbreak, he expects the impact of the Wuhan coronavirus to be mostly be felt on consumption (through retail and tourism-related sectors) and to a lesser degree on other economic drivers (such as investment and industrial value added). </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We also anticipate the economic impact to be less severe compared to the Sars episode, at least for now. The faster reaction time by the Chinese authorities this time around, with increased transparency and firm actions taken recently, are certainly helpful in mitigating the impact on public health, confidence and the economy... </p> <p>We also expect the government to roll out measures, if needed, to stabilise growth.

      "bodyText": "Global stock and commodity markets have been rocked by the coronavirus outbreak in China, as the death toll and infection rates continue to climb and the outbreak has spread to 10 other countries, including France, Japan and the US. It took one day for European stocks to give up all their gains so far this year. Investors are fretting about the impact on travel, tourism and the wider economy. The common view is that economic output is likely to be hit in the short term, as Chinese authorities have widened travel restrictions and extended the lunar new year holiday by three days until Sunday to contain the outbreak. China\u2019s Shenzhen stock exchange says it will re-open next Monday. Oil, copper and iron ore prices have sold off, as demand from commodity-hungry China is expected to weaken. Brent crude fell as low as $58.50 and is now at $49.17 a barrel, down $1.52 or 2.5%. US crude has shed 2.3% to $52.92 a barrel. Copper prices fell to a three-month lower and panic selling also spread to other industrial metals. Saudi Arabia\u2019s energy minister has cautioned against \u201cextreme pessimism,\u201d though \u2013\u2013 he noted that during the Sars outbreak in 2002-3, there was a similar amount of pessimism but the virus did note cause a significant reduction in oil demand. Japan\u2019s Nikkei lost 2% while many other Asian markets were closed for the lunar new year holiday. European shares followed suit: the FTSE 100 index in London has slid 2.1%, or 160 points, to 7425. Germany\u2019s Dax has lost 2.6%, France\u2019s CAC, home to many top luxury brands, has slid 2.7% and Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB is 1.85% lower. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones fell 1.54%, the S&amp;P 500 dropped 1.57% and the Nasdaq shed 2.05%. The panic selling sparked a flight to safe-haven investments such as gold, which rose as much as 1% to $1,585.80 an ounce, the highest since 8 January, and later traded 0.56% higher at $1,579.33 an ounce. Thank you for all your comments. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. Good-bye! There are also heavy losses on Wall Street after the opening bell. Dow Jones down nearly 530 points, or 1.8%, at 28,459 S&amp;P 500 down nearly 60 points, or 1.8%, at 3235 Nasdaq down 220 points, or 2.36%, at 9094 The oil price has come back a bit, but is still down $1.46 at $59.23 a barrel, a fall of 2.4%. But mining companies are not the only ones suffering during the equity sell-off. Europe\u2019s top luxury names \u2013\u2013 including LVMH, Kering, L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Burberry and Hermes \u2013\u2013 have seen nearly $50bn wiped off their market value since the virus outbreak. Analysts at Bernstein calculate that Chinese consumers spent $149bn during the lunar new year holiday last year and that\u2019s unlikely to be repeated this year due to the travel restrictions. The outbreak couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time \u2013\u2013 millions of Chinese usually travel during the holiday period, but many have been forced to ditch their plans. Russ Mould, investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, says: The market is back in panic mode about China\u2019s coronavirus. An extended lunar New Year holiday is nothing to celebrate for China, instead it represents an escalation of attempts to contain the deadly virus by restricting travel and locking down major cities. As the death toll rises, all eyes are on the World Health Organisation. So far it has resisted calls to declare the outbreak a health emergency. Should that change there could be restrictions on international trade and travel, putting pressure on a fragile global economy. The difficulty for investors is that it is extremely difficult to predict what turn events might take in the coming days and weeks. Until there are signs the virus has been contained equities look set to be dogged by uncertainty. Previous experience of global health crises does at least suggest there could be a fairly rapid recovery once the number of cases has peaked. The FTSE 100 index in London is one of the worst performers outside China because it is heavily weighted towards the resources sector, whose fortunes are closely tied to the commodity-hungry Chinese economy. The sell-off on stock and commodity markets continues, as investors panic about the deadly coronavirus outbreak in China, which has spread to more than 10 other countries. Here is our markets story. Rupert Thompson, chief investment officer at the Aim-listed wealth management firm Kingswood, has also compared the Wuhan outbreak with the Sars outbreak in the early 2000s. He says the short term impact on the Chinese economy is \u201clikely to be considerable\u201d but he is fairly relaxed about the impact on the global economy \u2013\u2013 and stock markets. Global equities had started to looked vulnerable to a correction following their gain of close to 14% since early October, and the coronavirus has provided the catalyst for just such a setback. [The Sars] outbreak hit Chinese growth and the Chinese equity market significantly but the impact was short-lived with both rebounding within a matter of months. As for global equities, there was minimal impact at all. This time round, the Chinese economy is much larger and much more connected with the global economy. The Chinese authorities have also imposed much more draconian measures to try and halt the virus. Turning to the world economy and equity markets: We continue to expect global growth to recover a little over the coming year on the back of the relaxation of monetary policy and easing in trade tensions. As for global equities, the risk is clearly that the news gets worse before it gets better and the market correction could well have further to run as a result. Indeed, corrections of 5-10% are surprisingly common. In the past, however, even when global health scares have impacted markets, the effect has been short-lived. At the peak of Ebola fears in 2014, global equities fell back 9% over the course of a month but had recouped these losses within weeks. Tommy Wu, senior Asia economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, says the current coronavirus outbreak could \u201cpotentially be a high impact but short-lived event, similar to the Sars experience in 2003\u201d. He reckons it could drag GDP growth lower in China in the first quarter and possibly also the second, but beyond that the impact should begin to fade. Following the Sars outbreak, China\u2019s GDP growth fell to 9.1% y/y in Q2 2003 from 11.1% in the previous quarter and subsequently recovered to 10% in H2 2003. Consumption and travel were most affected. Retail sales growth fell to 4.3% y/y in May 2003 from an average of 9% in the previous six months ... However, [it was] quick to rebound. Similarly, industrial value added growth slowed to 13.7% y/y in May 2003 from 17.5% at the beginning of 2003. But it recovered to 17% in June and stayed robust for the rest of 2003. Investment and property market activities, on the other hand, were largely unaffected, in part bolstered by monetary easing. Similar to the Sars outbreak, he expects the impact of the Wuhan coronavirus to be mostly be felt on consumption (through retail and tourism-related sectors) and to a lesser degree on other economic drivers (such as investment and industrial value added). We also anticipate the economic impact to be less severe compared to the Sars episode, at least for now. The faster reaction time by the Chinese authorities this time around, with increased transparency and firm actions taken recently, are certainly helpful in mitigating the impact on public health, confidence and the economy... We also expect the government to roll out measures, if needed, to stabilise growth. Though we do not expect significant monetary easing amid the ongoing campaign to rein in financial risks. My colleague Joanna Partridge writes: Brexit uncertainty plus political turmoiled equalled financial distress for almost half a million British businesses in the final three months of last year, according to a new survey which measures corporate health. About 494,000 companies were found to be in significant distress in the last quarter of 2019 by the latest red flag alert from insolvency firm Begbies Traynor, representing about 14% of all economically active firms and the highest number since the survey began in 2004. Significant distress is described as firms which have county court judgments of of less than \u00a35000 filed against them, or businesses which have been identified by its credit risk system. The number of businesses in significant distress has risen by 81% since the start of 2016. The uncertainty following the European referendum result is partly to blame, according to Julie Palmer, a partner at Begbies Traynor. \u201cDistress increased to record levels on the back of ongoing uncertainty around Brexit. These figures clearly demonstrate the impact of this indecision, and with political certainty and a clear Brexit path, UK businesses should, at last, be able to plan for 2020 with a greater sense of clarity,\u201d she said. Retail, real estate and property and construction sectors suffered more than others, although significant distress at businesses rose in 15 out of 22 sectors of the economy. The highest year-on-year increase in the number of businesses suffering significant financial distress was seen in the real estate and property sector, with a 13% rise in the number of businesses affected. The survey finds financial difficulties affecting both bricks-and-mortar and online retailers. On currency markets, sterling has risen slightly versus the dollar and the euro (to $1.3087 and \u20ac1.1872), as the Brexit date of 31 January approaches. Cailin Birch, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit in London, has sent us her thoughts on the decline in oil prices. The recent drop in Brent crude oil prices, below $60 a barrel, reflects two main factors: a recent spike in concerns over the impact of the coronavirus stemming from China, and deeper, more lingering concerns about the health of the global economy. Our China experts believe that the economic impact of the coronavirus will depend on how quickly it is contained and the confidence of the public in the authorities\u2019 ability to take effective measures. The experience of previous disease outbreaks, including Sars in 2002-03, suggests that consumer spending could be negatively affected in the next 2-3 months, but that this is likely to be compensated for later in the year. The oil market\u2019s initial reaction is relatively in line with this outlook. Confidence in global oil demand growth had strengthened slightly in December and early January, buoyed by the signature of the US-China phase-one trade agreement. The virus outbreak has been a setback. She expects oil prices to remain around $60 to $65 a barrel in the coming months, provided that the virus remains contained, as the negative effects have largely been priced in. \u201cIf conditions in China were to deteriorate, however, Brent crude prices could dip by another $3-$5 per barrel.\u201d Global markets have been rocked by the spread of the deadly coronavirus, which originated at a sea food market in Wuhan in southern China and has claimed the lives of 81 people so far, with thousands more infected. About 44 cases have been confirmed outside China in more than 10 other countries, including the US, France and Japan. Many Asian stock markets were closed for the lunar new year holiday (which has been extended to Sunday in China), but Japan\u2019s Nikkei index shed 2%, its biggest one-day drop in five months. In Europe, 586 stocks on the pan-European 600 Stoxx index are in the red. Mining, luxury and travel shares have been badly hit. Wall Street futures are pointing to falls of 1.4% on the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones, and a steeper drop of 1.9% on the tech-heavy Nasdaq. UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 185 points, or 2.45%, at 7400.46 Germany\u2019s Dax down 284 points, or 2.09%, at 13,292 France\u2019s CAC down 132 points, or 2.2%, at 5891 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 386 points, or 1.6%, at 23,583 Oil, copper and iron ore prices have fallen, on expectations that the virus could exacerbate the economic slowdown in China and the rest of the world. This would translate into weaker demand for commodities. Brent crude has slid more than $2, or 3.36%, to $58.65 a barrel. US crude has lost 3.43% to $52.33. Investors are buying safe-haven assets instead of stocks, for example the Japanese yen and Swiss franc, gold and US Treasury bonds. Spot gold jumped 1% to a near three-week high, and later traded 0.82% higher at $1,583 an ounce. Silver also rose 1% to $18.25 an ounce. However, consumer credit was relatively weak, according to the UK Finance figures. It grew by 4% year-on-year in December, the joint-weakest pace since April. Within this, credit card lending rose 2.4%, the second-weakest performance since late 2014. The Bank of England\u2019s monetary policy committee meets on Thursday and will discuss whether to cut interest rates in response to the economic slowdown at the end of 2019 \u2013\u2013 or to stay put amid signs of recovery since December\u2019s election. It will be the last meeting chaired by Mark Carney, the outgoing Bank of England governor. He and two other policymakers have spoken publicly about the possibility of a rate cut after economic growth in the 12 months to November slowed to 0.6%, the weakest pace since 2012. The meeting takes place a day before the UK leaves the European Union. Carney\u2019s last day at the Bank is 15 March, before he becomes the UN\u2019s special envoy for climate action and finance. Separate figures from UK Finance, which represents UK banks and building societies, show that lenders approved the highest number of mortgages in more than four years in December. Mortgage approvals for house purchase hit 46,815, the most since August 2015. The value of mortgage lending rose the most since March 2016, up a net \u00a33.77bn. House price surveys are also pointing to a pick-up in the housing market since the general election in mid-December. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the forecasting group EY Item Club, says: December\u2019s jump in mortgage approvals adds to a growing amount of firmer data and survey evidence suggesting that the housing market could well be changing up a gear after a lacklustre 2019. In other news... Business morale in Germany worsened unexpectedly this month, after the economy narrowly avoided slipping into recession last year. Europe\u2019s largest economy expanded 0.6% in 2019, the weakest growth since 2013. The closely watched business climate index from the Ifo institute fell to 95.9 from 96.1 in December. Ifo president Clemens Fuest said companies had become more pessimistic looking ahead, while their assessment of the current situation had improved slightly. The German economy is starting the year in a cautious mood. Interestingly, business confidence in the service sector slumped while the struggling manufacturing sector showed signs of recovery. How will Hong Kong be affected? Its economy dipped into recession last year as the pro-democracy protests took their toll. Hong Kong has six confirmed cases of the coronavirus, and has banned residents of China\u2019s Hubei province from entering. According to Reuters, the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in China has climbed to 81 and the virus has spread to more than 10 countries, including France, Japan, Canada and the United States. On the stock markets, shares of mining companies have been hit, as they are hugely dependent on demand from China. Evraz is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 index in London, down 5.6%, and fellow miners Anglo American, Antofogasta and Rio Tinto have also tumbled. Luxury goods companies are also down again across Europe \u2013\u2013 Burberry, LVMH, Kering and L\u2019Or\u00e9al. London-listed Burberry has lost 5.3%, for example. Chinese consumers usually go on a spending spree during lunar new year, but this won\u2019t happen this time as the travel bans imposed due to the coronavirus outbreak have restricted the movement of tens of millions of people. Airline and travel stocks are in the red, including the UK cruise company Carnival. Prudential, Britain\u2019s biggest insurer, has slid 5.2%, as it makes a large chunk of its profits in Asia. The sell-off on stock markets is gathering pace. London\u2019s FTSE 100 index has tumbled more than 2%, or 154 points, to 7431.77. Germany\u2019s Dax down 206 points, or 1.52%, at 13,370 France\u2019s CAC down 100 points, or 1.68%, at 5923 Italy\u2019s FTSE MiB down 204 points, or 0.85%, at 23,766 The Saudi energy minister mentioned the Sars outbreak. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) first appeared in November 2002 in southern China and killed more than 750 people in 37 countries. It was contained by placing patients in quarantine. The outbreak ended in 2004 and the disease has never resurfaced. The diseases are similar \u2013\u2013 Sars and the new virus are from the same coronavirus family, and both attack the lungs \u2013\u2013 but China has responded differently to the latest outbreak, which originated at a seafood market in Wuhan. Sars was traced back to virus-infected bats. Thomas Abraham, author of Twenty-First Century Plague: The Story of Sars, wrote in the Guardian last week: In 2002, China was in denial and concealed the existence of Sars not merely from the outside world but from its own people. Newspapers were forbidden from reporting the disease, except for occasional statements from government officials assuring the public that there was nothing to worry about ... The fallout from China\u2019s handling of Sars forced a move towards greater openness that has been apparent in other outbreaks of disease. In the case of the Wuhan flu, the World Health Organization as well as the public were informed on 31 December about the new disease. By early January, the virus had been identified as a coronavirus by Chinese scientists, and its genetic sequence had been shared globally. Both of these moves were essential for an effective global response to the disease. Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest oil producer, is closely monitoring developments in global oil markets as the deadly coronavirus spreads, amid \u201cgloomy expectations\u201d for the impact on the Chinese and global economy, the country\u2019s energy minister said on Monday. Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said the Opec oil cartel and its allies could act to restore the stability of the oil market if needed \u2013\u2013 but added he was confident that the Chinese government and international community would be able to contain the spread of the virus and eradicate it. Brent crude is down $1.1, or 1.83%, at $59.58 a barrel, after hitting $58.68 earlier, the lowest level since late October. US crude slid 1.1% to $53.1 a barrel, after falling as low as $52.1, the lowest since early October. Prince Abdulaziz said in a statement: Such extreme pessimism occurred back in 2003 during the Sars outbreak, though it did not cause a significant reduction in oil demand. He said the kingdom and other members of Opec, along with a group of other oil producers known as Opec+, have the capability and flexibility needed to respond to any developments, by taking the necessary actions to support oil market stability, if the situation so requires. Opec+, which includes Russia, has been pumping less oil to support prices. The Saudi energy minister said all options were open when Opec+ meets in Vienna in March, but added that it was too early to say whether more cuts to supply were needed. The FTSE 100 index in London has fallen more than 110 points in early trading, losing 1.49% to 7473.29. Over on the continent, stocks have also tumbled. France\u2019s CAC has slid 1.7% while Germany\u2019s Dax and Spain\u2019s Ibex are both down 1.5%. You can follow the latest news about the spread of the deadly virus on our main news blog. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The year of the rat has not got off to a good start. Shares tumbled in the Asian markets that were open on Monday, as the death toll due to the coronavirus rose to at least 80 and the virus continued to spread. China extended its week-long lunar new year holiday by three days to 2 February and widened the restrictions that have curbed the movement of tens of millions of people. The head of the World Health Organisation will hold a special meeting with officials in Beijing today to discuss how to contain the coronavirus, as more cases were confirmed outside China. More than 400 people are critically ill and over 2,700 people are known to be infected in China, although experts are warning that up to 100,000 could be infected around the world. Japan\u2019s Nikkei lost 2%, its biggest one-day fall in five months. Markets in China, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong were closed for the lunar new year holiday. A Tokyo-listed China proxy, the ChinaAMC CSI 300 index ETF, shed 2.2%. European shares are expected to open more than 1% down, while safe-haven assets such as the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc, gold and US Treasury bonds are in demand. Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, slumped below $59 a barrel, and later traded at $59.38, down $1.3 or 2.2%. China is the world\u2019s biggest oil importer.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Asked if he supported flying Britons back from Wuhan, and elsewhere, Hunt told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI think I would be very sympathetic and I\u2019m sure the Foreign Office would be too.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cThis is a very difficult time of year for the NHS \u2013 it is the most difficult time. But, again, my experience is that the NHS does know how to cope with these kinds of emergencies.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThe thing that will be difficult is the knock-on impact on other NHS services,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt would be very, very challenging for the NHS in terms of the regular workload but I have absolutely no doubt that, when it comes to doing what is necessary to isolate the virus and keep the public safe, our doctors and nurses will do exactly what they need to do.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a6078f6-5a66-4d3e-9339-5610fe320767\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.</p>\n    <p>The UN agency&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public\">advises</a>&nbsp;people to:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap</li>\n     <li>Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing</li>\n     <li>Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough</li>\n     <li>Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers</li>\n     <li>Advice about face masks varies.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus.

The Boarding Schools\u2019 Association, which represents 550 independent and state boarding schools, urged its members to support pupils from affected areas who may be worried about friends and families. And in new guidance published on its website, it warns: \u201cStay alert for any signs of xenophobia by students towards one another, or by any external audiences, either in school or on social media sites. \u201cSuch behaviour should not be tolerated and action should be taken against anyone acting in this way.\u201d Media coverage of the coronavirus outbreak in the UK has noted the 120,000 Chinese students currently enrolled in UK universities, but the number of Chinese pupils at private schools in the UK has also grown in recent years. According to the latest statistics published by the Independent Schools Council (ISC), an umbrella body that includes famous public schools such as Eton and Harrow as well as hundreds of smaller prep schools, there are almost 10,000 pupils from mainland China now studying at ISC schools. Asked about xenophobia, the BSA said there had been no reports of incidents. \u201cWe have not heard of anything happening in our schools, and we don\u2019t envisage it happening in our schools, we are trying to make sure we are covering every eventuality.\u201d The latest BSA guidance also advises member schools to warn families against travelling back to China and Hong Kong in the February half-term, suggesting schools could be kept open to accommodate pupils instead.

Health secretary Matt Hancock has said that \u201canyone in the UK who has returned from Wuhan in the last 14 days\u201d should self-isolate. About 73 people have been tested negative for the virus in the UK, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. Health experts say they would be surprised if the virus does not spread to the UK. Wuhan\u2019s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, has admitted the authorities were too slow in how they released information about the virus. Appearing on state TV he said: \u201cWe were not sufficiently in time, and we did not make good use of many helpful information.\u201d China\u2019s Daily newspaper released images allegedly showing the first wing of a specialist hospital for coronavirus patients built in just 16 hours in Wuhan. However, Twitter users were quick to point out that the shared image of a modular building can be seen elsewhere on the internet, for example here. Turkey urged its citizens not to travel to China unless necessary to avoid infection with the coronavirus, and Ukraine warned against all but essential travel to the Hubei province. The UK government is under pressure to evacuate Britons stranded in the city of Wuhan and the province of Hubei. The Foreign Office said it was \u201cworking to make available an option\u201d for British nationals to leave Hubei. Britons stranded in the Wuhan say the UK response has been \u201cpathetic\u201d. France, Japan, the US and Spain are all attempting to evacuate citizens stranded in China. The lunar new year holiday in China has been extended until 2 February across China and to 9 February in Shanghai. Chongqing municipality \u2013 one of China\u2019s biggest \u2013 has banned inter-province bus travel for its nearly 30 million residents. Hong Kong has banned Hubei residents from entering. New coronavirus cases have been reported in Australia, South Korea and Canada. Cambodia and Sri Lanka reported their first case. World Heath Organization chiefs have held meetings in Beijing on Monday. The WHO\u2019s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus last week urged China to ensure lockdown measures are kept \u201cshort in duration\u201d. That\u2019s all for now, we will update the blog later if there are new developments. Ukraine has advised its citizens against all non-essential travel to the Hubei Province in China, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak. Ukrainian authorities also advised citizens traveling to China to take precautions, including avoiding contact with people displaying signs of respiratory diseases. The Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC) said on Monday that \u201cthe immediate health risk from [coronavirus] in the U.S. is currently considered low.\u201d According to new figures published on its website on Monday, there are 73 people in the US still under investigation, 32 confirmed negative and 5 positive. \u201cThere is an ongoing investigation to determine more about this outbreak. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available,\u201d a statement said. The CDC added that reported illnesses in infected people had ranged from little to no symptoms to people being severely ill and dying. Turkey has urged its citizens not to travel to China unless necessary to avoid infection with the coronavirus. \u201cIt is highly recommended that our citizens do not travel to China unless it is necessary and if they travel there, they should stay away from the regions where the cases are seen, especially in Hubei province,\u201d the Turkish ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement on Monday. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has announced that it is working on a coronavirus vaccine, in collaboration with the World Health Organization and several other partners. CEPI said it will \u201cbegin three programmes\u201d aimed at creating an effective vaccine against the virus that has so far killed 82 reported cases. Health secretary Matt Hancock told MPs that \u201call possible means\u201d were being used to get in contact with the 1,460 people who have travelled to the UK from Wuhan before the city went on lockdown. \u201cWe\u2019re collaborating with [...] Border Force, with the airlines and with others including universities, schools and cultural organisations to try to make contact,\u201d Hancock said. China has announced that 60.33bn yuan (6.6bn GBP) will be allocated for the sole purpose of fighting the coronavirus outbreak. China\u2019s Ministry of Finance and National Health Commission said funds would be used to prop up public health services and epidemic prevention. France expects to repatriate up to a few hundred of its 800 citizens living in the Wuhan area, though evacuees will have to spend 14 days in quarantine to avoid spreading the virus in France. Japanese citizens who wish to return home from Wuhan are expected to be flown out via charter flights as early as Tuesday, Reuters reports. Japan\u2019s foreign minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, said about 430 Japanese nationals had been confirmed to be in Hubei province. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, has questioned whether there are enough specialist beds available in the NHS to deal with any potential coronavirus outbreak in the UK. Ashworth said specialist extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) beds might be needed for the treatment of the virus, and they were already in high demand in the UK, PA reported. He asked the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to \u201cupdate the House on how many ECMO beds are currently open and what preparations the NHS is making on that front?\u201d Hancock responded: \u201cThere are four centres that are stood up and ready should there be a need. The centres are in Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 hospital (London), Liverpool, Newcastle and the Royal Free (London) and there is a further escalation if more beds are So we are ready, but of course we keep all these things under review.\u201d The total number of confirmed people infected with the coronavirus now stands at 2,887, with 2,827 of these in China. Australia had 4 confirmed cases, Cambodia 1, France 3, Hong Kong 5, Japan 3, Macao 2, Malaysia 3, Nepal 1, Singapore 4, Taiwan 3, Thailand 5, Vietnam 2, South Korea 2, Sri Lanka 1 and the US 5. This post was amended on 29 January 2020 to change \u201cTaipei\u201d to Taiwan. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has told MPs that the risk to the UK population is low and the country is \u201cwell prepared and well equipped\u201d to respond if required. However, he added that the Foreign Office was \u201crapidly advancing measures to bring UK nationals back from Hubei province\u201d. \u201cCoronaviruses do not usually spread if people don\u2019t have symptoms \u2013 but we cannot be 100% certain. \u201cFrom today, we are therefore asking anyone in the UK who has returned from Wuhan in the last 14 days to self-isolate. Stay indoors and avoid contact with other people \u2013 and to contact NHS 111. \u201cIf you are in Northern Ireland, you should phone your GP. \u201cIf you develop respiratory symptoms within 14 days of travel to the area, and are now in the UK, call your GP or ring 111 informing them of your symptoms and your recent travel to the city. \u201cDo not leave your home until you have been given advice by a clinician.\u201d Hancock added that efforts were continuing to trace people who have arrived in the UK from Wuhan: \u201cHaving eliminated those who we know have since left the country, there are 1,460 people we are seeking to locate. \u201cThe Foreign Office is rapidly advancing measures to bring UK nationals back from Hubei province. \u201cI have asked my officials to ensure there are appropriate measures in place upon arrival to look after them and protect the public.\u201d The health secretary asked Britons in Hubei province to get in contact with the Foreign Office. People\u2019s Daily, China\u2019s largest newspaper, has claimed on Twitter that an \u201cantiviral spray\u201d that can be applied to the throat and shield from infection with the coronavirus has been developed in a clinical centre in Shanghai. The tweet seemed to imply that the spray is already being used by hospital staff in China on the frontline of the virus outbreak, as it emphasised that \u201cmass-production for public use is not available for now\u201d. The US president, Donald Trump, has commented on the coronavirus on Twitter, stating that his administration has offered help to China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping: Dubai\u2019s Emirates airline has advised its flight crews to stay in their hotels when on a layover in China to avoid infection risk with the coronavirus. According to Reuters, the airline also recommends that crew avoid areas with a potential for large gatherings of people. The expert added that it was probably difficult for someone infected with coronavirus to transmit it to others without coughing or sneezing, but that more research was needed. Van Kerkhove said that so far there was no evidence that the virus was mutating. Van Kerkhove said a lot of people were asking whether receiving mail from Wuhan posed an infection risk, and said that this was not a concern, as the virus would not survive for that long a journey. She added that not many children had been infected so far, and that about three to six feet (1-2 metres) of distance should be kept from those carrying the virus in order to avoid infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) has invited people to participate in a live Q&amp;A with the epidemiologist Dr Maria Van Kerkhove on Twitter. Van Kerkhove, who specialises in respiratory diseases, said that while it was confirmed that this was a \u201cnew\u201d coronavirus, it was still being investigated whether it was transmitted from an animal. She added that currently there were 37 confirmed cases in 12 countries other than China. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced a short while ago that three new cases of coronavirus infection have been confirmed in the US \u2013 one in Arizona and two in California \u2013 apparently all travellers returning from Wuhan. One wing of the specialist hospital in Wuhan has been constructed in just 16 hours, according to China\u2019s People\u2019s Daily. It will be handed over to the military next week. Update: A number of Twitter users have pointed out that the above image of a modular building can be seen elsewhere on the internet, for example here. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest developments: The number of deaths from coronavirus has risen to 81, with the number of confirmed infections climbing above 2,700 in China alone. The southern province of Hainan has reported its first fatality. About 95% of deaths and more than 50% of infections are in Hubei province. China\u2019s second most powerful man, Premier Li Keqiang, has become the most senior figure to visit Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak. He met medical staff, visited a supermarket, and the construction site of a new hospital. Wuhan\u2019s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, has admitted the authorities were too slow in how they released information about the virus. Appearing on state TV he said: \u201cWe were not sufficiently in time, and we did not make good use of many helpful information.\u201d About 73 people have been tested negative for the virus in the UK, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. Health experts say they would be surprised if the virus does not spread to the UK. The UK government is under pressure to evacuate Britons stranded in the city of Wuhan and the province of Hubei. The Foreign Office said it was \u201cworking to make available an option\u201d for British nationals to leave Hubei. Britons stranded in the Wuhan say the UK response has been \u201cpathetic\u201d. The lunar new year holiday in China has been extended until 2 February across China and to 9 February in Shanghai. Chongqing municipality \u2013 one of China\u2019s biggest \u2013 has banned inter-province bus travel for its nearly 30 million residents. Hong Kong has banned Hubei residents from entering. New coronavirus cases have been reported in Australia, South Korea and Canada. Cambodia has reported its first case. World Heath Organization chiefs have held meetings in Beijing on Monday. The WHO\u2019s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus last week urged China to ensure lockdown measures are kept \u201cshort in duration\u201d. The mayor of Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, has acknowledged criticism over his handling of the crisis, admitting that information was not released quickly enough. Zhou Xianwang wore a mask for protection as he told Chinese state broadcaster CCTV: \u201cWe haven\u2019t disclosed information in a timely manner and also did not use effective information to improve our work.\u201d He said he would resign if it helped with public opinion but pointed out the local government was obliged to seek permission before fully disclosing information about the virus, and that its response had since become \u201ctougher than others\u201d. The number of people tested for the virus in the UK has now reached 73, with all coming back been negative. The latest figures come in a 2pm update from the Department of Health and Social Care. Saudi Arabia\u2019s health ministry has put out some very rigorous hand-washing guidance, that includes using a paper towel to turn the tap off. Here\u2019s video of Wuhan\u2019s mayor admitting the city had been slow to provide information about the virus. A second case of the virus has been confirmed in Canada. Officials in Ontario said it had been diagnosed in the wife of a man who was already being treated in Toronto, CBS reports. The couple travelled back from Wuhan last week. Cambodia has confirmed the first case of coronavirus in the country, its health minister, Mam Bunheng, said on Monday, Reuters reports. The patient is a Chinese national in the coastal city of Sihanoukville, he said. More than a dozen countries have reported cases, although most are in China. AP has more on the Cambodia case. Mam told a press conference that the 60-year-old Chinese man had flown directly from Wuhan to Sihanoukville on 23 January. He displayed symptoms of the illness on Saturday. The Pasteur Institute in the capital, Phnom Penh, confirmed the infection from a blood sample. The man is undergoing treatment at a hospital in Sihanoukville. Sihanoukville is a popular destination for Chinese visitors. The man\u2019s three travelling companions from Wuhan were found not to have the virus. British citizens trapped in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, say the UK government\u2019s response has been slow and unclear, and its travel advice pathetic. Up to 300 British citizens are thought to be stuck in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located and where most of the 81 deaths associated with the disease have occurred. It is not clear whether the British government will conduct an evacuation, though the US and Japan are preparing airlifts. The French carmaker PSA Group has also said it will evacuate its employees. Kharn Lambert, 31, from Lancaster, who works as a PE teacher in Wuhan, described the city as a ghost town. All planes and trains have been cancelled and most private vehicles banned from the roads, as officials try to stop the spread of the virus. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest developments: The number of deaths from coronavirus has risen to 81, with the number of confirmed infections climbing above 2,700 in China alone.

The WHO\u2019s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus last week urged China to ensure lockdown measures are kept \u201cshort in duration\u201d. On his visit to Wuhan, China\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang, visited the site of a special new hospital being constructed to treat coronavirus patients. The hospital is due to be completed as soon as next week. Li delivered an upbeat message. He said: \u201cTo get the epidemic under control in Wuhan and the good health of people in Wuhan will be good news for the whole country. We wish the people of Wuhan a safe, healthy and long life. Let\u2019s go, Wuhan!\u201d The front page of the Evening Standard, edited by the former chancellor George Osborne, underlines the growing pressure facing the UK government to evacuate Britons stranded in Wuhan and Hubei. Footage has emerged of people clamouring for face masks at the gates of a factory in Jiujiang, in Jiangxi province, 230km (142 miles) south-east of Wuhan. Germany is also considering evacuating its citizens from Wuhan, AP reports. The foreign minister, Heiko Maas, told reporters that the German government\u2019s crisis response committee would meet shortly with medical experts to evaluate the situation. The foreign ministry currently advises Germans to refrain from or postpone \u201cnon-essential travel\u201d to China. Maas said the German embassy is in touch with its citizens in Wuhan, which a spokeswoman said number about 90 people. Mass said: \u201cWe are examining and preparing for all options.\u201d A consular team is expected to arrive in Wuhan later on Monday to provide Germans there with assistance. Here\u2019s our latest coronavirus explainer. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has committed $10m (\u00a37.6m) to tackling the virus. The money will be split between China and countries in Africa. One supermarket shopper was unfazed by the visit to Wuhan of China\u2019s prime minister Li Keqiang, Keith Zhai from Reuters reports. The death toll from the virus has risen to 81, after the southern island province of Hainan in the South China Sea reported its first fatality, an 80-year-old woman whose family arrived from Wuhan on 17 January, AP reports. Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, has accounted for 76 of the deaths reported so far. There have been one each in Shanghai and the provinces of Hebei in the north, Heilongjiang in the north-east and Henan in central China. The number of confirmed cases in China has reached 2,744. Officials in Shanghai, a city with a population of more 25 million people, have extended the lunar new year holiday to 9 February. It has ordered sports stadiums and religious events closed. Shanghai has gone further than the rest of China where the holiday was pushed back from Sunday to Thursday to reduce mass gatherings in an effort to block spread of the virus. Britain\u2019s embassy in Beijing has said it is \u201cworking to make available an option\u201d for British nationals to leave the Chinese province at the centre of the coronavirus as the UK\u2019s response was contrasted with that of other countries with active evacuation plans. The announcement on Monday came as the former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt backed the idea of airlifts for British citizens in China and Public Health England said the first case of the virus was likely to come from somebody already in the UK. \u201cOur view is that, although airports are important, the most likely place that we might find a case is somebody in the country already, and it\u2019s absolutely critical that the public health service and the NHS are ready to diagnose that and are able to designate the person to the right facilities,\u201d said Prof Yvonne Doyle, the medical director and director of health protection for PHE. Here\u2019s a map showing how the virus has spread across the world in terms of confirmed cases. In that appearance on Chinese TV, Wuhan\u2019s mayor, Zhou Xianwang, admitted the authorities were too slow in how they released information about the virus, AFP\u2019s Xinqi Su reports. Chinese officials at the centre of the crisis are coming under fire for incompetence and being ridiculed for not properly wearing protective masks, AFP reports. Many Chinese social media users were incensed by what they perceived as a series of errors at a televised press conference Sunday by three local officials at the heart of the new virus outbreak. Governor of central Hubei province, Wang Xiaodong, held the press conference without wearing a mask - in violation of the provincial capital Wuhan\u2019s own rules mandating masks in public spaces. Meanwhile the mayor of Wuhan was wearing his mask incorrectly by having it on inside out, pointed out Chinese users on Weibo, China\u2019s Twitter-like social media platform. \u201cIf the mayor doesn\u2019t even know how to wear a mask, how will everyday people know?\u201d criticised one user. \u201cIncompetent and irresponsible politicians,\u201d wrote another in a scathing comment about the press briefing. The comments are a rare instance of public anger outpacing the army of online censors in China, where criticism of government figures is usually scrubbed. By Monday afternoon, a hashtag on the press briefing had more than 680 million views on Weibo. Online users also focused in on Wang\u2019s repeated fumble of Hubei\u2019s annual mask production \u2013 giving three revisions to his answer from 10.8 billion to 1.8 billion, to 1.08 million. \u201cAs the governor of Hubei province, how can you not know how many masks Hubei province produces?\u201d asked one incredulous user. Britons stranded in Wuhan and other Chinese cities are frustrated by the UK government\u2019s response. They have been speaking to Michael Standaert, a Guardian stringer in Beijing. Matthew Heard, a 31-year-old education consultant from London, has been living in Wuhan on and off for more than five years. Confusion would be the word to describe what\u2019s going on. There\u2019s a lot of information flying around. There\u2019s posts flying around group chats and no one really knows what\u2019s going on. That\u2019s the main frustration. I\u2019ve been holed up for the last maybe three days. On the first day I started out to the supermarket and got a good few things to keep me tied over for the foreseeable eight or nine days, but I\u2019m going to consider perhaps going out again. I know a few others who are venturing out most days just to go to the shops or to the supermarket to see if they can restock on supplies and things. Asked he was in touch with the UK embassy, Heard said: They don\u2019t really seem to be doing too much, you send an email and whether you get a response or not is entirely a guess. The Foreign Office is what people are relying on for information. It is staying relatively quiet, with very tentative statements, thinking about potential action, things like that and it\u2019s not really helping anyone. I think what people want to hear is whether there is a plan, and what the situation for us is, and what we should be doing, because so far their advice has just been to get out of the city which is impossible, because the cities are locked down. Asked what he\u2019s doing to pass the time, Heard said: This year I pledged to myself at the beginning of 2020 I was gonna read 50 books this year, and I\u2019m making a good bit of progress on that. Kharn Lambert, 31, from Lancaster, Lancashire, is working in Wuhan as a PE teacher for an international school. We are still being advised to stay in the house as it\u2019s the safest place and only go out when absolutely necessary. My biggest worry is my grandmother who suffers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This city is pretty much a ghost town apart from the odd person walking the streets to get necessities, some cars are out and about. We have enough supplies for now probably enough food for the next two weeks, I\u2019ve got enough masks for the amount of time I think I\u2019ll be outside, I\u2019m trying to go out as little as possible, with my grandmother\u2019s condition I don\u2019t want to jeopardise her health. The response from the UK government has been an absolute joke. They were helpful at the beginning, they put us in touch with a doctor for more medication for my grandmother, but since then they have been quiet, we have not even had a hello from any of the British consulate staff in Wuhan. I presume they have been evacuated in secret because they seem to have left Wuhan, the advice from the embassy is to keep checking the travel advisory website for updates. The update is absolutely pathetic \u2013 \u201cget out if you can\u201d \u2013 how can we? We are on lockdown. The FCO have been absolutely shocking in their response. The school are desperately trying to help with the situation as they fear for my grandmother\u2019s health if she was to contract this virus. The head of the World Health Organization will hold a special meeting with officials in Beijing on Monday to discuss how to contain the coronavirus that has killed 80 people and left more than 400 in a critical condition. In an effort to reduce chances of infection during what is China\u2019s busiest travel season, officials announced the end of this week\u2019s lunar new year holiday would be postponed until at least 2 February. Authorities have also widened sweeping restrictions on travel across the country. On Monday, Chongqing municipality, which has a population of 30 million, said it had banned long-distance bus services. The municipality borders Hubei province, where the vast majority of deaths have been recorded. It follows similar announcements over the weekend by Beijing, Shanghai and the eastern province of Shandong. The suspension of long-distance bus services, the cheapest way to travel, is likely to slow down the return of millions of migrant workers who have visited their families over the lunar new year. By postponing the end of the holiday to Sunday from Friday, officials hoped to \u201ceffectively reduce mass gatherings\u201d and \u201cblock the spread of the epidemic\u201d, a cabinet statement said. Many of China\u2019s big retail chains have also said they will temporarily close their stores, while some online businesses and banks have advised employees returning from Hubei province to work from home. Spain\u2019s foreign minister, Arancha Gonzalez, has said Spanish officials are trying to repatriate 20 Spaniards stranded in Wuhan and Hubei. A pair of British teachers who have been working in Wuhan say they have not left their apartment for five days, that all transport has been stopped and \u201cthere is no place to go\u201d and \u201cso we are pretty much stuck\u201d, PA Media reports. Jason Neal and Sophie Hunt told BBC Breakfast there has been no reassurance from the British authorities whom they have \u201cstruggled\u201d to contact, possibly because of the time difference and them being closed over the weekend. They have about five days of food left and are keeping in touch with colleagues online while the scene outside is now like a \u201cghost town\u201d. Neal said: \u201cEven if the news is just to sit tight and nothing is going to change - I think it is just the silence that is disconcerting. We have not heard anything from outside of Wuhan for a week now.\u201d He said there is a support group for people who may need help and to get masks and some volunteers are going out to make deliveries. Hunt said emailing and trying to ring the authorities has brought a \u201cuseless automated response back from the embassy saying not to go\u201d to the area. She feels the Chinese authorities have made the right decision by shutting down the city, adding: \u201cAll we keep hearing is that the death toll is accelerating every day. All we can do really is sit tight and wait for more news. \u201cAlthough it is hard us being stuck here, we know that it is the safest possible option for us at the moment.\u201d Meanwhile, health officials are continuing to track down around 2,000 people who have recently flown into the UK from Wuhan, the area of China worst affected by the outbreak. The DoH confirmed it is trying to find \u201cas many passengers as we can\u201d who arrived from the region in the past two weeks to check on their wellbeing. It is understood Border Force officers have been recruited to help speed up the search for passengers as testing for the virus continues in the UK. One British man, who had travelled to Wuhan to visit his girlfriend, is stuck in the city after his return flight on 3 February was cancelled, and he described trying to get out of the area as \u201cimpossible\u201d. The 29-year-old, who did not want to be named, told the PA news agency: \u201cThere is no news on when the airport will reopen therefore the airline (China Southern) have just cancelled the flight. \u201cI\u2019ve also had no help from the UK Embassy in Beijing who are conveniently closed for the weekend.\u201d The Foreign Office has confirmed it is working on making an \u201coption available\u201d for British nationals to leave Wuhan in Hubei province in China. British citizens in the region have been told to call the FCO on +86 (0) 10 8529 6600 or (+44) (0)207 008 1500 should they need assistance. A spokeswoman said: \u201cWe continue to monitor developments closely and are in close touch with the Chinese authorities. The safety and security of British nationals is always our primary concern.\u201d The Australian government does not know how many of its citizens are caught in the vast quarantine lockdown imposed across China, as it and governments around the world scramble to try to evacuate their nationals. But it appears increasingly unlikely foreign countries will be allowed to simply extricate their citizens in the face of militarily enforced lockdowns. Indonesia has said it \u201cseems to be impossible\u201d, while Australia has said it \u201cneeds to abide by the travel restrictions \u2026 placed there for precisely the purpose of containing the coronavirus\u201d. A hotline for family members of Australian citizens has received 385 calls, but the foreign minister, Marise Payne, has said it was \u201cunwise to speculate\u201d on how many citizens this represented or how quickly they could be brought out. The former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt has joined calls for the UK to organise airlifts for UK citizens in China and warned of the pressure the coronavirus could put on the NHS. Asked if he supported flying Britons back from Wuhan and elsewhere, he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI think I would be very sympathetic and I\u2019m sure the Foreign Office would be too.\u201d He said the NHS is well-equipped to deal with patients returning with the virus but warned that it could strain the service. \u201cThis is a very difficult time of year for the NHS \u2013 it is the most difficult time. But, again, my experience is that the NHS does know how to cope with these kinds of emergencies. \u201cI think the thing that will be difficult is the knock-on impact on other NHS services. \u201cI think it would be very, very challenging for the NHS in terms of the regular workload but I have absolutely no doubt that, when it comes to doing what comes to necessary to isolate the virus and keep the public safe, our doctors and nurses will do exactly what they need to do.\u201d On the global markets, oil prices and shares are selling off as the death toll from the coronavirus rises and more cases are confirmed around the world. In London, the FTSE 100 index lost more than 110 points in early trading, falling 1.5% to 7472.877. Stock markets in Germany and France were also down 1.5% while France\u2019s CAC index slid 1.7%. Chinese and other Asian markets were closed for the lunar new year holiday but Japan\u2019s Nikkei lost 2%, its biggest one-day fall in five months. Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, tumbled $1.3 to $59.39, a 2.2% fall. China is the world\u2019s biggest oil importer and if its economic slowdown deepens as the virus spreads, it will need less oil. The virus outbreak has sparked a flight to safe-haven investments: investors are buying the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc , gold and US Treasury bonds. More than 50 people have now been tested for coronavirus in the UK, according to the Department of Health and Social Care, although all tests have returned negative, PA reports. As of Sunday afternoon, some 52 people across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have been tested for the deadly flu-like virus. The current risk to the public remains low, the department said, adding that the government is continuing to monitor the situation closely. England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said there was a \u201cfair chance\u201d cases would emerge in Britain as the overall number reported around the world climbed to about 2,744 including 80 deaths, which have all occurred in China. Britons trapped in the Chinese province at the centre of the outbreak have been urged to leave the area if they are able to do so. The Foreign Office updated its guidance to \u201cadvise against all travel to Hubei province\u201d, which has been on lockdown for several days as China seeks to contain the illness. But the guidance also added: \u201cIf you are in this area and able to leave, you should do so. This is due to the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak.\u201d Prof Whitty said following a meeting of the government\u2019s Cobra emergency committee in Whitehall on Friday that the virus looked \u201ca lot less dangerous\u201d than contracting Ebola, the recent coronavirus, Mers and \u201cprobably less dangerous\u201d than Sars virus. But he added: \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is how far it\u2019s going to spread, that really is something we need to plan for all eventualities. We all agree that the risk to the UK public remains low, but there may well be cases in the UK at some stage.\u201d \u201cWe think there\u2019s a fair chance we may get some cases over time. Of course this depends on whether this continues for a long time, or whether this turns out to be something which is brought under control relatively quickly.\u201d The UK government is coming under pressure to evacuate UK citizens from Wuhan and the surrounding province of Hubei. Both the home secretary, Priti Patel, and the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, have said ministers are considering an evacuation plan, but both stopped short of committing to one. The response of other countries has added weight to calls for the UK to order a full evacuation plan. AP has a roundup of what countries are doing for their citizens. Japan Its chief government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said 560 Japanese citizens are confirmed in Hubei and chartered evacuation flights are being prepared to leave as soon as possible. The Japanese embassy in Beijing said the initial evacuation is limited to those in Wuhan. Evacuees are expected to include employees of Honda, Electron, Aeon other Japanese companies operating in Wuhan. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said his cabinet will designate the new coronavirus as an infectious disease subject to forced hospitalisation and isolation. Such preventative measures appear to be preparation for the evacuation. United States The US consulate in Wuhan plans a charter flight on Tuesday to evacuate its personnel and some other Americans. The US embassy in Beijing said the limited capacity on the flight to San Francisco meant priority will be given to to individuals at greater risk from coronavirus. France The health minister, Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, said French citizens who want to leave Wuhan will be taken on a direct flight to France in the middle of the week, and then held in quarantine for 14 days. French carmakers PSA, which produces Peugeot and Citroen cars, said it was evacuating its expatriate employees and their families from Wuhan and quarantining them in another city. The number of deaths from coronavirus has risen to 80, with infections climbing above 2,700. Hainan province confirmed its first death. 95% of deaths and more than 50% of infections are in Hubei province. China\u2019s second most powerful man, Premier Li Keqiang, has met medical staff and visited a supermarket in Wuhan. The lunar new year holiday in China has been extended until 2 February. Chongqing municipality \u2013 one of China\u2019s biggest \u2013 has banned inter-province bus travel for its nearly 30 million residents. New coronavirus cases have been reported in Australia and South Korea. World Heath Organization chief will hold meetings in Beijing on Monday. Hong Kong has banned Hubei residents from entering. The Associated Press has just published a useful list of the latest figures on coronavirus infections. It says these are up-to-date as of midday on Monday in Beijing: China: 2,744, with 769 of those newly confirmed in the 24 hours through midnight Sunday. Five are in Hong Kong and two in Macao. Nearly all of the 80 deaths have been in Hubei province, with four elsewhere in China. United States: 5, 2 in southern California and 1 each in Washington state, Chicago, and Arizona. Thailand: 8 Australia: 5 South Korea: 4 Japan: 4 Singapore: 4 Malaysia: 4 France: 3 Taiwan: 3 Vietnam: 2 Canada: 1 Nepal: 1 As I mentioned earlier, China\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang, has been visiting Wuhan. There\u2019s been plenty of video clips on social media of him meeting medical staff. He also visited a store where he had his temperature scanned upon entry. Singapore said on Monday that the coronavirus outbreak will hurt its economy this year. So far it has reported four cases of the virus. \u201cWe certainly expect there to be an impact on our economy, business and consumer confidence this year especially as the situation is expected to persist for some time,\u201d its trade minister, Chan Chun Sing, said. Singapore is currently forecasting growth in a wide range of 0.5-2.5% this year. The country has announced a raft of new measures on Monday to halt the spread of the virus, including urging all school students and staff with a recent travel history to China to stay at home for a fortnight. The head of the World Health Organization will hold a special meeting with officials in Beijing on Monday to discuss how to contain the coronavirus. The WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Twitter: \u201cMy WHO colleagues and I would like to understand the latest developments and strengthen our partnership with China in providing further protection against the outbreak.\u201d You can find our latest update on the virus outbreak below. As I reported earlier, the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, has travelled to Wuhan, the centre of the virus outbreak. Li is China\u2019s second most powerful man. According to the government outlet, the Global Times, he told medical staff at Wuhan hospital: \u201cI am here to cheer you up.\u201d The Chinese state broadcaster CCTV has said that Hainan province confirmed on Monday that an 80-year-old woman has died after being infected with the coronavirus, marking the province\u2019s first fatality in the rapidly spreading outbreak. China\u2019s state media is reporting that of the more than 2,700 people infected with coronavirus, 461 are in a critical condition. Eighty people are known to have died in China from the virus. China\u2019s CGTN state TV channel has launched a live feed of the construction of the 1,000-bed hospital in Wuhan. You can see it here. The BBC\u2019s China correspondent, Stephen McDonell, is reporting that China\u2019s massive film studio, Hengdian studios, has suspended filming because of the virus. The studio\u2019s website says it is the biggest film and TV shooting base in the world. More on the Australian cases of the virus, and the University of New South Wales, which is in Sydney, has confirmed that one of its students has tested positive for the virus. I am assuming that this is the 21-year-old woman referred to by the health authorities at a press conference in the past hour. The university says the student arrived back in Sydney on 22 January and was not infectious on the flight. \u201cThe student did not attend any classes at the University and stayed on her own in campus accommodation with no close contact before she was admitted to hospital,\u201d the university said. So after that flurry of news conferences, I\u2019ll just double back on one of the key points from Australian authorities. That is, they don\u2019t believe there have been any human-to-human transmission of the virus in the country. This is significant for a number of reasons, but particularly as the country\u2019s schools are due to return this week from the long summer break. Medical advice is if children have been in close contact with a CONFIRMED case of the virus, they should not attend school for 14 days. The New South Wales department of education describes close contact as \u201cliving in the same household, 15 minutes face-to-face contact with a person with confirmed coronavirus in any setting, or sharing a closed space with a person with confirmed coronavirus for more than 2 hours\u201d. Payne has also asked anyone who is still in affected Chinese provinces to get in touch with her department. She says the contact line has already had 385 calls. She has given out the two numbers again: ph 1300 555 135 from inside Australia or +61 2 6261 3305 from outside the country. Payne has advised Australians in China not to attend public gatherings: \u201cPeople will be safer if they continue to follow the advice that has been given by health authorities, both in Australia and in China. That does mean avoiding major gatherings, staying away from crowded areas, as much as possible, and following strict hygiene precautions,\u201d Payne says. Now we are hearing from Australia\u2019 s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne. She says where possible, her government is looking to assist Australians who want to leave Hubei province. A number of countries have been looking at how to get their citizens out of affected Chinese provinces which are affected by coronavirus, particularly Hubei. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, says the majority of people who have been tested in Australia have tested negative for coronavirus. He says there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the virus in Australia. Every flight from China is now being met by border security officers, who are giving out information about the virus and are also working to identify potentially infected passengers. Four adults in Western Australia are also being tested to see if they have contracted the deadly coronavirus. The WA Department of Health would not confirm any further details about the patients on Monday but said they each met specific travel criteria. There have been no confirmed cases in WA with three people returning negative test results. In New South Wales, a 21-year-old woman has been confirmed to have the coronavirus. She is bring treated at Sydney\u2019s Westmead hospital. It brings the number of cases in Australia to five. There has been concern in Australia over schools returning this week after the summer break. Kerry Chant, the chief health officer for the state of New South Wales, has just given a news conference in which she advised that if children have had contact with people confirmed to have the coronavirus, they should not attend school: The national approach to this issue is that our advice is that people that have come back from \u2013 children that have come back from the Hubei province \u2013 we have broadened it slightly from Wuhan with the emerging evidence of transmission from adjacent areas of Wuhan, the city, to the Hubei province more broadly. We are recommending that, if you have symptoms, that you should get immediately checked if you\u2019ve come back from that area. And also, if you\u2019ve been in contact with any confirmed case, that you should not attend school \u2013 close contact with a confirmed case of novel coronavirus \u2013 you shouldn\u2019t attend school for the 14 days. Otherwise, we\u2019re just suggesting that people monitor their symptoms. That\u2019s the advice we\u2019ve seen with schools. We\u2019ve just had a national hook-up and there\u2019s been agreement that that is the approach nationally. Several Sydney private schools have gone further, banning students who have recently visited China from returning to school without medical certificates, as concerns grow about the spread of coronavirus. Pymble Ladies College in Sydney\u2019s north has told parents that if their child has recently visited an affected area in China or has been in contact with someone who has visited an affected area, they should not attend school for at least 14 days after their return to Australia or 14 days after the contact with someone who has visited an affected area. Students in that situation would require a medical certificate before returning to school. Other private schools in Sydney, including Scots College, Ravenswood School for Girls, Kambala School and Newington College, have told parents that students who have visited affected regions in China must provide medical clearance from a doctor, the ABC reported. A spokesperson for the NSW Education department said the department will be providing updated health advice to schools today but it was not advising that students should be kept at home, and would provide updated health advice later on Monday. Most public school students in New South Wales are due to return to classes from Wednesday. Death toll in China rises to 80, with infections climbing above 2,700. 95% of deaths and more than 50% of infections are in Hubei province. China\u2019s second most powerful man, Premier Li Keqiang, arrives in Wuhan. China extends lunar new year holiday until 2 February. Chongqing municipality \u2013 one of China\u2019s biggest \u2013 bans inter-province bus travel for its nearly 30m residents. Chongqing borders Hubei province. World Heath Organization chief flies to Beijing. Hong Kong bans Hubei residents from entering. The Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, has arrived in Wuhan. Pictures show him carrying out inspections of what look like medical facilities in the city. Li is the head of the government\u2019s coronavirus taskforce and the second most powerful man in China, after President Xi Jinping. Chongqing municipality, which borders the province of Hubei, where the coronavirus outbreak began, has banned bus travel between provinces from midday on Monday. The municipality has a population of around 30m people, making it one of the biggest in China. Chongqing city has a population of about 9 million. In the UK 50 people have been tested for the virus and all have returned negative. The current risk to the public is described as low, but England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said there was a \u201cfair chance\u201d cases would emerge in Britain. The UK\u2019s home secretary, Priti Patel, has said the government is \u201clooking at all options\u201d to help Britons leave Wuhan following reports that officials have been asked to examine the logistics for an airlift from the city. You can read our full coverage here: An Irish teacher living in Wuhan, Ben Kavanagh, has made a video for Britain\u2019s Channel 4 news, about his daily life in the locked-down city. You can see it below via YouTube, including all the precautions taken to leave the house. There are reports that a fourth person has been diagnosed with coronavirus in South Korea. Just on those figures, the government tabloid, the Global Times has recently tweeted figures of cases in provinces across China. The next most infections outside of Hubei (1,423 cases) is in Guangdong, which has 146 cases. Henan and Zhejiang provinces each have 128 cases. Given the spread of the virus across China and to at least 10 other countries, I thought it\u2019s worth mentioning that all but four deaths so far have been recorded in Hubei province, where the outbreak started. Of the 80 fatalities reported by the National Health Commission, 76 are were in Hubei (that\u2019s 95% of fatalities). The total number of cases reported in Hubei is 1,423, according to government figures. This makes up 51.5% of the 2,761 cases reported so far by the commission across China, Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan. Several of the UK\u2019s newspaper front pages carry stories of the coronavirus spread, including pleas from Britons stranded in Wuhan. In Australia, where five cases of the virus have been confirmed, there\u2019s also wide coverage on Monday morning\u2019s newspapers. Melbourne\u2019s Age newspaper says more cases are expected. The Australian newspaper reports on Australian children being trapped in Wuhan. Social media is reporting discontent about the handling of the response to the virus in Hubei province, including the governor of the province apparently stumbling over the number of face masks produced there. Keeping track of the numbers in this coronavirus story is challenging, with things changing all the time. But one figure that caught my attention from the National Health Commission this morning, was the number of people currently under medical observation for the virus. It stands at 30,453. It\u2019s not clear from the statement where or how these people are being observed, but we do know that there\u2019s a huge construction effort going on in Wuhan to build a 1,000-bed hospital for the virus patients. You can read our full story on this 10-day build here, but it\u2019s fair to say the pictures of the construction are pretty incredible. The Chinese city of Wuhan is suspending customs services for four days until Thursday, according to the government-run Global Times. I assume that this is linked to the transport shutdown in the city. I\u2019ll bring you more information on this when it comes to hand. Japan is to send a chartered plane to Wuhan, possibly on Tuesday, to bring back Japanese citizens who wish to return home, Kyodo news agency said, citing a foreign ministry source. The government has so far been able to contact about 430 Japanese citizens living or staying in Hubei province, almost all of them in Wuhan, the foreign minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, said on Sunday. The prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said: \u201cAs soon as adjustments with the Chinese government are done, I will pursue all means, including a charter plane, to realise the return of all applicants\u201d from Wuhan and elsewhere in Hubei province. Japan\u2019s health ministry on Sunday confirmed the country\u2019s fourth case of coronavirus. The patient is a man in his 40s who arrived in Japan on Wednesday as a tourist from Wuhan, the ministry said, adding he was in a stable condition. He reportedly showed no symptoms on arrival in Japan but later developed a fever and sought medical help in Aichi prefecture, central Japan. Honda, meanwhile, said it was arranging for 30 employees, including Japanese nationals and their families, to be flown out of Wuhan on a government-chartered flight, according to the Nikkei business newspaper. The carmaker said a small number of staff would stay on in the Chinese city, where it has three factories. Hong Kong has stepped up efforts to stop the virus\u2019s entry. As of Monday, residents of Hubei will be banned from entering. Anyone who has visited Hubei province in the past 14 days, will also be banned from entry. The rule does not apply to Hong Kong residents. Hong Kong has six confirmed cases of the virus. With millions of people now subject to travel restrictions in China, as the country shut down transport networks in a bid to stop the spread of the virus, some countries are preparing to help their citizens leave affected areas. Japan\u2019s foreign minister has confirmed that there are 430 Japanese citizens in Hubei province, mostly in Wuhan. Toshimitsu Motegi told reporters that he had spoken to his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, and that Wang understood Tokyo\u2019s desire to repatriate its nationals as soon as possible. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, had said earlier that his government was working with Chinese authorities to make arrangements for all Japanese nationals wishing to return from Wuhan, including with charter flights, but no schedule has been set. The Australian government is also working to repatriate its citizens trapped in Wuhan, including about 100 schoolchildren who are stranded there. \u201cWe are working to make sure that there is support for those Australians and we are also working on, as are other countries, trying to secure their ability to return to Australia. At this point in time, the foreign minister is working around the clock on that,\u201d said Australia\u2019s health minister, Greg Hunt. There have been five confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia as of Monday 27 January. Australians who believe they have family in the affected areas can contact this emergency telephone number + 61 2 6261 3305, for assistance. You can read Guardian Australia\u2019s latest piece on the country\u2019s response to coronavirus here: If you or your family are concerned about the spread of the coronavirus, this has been one of the Guardian\u2019s best read pieces on the illness, including the virus\u2019s symptoms, information about transmission, where it\u2019s been identified globally and what experts are saying about the virus. Some more information now on the update from China\u2019s National Health Commission with regards to the number of deaths and infections from coronavirus. On Sunday 26 January 769 new cases were reported across 30 different areas of China. As of midnight on Sunday into Monday, of the more than 2,700 cases reported (including in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao), the commission said 30 were severe. There are nearly 6,000 suspected cases and 51 cured cases China\u2019s state media, CGTN (formerly CCTV), is reporting that the lunar new year holiday has been extended by three days until 2 February. All universities, schools and kindergartens will postpone the start of their spring term until further notice, it says. Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the outbreak of the coronavirus. I\u2019m Alison Rourke and I will be keeping you up to date on developments as they unfold. The first order of business to report is that the death toll in China has risen to 80, according to the National Health Commission (NHC). This is up from 56 yesterday. The NHC also says there are more than 2,700 infections reported (note that the commission has included Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan in this number). The news comes as the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, flies to Beijing to discuss the outbreak with authorities. \u201cI am on my way to Beijing, to meet with the government and health experts supporting the \u001dcoronavirus response,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cMy WHO colleagues and I would like to understand the latest developments and strengthen our partnership with China in providing further protection against the outbreak.\u201d You can get up to speed on the story with our latest piece from the Guardian, including fears that up to 100,000 people may be infected.",
