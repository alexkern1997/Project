But who are the losers and winners from a dramatic few days for Republicans and Democrats? <br></p> \n  <h2>5/5: Donald Trump </h2> \n  <p>A swaggering and aggressive US president called his speech at the White House on Thursday a \u201ccelebration\u201d \u2013 and well he might. He was coming to the end of a week in which he had spent 80 minutes making the case for his re-election on primetime TV in his State of the Union speech and had been acquitted in his impeachment trial \u2013 with only one Republican breaking ranks to vote against him. A <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/284156/trump-job-approval-personal-best.aspx\">Gallup poll</a> put the president\u2019s approval rating at 49%, the highest level for that survey since 2017, and on top of that the Democratic primary race got off to a disastrously shambolic start in Iowa. Holding up a newspaper front page that said \u201cTrump acquitted\u201d, the president told his White House crowd: \u201cLet me take that home; maybe we\u2019ll frame it. It\u2019s the only good headline I\u2019ve ever had in the Washington Post.\u201d His speech sounded like a preview of the one he plans to make on 4 November after winning the election. <br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"74571569-c2d1-4979-bfbb-a6316bacc50a\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r6VFYRPP3SA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <h2>4/5: Pete Buttigieg</h2> \n  <p>If anyone managed to wring any momentum out of the mess in Iowa, it was the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who more or less declared victory before the results were in and went on to grab as much of the spotlight as possible. Did he even win? With almost 100% of the vote in, Buttigieg is only 0.09% ahead of socialist rival Bernie Sanders in the delegate count, and Sanders is ahead of the young pretender in the popular vote.

She has succeeded on the first two points, but the latter is very much up for debate.

      "bodyText": "An updated evening summary of today\u2019s key political news as we close this blog for tonight. But as one blog closes, another opens: You can follow the Democratic presidential debate live blog for continued live updates. Two key witnesses in Trump\u2019s impeachment trial were fired by the White House: Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and European Union ambassaor Gordon Sondland. Vindman\u2019s lawyer issued a statement saying that he was escorted out of the White House. He \u201cwas asked to leave for telling the truth,\u201d his lawyer said. Vindman\u2019s twin brother, a lawyer for the National Security Council, was also fired. Pundits dubbed the firings a \u201cFriday Night Massacre,\u201d in reference to the Richard Nixon\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d in 1973. Democrats condemned the firings; Republican lawmakers said \u201cgood riddance.\u201d Meanwhile, Bill Taylor, another witness in the impeachment trial, went on CNN to defend Marie Yovanovitch, former ambassador to Ukraine, who was subject to a smear campaign that led to her own firing. \u201cIt of course bothers me any time I see someone like Masha Yovanovitch or Alex Vindman unfairly attacked,\u201d Taylor said. Trump spoke at an event in North Carolina this afternoon where he mocked Democrats for messing up the Iowa caucus and said that he would continue to hold rallies even if he wins the 2020 election. As Democratic presidential candidates prepared for another televised debate, the feud between Iowa front-runners Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg started to gear up today. Sanders slammed Buttigeg for having \u201cthe most exclusive billionaire donors of any Democrat.\u201d #PetesBillionaires was trending on Twitter this afternoon. Saturday Night Massacre Prompted Angry Telegrams Some more historical comparisons: 1973 was a different time. Do you remember what it was like when all major breaking news did not happen simultaneously? How good is the Saturday Night Massacre comparison? Curious how well the White House\u2019s actions tonight compare to Nixon\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Massacre\u201d in 1973? You can look back at what Nixon did via: NPR\u2019s Brief History of the \u2018Saturday Night Massacre\u2019 The Saturday Night Massacre episode of the hit Watergate podcast Slow Burn The original Sunday morning report on the massacre in the Washington Post On a Saturday evening in October 1973, in the midst of the scandal that would lead to his resignation, President Richard Nixon demanded that his attorney general fire the special counsel assigned to investigate Watergate. Nixon\u2019s attorney general and deputy attorney general refused, and resigned. Then solicitor general Robert Bork became the acting attorney general, and he did what Nixon wanted: he fired special counsel Archibald Cox, who had refused to go along with the White House\u2019s plan to turn over only summarized material from the White House Watergate tapes to Cox\u2019s investigation. The forced resignation and firing became known as Nixon\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Massacre.\u201d Political pundits are already calling this Friday evening in Washington Trump\u2019s \u201cFriday Night Massacre,\u201d with two of the witnesses who testified in the impeachment inquiry against Trump already fired by 7 p.m. in the evening. Other commentators, like Rachel Maddow, are arguing that it\u2019s not quite an accurate comparison. Full statement from Second Fired Impeachment Witness The White House has moved to fire another person who testified in the House impeachment inquiry against President Trump: Gordon Sondland, who also testified about the president\u2019s efforts to pressure top Ukranian officials to investigate his political rivals, the New York Times reports. \u201cI was advised today that the president intends to recall me effective immediately as United States Ambassador to the European Union,\u201d Sondland said in a statement just hours after the White House fired a top National Security expert on Ukraine, Lt Col Alexander Vindman, who had also testified, the Times reported. Sondland expressed gratitude in the statement to Mr. Trump \u201cfor having given me the opportunity to serve.\u201d In November, Sondland delivered what had been characterized as \u201cbombshell\u201d public testimony against Trump, saying, \u201cWas there a \u2018quid pro quo [with Ukraine]?\u2019 As I testified previously, with regard to the requested White House call and White House meeting, the answer is yes.\u201d Just a reminder: there are 269 days until the 2020 presidential election! Tonight, the Democratic presidential primary continues with a televised debate. My colleague Joan Greave has more details on our debate night live blog. In a week marked by impunity and vengeance in Washington, my colleague Ed Pilkington has a story on a black radical who has finally won his freedom. The release of the final incarcerated member of the Move 9 comes more than three decades after Philadelphia police dropped an incendiary bomb on a row house where black activists lived, resulting in the deaths of eleven people, including five children, and a fire that razed dozens of homes in a predominantly black neighborhood. One of the great open wounds of the black liberation struggle of the 1970s has finally been healed with the release of the last member of the Move 9, the group of radicals rounded up in a Philadelphia police siege in 1978 and held behind bars for more than four decades. Chuck Sims Africa, 59, walked free from the Fayette state correctional institution in La Belle, Pennsylvania, on Friday morning. The youngest of the incarcerated group, he has been in custody since shortly after he turned 18. His freedom marked his reunion with his family for the first time in almost 42 years. Schumer Responds to White House firing Vindman \u201cThis action is not a sign of strength,\u201d senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. Presenting this statement without comment, since the emoji I need is not available on this liveblog. White House Fires Twin Brother of Impeachment Witness The twin brother of Lt Col Alexander Vindman, a national security expert who testified during Trump\u2019s impeachment trial about his concerns about the president pressuring Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, his political rivals, was also fired by the White House today, multiple news outlets reported. Vindman\u2019s twin brother, Lieutenant Colonel Yevgeny Vindman, was a lawyer at the National Security Council. The New York Times reported that President Donald Trump spoke publicly yesterday, at a prayer breakfast, about his antipathy toward \u201cLieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother.\u201d Early GOP responses on Vindman\u2019s firing Lois Beckett here in our West Coast office, taking over our live politics coverage at the end of a week that has been quite uneventful, really, just an impeachment vote and some lively discussions about democracy in Iowa. (Remember last Friday, when the UK left the European Union?) Politico\u2019s Kyle Cheney has some early reactions from GOP lawmakers to the White House\u2019s choice to fire one of the key witnesses in Trump\u2019s impeachment trial today. In two words: \u201cGood riddance.\u201d Here\u2019s what has happened this afternoon: Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, one of the key witnesses in the impeachment trial, was fired from his post on the national security counsel. His lawyer issued a statement saying that he was escorted out of the White House today. He \u201cwas asked to leave for telling the truth,\u201d his lawyer said. Meanwhile, Bill Taylor, another witness in the impeachment trial, went on CNN to defend Marie Yovanovitch, former ambassador to Ukraine, who was subject to a smear campaign that led to her own firing. \u201cIt of course bothers me any time I see someone like Masha Yovanovitch or Alex Vindman unfairly attacked,\u201d Taylor said. Trump spoke at an event in North Carolina this afternoon where he mocked Democrats for messing up the Iowa caucus and said that he would continue to hold rallies even if he wins the 2020 election. The feud between Iowa front-runners Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg started to gear up today. Sanders slammed Buttigeg for having \u201cthe most exclusive billionaire donors of any Democrat.\u201d #PetesBillionaires was trending on Twitter this afternoon. Congressional Democrats are on Twitter expressing their shock at the news that Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman was fired from his post on the national security counsel. Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an adviser on the national security counsel who testified in the impeachment trial, was fired from his post. \u201cToday, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman was escorted out of the White House where he has dutifully served his country and his President,\u201d said his attorney, David Pressman in a statement. \u201cLTC Vindman was asked to leave for telling the truth.\u201d The news comes just hours after Donald Trump told reporters that he is \u201cnot happy with him\u201d and made vague comments saying \u201cthey\u2019ll make that decision\u201d about whether he would be keeping his job. Later, Trump retweeted posts on Twitter that called on him to fire Vindman. Vindman was considered the top expert on Ukraine on the national security counsel. During his testimony in Congress, Vindman expressed concerns about a call Trump had with the president of Ukraine where he demanded an investigation into Joe Biden. \u201cIt was improper for the president of the United States to demand a foreign government investigation of a US citizen and a political opponent,\u201d Vindman said during the testimony in November. Vindman is largely respected as a veteran who came to the United States when he was three after his family fled Ukraine. He served multiple tours overseas and was wounded by a roadside bomb during a combat deployment in Iraq, earning him a Purple Heart. He went on to earn a master\u2019s degree in Russian from Harvard and served at US embassies in Kyiv and Moscow. During his testimony, Vindman outlined why he felt comfortable coming forward with the information he had through a message to his father. \u201cDad, my sitting here today, in the US Capitol talking to our elected officials is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union and come here to the United States of America in search of a better life for our family,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not worry. I will be fine for telling the truth.\u201d Bill Taylor: Smears against Marie Yovanovitch \u2018unconscionable\u2019 Bill Taylor, a former acting ambassador to Ukraine who testified in the impeachment trial, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper in an interview that the smear campaign against Marie Yavonovitch, former US ambassador to Ukraine who also testified in the impeachment trial is \u201cunconscionable\u201d. Yovanovitch was removed from her post after attacks from Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, went on a smear campaign with the goal of removing her from office so the investigation into Hunter Biden could continue. While Tapper did not reference Donald Trump specifically in his question, the president lashed out against Yovanovitch on Twitter in November, seemingly as backlash against her testifying in front of Congress. \u201cEverywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,\u201d he wrote. Defending Yovanovitch, Taylor said he believes the former ambassador\u2019s credibility. \u201cIt of course bothers me any time I see someone like Masha Yovanovitch or Alex Vindman unfairly attacked,\u201d Taylor said, referring to Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an adviser on the national security counsel who testified in the impeachment trial. If you see your local influencer gushing about former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg on Instagram anytime soon, here\u2019s why: Bloomberg is turning to social media influencers to help him gain traction in the 2020 election, according to the Daily Beast. The Bloomberg campaign is using Tribe, a platform that connects influencers with brands for advertising purposes. Bloomberg\u2019s campaign is specifically targeting \u201cmicro-influencers\u201d \u2013 users who have between 1,000 and 1,000 \u2013 for $150 posts on why they support the mayor. The campaign\u2019s posting on Tribe asks influencers to \u201cShow+Tell why Mike the candidate who can change our country for the better, state why YOU think he\u2019s a great candidate\u201d. Trump just ridiculed Democrats during a speech he delivered in North Carolina, saying, \u201cThey can\u2019t count simple votes, but they want to fix your healthcare system,\u201d he told the crowd at the Opportunity Now Summit in Charlotte. Donald Trump is now giving a speech at the North Carolina Opportunity Now Summit in Charlotte, North Carolina. Here\u2019s a little cheery nugget from his speech: Reminder that rallies are typically for presidential candidates looking to run for office, which a president cannot do if they just served for two terms. With Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders still neck and neck amid the ongoing Iowa debacle (still no official winner), and Buttigieg surging into a position as surprise threat in New Hampshire, Sanders has been chewing the fat at the traditional Politics &amp; Eggs breakfast in event the Granite State. \u201cI\u2019m reading some headlines from newspapers about Pete Buttigieg,\u201d he said. \u201cPete Buttigieg has most exclusive billionaire donors of any Democrats, that was from Forbes. The Hill: Pete Buttigieg tops billionaire donor list. Fortune: Pete Buttigieg takes lead as big business candidate in 2020 field. Washington Post: Pete Buttigieg lures even closer look from Wall Street donors following strong Iowa caucus performance. Forbes magazine: here are the billionaires backing Pete Buttigieg\u2019s presidential campaign,\u201d Time reports. \u201cI like Pete Buttigieg, nice guy,\u201d he added. \u201cBut we are in a moment where billionaires control not only our economy but our political life.\u201d And this: Sanders must have thought he was a shoo-in for a strong win in New Hampshire, being a left-wing fixture for decades in next-door Vermont. Buttigieg is nipping at Sanders\u2019s heels in the latest opinion poll in New Hampshire. The Boston Globe/WBZ-TV/Suffolk University poll showed Sanders just in the lead in New Hampshire at 24 percent, with Buttigieg at 23 percent. Then a gap before the third-placed Elizabeth Warren, also a New England politician as the Senator for nearby Massachusetts, but now in danger of stalling in the middle of the leading group despite a solid performance in Iowa. Warren received 13 percent support, ahead of the flagging Joe Biden on 11 percent. Donald Trump retweeted this afternoon two tweets that recommended he fire Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, an adviser on the national security counsel who testified in the impeachment trial. This morning, Trump said he wasn\u2019t happy with Vindman and that decisions would be made about his post. Here are the tweets \u2013 one is from November. Here\u2019s what has happened so far today: Donald Trump said that he is not happy with Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and alluded to \u201cdecisions\u201d that would be made about his standing on the national security council, essentially confirming reports that the White House is thinking about moving him out of his position. All attention is on New Hampshire ahead of the state\u2019s Democratic primary on Tuesday. A new poll showed senator Bernie Sanders and former South Bend Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg are head-to-head for New Hampshire voters. Sanders has a slight lead at 24%, while Buttigieg polled at 24%. A US appeals court in DC ruled that a lawsuit brought forth by congressional Democrats that says Trump violated the Constitution by not turning over information about his personal investment has no standing. Trump celebrated the news about the \u201cWitch Hunt\u201d with a tweet. A Washington Post reported this morning that Trump\u2019s properties have billed Secret Service agents as much as $650 for a night\u2019s stay while protecting the president, ultimately paid by US taxpayers. House passes Puerto Rico aid package The House just passed a $21bn emergency aid package in response to the 6.4 magnitude earthquake that struck the island 7 January. The earthquake left one dead and destroyed dozens of homes and structures, along with disrupting power and water for days. \u201cIn recent weeks, thousands of families in Puerto Rico were forced from their homes, schools were flattened, roads and infrastructure were severely damage,\u201d said US rep Nita Lowey, House appropriations chairwoman, in a statement. Congressional Republicans, 17 of whom in the House voted for the bill, have indicated that they will give the package trouble once it gets to the Senate. Donald Trump has already threatened to veto it. Is this a preview of the kind of content former NYC mayor Mike Bloomberg\u2019s campaign Twitter will be spitting out during tonight\u2019s debate? Only time will tell. Standing outside the White House for some Chopper Talk this morning, Donald Trump said that there will be a decision sometime in the future about what to do with Lt Col Alexander Vindman, a member of the national security council who testified against the president during the impeachment trial. Bloomberg News reported last night that the White House is thinking about moving Vindman out of the council and rotate him to a position in the Department of Defense. One reporter said that a source close to Vindman indicated that he was at the White House yesterday and will likely work today as well, amid reports of his departure. When asked about any plans to remove Vindman from his position, Trump said that he is \u201cnot happy with him\u201d and that a decision about what do with him will be made later. Trump also denied reports that the acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, is on his way out. Comments that pundit Donny Deutsch made on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe about senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s electability is getting some heated backlash on Twitter this morning. When the show\u2019s host, Joe Scarborough, asked Deutsch and Vice reporter Shawna Thomas why they think Warren has fallen behind senator Bernie Sanders, Thomas made the argument that it was because people weren\u2019t comfortable about the electability of a woman. \u201cIf you look around and your neighbors, they\u2019re not sure a woman can beat him, that starts to wear on a campaign,\u201d Thomas said. Deutcsh cut in. \u201cIs it a woman or is it her? There\u2019s a certain stridentness to her that, do we want to invite her into our bedrooms and living rooms every day for four years?\u201d Deutsch said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a gender issue \u2013 it\u2019s a likability issue.\u201d Something interesting to keep in mind: Educational attainment is a top determinant for who shows up to the polls. During the 2018 election, those whose highest degree is a high school diploma had a 42% turnout rate in 2018, while those without a high school degree had a 27% turnout. Comparatively, 65% and 74% of those with a bachelor\u2019s degree and advanced degree, respectively, went to the polls. A US Appeals Court in DC just ruled on a lawsuit brought forth by lawyers for over 200 congressional Democrats that argues Donald Trump violated the Constitution\u2019s Emolument Clause by not allowing Congress to approve his financial interests. The suit was meant to allow Democrats to figure out how Trump has profited from foreign dignitaries in his business dealings, like when they stay at his hotels. The clause bans the president from receiving gifts or titles from leaders of state governments or foreign countries and requires Congress to approve any gifts the president receives. The lawsuit is one of multiple that charges the president for violating the clause. Would you like a side of politics with those eggs? Senator Bernie Sanders is scheduled to speak this morning at a quirky event that\u2019s become a New Hampshire tradition: Politics &amp; Eggs. The event, which has been held for over 20 years, largely consists of local business leaders, giving politicians a chance to schmooze and campaign for the upcoming primary. Politics &amp; Eggs even comes with souvenirs for attendees. Commemorative wooden eggs from the event have become something of a collectible in the state, especially since candidates are often asked to autograph the eggs while attending the breakfast. And if you were wondering, the eggs are actually made in nearby Maine. Trump pockets up to $650 when his own Secret Service agents stay at his hotel The president\u2019s company charges his own Secret Service agents up to $650 a night to stay at his properties \u2013 a bill that is ultimately paid by U.S. taxpayers \u2013 when they stay the night protecting him, the Washington Post reported this morning. Here\u2019s more from the Post: At Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club, the Secret Service was charged the $650 rate dozens of times in 2017, and a different rate, $396.15, dozens more times in 2018, according to documents from Trump\u2019s visits. And at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster, the Secret Service was charged $17,000 a month to use a three-bedroom cottage on the property, an unusually high rent for homes in that area, according to receipts from 2017. Trump\u2019s company billed the government even for days when Trump wasn\u2019t there. These payments appear to contradict the Trump Organization\u2019s own statements about what it charges members of his government entourage. \u201cIf my father travels, they stay at our properties for free \u2014 meaning, like, cost for housekeeping,\u201d Trump\u2019s son Eric said in a Yahoo Finance interview last year. Dostre effect a la today\u2019s Washington Post B-boys are battling it out in town Though Democrats are still trying to wrap their heads around what the hell actually happened in Iowa this week, the race still goes on. The candidates will be brawling on TV tonight for the latest Democratic debate in New Hampshire tonight before the primary vote takes place on Tuesday. The scene in New Hampshire is tense in the wake of the Iowa caucus. Former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s on-the-margin win in Iowa helped him surge in a recent New Hampshire poll, putting him in a near-tie with senator Bernie Sanders, who closely followed him in the caucus (though declared a caucus victory of his own). Sanders received 24% of support in the poll, while Buttigieg got 23% \u2013 a huge soar compared to the 11% he scored in a New Hampshire poll on Monday. Expect the two to throw punches at each other on stage tonight. Former vice president Joe Biden\u2019s campaign appears to be quickly losing momentum. In the poll, Biden trailed senator Elizabeth Warren \u2013 who received 13% of support in the poll \u2013 getting 11% of support. Biden recently got backlash for a cringey video of Biden apparently stroking the face of Samuel Habib, a 20-year-old student and disability rights advocate, who approached the candidate asking him what he will do to support students with disabilities. Habib has since said the interaction felt patronizing. The US added 225,000 jobs in January, a much higher figure than expected. For all the jobs numbers, reaction and analysis, here\u2019s our business live blog. After retweeting various people praising him and attacking enemies like Elizabeth Warren and Nancy Pelosi, Trump has welcomed actor James Woods back to Twitter after he left the platform, claiming it was censoring him. Trump told him: \u201cWelcome back James!\u201d and earlier on retweeted a post by Woods that called Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez a \u201cmoron\u201d. He also weighed in on the Democrats\u2019 inability to declare a winner in Iowa, suggesting that they should blame Russia and making a disingenuous comparison with their plans for increased health coverage. Trump has always poured scorn on the US intelligence community\u2019s assertion that Russia meddled in the 2016 election in order to help him win. How Donald Trump and his allies will react towards his perceived political enemies now that he has been acquitted in his impeachment trial remains to be seen. Bloomberg News reports that Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman \u2013 who gave evidence against Trump during the impeachment \u2013 may be moved from the National Security Council. Trump made reference to Vindman as he hit out at his foes during his post-acquittal speech at the White House yesterday. \u201cLieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother, we had some people that were really amazing,\u201d he said, before moving on. Meanwhile Yahoo News reports that the US Treasury Department has given congressional Republicans access to financial information relating to Hunter Biden \u2013 the son of Democratic hopeful Joe Biden, whose work in Ukraine played a key role in kicking off the impeachment. Treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin has blocked Democratic requests for access to Trump\u2019s tax filings, saying: \u201cThe legal implications of this request could affect protections for all Americans against politically-motivated disclosures of personal tax information, regardless of which party is in power.\u201d Nevertheless, Axios has reported that there is little appetite among the Republican leadership in Washington to pursue the Bidens. Alayna Treene wrote: \u201cSome Republicans fear aggressively pursuing any investigations about Burisma will give the appearance of trying to hurt Joe Biden \u2014 a former Senate colleague \u2014politically, which isn\u2019t worth it to them, the aide said, \u2018especially since the Biden campaign looks like it\u2019s toast.\u2019\u201d Walsh placed third in the Republican Iowa caucuses this week, with 1.07% of the vote. His move leaves former governor Bill Weld as the only Republican challenger to Trump. He got 1.32% in Iowa. Trump came in first with 97.14%. The president mused about his two challengers during his speech yesterday. We also had an election out there and we got 98 percent of the vote. We have two people running, you know. I guess they consider them non-people. One is a governor, but they\u2019re running. They said, who is that crowd over there? It was Trump, right, Mark Meadows? It was Trump. This was a Trump crowd. Walsh said today: \u201cDonald Trump is the greatest threat to our republic right now ... The rest of this country needs to come together to stop this guy, period.\u201d My colleague David Smith interviewed Walsh recently. Former congressman Joe Walsh has dropped his primary challenge against Donald Trump, telling CNN: \u201cIt\u2019s not a party. It\u2019s a cult. He can\u2019t be beat in the Republican primary so there\u2019s no reason for me, or any candidate, really to be in there.\u201d It\u2019s been a rollercoaster week in US politics, starting with the voting debacle in Iowa on Monday and carrying on through Donald Trump\u2019s divisive State of the Union speech and his acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial. But who are the losers and winners from a dramatic few days for Republicans and Democrats? 5/5: Donald Trump A swaggering and aggressive US president called his speech at the White House on Thursday a \u201ccelebration\u201d \u2013 and well he might. He was coming to the end of a week in which he had spent 80 minutes making the case for his re-election on primetime TV in his State of the Union speech and had been acquitted in his impeachment trial \u2013 with only one Republican breaking ranks to vote against him. A Gallup poll put the president\u2019s approval rating at 49%, the highest level for that survey since 2017, and on top of that the Democratic primary race got off to a disastrously shambolic start in Iowa. Holding up a newspaper front page that said \u201cTrump acquitted\u201d, the president told his White House crowd: \u201cLet me take that home; maybe we\u2019ll frame it. It\u2019s the only good headline I\u2019ve ever had in the Washington Post.\u201d His speech sounded like a preview of the one he plans to make on 4 November after winning the election. 4/5: Pete Buttigieg If anyone managed to wring any momentum out of the mess in Iowa, it was the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who more or less declared victory before the results were in and went on to grab as much of the spotlight as possible. Did he even win? With almost 100% of the vote in, Buttigieg is only 0.09% ahead of socialist rival Bernie Sanders in the delegate count, and Sanders is ahead of the young pretender in the popular vote. But the veteran Vermont senator will now have to wait until New Hampshire next week to grab his share of the glory. 3/5: Mike Bloomberg The billionaire former mayor of New York\u2019s decision to sit out the early states and instead blanket California with advertising seems partially vindicated. With the usual momentum conferred on the winner of Iowa blunted, a strong showing from Bloomberg in the array of states voting on Super Tuesday (3 March) is bound to launch a thousand think-pieces asking whether Bloomberg can elbow aside Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg and unite the centre. Feel queasy about a rich man buying the race? Bloomberg has an answer. \u201cSomeone said, \u2018Are you spending too much money?\u2019 and I said, \u2018I\u2019m spending money to get rid of Donald Trump.\u2019 And the guy said, \u2018Spend more.\u2019 \u201d 2/5: Joe Biden Barack Obama\u2019s former vice-president went into the week as the frontrunner in the Democratic race and still leads most national polls and match-ups with Trump. But coming fourth in Iowa \u2013 a result he called a gut-punch \u2013 has seriously dented his pitch that he is the most electable candidate. If he underperforms again in New Hampshire on Tuesday, Biden could find supporters and donors abandoning him for Buttigieg or Bloomberg. 1/5: Nancy Pelosi The leader of the Democrats in the House of Representatives took a lot of persuading to agree to impeach Trump, only doing so when the strength of the evidence in the Ukraine case became overwhelming. She initiated the process knowing it was almost certain Trump would be acquitted, but hoping to put his impeachment on the record for posterity, gum up his legislative agenda, and damage him ahead of this November\u2019s election. She has succeeded on the first two points, but the latter is very much up for debate. And on top of that, Pelosi \u2013 usually so poised in her dealings with Trump \u2013 risked losing the moral high ground when she tore up her copy of his State of the Union speech on live TV, leading secretary of state Mike Pompeo to liken her to Lisa Simpson. (Critics said he hadn\u2019t understood the episode.) 0/5: The state of Iowa Iowa was already facing criticism that as a small, 90% white, largely rural state it had a disproportionate impact on the Democratic race even before Monday\u2019s debacle, in which apps failed and telephone lines were overwhelmed, meaning that even by Friday Democrats were unable to say who had won the first contest of primary season. In the results the party eventually released, vote tallies did not add up, and figures contained inconsistencies and errors, according to the New York Times, leading the national party chair to demand a review \u201cto assure public confidence in the results\u201d. Conspiracy theories raged that the party was deliberately sabotaging Sanders\u2019 chances \u2013 and the Trump campaign gleefully fanned the flames. If the Iowa state party had deliberately set out to undermine its own place in the primary hierarchy it couldn\u2019t have done better than this. Donald Trump has been tweeting his support for his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping as Beijing struggles to deal with the coronavirus (you can read the latest on that here). China is reportedly worried about what the virus means for its ability to stick to the terms of its new trade agreements with the US, and some officials are apparently angry at Washington\u2019s travel restrictions and commerce secretary Wilbur Ross\u2019s comment that the outbreak \u201cwill help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America\u201d. Who has won the Iowa caucuses? We still don\u2019t know. With almost 100% of the vote in, former Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg is only 0.09% ahead of socialist rival Bernie Sanders in the delegate count, while Sanders is ahead of the young pretender in the popular vote. The Associated Press says it is still too close to call. Both Buttigieg and Sanders claimed victory last night. CNN asked the centrist former mayor for his reaction to the latest tally. \u201cThat\u2019s fantastic news, to hear that we won,\u201d Buttigieg said. Meanwhile, Sanders pumped out social media posts baldly claiming \u201cBernie wins Iowa\u201d \u2013 and basing that in the small print on his lead in the popular vote. \u201cWe did very well,\u201d Sanders told CNN. \u201cWe won in Iowa.\u201d In truth, it\u2019s probably accurate to call Iowa a draw. The Democratic race will be decided based on the number of delegates won, and both Buttigieg and Sanders will probably come out of Iowa with the same number. That said, Sanders went in to the contest as the narrow favourite, so in terms of perception and momentum it has probably been a win for the former mayor. The winner certainly wasn\u2019t the Iowa Democratic party. National party chair Tom Perez called for a \u201crecanvass\u201d of the tally on Thursday. \u201cA recanvass is a review of the worksheets from each caucus site to ensure accuracy,\u201d he explained after some confusion about that. He later said he was only calling for a recanvass in certain sites. To add to the confusion, AP reported that \u201cit was unclear if the party planned to follow the directive of the national leader to recanvass those results \u2026 Iowa chairman Troy Price suggested in a statement Thursday that he would only pursue a recanvass if one was requested by a campaign.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got enough of Iowa,\u201d Sanders told CNN on Thursday night. \u201cI think we should move on to New Hampshire.\u201d That contest is on Tuesday and uses a conventional voting system. Also today: 8.30am ET (1.30pm): The monthly US jobs report will be released 1pm ET: Trump will speak at the North Carolina Opportunity Now Summit. He will later speak at the Republican Governors Association Finance Dinner in Washington 8pm ET: Democratic candidates will take part in a debate in New Hampshire",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Authorities may initially have planned only a short quarantine, hoping the disease would be brought under control as Sars was over a decade ago.</p> \n<p>But it is clear China cannot afford to delay most of its population going back to work, and a meeting of top Chinese leaders has called on businesses to \u201cresume operation in an orderly manner\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-02/07/c_138761763.htm\">the official Xinhua news agency reported.</a></p> \n<p>It suggested adapting working methods to reduce the risk of infection; options could include remote working or staggered shifts.

Authorities in Wuhan city have started going door to door checking temperatures, and rounding up suspected coronavirus patients for forcible quarantine in stadiums and exhibition centres that are serving as warehouses for the sick, the New York Times reported. The city and country face \u201cwartime conditions\u201d, the paper quoted vice-premier Sun Chunlan, who has been put in charge of the national campaign against the virus, as saying on a visit to Wuhan. She said: \u201cThere must be no deserters, or they will be nailed to the pillar of historical shame forever.\u201d Meanwhile another three people on a cruise liner off Japan have tested positive, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 64. Foreign passengers on another ship, Holland America\u2019s Westerdam, have also been barred, with suspected virus patients on board, according to authorities. The ship, with more than 2,000 people, was near Okinawa and seeking another port. More than 34,500 people have been infected around the world, the vast majority inside China and two-thirds of them in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province. There have been 724 deaths, all but two of them in mainland China. Chinese scientists claimed they may have found the animal source of the outbreak, based on genetic analysis, though their results have yet to be published. The coronavirus is thought to have originated in bats but passed through an intermediate host before infecting humans. The researchers have identified a coronavirus in pangolins that is 99% similar to the one causing the current outbreak. The only scaly mammal, the long-snouted, ant-eating pangolin is endangered but often hunted for meat or use in Chinese medicine. The World Health Organization on Friday hailed a fall in the number of new infections for a second consecutive day, which could signal some progress in containing the outbreak. But across mainland China there were 3,399 new confirmed infections in the last twenty four hours. And Sun\u2019s dramatic visit to Wuhan, stepping up efforts on the ground there, and promises of more help from Beijing suggest that party officials in China fear the epidemic is still not under control. Containment efforts across Hubei province should be stepped up, with efforts to increase the number of hospital beds and medical staff, top communist party officials agreed at a meeting chaired by the premier, Li Keqiang. The death rate in Wuhan was 4.1%, the New York Times reported, far higher than the 2.8% across Hubei province, and the national rate of about 2%. Some in Wuhan fear they are being sacrificed for the national good, and the death of a whistleblower doctor from the virus has stirred up popular anger across China. Li Wenliang had been reprimanded by security officials for warning fellow doctors in late December 2019 about a mystery new disease; he then caught the coronavirus from one of his own patients in January and, despite youth and apparent good health, he died early on Friday morning. The hashtag \u201cwe want free speech\u201d was briefly circulating on social media, amid memorials and tributes to Li, before it was wiped by censors. For weeks China has ignored offers of help from the the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US and the WHO, the New York Times reported, though a spokeswoman for the WHO said it was just \u201csorting out arrangements\u201d. There have been thousands of cases in other parts of China where increasing numbers of cities, towns and even remote villages are locking themselves down. Two weeks into the crisis, however, it is clear that Beijing cannot afford to keep all of the country closed for business indefinitely. When the growing scale of the outbreak was first made public in mid-January the country was on holiday for the most important celebration on the Chinese calendar, the lunar new year festival. But after festivities that normally bring in a large slice of retail and service sector income were effectively cancelled, and the nationwide holiday was prolonged by a week, the cost of shuttered shops, factories, restaurants and other businesses has started mounting. Small businesses have warned about problems with everything from keeping livestock fed, to paying rent, and staff salaries for shops that can\u2019t make any sales. The impact of the shutdown has also been felt beyond China\u2019s borders, since the world\u2019s second-largest economy is now so integrated into international markets. South Korea\u2019s Hyundai has shuttered the most productive car factory in the world, a five-plant network that can make 1.4m cars a year, as the shutdown in China meant it ran out of a key component. Authorities may initially have planned only a short quarantine, hoping the disease would be brought under control as Sars was over a decade ago. But it is clear China cannot afford to delay most of its population going back to work, and a meeting of top Chinese leaders has called on businesses to \u201cresume operation in an orderly manner\u201d, the official Xinhua news agency reported. It suggested adapting working methods to reduce the risk of infection; options could include remote working or staggered shifts. Foxconn, the electronics company that supplies Apple, has begun manufacturing its own surgical masks, allowing Chinese workers to churn out iPhones uninterrupted. As people gear up to return home there are special regulations on trains and planes to try to reduce the risk of infection. Ticket sales will be capped at under half the usual numbers so passengers can sit further apart to reduce the risk of infection, the South China Morning Post reported. There will also be more temperature checks and quarantine areas at train stations. The effort to get people back to work might be complicated by childcare problems if schools do not reopen; authorities said only that they should \u201cpostpone the start of new semester in an appropriate manner\u201d, Xinhua reported. President Xi Jinping spoke with Donald Trump and urged the US to \u201crespond reasonably\u201d to the outbreak, echoing complaints that some countries are overreacting by restricting Chinese travellers. In a sign of growing worries overseas, Hong Kong has begun a mandatory two-week quarantine for anyone arriving from mainland China and announced fines and jail terms of up to six months for quarantine breaches. Singapore has upgraded its coronavirus alert level, sparking panic-buying of essentials.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>We typically think of viral content as a chain reaction: you share something with friends, they share it with their friends, and so on.

FFA officials met with the referees and other stakeholders including the host broadcaster Fox Sports as well as the venue groundstaff to inspect the playing surface this morning.

      "bodyText": "They\u2019ve made the final four teams on eight out of nine occasions across the Big Bash era, the Stars, but for the second year in a row, they\u2019ve made the big dance, but had their toes trodden on. Josh Philippe and Steve Smith, with some late hitting from Jordan Silk put the Sixers in a pretty strong position, before excellent captaincy from Moises Henriques and brilliantly-executed bowling knocked over the Stars\u2019 danger men early on. With Glen Maxwell and Marcus Stoinis back in the sheds it was always an uphill battle for the Stars. Josh Philippe picks up the man of the match gong. The Sydney Sixers: BBL champions for the second time. \u201cThis is up there with anything I\u2019ve done in cricket\u201d - Steve O\u2019Keefe says post-match. He reckons his feet hurt from having performed a rain dance for the past three days, but having had to take to the field, he got it done with the ball anyway. \u201cThat\u2019s something pretty special, that\u201d says fellow spinner Nathan Lyon. What a battle he had with Marcus Stoinis in the opening over, and how decisive that proved for the shape of the evening. Lots of smiles, Gatorade flying everywhere, and pats on backs. They\u2019re buzzing the Sixers, and who would blame them. Coulter-Nile winds up against Dwarshuis but he only gets two off the first delivery. One off a full toss before a dot ball. Larkin smashes a huge six over square, before playing and missing. Some close ups of the long faces on the Stars bench - Glen Maxwell looks gutted. And that\u2019s that! Sydney Sixers have won BBL09 - a terrific batting performance backed up by an even better bowling display. Worthy winners. Big Bash - Stars 6/88 (11), Larkin 32*, Coulter-Niles 16* Larkin slashes at one and it goes into the offside for two. Next delivery Hazlewood tries the yorker, but he digs it out for four! A slower ball deceives Larkin third up; dot. Next one goes to the boundary as well. 10 off 4! A six and a four and we could be in for a big last over. But another terrific slower ball from JH deceives him for a dot - before excellent fielding on the rope from Silk saves four. 12 off it, but 29 to get on the final over. Big Bash - Stars 6/72 (10), Larkin 20*, Coulter-Niles 16* The big tailender comes in and throws the bat at everything and he gets them! Two off the first down the ground, a French cut for another two, a whack to the deep for two more, before a massive six followed by a top-edge that flew for four! 16 off the over. It\u2019s almost good enough? 41 needed off 12, and it\u2019s Josh Hazlewood with the ball. Big Bash - Stars 6/60 (9), Larkin 20*, Coulter-Niles 0* Larkin smashes O\u2019Keefe over the rope from the final ball, but the spinner had already had the last laugh, picking up Seb Gotch trying the same thing a few balls earlier. 57 off 18 is the equation. Three very big overs. Big Bash - Stars 5/49 (8), Gotch 5*, Larkin 12* Five off that Dwarshuis over as Larkin swings wildly at a wide one and gets nothing on it. The stump mic picks up some colourful language from the batsman - and that\u2019s how the evening has gone for the Stars. Big Bash - Wicket! Stars 5/40 (6.2), Dunk out It\u2019s Nathan Lyons who picks up Dunk - who throws the cross-bat at it, but is deceived by the off-spinner! He departs lbw, and that, surely, is the end of that. The Sixers can do this nicely from here, you\u2019d imagine. To the delight of those that braved the heavy rains in Sydney. Big Bash - Stars 4/39 (6), Larkin 7*, Dunk 11* Finally a decent over for the Stars, as Dunk takes on O\u2019Keefe and puts him over the boundary on the off-side. They\u2019ll need six more like that and then some. Otherwise curtains. At the halfway point though the bowling from the Sixers has been absolutely superb. What an attack, mind. Hazlewood. Lyon. O\u2019Keefe. Abbott. Great list. Big Bash - Stars 4/27 (5), Larkin 5*, Dunk 1* Brilliant first over from Abbott - a wicket and two runs from it. They\u2019re going at modern-day Test rate; you have to think the early loss of Stoinis plus scoreboard pressure has done them here, the Stars. How crucial were those consistent overs from Philippe and Smith? Really got inside the heads of the Stars\u2019 batsmen. Big Bash - Wicket! Stars 4/25 (4.1), Handscomb 6 out Ach, that\u2019s awful. First ball, and they\u2019ve done each other. They try for the second and Larkin slips - and then sends his partner back! Handscomb done at the bowler\u2019s end - run out. This is crashing like a supernova. The Stars are exploding. Big Bash - Stars 3/24 (4), Handscomb 6*, Larkin 4* Another good over from Hazlewood, just five off it. That\u2019s a third of the deliveries eaten up, and they\u2019re 93 runs short, with just 48 balls to get them in. You can understand the settling over, but these two need to go, and go big from here. Big Bash - Wicket! Stars 3/18 (2.4) - O\u2019Keefe gets Maxwell!! He glowers up at the replay screen as he trudges off. The Stars fans came to see this man - one of the game\u2019s most destructive batsmen - work his magic. But O\u2019Keefe deceives him with a slower spinning delivery, that goes on straight and catches the back pad. Was it bouncing too high? Possibly not. He took an age to make the decision, but the finger went up and Glen Maxwell is gone. Sixers in the ascendancy - they\u2019re looking pretty in pink now. 98 off 54 is the equation. Big Bask - Wicket! Stars 2/14 (1.4), Maddison goes for a duck He\u2019s had a scratchy old tournament, Maddinson but after a few dot balls he goes after one and like Stoinis holes out in the deep. Vince with the catch - that will lift his mood after missing out with the bat. Larkin comes in. Can he see off Josh Hazlewood and build the innings with Maxwell? A wicket and one off the over from the big quick - that\u2019s a phenomenal over in the short form of the game; let alone a reduced 12-over match. Big Bash - Wicket! Stars 1/10 (0.4), Stoinis out It was the big-hitting Marcus Stoinis v the wily Nathan Lyon, and they both find a bit of joy. A boundary off the first - a six that just clipped the rope third ball, but then fourth ball he\u2019s gone again and been caught on the boundary by Abbott! Stoinis goes - that\u2019s a huge wicket, just four balls in. It brings Maxwell to the crease. If he goes cheaply you would have to say it would definitely then be Sixers on top; no? Okay - to my knowledge, I think that\u2019s everything else in bed. Let\u2019s get back to the Big Bash final and follow the whole of the Stars innings until it\u2019s conclusion. Don\u2019t go anywhere - this could be an epic finish. Okay, I\u2019ve gone back to take a look at those A-League goals. Oh my. The great JP Howcroft wrote an entire column earlier this season as an Ode to the Goalmouth Scramble but Perth\u2019s effort against Newcastle had nothing on that equaliser from Brisbane Roar. McDonald thought he\u2019d scored, then Muratovic\u2019s follow-up effort was cleared off the line, then another a follow-up shot (from Inman?) was blocked - and then finally, the youngster volleyed home through a crowd of bodies! A bit more straight forward with the second goal, although it was a short-corner routine that eventually ended up with Tom Aldred nodding home at the far post. They cop stick, the elaborate training ground routines, but when they come off, well. Fair play. A huge three points for the home side - that makes four wins in their past six, and finally: they\u2019re back in the six! Big Bash: End of Innings - 5/116 (20), Philippe 52 out, last ball Wowee. Who needs the extra eight overs, that was some high-octane stuff. Zampa gets belted for six but on the last ball he gets his man on the last delivery. Philippe gives himself room out leg for a sweep, but misses and gets rattled. They\u2019ll need 117 at 9.75. Not quite the 10+ but that\u2019s still pretty intimidating - especially with a damp ball and a bit of moisture flying round. Plenty of hope for both sets of fans - this one is very nicely poised. A-League - Goal! Brisbane 2-1 Adelaide (Aldred) 74 min: Hello! It\u2019s the skipper, Aldred, and he nods home for Brisbane to come from behind! He\u2019s a very popular figure in the dressing room, and that\u2019s a very popular goal in the picture of the Roar\u2019s season. Can they hold on now for the three points? Big Bash - Sixers 4/106 (11), Philippe 43*, Silk 26* Big over off Haris Rauf - who goes for 13! Silk goes after him, and smashes it just shy of the rope - millimetres from a six, that. And on the final ball Silk goes again but it flies high into the night\u2019s sky. Maddinson\u2019s under it - it\u2019s a tricky, swirling catch - and he puts it down! Silk survives, and they grab two. Could that prove costly?! Big Bash - Sixers 4/93 (10), Philippe 38*, Silk 18* Jordan Silk opens the shoulders and lofts Coulter-Nile over cow corner for six! It\u2019s the second time they\u2019ve got him on the final ball; and another good over turns into a bad one, instantly. 100 was looking a decent psychologically barrier, not too many boundaries were coming - if they can push past that by some distance though the Sixers could have a good enough score. A-League - Goal! Brisbane 1-1 Adelaide (Muratovic) It took just ten minutes to hit back, and it\u2019s the youngster Mirza Muratovic who hands the home side a share of the spoils. I\u2019d love to tell you more, but I\u2019ll confess I\u2019ve got about three screens on and I\u2019m not catching it all. Great to see the young strikers coming through under the tutelage of the great Robbie Fowler. Big Bash - Sixers 4/82 (9), Philippe 36*, Silk 10* Rauf doesn\u2019t do a lot wrong (apart from one booming above-the-shoulders delivery that he has to bowl again) but he still goes for nine. They nudge him for a few twos off the end to make it a decent over. It\u2019s still really in the balance. 18 big deliveries - 25-30 could be enough for the Sixers. They need to get Philippe back on strike. Eek. That\u2019s got ugly near the end. The Waratahs had pulled back to 12-20 and made it a little nervy for their front-leading visitors, but two tries late on for Telea really rubbed their noses in it. \u201cCredit to the Blues, they\u2019re one of those teams that never give up - the try on the buzzer shows that\u201d - that\u2019s the word from a deflated Karmichael Hunt post-match. \u201cWe need to keep perspective - it\u2019s still round two.\u201d Big Bash - Sixers 4-68 (7.2), Philippe 33*, Silk 0* Zampa picks up the skipper Henriques - gone for 7 off 6, and they\u2019ve pinched two in as many overs, as Maxi traps the new man Hughes lbw! They\u2019re still scoring at a decent clip, but they need to find somebody to go with Philippe, the Sixers. Stars suddenly on top - can they add a good over or two here to push the run rate down? A-League - Goal! Brisbane 0-1 Adelaide (Halloran) 57 min: It\u2019s the home side looking to lift the tempo, but with Brisbane edging proceedings, against the run of play a belter from Halloran! He follows in Opseth\u2019s blocked effort, and blasts a half-volleyed effort from 25-30m out. Great control with the first touch, at pace, and the second - even better! Whack. His sixth goal of the season. Big Bash - Wicket! Sixers 1/49 (5.1), Smith 21 out! Here\u2019s a big moment! They were looking very comfortable, Philippe and Smith - the former seeing off the first dangerous Zampa over, with some smart singles and then a lovely final-ball boundary. The skipper Maxwell decides something has to change - and he grabs the ball himself. Smith takes him on - and first ball, he\u2019s holed out in the deep! A terrific catch from Handscomb who holds onto a swirling, difficult effort. Smith goes - is that a match changing moment?! Henriques comes out, but it\u2019s Philippe who takes on Maxi. A massive pre-meditated slog down the ground - a massive six! Big Bash - Sixers 1/40 (4), Philippe 17*, Smith 18* It\u2019s Smith v Rauf, as the Pakistani quick takes on perhaps the world\u2019s best batsmen. First blood - Smith: a four, a massive six and then some smart singles. Both these batsmen looking very comfortable out there. They\u2019ve seen off the first of the Stars\u2019 danger men with the ball - here comes the other; it\u2019s Zampa to bowl the fifth over. Big Bash - Sixers 0/15 (2), Philippe 11*, Vince 2* He\u2019s undone that good Worrall over, Nathan Coulter-Niles as with Vince pinned after a series of play and misses, he trundles down a wide one that Philippe lashes square, before clipping him off the toes for six off the final ball of the over! Can they settle now, the Sixers? No! First ball of the next Worrall over, he\u2019s picked up Vince! 2 off 9. That\u2019s a really bad innings in a 72 ball game. He was going after every delivery, and he connected with very few. In comes Steve Smith. Can he be the man for the Sixers? Big Bash - Sixers 0/3 (1), Philippe 1*, Vince 1* We\u2019re away! And it\u2019s a terrific first over for the Stars - especially in a rain-reduced 3-over powerplay, where they\u2019ve gone for just three! Worrall finding great lateral movement in the damp conditions and Vince wafts at a few to no effect. The pressure is already straight on the Sixers; they\u2019ve lost the toss, been sent in, and with just 66 balls left will already feel they need to get moving. A-League: Brisbane Roar 0-0 Adelaide United - half-time No goals, but plenty of intrigue in Brisbane. That near-howler from Izzo the closest we got to an opener, while at the other end the Reds had a few chances, but nothing too clear cut - at least to worry the league\u2019s in-form \u2018keeper, Young. More to come in this one, you\u2019d imagine, as legs and minds tire, and the match opens up. A-League - 43 min: It\u2019s the unlikely figure of Roar\u2019s centre back Macauley Gillesphey firing a shot from distance - and it\u2019s squirmed through \u2018keeper Paul Izzo\u2019s hands, but rolls agonisingly wide of the posts! Blushes spared - that was shades of Tom Glover\u2019s howler in the Melbourne derby. Crucially though, the final result was different - with it coming at the cost of just a corner, not a goal. Super Rugby - Tries! So much for the late half revival - the \u2018Tahs have come out for the second half as cold as week-old sick. The Blues with back-to-back tries within the first five minutes, the latter seeing a No 8 putting it on the toe for a winger in acres of space. What happened there?! The Waratahs defence caught badly short out wide, and they trail now 7-20. We have a bat toss! It\u2019s looking like a 12-over game, and it\u2019s Glen Maxwell\u2019s Stars that have won the bat-flip and elected to bowl first. Ben Dunk the only change to Melbourne\u2019s line up, the Sixers will be as they were last time out. Move over The Hundred - welcome to the 72! That\u2019s the figure if we do get the 12 overs in a piece. Game on. A-League - 30 min: Still scoreless in grizzly, drizzly conditions in Brisbane. A fair bit of niggle in this one - Adelaide\u2019s Gertjan Verbeek no shrinking violet on the touchline, and there\u2019s a fair bit of steel to Robbie Fowler\u2019s Roar these days. Mauk fires a shot for Adelaide - but it only catches the back of his own player, Kristian Opseth! Ach. Friendly fire, that was probably goal-bound. Super Rugby: Waratahs 7-8 Blues - half-time: A try just in the shadow of half-time has the home fans feeling a little more optimistic. Lalakai Foketi grabbing the five-pointer after a good sustained period of possession for the \u2018Tahs. That will make Rob Penney\u2019s half-time chat a little more optimistic. It\u2019s nicely poised this one; the home side very much fought their way back into the contest after looking on the back foot early on. We could be looking at 12-14 overs each in the Big Bash final - which poses all sorts of conundrums for coaches and performance staff. Does Maxi open?? Imagine. It\u2019s reportedly reasonably dry underfoot - I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve had a toss yet though; will keep my eyes and ears peeled (sure) on that front. A-League - 10 min: No score from Brisbane in the inaugural \u201cStefan Mauk derby\u201d. The man named Ingo (middle name) was of course until last month a Brisbane Roar player. He found his opportunities limited, or at least, not to his liking - and lines up this weekend for his new side, Adelaide United, against - you guessed it: Brisbane Roar. It\u2019s the Reds (playing in white) on the attack early on - they look to work something from a corner, but Jamie Young comes and claims comfortably. Super Rugby - 25 min: So, not the ideal start for the Tahs, who go behind after ten minutes to a Blake Gibson try. It\u2019s the Blues who have been probing and very much setting the pace, although there\u2019s still been plenty of ball in hand for the home side. A penalty while on attack is also gratefully accepted: Waratahs 0-8 Blues. The latest from the SCG and the Big Bash final: the super soppa is out working over-time, and a decent breeze is coming across the oval which is helping dry out the pitch. No official word on a starting time, or how many overs we\u2019ll lose, but we are edging inexorably closer to a start. I believe. Some bad news from the A-League and for Melbourne Victory fans (it\u2019s really not been their week, let\u2019s face it) - Socceroos star Robbie Kruse is set for a lengthy stint on the sideline: Anna Harrington with the words out of Melbourne: Melbourne Victory winger Robbie Kruse has suffered a fresh hamstring injury and will miss at least six weeks of the A-League season. Kruse limped down the tunnel in the 84th minute of Victory\u2019s 2-1 loss on Friday night, just 29 minutes after entering the fray, having missed the previous week\u2019s draw with Perth Glory with hamstring tightness. Victory confirmed Kruse had suffered a right hamstring injury - his other hamstring caused the Socceroo to miss the opening five rounds. \u201cBarring any setbacks during his recovery, it\u2019s expected Kruse will be available for selection in the next 6-8 weeks,\u201d the Victory said in a statement issued on Saturday. Kruse\u2019s setback means Victory will also have to reshuffle ahead of Tuesday\u2019s Asian Champions League clash with Chiangrai United. Another significant spanner in Victory\u2019s stop-start season. Their traditional rivals Adelaide won\u2019t mind though - we are just a few minutes away from kickoff in Brisbane, where it is the Reds in action. Not sure the backstory behind it, but they\u2019ve elected to open their season a few hundred kilometres up the road in Newcastle, the Waratahs. Not a bad call given if they were playing in Sydney tonight the game would have no doubt been cancelled. Here\u2019s the respective XVs for Tahs v Blues - we\u2019re actually up and underway, no score as yet: We do of course have Super Rugby still ahead, where the Waratahs will be looking to bounce back from their opening round loss to the Crusaders - they\u2019re at home to the Blues. An intriguing result a bit earlier coming out of the Waikato - where the Chiefs have beaten Razer Robinson\u2019s South Islanders. Hello. And here\u2019s the official word on the BBL final - the final can be delayed for up to two hours before it will be officially cancelled; in which case the home side, the Sixers, would be declared champions. Summary courtesy AAP: Play would need to start by about 9:20pm for a completed game to be possible. There is no reserve day in the BBL schedule. The Sixers will be crowned champions if the clash is abandoned because they are hosting the final. \u201cThey (umpires) are certainly hopeful of getting some sort of game in,\u201d Stars skipper Glenn Maxwell said during Fox Sports\u2019 pre-match program. \u201cThey have to make sure it\u2019s a safe environment for the game to go ahead. \u201cThe last thing you want is a Josh Hazlewood or someone like that going down with an injury because of wet weather. \u201cI know everyone is desperate to get out there and have a game ... hopefully, we can get a bit of a break between the showers.\u201d Every eight minutes of play lost to wet weather will result in the match being reduced by one over per team. Now the big remaining question mark over Sportswatch tonight is the will-it, won\u2019t-it dilemma surrounding the Big Bash final, where the latest is that the torrential rains currently lashing Sydney have delayed the bat toss. So \u201cyes, hopefully, but not straight away\u201d remains the verdict there. Thousands have braved the rains and made their way out to the SCG. Let\u2019s hope for their sakes we can at least get a reduced game in. As the Thunder will remind you from earlier in the season - 5 overs is the minimum required for a formal contest. They started the quarter in flying fashion, Adelaide, and for a moment you wondered, maybe, just maybe - with a goal inside the opening minute of the final stanza. But some old heads in the Brisbane defensive line stood tall, marshalled excellently by Sharni Webb, and any final term turnaround was slowly strangled out. No Erin Phillips and plenty of other outs for Adelaide, but it was the eight debutants of Brisbane that stood tall - what a win for the home side! And the somewhat incongruous sounds of La Marseillaise resound around Hickey Park. Incroyable. And a story looming from the late A-League fixture, which will be going ahead. It\u2019s been one of the stories of the season - the emergence of FA Cup Final hero, Al Hassan Toure - but Adelaide United could be about to give a debut to his younger brother Mohamed - aged just 15. Here\u2019s the line ups for that one - Adelaide: And Brisbane: And, in news that won\u2019t surprise too many - the USWNT has qualified for the Toyko Olympics courtesy an emphatic 4-0 win over Mexico. It\u2019s shaping as some tournament, with Brazil, UK, Netherlands and Japan all qualifying (the latest, more easily as hosts). Can Australia join them? After their 7-0 win over Taiwan you\u2019d say it\u2019s looking positive, but still very early days in Australia\u2019s qualifying campaign through Asia. AFLW: three-quarter-time: Brisbane leads Adelaide 5.3 (33) to 1.2 (8) Brisbane kept them scoreless in the first quarter, and now they\u2019ve done it again, as the home side stretch their lead and start to threaten an opening-round boilover against the reigning premiers! 25 points the margin, surely the Crows can\u2019t turn this around, even with the breeze behind their backs? They did dominate the inside 50s, so they are making chances, but perhaps not finding those clear-cut opportunities? Golf: There was a fair bit of hoo-ha flying round with the news earlier in the week that ABC would be showing the Vic Open on its primarily TV channel, relegating the Sydney derby to the minor channels, but with news the latter has been washed out; who\u2019s laughing now? Here\u2019s Australian Associated Press\u2019s report from the day\u2019s action, where its wind, not rain, reportedly wreaking havoc: Marcus Fraser has overcome \u201cborderline unplayable\u201d conditions to rocket into title contention in the third round of the $1.5 million Vic Open at 13th Beach. With strong winds gusting over 60km/h late on Saturday afternoon at the links layout, Fraser hung tough to shoot a three-under-par 69, lifting him to 12 under. He was a shot off the lead held by fellow Australian Min Woo Lee, who still had four holes of his round to play. Fraser, 41, has won three times on the European Tour during his long professional career. Kia ora! A great hello to you and yours, on what remains, as Megan rightly pointed out, a full basket of sports entertainment. A very magnanimous welcome too - much obliged. Sensational! I guess toothache is a sensation though.. As we\u2019ve mentioned - if you\u2019re just joining us there will be no A-League Sydney derby tonight due to the inclement rains across Sydney. Still, you\u2019d take it over bushfires - let\u2019s hope the rains do some good somewhere across the region. We\u2019ll take you back to the AFLW shortly, but in the interim let\u2019s see what else is happening out there. It\u2019s been a very exciting afternoon so far, with some nail-biters in the cricket and AFLW. There\u2019s more sport coming your way this afternoon, with the second half of this fascinating contest from Brisbane coming up very soon, as well as the Waratahs taking on the Blues in the Super Rugby and another Brisbane v Adelaide match up - this time in the A-League. There is also the increasingly unlikely chance that we might get a BBL final tonight, though my very scientific predictions that consist of \u201clooking out my window\u201d suggest that you might be watching a replay of the Stars and Sixers qualifying final on your TV instead. To take you through tonight\u2019s line up, I\u2019m handing over now to the sensational Richard Parkin, who will guide you through the evening\u2019s events, both rain-affected and dry. Until next time, so long and thanks for all the fish! AFLW: Half-time - Brisbane leads Adelaide 3.3 (21) to 1.2 (8) The weather has settled down in Brisbane, but the Lions are still raining on the Crows\u2019 parade, adding another goal this quarter off the boot of Lauren Arnell. Courtney Gum added one for the Crows, but they weren\u2019t able to close the gap, as the Lions continued their strong defensive efforts. Jessy Keeffe has been all over the park with four tackles and nine hitouts to her name this half. A riveting second half awaits - the Lions are determined, but will the Crows bounce back and let their experience shine? BMX: Worrying news out of Bathurst today with Olympic hopeful Kai Sakakibara airlifted to hospital during a race. From AAP: Australian Olympic BMX cycling hopeful Kai Sakakibara has been airlifted to hospital with head injuries after crashing out of a World Cup event. The 23-year-old was racing on day one of the Supercross in Bathurst in central western NSW on Saturday when he was injured. He was taken by helicopter to Canberra hospital in a critical but stable condition, according to a statement on the BMX Australia website. Sakakibara fell on the second corner during his opening-round heat and was treated on site by paramedics and a doctor before being taken to hospital. The event was called off for the day after the men\u2019s first round because of wind and rain. Sakakibara and his younger sister Saya aim to make their Olympic debuts in Tokyo.\u201d BBL: While the view from my window tells me it\u2019s not currently raining in Sydney, it seems wildly optimistic to expect the BBL final to take place tonight. However it seems that there are a not-insignificant number of people who embrace wild optimism and have arrived at the SCG hoping to see some cricket. I mean, I assume that\u2019s what they\u2019re hoping and they haven\u2019t just turned up for the $9 meat pies. AFLW: Quarter-time Brisbane 2.2 (14) leads Adelaide 0.0 (0) It\u2019s a very strong start from the home team who did a brilliant job to slot two goals before the weather decided it would be fun to recreate the game from Blacktown earlier this afternoon. It\u2019s looking decidedly miserable out there, but the Lions are doing their best to make it worthwhile for the fans who braved the weather. Both goals were scored by debutantes in a brilliant sign for the Lions\u2019 recruitment team, with Orla O\u2019Dwyer and Greta Bodey doing the damage. The Crows look shell shocked and will need to fight the rain as well as their determined opponents to work their way back into this contest. Rugby: Things aren\u2019t getting easier for Australian rugby and the hunt for a new broadcast deal highlights some of the struggles they\u2019re facing. Bret Harris illustrates the woes here, with Fox Sports offering a much smaller deal than they previously had and Optus the only other bidder offering not much more. Whether RA receives $20m a year or $30m, it still will not be sufficient to stop the exodus of Australian players to Europe and Japan, which will further dilute the quality of Australia\u2019s four Super Rugby franchises. New Zealand and South Africa, too, are starting to lose players in significant numbers to overseas clubs, but they have more depth than Australia, which remains in a comparatively weaker position.\u201d AFLW: Another big match coming up, with Brisbane taking on Adelaide in just a couple of minutes. It will be a tough ask for Brisbane coming up against the defending premiers and the Lions\u2019 preseason form hasn\u2019t asked many questions of the opposition. But a home crowd might just spur them on as they look for a winning start to the season. AFLW: Another favourite from during the week, this great season preview from Kasey Symons. She makes some really interesting points about women\u2019s coaching roles and what is being done to address the lack of top level female coaches. Advocates for women in sport had hoped the expanded competition would establish more coaching opportunities for women. Yet of the 14 teams, only one boasts a woman as head coach \u2013 St Kilda, with Peta Searle, who made history as the first woman to be part of an AFL men\u2019s coaching program. Former AFLW head coaches Bec Goddard and Cowan have returned to the game in some way \u2013 Cowan as a forward line coach with the Eagles and Goddard with Hawthorn\u2019s VFLW program \u2013 but progress remains slow in this space. The AFL established an AFLW coaching academy in 2019 (also headed up by Cowan) to address the issue, but the fruits of that are yet to truly be seen \u2013 either in the women\u2019s or men\u2019s competitions. Another momentum swing saw the Dees steal the game and the spotlight from competition favourites North at Casey Field. Eden Zanker struck with an all-important goal for the Dees five minutes into the final quarter, and despite Shelley Scott only managing a behind in the 13th minute, the defence was strong enough to hold the lead, with North not able to add to their score for the quarter. It puts a target on the backs of the Dees who will look to continue this form into their match against the Bulldogs next Friday night. Returning star Daisy Pearce was delighted with the win - her return to the field coming 694 days after she last played an AFLW match. \u201cGreat to get the season off to a good start with a positive win against quality opposition,\u201d she said. \u201cTough conditions - we love Casey but it always throws out some challenges. Great to be back out here and so proud of our team for what we put out today in tough conditions.\u201d Olympics: One of my favourite pieces of this week was this fantastic reminiscence from Geoff Lemon on the surprise star of the Sydney Olympics - The Dream with Roy and HG. This was the joy of The Dream. It was a cleansing draught of bicarb soda to offset the saccharine stodge of the Olympic diet; the daily dose that made enjoying the rest possible. It came out of nowhere, but from a couple of practitioners who were in prime condition for the gig. It was bold and interesting programming from a network that usually shirks that. It made dagginess a centrepiece.\u201d Football: It was a dominant win for the Matildas last night without Sam Kerr and Samantha Lewis captured it wonderfully. Friday\u2019s 7-0 demolition of Taiwan showed just what a Kerr-less Matildas can look like. Ironically, the striker\u2019s niggle appeared to be a confidence-booster for the side, allowing other players to step out from beneath her ever-lengthening shadow and claim the spotlight for themselves.\u201d AFLW: Three-quarter-time - North Melbourne leads Melbourne 3.2 (20) to 2.3 (15) What a nailbiter this game is turning out to be! Momentum continues to swing back and forth and some nerves striking Melbourne, which allows the Kangaroos to take advantage. Tegan Cunningham had the perfect opportunity in front of the sticks, set up by a needle-threading kick by Kate Hore, but she sprayed it wide and came away with only one point for the quarter. Emma Kearney has been a powerhouse in defence for North, with seven tackles and 16 disposals for the match so far. What will the last quarter bring? Is there a scoring end or has North finally stamped their dominance on this game once and for all? Cricket: Due to that delightful NSW weather, the Bushfire Bash will be played in Melbourne tomorrow, which is quite possibly what Cricket Australia wanted all along. The squads are looking pretty impressive with some very big names in there, even after Shane Warne pulled out. What match up are you most looking forward to in this one? For me it\u2019s Brett Lee v Alex Blackwell - I\u2019m predicting Blackwell smashes some sixes off Tony Abbott\u2019s best mate. AFLW: A brilliant article today from the always brilliant Kirby Fenwick. She has beautifully captured the atmosphere and energy surrounding AFLW at Princes Park. For fans of the women\u2019s game, returning to Princes Park on a Friday night in February has become a tradition. It\u2019s a night we start pining for as soon as the shine of the grand final wears off. One that fills our bellies with nerves, and our hearts with joy. The old ground has a distinctive kind of magic, infused as it is with so many special AFLW memories \u2013 so many footy firsts, historic moments and iconic images.\u201d Cricket: The match report from Australia\u2019s loss earlier this afternoon is now live. The loss makes tomorrow\u2019s match against England a must-win encounter for Australia to qualify for the final of the tri-series. AFLW: Half-time - Melbourne leads North Melbourne 2.2 (14) to 2.1 (13) A much improved quarter from the Dees sees them hit the lead with a late goal right on half-time. Kate Hore has been a standout, with two goals and a behind, as well as 10 disposals and two marks. Melbourne\u2019s fitness is starting to come to the fore as they power through this match. A fascinating second half awaits us. Hockey: With wild weather forcing cancellations across NSW this weekend, the coronavirus is also playing havoc with scheduling. The Hockeyroos will be unable to travel to China for Hockey Pro League games in March. Here\u2019s the latest from AAP: Hockeyroos\u2019 games in China postponed The Hockeyroos have become the latest sporting team forced to alter their schedule because of the outbreak of the coronavirus. Australia\u2019s women\u2019s hockey team, who later this year will seek to win their first Olympic medal since triumphing at home in 2000, were slated to travel to Changzhou and face China in Pro League matches on March 14 and 15. Those games have now been scrapped, with the International Hockey Federation (FIH) scrambling to find new dates and another venue. \u201cThis is the right thing to do under the circumstances and Hockey Australia fully supports the FIH\u2019s stance,\u201d said Hockey Australia chief executive Matt Favier said. The FIH confirmed the latest change to its schedule, which comes after this weekend\u2019s games between Belgium and China in Changzhou were also postponed. \u201cHockey Australia\u2019s number one priority is always the health, well-being and safety of our athletes and staff,\u201d Hockey Australia high-performance director Toni Cumpston said. \u201cWe raised our concerns with FIH and initiated discussions as soon as the threat of the coronavirus was first publicised. We are happy that FIH have made this decision and we look forward to working with them and the Chinese Hockey Association to organise another suitable time to play the matches.\u201d The Pro League, a home-and-away competition involving the world\u2019s best teams, is a key part of the Hockeyroos\u2019 preparation for Tokyo 2020. Australia lost to the Netherlands in last year\u2019s Pro League final in a penalty shootout. The Hockeyroos\u2019 2020 Pro League campaign continues on March 6 against Argentina in Perth. AFLW: Quarter-time - North Melbourne leads Melbourne 2.1 (13) to 0.0 (0) It\u2019s been a dominant start from the competition favourites, who seem to be relishing the favourites tag. Despite windy conditions in Melbourne, the weather is positively balmy compared to the last game. The Dees are playing with heart, but the Kangaroos look too big and too strong for them at this stage of the game. Kaitlyn Ashmore and Daisy Bateman have the goals for the Kangaroos, while Tahni Nestor has been dominant in defence. Despite Ash Gardener\u2019s sensational 93 off 57 balls at Junction Oval today, Australia couldn\u2019t come away with the win and seal their place in the final, going down to India with two balls to spare. A lack of wickets hurt the Australians, something they will be looking to address with their World Cup campaign due to begin in less than two weeks. India will be pleased with the seven-wicket win, but will be aware that the hosts aren\u2019t giving away everything they\u2019ve got so close to the World Cup. Craig on Twitter is also keeping a close eye on the cricket, but is looking forward to the upcoming AFLW game also. That match is kicking off very soon and there will be plenty of eyes on Pearce as she makes her return to the field after the birth of her twins last year. The game has been billed as the match of the round and North Melbourne are favourites for this year\u2019s premiership, so the Dees will be extra motivated to start the season with a win over their rivals. Don\u2019t forget you can tweet or email me or leave a comment down below if you want to get involved in the chat around today\u2019s great day of sport. Maddy on Twitter is enjoying the T20 at the moment, but shares my concerns about Australia\u2019s lack of wickets going into the final three overs of the match. Delissa Kimmince with the ball for the 17th over, let\u2019s hope she has a couple of wickets in her. A League: News just in that tomorrow\u2019s F3 derby is now in doubt due to ongoing rain on the NSW coast. The latest from AAP: \u201cThe F3 derby between Newcastle and Central Coast is in doubt due to wet weather, with a decision expected to be made early on Sunday morning. Just hours after the Sydney derby was postponed due to torrential rain, the Jets on Saturday announced McDonald Jones Stadium will also be inspected at 10.30am on Sunday. \u201cThe inspection will assess the impact of the weather on the surface, and any decision regarding the #F3Derby fixture will be communicated following the inspection,\u201d the Jets said in a statement.\u201d Cricket: India 129-2 after 14 overs A big wicket from Megan Schutt gives some hope back to the Australians, with Jemimah Rodrigues departing for 30. Though it does bring the dangerous Harmanpreet Kaur to the crease, so still plenty of work for the bowlers to do in these last six overs. No more points were added in the end and GWS snuck away with the win, which they will hope will put their season on a better track than 2019. GWS captain Alicia Eva was happy with the win, although a little surprised when the siren sounded. \u201cI thought we were a point down!\u201d she said. \u201cThat was a tough game. Credit to Gold Coast, they went hard and made us work hard. The ground is really hard under foot, but credit to our strength and conditioning coach who trained us hard over the preseason.\u201d Cricket: India 120-1 after 12 overs A career best score from Ash Gardener put the Australians on track to win at Junction Oval where they finished 173-5 in their innings, but India have not let up in reply. Of course it was El-Pez with the big wicket, but India have not slowed, needing just 54 runs off 48 balls for victory with nine wickets in hand. AFLW: 4th quarter - GWS leads Gold Coast 1.3 (9) to 1.2 (8) While the W-League wasn\u2019t able to go ahead, the AFLW pushes on in a very wet and wild Blacktown. With visibility poor and the ball basically a bar of soap, it\u2019s not the entry to the competition the Suns would have dreamed of. Aimee Schmidt got the goal for GWS, while Brittany Perry found the big sticks for the Suns. With less than five minutes to go, it\u2019s still anyone\u2019s game if they can hold the ball. Guess what\u2019s back? Back again. Footy\u2019s back. Tell a friend. That\u2019s right, despite still being in the throes of cricket season, we are blessed with the AFLW, giving us more women\u2019s sport than you can poke a stick at, which makes me very happy indeed. More on the very soggy game from Blacktown in just a minute though, the big news is that the Sydney Derby in the A-League has been postponed due to heavy rain in Sydney. Football Federation Australia have released the following statement: \u201cThe Sydney Derby that was scheduled to be played at Netstrata Jubilee Stadium today has been postponed due to torrential rain in the Sydney basin over the past 48 hours. FFA officials met with the referees and other stakeholders including the host broadcaster Fox Sports as well as the venue groundstaff to inspect the playing surface this morning. Having assessed the condition of the field, and considering the forecast for rain for the remainder of the day, all stakeholders agreed that the pitch was not safe to play on today. FFA Head of Leagues, Greg O\u2019Rourke, was personally on hand to inspect the field of play this morning and ultimately made the decision to postpone the match. \u201cWith over 100mm of rain falling in the Sydney area over the past two days, and in the interest of player welfare, all parties agreed that it was not possible to play the match as scheduled today,\u201d said O\u2019Rourke. \u201cWhilst it is disappointing that a nearly sold-out crowd is unable to see another iconic Sydney Derby today, this was the right decision to give fans as much notice as possible under the circumstances,\u201d concluded O\u2019Rourke The match will be rescheduled for another date to be decided following discussions between FFA, both Clubs and Fox Sports.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Emmanuel Macron\u2019s work rate puts others to shame. As a slouching Boris Johnson hosted a boozy private party in Downing Street on Brexit eve, France\u2019s busy-bee president was issuing a statesmanlike appeal to the British people. Macron called for the opening of a new chapter in what he described as an \u201cunrivalled\u201d relationship forged in \u201cblood, freedom, courage, and battles\u201d. The French \u201cknow what they owe the British,\u201d he wrote. This was stirring, crafty stuff. While Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s chancellor, defied by her own party and the far right in Thuringia\u2019s state election, watches the clock tick towards retirement, Macron is vigorously setting tougher terms for future EU enlargement, covering countries such as Kosovo, Albania and North Macedonia.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51398169\" title=\"\">Madonna\u2019s Madame X</a> era is the gift that keeps on giving. On Wednesday night, her residency at the London Palladium descended into the kind of chaos that turned it into one of those gigs you can only have dreamed of being at, like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8yU8wk67gY\" title=\"\">Bob Dylan at the Newport Folk Festival</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2006/05/11/110506_sex_pistols_gig_feature.shtml\" title=\"\">Sex Pistols at Manchester\u2019s Lesser Free Trade Hall</a>.</p> <p>Madonna ran over the theatre\u2019s curfew by a few minutes, so the venue turned on the lights and <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/02/06/madonna-rages-madame-x-show-cut-short-claiming-theatre-lowered-9-tonne-curtain-stage-12196434/\" title=\"\">closed the curtain</a>. She then uploaded a video of it to Instagram, with a caption that began: \u201cArtists are here to disturb the peace\u201d and ended with: \u201cPower to the people!\u201d You can hear her protesting: \u201cFuck you motherfuckers! Censorship, censorship, motherfuckers censorship.\u201d If that doesn\u2019t open her next album, I\u2019ll eat my eyepatch.</p> <p>I love it when it all goes wrong. I bet the audience was thrilled that they had that ticket for that night. Some of the most memorable shows I\u2019ve ever seen have had an element of upset. I remember the Gossip, playing upstairs at a tiny pub, many years ago, having the same issue as Madonna: they overran and the sound was cut. Beth Ditto came to the front of the stage and sang, a cappella, in pure defiance, a song called (Take Back) the Revolution. I\u2019ve seen thousands of shows and that remains one of the very best.</p> <p>You can\u2019t contrive it, either. I saw a play a couple of years ago in which the lead actors appeared to corpse, and it was genuinely delightful, until we realised days later that it was not genuine. We thought we were witnessing something fresh, off-script, spontaneous.</p> <p>When I talked to relatives who had seen the same play, the exact same thing had happened and they felt special too. It didn\u2019t matter on the night, but we\u2019d been had. Just like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo8DAE9eFgU\" title=\"\">Fleetwood Mac\u2019s arena shows</a> bringing Stevie and Lindsey together for a pointed reunion hug (when Lindsey was still there to be reunited with), it was all part of the script, after all.</p> <p>The Conservative commentator <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7T1eUHPft4g\" title=\"\">Iain Dale</a> went off-script on <em>Good Morning Britain</em> on Friday, when he decided not to stand his ground as he was being interrupted, but to storm off instead. \u201cOK, I won\u2019t speak,\u201d he said, when being talked over, like me during a domestic about washing up. I can\u2019t begin to process the irony of walking off a show now built entirely on talking over people \u2013 for being talked over. I realised then I only ever watch <em>Good Morning Britain</em> when something has gone wrong.

      "bodyText": "Madonna\u2019s Madame X era is the gift that keeps on giving. On Wednesday night, her residency at the London Palladium descended into the kind of chaos that turned it into one of those gigs you can only have dreamed of being at, like Bob Dylan at the Newport Folk Festival or the Sex Pistols at Manchester\u2019s Lesser Free Trade Hall. Madonna ran over the theatre\u2019s curfew by a few minutes, so the venue turned on the lights and closed the curtain. She then uploaded a video of it to Instagram, with a caption that began: \u201cArtists are here to disturb the peace\u201d and ended with: \u201cPower to the people!\u201d You can hear her protesting: \u201cFuck you motherfuckers! Censorship, censorship, motherfuckers censorship.\u201d If that doesn\u2019t open her next album, I\u2019ll eat my eyepatch. I love it when it all goes wrong. I bet the audience was thrilled that they had that ticket for that night. Some of the most memorable shows I\u2019ve ever seen have had an element of upset. I remember the Gossip, playing upstairs at a tiny pub, many years ago, having the same issue as Madonna: they overran and the sound was cut. Beth Ditto came to the front of the stage and sang, a cappella, in pure defiance, a song called (Take Back) the Revolution. I\u2019ve seen thousands of shows and that remains one of the very best. You can\u2019t contrive it, either. I saw a play a couple of years ago in which the lead actors appeared to corpse, and it was genuinely delightful, until we realised days later that it was not genuine. We thought we were witnessing something fresh, off-script, spontaneous. When I talked to relatives who had seen the same play, the exact same thing had happened and they felt special too. It didn\u2019t matter on the night, but we\u2019d been had. Just like Fleetwood Mac\u2019s arena shows bringing Stevie and Lindsey together for a pointed reunion hug (when Lindsey was still there to be reunited with), it was all part of the script, after all. The Conservative commentator Iain Dale went off-script on Good Morning Britain on Friday, when he decided not to stand his ground as he was being interrupted, but to storm off instead. \u201cOK, I won\u2019t speak,\u201d he said, when being talked over, like me during a domestic about washing up. I can\u2019t begin to process the irony of walking off a show now built entirely on talking over people \u2013 for being talked over. I realised then I only ever watch Good Morning Britain when something has gone wrong. In ratings terms, at least, wrong can so often be right.

      "body": "<p>A nine-year-old British child diagnosed with coronavirus is in hospital in France.</p> \n<p>The child is one of five Britons who tested positive for the virus. Another six UK nationals are being kept under observation in French hospitals.</p> \n<p>The group had been staying in two apartments in a ski chalet in the Haute-Savoie region in the eastern French Alps when they were visited by a Briton who had been in Singapore and was found to have the virus when he returned to the UK at the end of last month.</p> \n<p>The French health minister Agn\u00e8s Buzyn said none of the patients were in a serious condition. She described the new outbreak as a \u201ccluster, grouping around one original case\u201d.</p> \n<p>Jean-Yves Grall, the head of the regional health authority, told journalists the child lived in the ski resort with their parents and two siblings. The child\u2019s mother was in the UK taking exams and the children were with their father. The six other Britons were in a second apartment in the same chalet. He did not give details of where the visitor believed to have brought the virus from Singapore had stayed.</p> \n<p>The local health authority is disinfecting the building and is searching for anyone who might have come into contact with the group.</p> \n<p>Grall said the infected child had attended school in Les Contamines-Montjoie and had recently spent a day at a second school in the nearby town of Saint-Gervais-les-Bains.</p> \n<p>He said the schools would be shut next week as the authorities tried to determine with whom the child had come into contact.</p> \n<p>\u00c9tienne Jacquet, the mayor of Les Contamines-Montjoie, said: \u201cI was called by the regional health agency at 12.30am [on Saturday] about two British families. Seven were in one chalet and four in another. Of the 11 people, five have tested positive for the coronavirus.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u00c9douard Philippe, the French prime minister, called a meeting of health ministers on Saturday and the ministry has opened a UK hotline (0800 100 379) in an attempt to find out who else may have been in contact with the Britons.</p> \n<p>Buzyn said: \u201cWe\u2019re starting an important operation to identify cases of those in contact.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat original case was brought to our attention last night. It is a British national who had returned from Singapore where he had stayed between 20 and 23 January, and he arrived in France on 24 January for four days.\u201d</p> \n<p>As well as the five who tested positive for the virus, the others were being kept under surveillance in hospitals in Lyon, Saint Etienne and Grenoble.</p> \n<p>The Briton at the origin of the cluster returned to the UK on 28 January, a French health official said.</p> \n<p>Grenoble hospital said it was not authorised to give any more information.</p> \n<p>The local newspaper Le Dauphin\u00e9, reported that Marie-Charlotte Pasquier of the Les Contamines-Montjoie tourist office had spent the morning reassuring tourists in the resort. There has been no public announcement but the town hall has been distributing leaflets with advice on how to avoid transmitting coronavirus. Local doctors have sent a consignment of disinfectant and face masks to the town hall.</p> \n<p>Pasquier said: \u201cWe are in permanent contact with the local health authorities and have put in place a number where people can contact and ask questions and a doctor will reply. We are there to inform and reassure people.\u201d</p> \n<p>The latest outbreak brings the total number of people infected with the virus in France to 11. Health officials said some of the original six cases, who are being treated in hospital in Paris and Bordeaux, were ready to be released.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0a09a661-0ee2-41ea-b0a0-9e1deefd9268\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is Covid-19?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before.

Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill.

      "bodyText": "A nine-year-old British child diagnosed with coronavirus is in hospital in France. The child is one of five Britons who tested positive for the virus. Another six UK nationals are being kept under observation in French hospitals. The group had been staying in two apartments in a ski chalet in the Haute-Savoie region in the eastern French Alps when they were visited by a Briton who had been in Singapore and was found to have the virus when he returned to the UK at the end of last month. The French health minister Agn\u00e8s Buzyn said none of the patients were in a serious condition. She described the new outbreak as a \u201ccluster, grouping around one original case\u201d. Jean-Yves Grall, the head of the regional health authority, told journalists the child lived in the ski resort with their parents and two siblings. The child\u2019s mother was in the UK taking exams and the children were with their father. The six other Britons were in a second apartment in the same chalet. He did not give details of where the visitor believed to have brought the virus from Singapore had stayed. The local health authority is disinfecting the building and is searching for anyone who might have come into contact with the group. Grall said the infected child had attended school in Les Contamines-Montjoie and had recently spent a day at a second school in the nearby town of Saint-Gervais-les-Bains. He said the schools would be shut next week as the authorities tried to determine with whom the child had come into contact. \u00c9tienne Jacquet, the mayor of Les Contamines-Montjoie, said: \u201cI was called by the regional health agency at 12.30am [on Saturday] about two British families. Seven were in one chalet and four in another. Of the 11 people, five have tested positive for the coronavirus.\u201d \u00c9douard Philippe, the French prime minister, called a meeting of health ministers on Saturday and the ministry has opened a UK hotline (0800 100 379) in an attempt to find out who else may have been in contact with the Britons. Buzyn said: \u201cWe\u2019re starting an important operation to identify cases of those in contact. \u201cThat original case was brought to our attention last night. It is a British national who had returned from Singapore where he had stayed between 20 and 23 January, and he arrived in France on 24 January for four days.\u201d As well as the five who tested positive for the virus, the others were being kept under surveillance in hospitals in Lyon, Saint Etienne and Grenoble. The Briton at the origin of the cluster returned to the UK on 28 January, a French health official said. Grenoble hospital said it was not authorised to give any more information. The local newspaper Le Dauphin\u00e9, reported that Marie-Charlotte Pasquier of the Les Contamines-Montjoie tourist office had spent the morning reassuring tourists in the resort. There has been no public announcement but the town hall has been distributing leaflets with advice on how to avoid transmitting coronavirus. Local doctors have sent a consignment of disinfectant and face masks to the town hall. Pasquier said: \u201cWe are in permanent contact with the local health authorities and have put in place a number where people can contact and ask questions and a doctor will reply. We are there to inform and reassure people.\u201d The latest outbreak brings the total number of people infected with the virus in France to 11. Health officials said some of the original six cases, who are being treated in hospital in Paris and Bordeaux, were ready to be released. This Saturday is one of the busiest days of the year for French ski resorts because it is the start of school holidays in the Paris region. The February holidays in France begin on three consecutive Saturdays and are staggered over five weeks. At a newsagents shop in Les Contamines-Montjoie one resident said local people were worried. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the news but the disinformation that\u2019s worrying,\u201d she said. Other shops and hotels referred callers to the local town hall. Les Contamines-Montjoie, 75 minutes from Geneva and sitting between Chamonix and Meg\u00e8ve, has a population of about 1,160 people, which increases during the tourist season in winter. It is close to Mont Blanc and popular with mountaineers and skiiers. The word contamines does not mean \u201ccontaminated\u201d as some supposed on social media but \u201cploughable land on the squire\u2019s estate\u201d. Meanwhile, a student in Brighton has been told to self-isolate after a confirmed case of coronavirus, according to Sky News. The middle-aged man was the first British national to contract the virus after he travelled to the UK from Singapore. In a message sent to parents on Friday, Portslade Aldridge community academy (Paca) said: \u201cToday we have been contacted by a parent of a student at Paca who was contacted by Public Health England as part of their investigation concerning the confirmed case that was reported in the press yesterday. \u201cWe have been informed by the parent that they have been advised by Public Health England to self-isolate their child at home for 14 days. If at any point the child is found to be symptomatic we will be notified.\u201d Four members of a British family living in Mallorca are being tested for coronavirus after coming into contact with a person who recently tested positive for the virus in France. The Balearic Islands health department said the father of the family had gone to Mallorca\u2019s Son Espases hospital after feeling ill and was placed in isolation. His partner and their two daughters were being evaluated in the same hospital. The health department said it had activated its coronavirus protocol. \u201cIn accordance with professional guidelines, the man remains in isolation and all members of the family have been tested and the tests sent to a laboratory. All remain at the hospital,\u201d it said. The department urged people to remain calm while the tests were carried out and said it was working closely with Spain\u2019s health ministry. Spain confirmed its first case of the coronavirus on 31 January after a man was diagnosed on the remote La Gomera island in the Canaries. The patient is part of a group of five people in isolation and under observation on the island after it emerged they had come into contact with a German man diagnosed with the virus. US officials have announced that a 60-year-old citizen had become the first foreign victim of the coronavirus in China. A Japanese man also died in Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, having had symptoms consistent with the disease. A US embassy spokesman in Beijing told Reuters: \u201cWe offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss. Out of respect for the family\u2019s privacy, we have no further comment.\u201d A British man with the virus is said to be feeling well and in good spirits after being transferred from the cruise ship Diamond Princess to hospital in Japan. Alan Steele, of Wolverhampton, who was on honeymoon on the ship, was moved to hospital on Friday while his wife, Wendy Marshall Steele, remained onboard. She had been in telephone contact with her husband and said on Saturday that he was still feeling healthy. \u201cAlan is well, Japanese doctors are excellent,\u201d she posted on Facebook. \u201cHe is in a little room. Just doctor and nurse visit him.\u201d She said she was also doing well but had \u201ccabin fever\u201d as she continued to be confined to her room on the ship. There are nearly 3,700 other passengers and crew being quarantined on the ship. They have been offered access to mental health counselling and enhanced internet access. In a video posted on Twitter, Rai Caluori, the executive vice-president at Princess Cruises, said: \u201cWe recognise that a situation like this can create unprecedented stress, so we\u2019re also offering our guests and crew specialised telephonic mental health counselling if they should be experiencing such stress and mental health issues.\u201d",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Folha de S.Paulo newspaper reported that Brazil had refused to evacuate citizens from neighbouring South American nations including Argentina, Bolivia and Colombia.</p> \n<p>In the article, one Argentinian diplomat speculated the preference for the Poles was \u201cideological\u201d, with Bolsonaro favouring Poland\u2019s Christian nationalist government.</p> \n<p>Brazil\u2019s foreign office \u2013 led by minister Ernesto Ara\u00fajo, who believes climate change is a Marxist plot \u2013 refuted the claims saying there was not sufficient space and that Poland offered authorisation to refuel first.</p> \n<p>Brazil declared the coronavirus a public health emergency earlier this week.

The rescue comes after a video plea made to the far-right president Jair Bolsonaro last week. One of those in the video, Adrielly Eger, 18, a model, told the Band news network she was \u201cvery grateful\u201d. The 34 Brazilians, a mixed group of students, professionals, couples and children, should arrive at An\u00e1polis airbase, 150km from the capital Bras\u00edlia at 1am local time in an operation labelled Return to Homeland Brazil . They will be isolated in transit hotels on the airbase, which according to local media will have access to video games, internet and the opportunity to watch military bands play live outside. Roberto Naves, the mayor of An\u00e1polis, which is in the mid-western state of Goi\u00e1s, told local radio that residents of the city of 362,000 had first been apprehensive about hosting the evacuees but had no reason to worry. But in a note, Sandro Mabel, the president of Goi\u00e1s industry federation, called the quarantine a \u201cdisaster for the state\u201d, arguing that they should be hosted somewhere else. \u201cWe could suffer segregation of what is produced in Goi\u00e1s, affecting the export of processed products and meat, for example,\u201d he wrote. Ronaldo Caiado, Goi\u00e1s\u2019 conservative governor and a staunch Bolsonaro ally, told reporters that Mabel\u2019s comments were \u201cinhumane\u201d and called him a \u201cscoundrel\u201d. Also travelling on the two planes from Wuhan were four Poles and a Chinese national, who disembarked during refuelling in Warsaw, Poland. The Folha de S.Paulo newspaper reported that Brazil had refused to evacuate citizens from neighbouring South American nations including Argentina, Bolivia and Colombia. In the article, one Argentinian diplomat speculated the preference for the Poles was \u201cideological\u201d, with Bolsonaro favouring Poland\u2019s Christian nationalist government. Brazil\u2019s foreign office \u2013 led by minister Ernesto Ara\u00fajo, who believes climate change is a Marxist plot \u2013 refuted the claims saying there was not sufficient space and that Poland offered authorisation to refuel first. Brazil declared the coronavirus a public health emergency earlier this week. According to the health ministry, there are eight possible coronavirus cases being monitored, while 24 cases have been dismissed. The ministry has also been issuing regular online warnings about \u201cfake news\u201d relating to the virus, with one of the latest being that it is \u201csimilar to HIV\u201d and \u201cwas created in a lab\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Time, for all, passes slowly in detention on Christmas Island. But for the family of Tamil asylum seekers Nadesalingam and Priya, not the neatly delimited 14 days of quarantine before returning home. As Christmas Island detention centre\u2019s longest-standing residents, they face, still, an indefinite detention and an anxious wait on an uncertain future. For Nades, Priya, and their two Australian-born children Kopika, 4, and Tharunicaa, 2, it has been 23 months since they have seen home, in Biloela in Queensland. It\u2019s not known if they ever will again. On the 21st of this month, days after the last of the quarantined Wuhan evacuees are expected to leave, the family will still be on Christmas Island, and their case will come before the federal court. The case is, ostensibly, a decision on their youngest daughter Tharunicaa, whose claim to stay in Australia has never been assessed by the government or any court. The court hearing is not a reassessment of the merits of the family members\u2019 claims for protection, rather a judicial review of the process they have been subjected to. It is the family\u2019s final legal avenue. The family\u2019s life on Christmas Island is closely circumscribed. Guards are their ever-present companions. In the detention centre this week, Nades and Priya\u2019s family has not seen any of those brought from Wuhan and being held in isolation, simply more guards and more trucks. Twice a week, the family is brought out of the detention centre for a visit to Christmas Island\u2019s Recreation Centre, in the middle of the island. There, Kopika rides a small bicycle, Tharunicaa plays with a ball. Priya walks laps of the basketball court, while Nades sits. He speaks little. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for us,\u201d Priya says. \u201cEvery day is difficult. But I tell myself I have to be strong, for my children, and believe I will see our home in Biloela again. But some days are very hard.\u201d Kopika and Tharunicaa have little chance to see children their own age. Tharunicaa has spent more of her life in detention than out of it. \u201cWe are just ourselves, it is not good for the children. They miss having other children to play with. They miss their friends at home.\u201d Priya has not been to Sri Lanka in two decades, and has no family there any more. But the threat of a forced removal to that country remains a constant worry. \u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen to us. Some days it is very hard. I worry all the time. But I have to be strong, for them,\u201d she says pointing to her two girls. It is nearly two years since Border Force officials raided the family\u2019s Biloela home at dawn on 5 March 2018: the morning after Priya\u2019s bridging visa expired, and as she awaited a court hearing set to assess her case. The family was flown to a Melbourne detention centre, where they were asked to sign documents saying they would voluntarily leave the country. They then spent 17 months in a detention centre in Melbourne before they were loaded on a plane to be forcibly deported to Sri Lanka. But a mid-air court injunction, granted in the middle of the night as a plane flew them west towards Colombo, ordered them returned to Australia. They were taken from the plane in Darwin then sent to the Christmas Island detention centre in September, which had been mothballed but then reopened, to great fanfare and at significant expense. For months before the outbreak of coronavirus and the designation of the detention as a quarantine site, Nades, Priya and the two girls were the only residents of the massive, sprawling centre, at the far-distant north-west point of the remote island. The government employed 109 staff, at a cost of $26.8m, to keep them there. The United Nations has called for their release from detention, as have Australia\u2019s children\u2019s commissioner and human rights commissioner, but these entreaties have been ignored by the Australian government. Kokilapathmapriya Nadesalingam \u2013 Priya \u2013 had fled Sri Lanka at the height of the violence of that country\u2019s brutal civil war. With her family, she escaped to southern India in 2000. But India is not a party to the refugee convention and exerts intense pressure on Sri Lankan Tamils to return, despite continued persecution of the ethnic minority there, the militarisation of the Tamil-majority north, and Sri Lanka\u2019s unhealed wound of thousands of people still missing. From limited options Priya chose Australia, arriving by boat in 2013. Nadesalingam Murugappan \u2013 Nades \u2013 had arrived in Australia a year earlier, in 2012, leaving the uncertainty and upheaval of the end of the war. Nades fled, he says, fearing persecution because of his links \u2013 as many Tamil men had \u2013 to the former separatist army, since defeated, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Former cadre continue to face persecution in Sri Lanka, international observers such as the UN and Amnesty say, and the head of the army at the conclusion of the war, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, has just been elected president. In Australia, Nades and Priya met, married and built a life together. Their daughters were born in 2015 and 2017. Priya has consistently maintained her assessment \u2013 her single chance to present her claim for protection \u2013 was flawed and didn\u2019t allow her to present the full facts of her case. Sitting in the Anglicare office in Biloela, Priya was eight months pregnant when she was interviewed by the department over the phone in February 2017. The previous day she had been in hospital with a migraine. Connections in the three-way call \u2013 between Priya, her migration agent and the department \u2013 repeatedly dropped out. Transcripts show key elements of the conversation, including evidence around torture, were not heard by some parties. Lawyers have also raised concerns that the family had to apply for protection without legal assistance, navigating the complex procedures and detailed forms in a foreign language both were only learning at the time. But under Australia\u2019s controversial fast-track assessment system introduced in 2014 (but applying to boat arrivals from 2012), there is essentially only one chance for an asylum seeker to make their claim. A claim can\u2019t be revisited because of accidental omission, error, changed circumstances, or the emergence of relevant new information. The government has been resolute. The minister and department have consistently maintained that the family\u2019s claim for protection was reasonably determined and they could not be offered protection. \u201cThis family\u2019s case has been comprehensively assessed, over many years, by the department, various tribunals, and courts,\u201d the Department of Home Affairs has said. \u201cThey have consistently been found not to meet Australia\u2019s protection obligations.\u201d An application for ministerial intervention was denied by the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton. \u201cThey didn\u2019t come to the country in the appropriate way, they have not been found to have an asylum claim,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to have changed our policy on this, or to exercise intervention powers on this, would be to send exactly the wrong message to those who are looking to sell tickets to vulnerable people looking to get on boats.\u201d In spite of the government\u2019s unswerving position, the family\u2019s many allies continue to argue the moral case, that a family that had made a life in Australia, seen children born, friendships formed, and a life established, should be granted Australia\u2019s assistance.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine.

French officials said the British national \u2013 reported to be a middle-aged man from Brighton \u2013 arrived in the resort of Contamines-Montjoie, near Mont Blanc, on 24 January and returned to England on 28 January. The conference at the Grand Hyatt hotel in Singapore, held earlier in January, is believed to have been attended by 15 people from Singapore and 94 foreigners, and hosted by a multinational company. The Singaporean evening daily paper Lianhe Wanbao named the company as UK firm Servomex, a global gas analysis company with offices in Europe and Asia. Malaysian health authorities first revealed the virus\u2019s link to the conference when they confirmed the case of a 41-year-old Malaysian who had attended it alongside colleagues from China, according to the New Straits Times.
