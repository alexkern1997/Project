      "bodyText": "More than 3,000 customers owed money by the failed replica-furniture chain Matt Blatt are set to receive nothing, even though the company reaped more than $4.4m by selling assets in the weeks leading to its collapse. Customers, some of whom are owed more than $1,000, were informed of the collapse by text message a fortnight ago. The company that owned the Matt Blatt brand, Badam Trading Co, is now in the hands of liquidator David Solomons of Sydney firm dVT Group. Badam\u2019s director, Adam Drexler, closed the company\u2019s 12 stores in late March as the coronavirus crisis gripped Australia, deepening the woes of an already struggling retail sector. In April, Badam went on to sell off warehouse stock through auction website Grays Online. Online retailer Kogan announced it had \u201cacquired Matt Blatt\u201d on 15 May for $4.4m, but a Kogan spokesman told Guardian Australia that in fact it \u201cacquired some intellectual property from the prior owners\u201d. Documents filed with the corporate regulator show that Drexler appointed Solomons as liquidator the following Friday, 22 May. It is believed Solomons will now investigate both the sale of stock through Grays Online and the sale of the intellectual property to Kogan. Company documents show another company controlled by Drexler, Badam Holdings, loaned money to Badam. The documents show that of a total of $11m owed to creditors at the point of collapse, more than $4m was owed to Badam Holdings. Staff were owed $600,000 and the tax office about $1m. In the documents, Drexler estimated the company had realisable assets of just $500,000. He could not be reached for comment through his business adviser, Les Szekely. Solomons did not respond to emails and phone calls to dVT\u2019s Sydney office. In 2016, he and another dVT partner, Riad Tayeh, admitted they had failed to lodge documents and publish notices as required by law \u2013 actions the Australian Securities and Investments Commission described at the time as \u201cbasic obligations\u201d of insolvency professionals. They entered into voluntary undertakings with Asic to engage an expert to train dVT staff on \u201can improved compliance culture\u201d and each hired a second expert to review three of their case files. Solomons and Tayeh have also been embroiled in a complex legal stoush with the federal department of employment, which administers a scheme that pays workers\u2019 entitlements when companies go bust, over their stewardship of a drilling company, Damilcrest. A Kogan spokesman said the company bought \u201csome intellectual property from the prior owners following a competitive sale process involving multiple parties which was conducted by the prior owners and their advisers\u201d. \u201cSome time after the acquisition, we were notified that one of the prior owners of Matt Blatt has gone into liquidation. Any customers who purchased from the prior owners are being advised to contact the liquidator with their enquiries, and we are assisting customers in doing so.\u201d",

Basketball, or entertainment period, isn\u2019t needed at this moment, and will only be a distraction. Sure it might not distract us the players, but we have resources at hand majority of our community don\u2019t have. And the smallest distraction for them, can start a trickle down effect that may never stop. Especially with the way the climate is now. I would love nothing more than to win my very first NBA Championship. But the unity of My People would be an even bigger Championship, that\u2019s just to (sic) beautiful to pass up. What better time than now for us to be focusing on our families. This is a rare opportunity that, I believe, we as a community should be taking full advantage of. When have we ever had this amount of time to sit and be with our families. This is where our Unity starts. At home! With Family!! European Colonization stripped us of our rich history, and we have yet to sit down and figure us out. The less distractions, the more we can put into action into rediscovering ourselves.

Los Angeles Lakers center Dwight Howard says he believes the NBA and other forms of entertainment are unnecessary distractions from the nationwide protest movement that is entering its fourth week following the death of George Floyd. I agree with Kyrie (Irving). Basketball, or entertainment period, isn\u2019t needed at this moment, and will only be a distraction. Sure it might not distract us the players, but we have resources at hand majority of our community don\u2019t have. And the smallest distraction for them, can start a trickle down effect that may never stop. Especially with the way the climate is now. I would love nothing more than to win my very first NBA Championship. But the unity of My People would be an even bigger Championship, that\u2019s just to (sic) beautiful to pass up. What better time than now for us to be focusing on our families. This is a rare opportunity that, I believe, we as a community should be taking full advantage of. When have we ever had this amount of time to sit and be with our families. This is where our Unity starts. At home! With Family!! European Colonization stripped us of our rich history, and we have yet to sit down and figure us out. The less distractions, the more we can put into action into rediscovering ourselves. Nations come out of families. Black/African American is not a Nation or Nationality. It\u2019s time Our Families became their own Nations. No Basketball till we get things resolved. The NBA is set to become the first major North American sports league to make a return to action when it resumes its season on 31 July at ESPN\u2019s Wide World of Sports Complex in Orlando, Florida. Hundreds of anti-racism demonstrators took to the streets of Palmdale in southern California on Saturday to demand a full investigation into the death of a 24-year-old black man found hanging from a tree near city hall. While the sheriff\u2019s department said the initial results of a coroner\u2019s investigation indicate Fuller\u2019s death was a suicide, the protesters who gathered on Saturday described it a \u201clynching\u201d and called on the state to investigate. Community members had confronted city officials at a contentious news briefing Friday, asking why they were quick to label Fuller\u2019s death on Wednesday a suicide and demanding an independent autopsy. On Saturday, protesters marched from the park where Fuller was found to the Los Angeles county sheriff\u2019s station, demanding a full investigation into the man\u2019s death. Many carried signs that said \u201cJustice for Robert Fuller\u201d. Fuller\u2019s sister addressed the crowd near Palmdale\u2019s city hall. \u201cWe want to find out the truth on what really happened,\u201d Diamond Alexander said, according to the LATimes. \u201cWe just want the truth. My brother was not suicidal. He was a survivor. He was street smart.\u201d Sheriff\u2019s Capt Ron Shaffer said homicide detectives were investigating the circumstances leading to Fuller\u2019s death to determine if foul play was involved. Investigators have been in contact with Fuller\u2019s family, Palmdale officials said. The city said there were no outdoor cameras that could have recorded what happened. Former Atlanta police chief Erika Shields, who has resigned in the wake of Friday night\u2019s fatal shooting of Rayshard Brooks, has issued a statement: For more than two decades, I have served alongside some of the finest men and women in the Atlanta Police Department. Out of a deep and abiding love for this City and this department, I offered to step aside as police chief. APD has my full support, and Mayor Bottoms has my support on the future direction of this department. I have faith in the Mayor, and it is time for the city to move forward and build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. Several hundred protesters gathered at West 135th street and St Nicholas Avenue in Harlem this afternoon in what was advertised as a march to demand New York City mayor Bill de Blasio reinstate habeas corpus: the right of a detainee to be seen by a judge within 24 hours to determine whether the arrest was lawful. This constitutional right was controversially suspended by a state supreme court judge last week amid mass arrests during protests against police brutality. But it was so much more. We heard an emotionally raw, urgent speech by Hawah Bah, the mother of Mohamed Bah, a 28-year-old immigrant from Guinea who was shot and killed inside his Harlem apartment by police officers in September 2012, after she\u2019d called an ambulance to help her mentally distressed son. \u201cWhen I heard George Floyd call for his mama, I felt it,\u201d a tearful Bah said. \u201cIf they can kill a baby in front of his mother, that is not freedom. Stay on the streets until we have our rights.\u201d This was also partly a grassroots political rally for Kristin Richardson Jordan, a poet and educator who is seeking to become the first openly black gay woman to be elected to the New York City council. \u201cI\u2019m on a mission to disrupt this district with radical love,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cWe want NYPD out of our schools, off our trains. ... In Harlem, black lives will matter.\u201d Anger towards the NYPD was prevalent during the rally including those particularly contentious moments when protestors chanted: \u201cHow do you spell racist? N-Y-P-D!\u201d and \u201cNo justice, no peace, fuck the racist ass police!\u201d at a line of cops stood in front of the 32th precinct. Moments later, Marvin Gaye\u2019s What\u2019s Going On, considered both a protest and love song, blasted out from the boom box that accompanied protesters south towards Frederick Douglass Circle Plaza, situated opposite the northwest corner of Central Park. The chief of Atlanta\u2019s police department has stepped down less than 24 hours after a black man was killed in a late-night struggle with officers after he failed a field sobriety test and resisted arrest. Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said during a news conference on Saturday afternoon that she had accepted the resignation of police chief Erika Shields. \u201cI do not believe that this was a justified use of deadly force and have called for the immediate termination of the officer,\u201d Bottoms said. \u201cWhat has become abundantly over the last couple of weeks in Atlanta is that while we have a police force full of men and women who work alongside our communities with honor, respect and dignity, there has a been a disconnect with what our expectations are and should be as it relates to interactions with our officers and the communities in which they are entrusted to protect.\u201d Police were called to the restaurant on a complaint that a man was sleeping in a car blocking the drive-thru lane as customers waited in line, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said. The agency identified the man who was fatally shot as 27-year-old Rayshard Brooks. A crowd of demonstrators gathered Saturday outside the restaurant where Brooks was shot. Gerald Griggs, an attorney and a vice president of Atlanta\u2019s NAACP chapter, estimated there were 150 people protesting at the scene as he walked with them Saturday afternoon. \u201cThe people are upset,\u201d Griggs said. \u201cThey want to know why their dear brother Rayshard Brooks was shot and killed when he was merely asleep on the passenger side and not doing anything.\u201d The AP reports from New Orleans where bars are letting in customers on Saturday for the first time in three months amid an atmosphere of uncertainty for owners: Capacity is limited to 25 percent, live music remains prohibited, and nobody knows how many tourists will show on Bourbon Street in the age of COVID-19. Pam Fortner, owner of six French Quarter venues, is opening only two of them, both on Bourbon, where the customary blocks-long frat party atmosphere ended in an abrupt shutdown in mid-March. Now, she\u2019s not sure what to expect. She sat at a sidewalk table at Royal and St. Ann on Thursday, eating a Caesar salad and deriving hope from the occasional out-of-state license plate she saw amid sparse traffic. \u201cI think Saturday will be busy,\u201d she said in an interview. Cherie Boos, manager of Lafitte\u2019s Blacksmith Shop, in an authentically rustic, creaky floored 18th-century Creole cottage, said she\u2019s hoping locals will help keep the bar financially afloat as Bourbon Street revives. But she adds, \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that, you know, we can start generating some tourists in the city, too, now that the bars are going to be open.\u201d Bourbon Street, which had the ambiance of an empty movie set in April, has experienced a slow re-awakening in recent weeks. Dine-in restaurants have been allowed to reopen at 25% capacity, as have bars with food permits. Still, traffic has been slow and plywood covered numerous tavern windows until Mayor LaToya Cantrell announced the latest easing of restrictions in a city that, in the spring, had become an international hot spot for COVID-19. Even as they announced the reopenings on Tuesday, city officials admitted they were concerned about a possible recurrence. \u201cOh, I\u2019m worried. I am worried,\u201d Cantrell said at a news conference. She said city code enforcement officials will watch to make sure social distancing, masking requirements and building capacity limits are enforced. Fox News has removed digitally altered photos from its website after the Seattle Times noted misleading images used in the network\u2019s coverage about the city\u2019s Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ), which has become a protest center against police brutality and racial injustice. As part of a package of stories Friday about the zone, where demonstrators have taken over several city blocks on Capitol Hill after Seattle police abandoned the East Precinct, Fox\u2019s website for much of the day featured a photo of a man standing with a military-style rifle in front of what appeared to be a smashed retail storefront. The image was actually a mashup of photos from different days, taken by different photographers \u2014 it was done by splicing a Getty Images photo of an armed man, who had been at the protest zone June 10, with other images from May 30 of smashed windows in downtown Seattle. Another altered image combined the gunman photo with yet another image, making it appear as though he was standing in front of a sign declaring \u201cYou are now entering Free Cap Hill.\u201d Fox\u2019s site had no disclaimers revealing the photos had been manipulated. The network removed the images after inquiries from The Seattle Times. In addition, Fox\u2019s site for a time on Friday ran a frightening image of a burning city, above a package of stories about Seattle\u2019s protests, headlined \u201cCRAZY TOWN.\u201d The photo actually showed a scene from St. Paul, Minnesota, on May 30. That image also was later removed. When asked by the Times about the clear breach of journalistic ethics, a Fox News spokeswoman said: \u201cWe have replaced our photo illustration with the clearly delineated images of a gunman and a shattered storefront, both of which were taken this week in Seattle\u2019s autonomous zone.\u201d The chairman of the New York chapter of Black Lives Matter has said Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden \u201cwould be an idiot\u201d to select two-term Florida congresswoman Val Demings, the two-term Florida congresswoman and former Orlando police chief, as his running mate. \u201cJoe Biden would be an idiot to put her on his ticket. People are already on the fence about him,\u201d the group\u2019s Hawk Newsome, told the New York Post. \u201cWhen black people become police officers, they are no longer black. They are blue. And I have been told this by numerous officers,\u201d the BLM official said that California senator Kamala Harris should also be disqualified after serving as San Francisco district attorney and the state\u2019s attorney general. Demings, 63, is reportedly one of six female Democrats to have passed an initial round of vetting by Biden\u2019s vice presidential search committee and has submitted documents for review. The former police chief is believed to be on a shortlist that includes Harris, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, former national security adviser Susan Rice, New Mexico governor Michelle Lujan Grisham and Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. Demings worked as a uniformed patrol detective, information officer and internal affairs supervisor during her 27 years on the force, walking away in 2007 to lead the 700-strong Orlando police force before retiring four years later. But during her time as police chief, the department was involved in a series of excessive-force controversies, including in 2010 when a department officer was involved in the injury of an 84-year-old second world war veteran who had complained about his car being towed. An internal review cleared Travis Lamont of wrongdoing with Demings telling the Palm Beach Post at the time: \u201cAfter review of the defensive tactic \u2026 by the training staff and Officer Lamont\u2019s chain of command, it appears the officer performed the technique within department guidelines.\u201d A year later, another officer pushed a woman to the ground during a scuffle, breaking her teeth. After that incident, which was captured on video, Demings wrote an op-ed to the Orlando Sentinel: \u201cLooking for a negative story in a police department is like looking for a prayer at church,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI believe a reasonable person also understands that a few seconds (even on video) rarely capture the entire set of circumstances.\u201d Police in South Carolina have released body camera footage of officers fatally shooting a handcuffed black man they said was wielding a gun in a Walmart parking lot. The Associated Press reports: Ariane Lamont McCree, 28, was shot and killed by police in November outside a Chester Walmart. He was handcuffed at the time of the shooting after being detained on suspicion of shoplifting. The South Carolina attorney general\u2019s office said in a March news release that the officers acted in self-defense and that McCree pulled a gun on police as he was fleeing the shoplifting arrest. The Post and Courier reported that the video released to news outlets shows an officer with his gun drawn approaching the suspect from across the parking lot. The video also shows officers later removing a gun from the suspect\u2019s body. Mullins McLeod, a Charleston attorney who has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the police department on behalf of McCree\u2019s family, has said there is no way McCree could have aimed a gun at officers with his hands cuffed behind his back, the newspaper reported. Police and McCree\u2019s family gave different interpretations of the video. The fatal shooting prompted protests in the small South Carolina city. At a news conference in Chester on Friday, McCree\u2019s family maintained the video shows that the handcuffed man was not a threat to officers, the newspaper reported. They criticized officials for waiting more than six months to release the video. Charlie Stringfellow, McCree\u2019s grandfather, took issue with the use of force after an alleged shoplifting incident. \u201cIf it\u2019s true, it\u2019s not worth his life,\u201d Stringfellow said. Kentucky governor Andy Beshear, who has led a push to take down a statue of Jefferson Davis at the state capitol, finished the job on Saturday with a push of a button. The Louisville Courier-Journal reports: The South has lost again. Jefferson Davis and his legacy departed Kentucky\u2019s Capitol rotunda after a 12-foot marble statue commemorating the lone president of the Confederate States of America was removed from its base Saturday morning. Workers assembled a rig that lifted the 5-ton marble sculpture off the pedestal where it stood for 84 years \u2013 just a few feet behind the bronze statue of fellow Kentuckian Abraham Lincoln. Gov. Andy Beshear, who joined workers in the rotunda on Saturday, said the monument represented a divisive symbol in Kentucky. \u201cAfter calling for its removal and urging the Historic Properties Advisory Commission to act, today I pressed the button to bring it down,\u201d Beshear tweeted. \u201cNow, every child who walks into their Capitol feels welcome. Today we took a step forward for the betterment of every single Kentuckian.\u201d It\u2019s been somewhat of a bearish week for the legacy of the first and only president of the CSA. A different Davis statue was toppled by protesters on Wednesday night in Richmond, which had been the capital of the Confederacy until it was captured in the later stages of the war. A relative of Rayshard Brooks, the African American man shot dead by police in Atlanta last night, has spoken about his grief and shock at the killing. Decatur Redd spoke to reporters and a crowd that had gathered outside the Wendy\u2019s where the 27-year-old Brooks was shot on Friday after police were called to reports of a man who had fallen asleep in his vehicle. \u201cI\u2019ve watched this on the internet, from the whole George Floyd situation to us coming together like we\u2019re doing and this whole thing landed on my doorstep with my little cousin,\u201d Redd said. The George Bureau of Investigation and the country district attorney\u2019s office are looking into the death. \u201cWe\u2019ve been watching this happen for so many years, with young black boys around the country just dying in vain \u2013 I just don\u2019t want that to continue and keep happening like that,\u201d Redd said. Redd added that he was shocked the incident had happened in Atlanta. \u201cI didn\u2019t think it would hit right here, man. I thought this city was better than that. They\u2019ve got to answer. Somebody\u2019s gotta say something,\u201d Redd said, \u201cWe need to at least know that the city is with us.\u201d Director Ava DuVernay has endorsed a petition calling for Edmund Pettus Bridge in Montgomery, Alabama to be renamed the \u201cJohn Lewis Bridge for Freedom\u201d. The bridge was the location of the Bloody Sunday beatings by police of marchers campaigning for voting rights in 1965. The episode featured in DuVernay\u2019s Oscar-nominated 2014 film, Selma. Pettus was an Alabama senator and Klu Klux Klan Grand Wizard, while John Lewis is a veteran US politician and civil rights leader. \u201cI\u2019ve just signed a petition about this bridge to dignity as seen in SELMA. It is named after a KKK grand wizard and confederate warlord,\u201d wrote DuVernay on Twitter. \u201cEdmund Pettus Bridge should be the John Lewis Bridge. Named for a hero. Not a murderer. Join this call. It\u2019s past due.\u201d The Georgia Bureau of Investigation have confirmed that the man police shot dead last night in Atlanta on Friday night was African American. Rayshard Brooks was 27. Stacey Abrams, who ran for Georgia governor in 2018, called for accountability over Brooks\u2019s death in a tweet on Saturday afternoon. \u201cThe killing of #RayshardBrooks in Atlanta last night demands we severely restrict the use of deadly force,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYes, investigations must be called for \u2013 but so too should accountability. Sleeping in a drive-thru must not end in death.\u201d Both the GBI and the Fulton county district attorney\u2019s office are investigating Brooks\u2019s death, which happened after police were called to reports that a man had fallen asleep at a fast food restaurant drive-through. The GBI says there was a struggle when police attempted to take Brooks into custody and he was shot and killed. \u201cIt has also been reported that the male subject was shot by an officer in the struggle over [a] Taser,\u201d the GBI said in a statement. From Philadelphia, meanwhile, comes footage of a protest near the site of the 1985 Move bombing, a notorious event in which 11 people including five children died and a neighborhood burned down after police carried out an airstrike against a black liberation group. Frank Rizzo was a notoriously racist mayor and police commissioner of Philadelphia. Earlier this month, his statue outside City Hall was first defaced and then removed. Ed Pilkington, Guardian US chief reporter, has written extensively about the Move bombing, \u201cone of the great, largely forgotten, outrages of modern America\u201d, and the group it targeted. Here\u2019s Ed\u2019s retelling of the bombing, from May this year, which begins with Frank Powell, a Philadelphia police officer who in 1985 was chief of the city\u2019s bomb disposal squad, remembering vividly the moment he was told to carry out the aerial attack. \u201cWow,\u201d he recalls thinking. \u201cYou want me to do that?\u201d Joe Biden has been tweeting, first about the \u201cbattle for the soul of this nation\u201d which he will fight against Donald Trump at the polls, chaotic as they may be, in November. \u201cIf we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House,\u201d the presumptive Democratic nominee writes, \u201che will fundamentally alter the character of this nation. We can\u2019t let that happen.\u201d Biden also says: \u201cWe need a national ban on chokeholds. Now.\u201d It\u2019s a reference to police arrest techniques at the heart of a number of recent deaths of unarmed African American men, including George Floyd, whose killing in Minneapolis last month touched off lasting protest and civil unrest. By way of comparison, here\u2019s what Trump said about chokeholds yesterday, in an interview with Fox News: \u201cI think the concept of chokeholds sounds so innocent and so perfect \u2026 [but] you have to be careful. With that being said, it would be, I think, a very good thing that, generally speaking, it should be ended.\u201d The Fulton county district attorney\u2019s office has opened an investigation into an incident in which Atlanta police shot and killed a man on Friday night. Police responded to reports that a man had fallen asleep in his car at a Wendy\u2019s drive-thru and was blocking traffic. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) says the man was shot and killed after police tried to take him into custody. One report says the man tried to grab a police taser. The GBI is conducting its own investigation. Unverified reports on social media say the man who died was black. From what we know of the case so far, there are some similarities to the death of Willie McCoy in California last year: Athletes at the University of Texas have asked the school song to be changed along with the names of buildings on campus. \u201cThe recent events across the country regarding racial injustice have brought to light the systemic racism that has always been prevalent in our country as well as the racism that has historically plagued our campus,\u201d the athletes said in a statement. The students want to see buildings named after figures associated with the confederacy or racism redubbed. They also want a change of the school song, Eyes Of Texas, as it once appeared in minstrel shows where blackface was performed. One building, Robert Lee Moore Hall is named after a teacher at the university from 1920 to 1969, who refused for many years to teach black students. Assa Traore, the sister of Adama Traore, who died while in police custody in France in 2016 has addressed protesters in Paris. \u201cThe death of George Floyd has a strong echo in the death in France of my little brother,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in the United States is happening in France. Our brothers are dying.\u201d Traore\u2019s family say he died after three police officers held him down, while authorities in France say the cause of death is unclear. Thousands of people attended anti-racism protests in France on Saturday. The demonstrations were largely peaceful, although police fired tear gas at one point as skirmishes broke out. Meanwhile, in the UK, rightwing protesters \u2013 some shouting \u201cwe are racist\u201d \u2013 clashed with police in London. The protesters claimed they were protecting monuments from vandalism. The UK home secretary, Priti Patel, condemned the protests as \u201cthuggery\u201d. \u201cThoroughly unacceptable thuggery. Any perpetrators of violence or vandalism should expect to face the full force of the law. Violence towards our police officers will not be tolerated,\u201d said Patel on Twitter. US embassies around the world have been the sites of protests over the last few weeks, but on Saturday the embassy in South Korea tweeted in solidarity with Black Lives Matter. \u201cThe US Embassy stands in solidarity with fellow Americans grieving and peacefully protesting to demand positive change,\u201d wrote the Seoul embassy on its Twitter account. \u201cOur #BlackLivesMatter banner shows our support for the fight against racial injustice and police brutality as we strive to be a more inclusive &amp; just society.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo has said that local governments in the state must redesign their police forces by 1 April next year or they will not receive funding. The statement comes in the wake of protests of police killings of African Americans. \u201cIf you don\u2019t do it, local government, you won\u2019t get any state funding, period,\u201d he said in a press briefing on Saturday. \u201cWe heard you \u2026 we agree with you protesters.. now tell us what the police force should look like,\u201d he added. Cuomo also said that 32 people had died from coronavirus in New York over the last 24 hours, the lowest total since the start of the pandemic. A high-ranking ABC News executive, Barbara Fedida, has been placed on administrative leave after a story was published today by HuffPost detailing allegations of racist and inappropriate statements. According to the report by Yashar Ali, Fedida made a racist remark during contract negotiations with Good Morning America anchor Robin Roberts, who is black. During the negotiations, one source who was in the room claims that Fedida, who was the network\u2019s head of talent, said ABC was not asking Roberts \u201cto pick cotton.\u201d She also is said to have described a black contributor as \u201clow rent\u201d. According to Ali, Fedida had been the subject of dozens of complaints from workers at ABC News, and the network has paid out millions of dollars in settlements to former staff over her behaviour. She is also said to have stifled job opportunities for black members of staff. \u201cThere are deeply disturbing allegations in this story that we need to investigate, and we have placed Barbara Fedida on administrative leave while we conduct a thorough and complete investigation,\u201d ABC News said in the wake of Ali\u2019s story. \u201cThese allegations do not represent the values and culture of ABC News, where we strive to make everyone feel respected in a thriving, diverse and inclusive workplace.\u201d In an statement issued through her attorney, Fedida described the allegations as \u201cmisleading\u201d. \u201cThroughout my career, I have been a champion for increased diversity in network news,\u201d read the statement. \u201cBuilding a news division where everyone can thrive has been my life\u2019s mission. I am proud of my decades of work of hiring, supporting and promoting talented journalists of color. And, unlike these heartbreaking and incredibly misleading claims about me, that track record is well-documented and undeniable.\u201d A group called Republican Voters Against Trump have highlighted South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham\u2019s somewhat ... contradictory statements on the president. The video starts with an interview from Graham in 2015 in which he says of Trump: \u201cHe\u2019s a race baiting, xenophobic religious bigot,\u201d before adding: \u201cYou know how you make America great again? Tell Donald Trump to go to hell.\u201d Graham is then seen in another video from 2015 saying that \u201cif you can\u2019t admire Joe Biden as a person, you\u2019ve got a problem. You need to do some self-evaluation, \u2018cause, what\u2019s not to like?\u201d Biden is the presumptive Democratic candidate for this year\u2019s presidential election. Graham is up for reelection in November for the Senate, where he will face off against Democrat Jaime Harrison. Graham has faced criticism from Republicans and Democrats for switching from a vocal critic of Trump to one of his most loyal supporters. The Houston Police Department has relieved one of its members of their duties after the officer wrote a post on social media with \u201cracial undertones\u201d. In the since deleted post, the officer blamed the black community for its own problems. ABC13 reported the officer had been a member of the HPD for 25 years. The president of the Houston Police Officers\u2019 Union, Joe Gamaldi, condemned the post on Twitter. \u201cI am aware of a post circulating that is reported to come from one of our officers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt is is vile, it is is disgusting, I know it is under investigation but I am confident the @houstonpolice department will act swiftly. This is not who we are as Houston Police Officers.\u201d Trump ends his address by saying that \u201cAmerica will always prevail\u201d and thanking the graduating class. He is greeted with polite applause by the graduates after he ends his speech. There was little of the freewheeling you see from Trump at rallies and press conferences and he appeared to stick to the script. There was only a passing reference to the unrest that has roiled the country recently. Trump outlines his isolationist message by telling the graduates that the US is not \u201cthe policeman of the world\u201d but says if \u201cour people are threatened, we will never hesitate to act\u201d. He adds that his administration has embarked on a \u201ccolossal\u201d rebuilding of the armed forces after it was depleted by \u201cendless wars\u201d. He also returns to one of his pet projects, saying that the new Space Force is a \u201cbig deal\u201d. Trump then pays tribute to CJ Morgan, a member of the graduating class killed in a training accident. As the president gives his speech protesters have gathered outside West Point: Trump congratulates the Army football team for ending arch-rivals Navy\u2019s winning streak, which draws a big cheer from the graduates. Trump mentions how the army has helped win the battle against slavery and communism, and helped protect civil rights (although some West Point graduates fought for the Confederacy in the civil war). Trump asks the cadets to stand and applaud their parents and families, which they do. The president then brings in some politics, repeating an old, unproven claim as he thanks the military for helping fight Covid-19, a virus \u201cthat came from a foreign land called China\u201d. The superintendent of the US Military Academy, Darryl A Williams, stands to make his address. He shares a stage with Trump \u2013 everyone on the platform with the president has been tested for Covid-19. He then introduces Trump. The president congratulates the class on graduating, and talks about the achievements of the US army down the years. It\u2019s usual Trump language with plenty of talk of large weapons and enemies who have been sent through the \u201cgates of hell\u201d. He thanks the graduates for answering \u201ctheir nation\u2019s call\u201d. The West Point band plays some musical with a few speeches peppered in between. There are a few references to the army being open to all communities and races, possibly a reference to the recent protests. But they mainly pay tribute to the military \u2013 and America \u2013 as a whole. Donald Trump has arrived at West Point amid a 21-gun salute. He will soon address the more than 1,000 graduates at the United States Military Academy. It\u2019s a beautiful morning in New York state and the ceremony will take place outside, with the graduates sat 6ft apart. A lawyer for the family of George Floyd says they will file a civil lawsuit against Derek Chauvin, the police officer who knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck in the minutes leading up to his death. \u201c[Floyd\u2019s family] intends on holding Derek Chauvin fully accountable in every aspect, criminal and civil,\u201d Benjamin Crump told CNN on Saturday. Chauvin is also facing a second-degree murder charge over the killing of Floyd last month. CNN reports that Chauvin could still receive more than $1m in pension payments even if he is convicted. Crump also said that problems in Minneapolis went far beyond Chauvin. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just the knee of Derek Chauvin that killed George Floyd in Minneapolis, it was the knee of the entire police department,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause when you have that kind of culture and behavior of a police department, it is foreseeable that something like this is going to happen.\u201d At West Point this morning Donald Trump will deliver a speech controversial by its very occurrence and due to tensions between the president and leaders of the US armed forces. With New York state only beginning its reopening after the coronavirus outbreak, Trump will address graduates at the United States Military Academy, 40 miles up the Hudson river from New York City. The city has been a global hotspot for Covid-19, recording more than 213,000 cases and more than 21,000 deaths. Across the US, graduation ceremonies and commencement speeches have taken place online. But the 1,100 graduating cadets at West Point, who had been at home since early March, just before lockdowns began, were brought back to campus late last month. They immediately underwent coronavirus testing and more than 15 who tested positive were isolated for two weeks before rejoining their classmates. Some have decried the decision to bring the graduating second lieutenants back to campus to hear the president speak during a public health crisis. A group called Veterans For Peace announced a protest outside West Point\u2019s main gate on Saturday, against what it called \u201cTrump\u2019s dangerous narcissistic Photo-Op Stunt at the West Point Graduation\u201d. Further strain has been placed on what would normally be one of the showpiece events of US public life by Trump\u2019s pronouncements and actions in regard to widespread civil unrest over the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. The president both threatened to use active duty troops against protesters and staged a controversial photo op at St John\u2019s church, near the White House, before which peaceful demonstrators were teargassed and attacked by federal officers. Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the defense secretary, Mark Esper, joined Trump on his walk to the church. Both have said they should not have done so. A pertinent story coming out of Atlanta as protests continue over, among other things, police killings in the United States. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) is looking into an incident during which Atlanta police shot and killed a man. Police responded to a report that a man was asleep in a car and blocking traffic at a Wendy\u2019s drive-thru. The GBI says there was a struggle when police attempted to take the man into custody and he was shot and killed. \u201cIt has also been reported that the male subject was shot by an officer in the struggle over [a] Taser,\u201d the GBI said in a statement. A small crowd gathered at the site of the shooting to protest at the death, according to the Associated Press. The identity of the dead man has not been released. Reports on social media \u2013 which have not been confirmed \u2013 say he was African American. Hello, welcome to our live coverage of the ongoing protests against racism and police brutality in the US and around the world, now into their third week since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on 25 May. Donald Trump will address US military graduates at West Point this morning, at a time when the president looks increasingly out of touch with the public \u2013 and many within his own party. We\u2019ll be covering his address and events from around the country and the world. In the meantime, here\u2019s David Smith on Trump\u2019s last few weeks:",

Putting to one side questions of conflicts of interest raised by the fact Serco\u2019s CEO is a former Bullingdon Club member and brother of recently retired Conservative MP Nicholas Soames and that a junior health minister lobbied on behalf of the company, can we trust the company to deliver a critical component of the UK\u2019s strategy to exit lockdown without future waves of significant infection? Serco even couches the fines resulting from failures in terms with positive connotations: service credits. There will be no credit should the company do for test-and-trace what it has done for the provision of accommodation for asylum seekers and the electronic tagging of offenders. The Department of Health spokesperson justifies the use of the private sector on the basis of its expertise and resources.

But the political setting crackled with civil-military tension.</p> <p>When all else fails \u2013 and that has happened a lot \u2013 the president has embraced the flag and hugged the military. But these days the military is not hugging back. It stands to attention as duty demands, but as inertly as Old Glory, the banner which Trump has taken to fondling at public events.</p> <p>The president likes to refer to the soldiers around him as \u201cmy generals\u201d and \u201cmy military\u201d. The possessive pronoun always jarred with the spirit of civ-mil rectitude, even before it became evident how literally Trump interpreted it.</p> <p>Saturday\u2019s ceremony at West Point was the embodiment of the president\u2019s approach. More than a thousand cadets from the class of 2020 were called back from their homes to the campus, 50 miles north of New York City, despite the coronavirus pandemic, so Trump could give a televised speech.</p> <p>Fifteen cadets tested positive. The rest had to quarantine for two weeks. The whole show was widely disparaged as stage dressing for Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, days after the president crossed a line in the exploitation of military leaders as props.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What we have here is an effort to use the military to partisan advantage</p> <footer> <cite>Risa Brooks</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On 1 June, the president had the area around the White House <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2020/06/08/timeline-trump-church-photo-op/?arc404=true\">cleared of peaceful demonstrators</a> who were protesting police killings of black Americans. Tear gas and other chemical irritants were used as well as rubber bullets, baton charges and mounted police, all so Trump could walk across Lafayette Square to pose with a Bible in front of St John\u2019s, the so-called \u201cchurch of the presidents\u201d.</p> <p>In his entourage were the defense secretary, Mark Esper, and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley, the latter dressed in battle fatigues. In the presence of scores of soldiers from the national guard, it certainly looked like Trump\u2019s suppression of peaceful protests was a military operation, in violation of norms that have underpinned US military conduct for a century and a half.</p> <p>Trump planned to go much further, invoking the 1807 Insurrection Act to deploy an elite combat unit from the 82nd Airborne on the streets of the capital.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we have here is an effort to use the military to partisan advantage to the point of potentially putting troops in the streets to confront protesters [and] to present himself as the law and order president, which is a concept with pretty historical racial overtones,\u201d said Risa Brooks, professor of political science at Marquette University.</p> <p>As the full impact of the photo op debacle dawned, Esper and Milley slammed on the brakes.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump attempted to solidify his bond with the US army on Saturday, delivering the graduation speech to cadets at the United States Military Academy and boasting of a \u201ccolossal\u201d $2tn rebuilding of American martial might. Trump\u2019s West Point speech was studiously vapid, with only a modicum of partisan boasting. But the political setting crackled with civil-military tension. When all else fails \u2013 and that has happened a lot \u2013 the president has embraced the flag and hugged the military. But these days the military is not hugging back. It stands to attention as duty demands, but as inertly as Old Glory, the banner which Trump has taken to fondling at public events. The president likes to refer to the soldiers around him as \u201cmy generals\u201d and \u201cmy military\u201d. The possessive pronoun always jarred with the spirit of civ-mil rectitude, even before it became evident how literally Trump interpreted it. Saturday\u2019s ceremony at West Point was the embodiment of the president\u2019s approach. More than a thousand cadets from the class of 2020 were called back from their homes to the campus, 50 miles north of New York City, despite the coronavirus pandemic, so Trump could give a televised speech. Fifteen cadets tested positive. The rest had to quarantine for two weeks. The whole show was widely disparaged as stage dressing for Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, days after the president crossed a line in the exploitation of military leaders as props. On 1 June, the president had the area around the White House cleared of peaceful demonstrators who were protesting police killings of black Americans. Tear gas and other chemical irritants were used as well as rubber bullets, baton charges and mounted police, all so Trump could walk across Lafayette Square to pose with a Bible in front of St John\u2019s, the so-called \u201cchurch of the presidents\u201d. In his entourage were the defense secretary, Mark Esper, and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley, the latter dressed in battle fatigues. In the presence of scores of soldiers from the national guard, it certainly looked like Trump\u2019s suppression of peaceful protests was a military operation, in violation of norms that have underpinned US military conduct for a century and a half. Trump planned to go much further, invoking the 1807 Insurrection Act to deploy an elite combat unit from the 82nd Airborne on the streets of the capital. \u201cWhat we have here is an effort to use the military to partisan advantage to the point of potentially putting troops in the streets to confront protesters [and] to present himself as the law and order president, which is a concept with pretty historical racial overtones,\u201d said Risa Brooks, professor of political science at Marquette University. As the full impact of the photo op debacle dawned, Esper and Milley slammed on the brakes. Esper reportedly came close to being fired, by opposing the use of the Insurrection Act and ordering the 82nd Airborne home. The former army officer and arms trade lobbyist pleaded cluelessness, saying he had no idea he was being roped into a photo-op at St John\u2019s. This week, in a video address to the National Defense University, Milley apologised for his presence, saying it had been a mistake. In an administration for which absolute personal loyalty is everything, the longevity in office of both men seemed to be in question. They are facing powerful countervailing winds. A string of retired generals denounced Trump\u2019s behaviour. James Mattis, the marine commander who was Trump\u2019s first defense secretary, accused him of \u201cabuse of executive authority\u201d and making a \u201cmockery of the constitution\u201d. Ahead of the West Point ceremony, hundreds of its graduates wrote to the class of 2020. \u201cWe are concerned that fellow graduates serving in senior-level, public positions are failing to uphold their oath of office and their commitment to Duty, Honor, Country,\u201d the open letter said, in a reference to Esper, class of 1986. \u201cTheir actions threaten the credibility of an apolitical military.\u201d Peter Bergen, director of international security at the New America think tank, and author of Trump and His Generals: The Cost of Chaos, said: \u201cI think this is the biggest split between the military and the civilian leadership. I can\u2019t recall a time where there was more of a fissure.\u201d \u2018A very delicate position\u2019 Such tremors under the pillars of the republic have been amplified by racial tensions, the restless fault line in US society and politics. The US armed forces reflect the diversity of the nation far more than other institutions. Amid protests over the killing of George Floyd, black officers who posted emotional videos expressing the agonies of bearing witness to systemic racism were backed by the top brass. The protest movement also gave new impetus to attempts to do away with symbols of the Confederacy. The navy and marine corps banned displays of the Confederate flag and the army has been taking steps to review whether 10 of its bases should be named after Confederate officers. Alice Hunt Friend, a former senior Pentagon policy official now at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said: \u201cSenior military leaders, both active and retired, are in a very delicate position because they want to maintain their nonpartisanship \u2026 but they also want to talk about how important it is for the American military to be anti-racist.\u201d The widening gap between racially sensitive armed services and a presidency that draws significant support from white nationalists became vividly apparent this week.

      "bodyText": "China has reported its highest daily number of new coronavirus cases in months as parts of Beijing remained under lockdown, offering a second-wave warning to the rest of the world as the pandemic rages in South America and global cases approach 7.8 million. The shock resurgence in domestic infections on Sunday has rattled China, where the disease emerged late last year but had largely been tamed through severe restrictions on movement that were later emulated across the globe. It also provides a bleak insight into the difficulties the world will face in conquering Covid-19 \u2013 even as countries in Europe prepare to reopen borders at the beginning of the summer holiday season after an encouraging drop in contagion. Of the 57 new cases logged by Chinese authorities, 36 were domestic infections in the capital, where a large wholesale food market at the centre of the outbreak has been closed and nearby housing estates put under lockdown. \u201cPeople are scared,\u201d a fruit and vegetable trader at another local market in central Beijing told AFP. \u201cThe meat sellers have had to close. This disease is really scary,\u201d said the man, adding that there were fewer customers than normal. At least 430,000 people worldwide have died from Covid-19, and the total number of confirmed cases has doubled to 7.78 million in slightly over a month. The disease is now spreading most rapidly in Latin America, where it is threatening healthcare systems and sparking political turmoil. Brazil now has the second-highest number of virus deaths after the US, surpassing Britain\u2019s toll, and the Chilean health minister, Jaime Manalich, resigned on Saturday amid a furore over the country\u2019s true number of fatalities. There have been frequent reports of spats among health ministry officials, and Manalich has been criticised by opposition politicians, mayors, medical experts and social groups for refusing to release more detailed contagion data or apply lockdowns sooner. The sudden reshuffle comes as Chile faces its toughest month in the pandemic so far, with spiralling active cases and death rates. The country now has the highest number of confirmed cases per million people in Latin America, reporting a total so far of 167,355 on Saturday and 3,101 deaths in a population of 19 million. Elsewhere in Latin America, an evacuation flight carrying about 230 British nationals and residents left Colombia\u2019s main airport in Bogota, bound for Heathrow. The plane will return with Colombian evacuees on Sunday. Colombia, which is relaxing some of its lockdown measures, currently has confirmed 46,858 cases of Covid-19, with 1545 deaths. Daily cases are climbing, with 1646 confirmed on Saturday, worrying experts that the worst is about to hit. In Mexico, the health ministry reported 3,494 new confirmed coronavirus infections along with 424 additional fatalities on Saturday, bringing the total in the country to 142,690 cases and 16,872 deaths. While Latin America grapples with its rising tide of cases, many European nations are lifting lockdowns and opening borders. After the European Commission urged a relaxation of restrictions, a number of nations are preparing to reopen borders on Monday \u2013 while some like Poland have done so already, with people from other European Union countries allowed to visit. Germany said it would end land border checks on Monday, and France said it would gradually reopen its borders to non-Schengen countries from July. Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis travelled to picturesque Santorini island to open his country\u2019s tourism season, while Venice sprang back to life on Saturday as hundreds of tourists flocked to the city for the reopening of the iconic Doge\u2019s Palace. In other developments around the world: In the US, which has seen the most deaths with over 115,000, more than a dozen states \u2013 including populous Texas and Florida \u2013 reported their highest-ever daily case totals in recent days. New York state, however, had its lowest daily death toll since the pandemic began on Saturday. Australia is also working towards reopening its borders, with senior ministers flagging shorter quarantine periods for international students and business travellers. Victoria is easing its restrictions from 21 June to allow up to 50 people can gather in pubs, cafes and restaurants. All visitors to Australia are currently required to spend two-weeks in hotel quarantine, but there are reports that could be halved for countries with low rates of infection such as Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea. There could also be travel bubbles with safe countries, such as New Zealand, which would not require quarantine. Football superstar Lionel Messi took to the pitch again in Spain as Barcelona resumed their La Liga title challenge and thumped Real Mallorca 4-0 in an empty stadium. Live sport also returned on Saturday to New Zealand, which has gone 22 days without new coronavirus cases, as 20,000 fans watched rugby\u2019s Otago Highlanders edge the Waikato Chiefs. Australian rugby league officials postponed a top-level game on Sunday hours before kick-off due to a coronavirus scare.",

It wasn\u2019t until more than 40 years later that Horton tracked him down, struck up a relationship, and discovered five half-siblings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/18/uk-failures-over-covid-19-will-increase-death-toll-says-leading-doctor\">UK failures over Covid-19 will increase death toll, says leading doctor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m absolutely certain that that\u2019s what\u2019s made him somebody who\u2019s capable of looking at situations a bit outside himself,\u201d says Nabarro.</p> <p>Despite his ill-health, Horton is a boyish-looking 58 who, incredibly, has been editor of the <em>Lancet</em> for a quarter of a century. In that time he\u2019s turned the journal into a major international success, frequently setting the agenda for global health. Last year he received the $100,000 Roux prize for lifetime achievement in population health, being cited as one of the field\u2019s most \u201ccommitted, articulate, and influential advocates\u201d.</p> <p>Despite the success and recognition Horton has enjoyed, Dame Sally Davies, the former chief medical officer, believes he is still motivated by a haunting chapter in his past.&nbsp;\u201cI think with Covid,\u201d she says, \u201che\u2019s repaying his debts.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5f017cc0abaca739f6c9b4eb8d4ad8a46da13c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5f017cc0abaca739f6c9b4eb8d4ad8a46da13c6/0_191_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Wakefield and his wife Carmel arriving at a GMC disciplinary meeting in 2007.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrew Wakefield and his wife Carmel arriving at a GMC disciplinary meeting in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glenn Copus/Evening Standard/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The debts refer to Horton\u2019s role in publishing Andrew Wakefield\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(97)11096-0/fulltext\">discredited paper</a> claiming a link between the MMR vaccination and autism. The panic that ensued led to a significant drop in vaccinations across the world, growth of the anti-vaccination movement, and lethal outbreaks of measles. Although the science was questioned from the beginning, Horton strongly defended Wakefield, whom he knew from their time working together at the Royal Free. It took 12 years before Horton finally retracted the paper, after a General Medical Council inquiry found Wakefield to have been guilty of dishonesty and deception.</p> <p>Many people in medical science have never forgiven Horton for awarding Wakefield such a prestigious platform as the <em>Lancet</em>, nor for the delay in retracting the paper. One eminent figure told me: \u201cOn his headstone it ought to say, \u2018I published Wakefield on MMR and autism\u2019.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/editorial-staff/fiona-godlee\">Fiona Godlee</a>, editor of the rival <em>British Medical Journal</em> (BMJ), says that MMR is to Horton \u201cwhat Iraq is to Tony Blair\u201d.</p> <p>As David Salisbury, who was director of immunisation at the department of health at the time of the MMR crisis, put it: Horton \u201cmade a catastrophic mistake in publishing that article, and that had enormous consequences both in the UK and globally\u201d.</p> <p>According to Dame Sally, it still rankles her CMO predecessor Sir Liam Donaldson that Horton did not properly apologise. A big supporter of Horton, she describes him as \u201ca great person doing a good job\u201d, but she she wishes he\u2019d given a \u201cmore fulsome apology\u201d, if only to placate the naysayers.&nbsp;</p> <p>Horton says that he has made many public apologies but not, perhaps, to the particular people involved, like Salisbury. In hindsight, he says, he would have loved to have retracted the paper sooner but he believed, and still does, that Wakefield deserved his day in court.</p> <p>The whole subject, says Godlee, was one about which Horton used to be very defensive. She says the pair fell out after she ran a series of pieces in the BMJ which were highly critical of Horton. Thereafter, she says, he avoided her, refusing to go to any events at which she was present. But they are now on a more friendly footing.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ea625223f87e0575c014d6bd95aa4c61b3d5467d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea625223f87e0575c014d6bd95aa4c61b3d5467d/141_0_6134_3684/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson\u2019s first daily update on the Coronavirus pandemic,with chief medical officer Chris Whitty and chief scientific officer Sir Patrick Vallance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson\u2019s first daily update on the Coronavirus pandemic with chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and chief scientific officer, Sir Patrick Vallance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WPA Pool/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHe has changed in the process of being ill,\u201d she says. \u201cHe and I have met and have had a hug and he invited me to his Roux prize thing.\u201d</p> <p>As for his doing penance, Horton thinks that Dame Sally has a psychological point, just not in terms of Covid-19. \u201cThe MMR issue was so profoundly damaging that for me the payback that I needed to give was very much a commitment to children\u2019s health. Not just vaccination but a whole range of different issues: newborn health, child health, adolescent health, women\u2019s health as it pertains to child health. I would say that yes, I think there is a debt that I was trying to repay for that.\u201d</p> <p>The<em>Lancet</em>\u2019s<em> </em>publisher, Elsevier, the Dutch analytics company, has stood by Horton, not just through the MMR saga but also a number of other controversies. These include his support for Sir Roy Meadow, the paediatrician who was sanctioned for giving misleading evidence in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/sally-clark\">case of Sally Clark</a>, the mother wrongly convicted of killing her children; a controversial analysis of civilian deaths in the Iraq war; and only two weeks ago a paper that raised concerns about the efficacy and side effects of the drug <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/covid-19-lancet-retracts-paper-that-halted-hydroxychloroquine-trials\">hydrox</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/covid-19-lancet-retracts-paper-that-halted-hydroxychloroquine-trials\">ychloroquine</a> was retracted, following widespread protests from leading figures in the field.&nbsp;</p> <p>Speaking before the paper is withdrawn, he says: \u201cIt\u2019s because of Trump being such an ardent supporter of [hydroxychloroquine] that it\u2019s got much more politicised than it normally would do. It\u2019s all gone a bit crazy.\u201d</p> <p>The swiftness with which he went on to respond to the furore, says Godlee, \u201cis a sign that he\u2019s learned a great deal\u201d. Nevertheless Horton maintains that it\u2019s vital that \u201cpeople are allowed to make mistakes because making mistakes should be what science is about\u201d.</p> <p>Despite the apparent security of his position throughout these various wrangles, he says that there was one occasion when he did think he was heading for the sack. It was after he published an \u201cextremely negative\u201d editorial about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/astrazeneca\">AstraZeneca</a> for \u201cspinning the most appallingly exaggerated story\u201d about a particular drug.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Whitty is in the middle of viral storm... it\u2019s debatable whether he\u2019d increase public confidence by acknowledging he got it wrong</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By coincidence the editorial came out on the same day as the drug company\u2019s annual investor\u2019s meeting, causing the share price to drop. The furious AstraZeneca CEO phoned Elsevier\u2019s chief executive and expressed his fury in uncompromising terms. The chief executive in turn called Horton and demanded to know \u201cwhat the hell\u201d he was doing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f24d0640297cdd811e1ac3af2c6c14bdf35fe1da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f24d0640297cdd811e1ac3af2c6c14bdf35fe1da/0_199_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump revealed in May that he was taking hydroxychloroquine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump revealed in May that he was taking hydroxychloroquine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Frey/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Godlee says that the <em>Lancet</em> usually has a cosy relationship with big pharma, often publishing major drug trials. It\u2019s a \u201cpact with the devil\u201d, she believes, that has enabled the journal to become a global powerhouse.</p> <p>Whatever the <em>Lancet</em>\u2019s economic model, Horton has studiously built an internationally recognised position of authority that has enabled him to speak out on issues that matter to him. Very few individuals&nbsp;manage to be as plain-speaking as Horton, says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-heymann\">David Heymann</a>, the former chair of Public Health England, and still retain respect in the global health community. He speaks of one occasion when he witnessed Horton inform the notoriously sensitive Chinese delegation at a seminar in Hong Kong that China needed to be more open and participatory in global health.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThere was a vice-minister of health and many top level ministers present,\u201d says Heymann, \u201cand I think that it may have had the benefit of encouraging them to become better development partners. He\u2019s very good in a tough situation.\u201d</p> <p>For all that, it\u2019s far from certain that his current campaign and book will have the same effect on the British government and its senior scientific advisers. Horton believes that in order to restore their damaged reputation they need to acknowledge their mistakes.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI think that\u2019s going to have to start with Sage, the chief scientific officer and the chief medical officer being very clear that the signals were missed from January. And there needs to be an acknowledgment that there was a collusion that took place between scientific and medical advisers and politicians which was in the end damaging to public health.\u201d</p> <p>Although at least one member of Sage has admitted that an earlier lockdown would have saved lives, it seems unlikely that Whitty will issue any kind of general mea culpa just now. He is in the middle of viral storm, trying to plot a course out. It\u2019s debatable whether he\u2019d increase public confidence in his advice by acknowledging that he got it wrong. That\u2019s if he even thinks he was wrong, which he probably doesn\u2019t.</p> <p>Horton acknowledges that from the last conversation he had with him, Whitty \u201cthinks that I don\u2019t understand what he\u2019s trying to achieve\u201d. Yet there remains a case to answer about why we took so long to lock down, and why, despite all the warnings first from China and then from Italy, that we seemed to be caught unawares by the speed and lethality of the virus.</p> <p>\u201cHow long did the UK wait before it took it seriously?\u201d asks Nabarro. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say, but Richard will tell you.\u201d</p> <p>He has indeed told us. On that, at least, we can all agree.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Covid-19 Catastrophe: What\u2019s Gone Wrong and How to Stop it Happening Again</em> by Richard Horton is published by Polity Press&nbsp;on 18 June (\u00a312.99).

Wait until all the facts are known and the crisis has subsided, goes this thinking, and then we can analyse the performance of those involved. It\u2019s safe to say that Richard Horton, the editor of the influential medical journal the Lancet, is not part of this school.

And so the question is what do we do with that knowledge now?\u201d While he doesn\u2019t have an answer to that question, he does believe that the \u201cmoral provocation\u201d of Covid-19 is not one that we can afford to ignore. For Nabarro, Horton\u2019s concern for social justice is a product of his childhood. \u201cHe was adopted at three months,\u201d he explains. Horton\u2019s birth father was a Norwegian who returned home not knowing that his brief affair had produced a child. It wasn\u2019t until more than 40 years later that Horton tracked him down, struck up a relationship, and discovered five half-siblings. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely certain that that\u2019s what\u2019s made him somebody who\u2019s capable of looking at situations a bit outside himself,\u201d says Nabarro. Despite his ill-health, Horton is a boyish-looking 58 who, incredibly, has been editor of the Lancet for a quarter of a century. In that time he\u2019s turned the journal into a major international success, frequently setting the agenda for global health. Last year he received the $100,000 Roux prize for lifetime achievement in population health, being cited as one of the field\u2019s most \u201ccommitted, articulate, and influential advocates\u201d. Despite the success and recognition Horton has enjoyed, Dame Sally Davies, the former chief medical officer, believes he is still motivated by a haunting chapter in his past. \u201cI think with Covid,\u201d she says, \u201che\u2019s repaying his debts.\u201d The debts refer to Horton\u2019s role in publishing Andrew Wakefield\u2019s discredited paper claiming a link between the MMR vaccination and autism. The panic that ensued led to a significant drop in vaccinations across the world, growth of the anti-vaccination movement, and lethal outbreaks of measles. Although the science was questioned from the beginning, Horton strongly defended Wakefield, whom he knew from their time working together at the Royal Free. It took 12 years before Horton finally retracted the paper, after a General Medical Council inquiry found Wakefield to have been guilty of dishonesty and deception. Many people in medical science have never forgiven Horton for awarding Wakefield such a prestigious platform as the Lancet, nor for the delay in retracting the paper. One eminent figure told me: \u201cOn his headstone it ought to say, \u2018I published Wakefield on MMR and autism\u2019.\u201d Fiona Godlee, editor of the rival British Medical Journal (BMJ), says that MMR is to Horton \u201cwhat Iraq is to Tony Blair\u201d. As David Salisbury, who was director of immunisation at the department of health at the time of the MMR crisis, put it: Horton \u201cmade a catastrophic mistake in publishing that article, and that had enormous consequences both in the UK and globally\u201d. According to Dame Sally, it still rankles her CMO predecessor Sir Liam Donaldson that Horton did not properly apologise. A big supporter of Horton, she describes him as \u201ca great person doing a good job\u201d, but she she wishes he\u2019d given a \u201cmore fulsome apology\u201d, if only to placate the naysayers. Horton says that he has made many public apologies but not, perhaps, to the particular people involved, like Salisbury. In hindsight, he says, he would have loved to have retracted the paper sooner but he believed, and still does, that Wakefield deserved his day in court. The whole subject, says Godlee, was one about which Horton used to be very defensive. She says the pair fell out after she ran a series of pieces in the BMJ which were highly critical of Horton. Thereafter, she says, he avoided her, refusing to go to any events at which she was present. But they are now on a more friendly footing. \u201cHe has changed in the process of being ill,\u201d she says. \u201cHe and I have met and have had a hug and he invited me to his Roux prize thing.\u201d As for his doing penance, Horton thinks that Dame Sally has a psychological point, just not in terms of Covid-19. \u201cThe MMR issue was so profoundly damaging that for me the payback that I needed to give was very much a commitment to children\u2019s health. Not just vaccination but a whole range of different issues: newborn health, child health, adolescent health, women\u2019s health as it pertains to child health. I would say that yes, I think there is a debt that I was trying to repay for that.\u201d TheLancet\u2019s publisher, Elsevier, the Dutch analytics company, has stood by Horton, not just through the MMR saga but also a number of other controversies. These include his support for Sir Roy Meadow, the paediatrician who was sanctioned for giving misleading evidence in the case of Sally Clark, the mother wrongly convicted of killing her children; a controversial analysis of civilian deaths in the Iraq war; and only two weeks ago a paper that raised concerns about the efficacy and side effects of the drug hydroxychloroquine was retracted, following widespread protests from leading figures in the field. Speaking before the paper is withdrawn, he says: \u201cIt\u2019s because of Trump being such an ardent supporter of [hydroxychloroquine] that it\u2019s got much more politicised than it normally would do. It\u2019s all gone a bit crazy.\u201d The swiftness with which he went on to respond to the furore, says Godlee, \u201cis a sign that he\u2019s learned a great deal\u201d. Nevertheless Horton maintains that it\u2019s vital that \u201cpeople are allowed to make mistakes because making mistakes should be what science is about\u201d. Despite the apparent security of his position throughout these various wrangles, he says that there was one occasion when he did think he was heading for the sack. It was after he published an \u201cextremely negative\u201d editorial about AstraZeneca for \u201cspinning the most appallingly exaggerated story\u201d about a particular drug. By coincidence the editorial came out on the same day as the drug company\u2019s annual investor\u2019s meeting, causing the share price to drop. The furious AstraZeneca CEO phoned Elsevier\u2019s chief executive and expressed his fury in uncompromising terms. The chief executive in turn called Horton and demanded to know \u201cwhat the hell\u201d he was doing. Godlee says that the Lancet usually has a cosy relationship with big pharma, often publishing major drug trials. It\u2019s a \u201cpact with the devil\u201d, she believes, that has enabled the journal to become a global powerhouse. Whatever the Lancet\u2019s economic model, Horton has studiously built an internationally recognised position of authority that has enabled him to speak out on issues that matter to him. Very few individuals manage to be as plain-speaking as Horton, says David Heymann, the former chair of Public Health England, and still retain respect in the global health community. He speaks of one occasion when he witnessed Horton inform the notoriously sensitive Chinese delegation at a seminar in Hong Kong that China needed to be more open and participatory in global health. \u201cThere was a vice-minister of health and many top level ministers present,\u201d says Heymann, \u201cand I think that it may have had the benefit of encouraging them to become better development partners. He\u2019s very good in a tough situation.\u201d For all that, it\u2019s far from certain that his current campaign and book will have the same effect on the British government and its senior scientific advisers. Horton believes that in order to restore their damaged reputation they need to acknowledge their mistakes. \u201cI think that\u2019s going to have to start with Sage, the chief scientific officer and the chief medical officer being very clear that the signals were missed from January. And there needs to be an acknowledgment that there was a collusion that took place between scientific and medical advisers and politicians which was in the end damaging to public health.\u201d Although at least one member of Sage has admitted that an earlier lockdown would have saved lives, it seems unlikely that Whitty will issue any kind of general mea culpa just now. He is in the middle of viral storm, trying to plot a course out. It\u2019s debatable whether he\u2019d increase public confidence in his advice by acknowledging that he got it wrong. That\u2019s if he even thinks he was wrong, which he probably doesn\u2019t. Horton acknowledges that from the last conversation he had with him, Whitty \u201cthinks that I don\u2019t understand what he\u2019s trying to achieve\u201d. Yet there remains a case to answer about why we took so long to lock down, and why, despite all the warnings first from China and then from Italy, that we seemed to be caught unawares by the speed and lethality of the virus. \u201cHow long did the UK wait before it took it seriously?\u201d asks Nabarro. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say, but Richard will tell you.\u201d He has indeed told us. On that, at least, we can all agree. \u2022 The Covid-19 Catastrophe: What\u2019s Gone Wrong and How to Stop it Happening Again by Richard Horton is published by Polity Press on 18 June (\u00a312.99).

      "body": "<p>The start of lockdown feels a very long time ago. But cast your mind back and you may recall a spate of articles predicting an imminent baby boom. Under lockdown Britain, people were going to be incapable of keeping their hands off each other. Nadine Dorries, minister responsible for maternity services, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nadinedorries/status/1244881952945115136?lang=en\">tweeted</a> \u201chow busy we are going to be, nine months from now\u201d.</p> <p> I was always sceptical of these baby boom forecasts. After all, a good chunk of childbearing age Britain was basically banned from having sex, while another was quarantined with existing children, surely enough to put them off producing more. History also shows that we have fewer babies in recessions as financial pressures build.</p> <p>New <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/covid19-baby-boom-bust/\">research</a> from Italian academics supports this scepticism.

      "bodyText": "The start of lockdown feels a very long time ago. But cast your mind back and you may recall a spate of articles predicting an imminent baby boom. Under lockdown Britain, people were going to be incapable of keeping their hands off each other. Nadine Dorries, minister responsible for maternity services, tweeted \u201chow busy we are going to be, nine months from now\u201d. I was always sceptical of these baby boom forecasts. After all, a good chunk of childbearing age Britain was basically banned from having sex, while another was quarantined with existing children, surely enough to put them off producing more. History also shows that we have fewer babies in recessions as financial pressures build. New research from Italian academics supports this scepticism. The authors surveyed under-35s in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK on their fertility plans and far from seeing a baby boom, Europe is set for baby bust as young adults are abandoning or delaying plans for kids in all five countries. There are differences: in places with already low fertility rates (Spain and Italy) more young people are giving up plans to have children entirely, while in previously more fertile countries (Germany, France, the UK) a higher proportion of people are still planning to have a child this year or postponing fertility plans.

      "body": "<p>On Saturday morning, Lucy Coleman, 36 from Middlesbrough, packed her bags and drove for two-hours to Lincolnshire to see her partner, Phil Bellamy. They\u2019ve always had a long distance relationship and seen each other at weekends and on days off, but lockdown has kept them apart for months.</p> <p>\u201cI was weirdly nervous as I\u2019d hardly seen anyone in ages, but it\u2019s really exciting to be back here, and we\u2019ve just gone back to normal life,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a brew and we\u2019re sat in the garden. He\u2019s done the Iceland shop online, and tonight we\u2019re getting a takeaway from our favourite place.\u201d</p> <p>Reunions such as this are taking place across England this weekend, after Boris Johnson announced that people living alone or as single parents are allowed to combine with another household to form a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/support-bubble-plan-lets-single-parents-in-england-combine-households\"> \u201csupport bubble\u201d</a>. The new rules mean they can go inside each other\u2019s houses and stay overnight without maintaining physical distancing.</p> <p>As well as reuniting couples, the change means some grandparents have been able to hug their grandchildren for the first time since March.</p> <p>Josie O\u2019Brien, who lives on her own in Lancashire, is spending the weekend with her daughter Emma Rawlinson, and grandchildren, Harris, four, and Rosa-May, two. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful feeling. The last few weeks I\u2019ve been saying \u2018don\u2019t go near me, keep two metres away\u2019, but they came running up to me and threw their arms around me. Human contact is a basic need, and having that has made such a difference.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"599d6228474a24500d6c612883509955d18c7b40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/599d6228474a24500d6c612883509955d18c7b40/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lucy Coleman and her partner Phil Bellamy are reunited in Cleethorpes in North East Lincolnshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lucy Coleman and her partner Phil Bellamy are reunited in Cleethorpes in north east Lincolnshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker/the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Any multi-person household will only be able to join with one single-person household, and some say this means choosing between family, friends or sex. \u201cA guy I was seeing wants to be in a bubble with me, but I\u2019ve never liked him that much,\u201d says 34-year-old Louise from Manchester, who lives alone. \u201cBut it\u2019s like everyone\u2019s come out of the woodwork. Friends who haven\u2019t been supportive at all are now asking if I want to be in a bubble. It feels way too late.\u201d</p> <p>The new rules are designed to alleviate loneliness among adults living alone. Some say lockdown had begun to take its toll. \u201cI lost my mum on 24 March, and I\u2019ve not had any human contact until this weekend. It\u2019s been very lonely, and my mental health has been affected,\u201d says O\u2019Brien.</p> <p>Her daughter, Emma, says it\u2019s been difficult. \u201cIt\u2019s been really tricky to see that the one person struggling the most was probably my mum. The kids missed her a lot, but being back together has been wonderful.

      "bodyText": "On Saturday morning, Lucy Coleman, 36 from Middlesbrough, packed her bags and drove for two-hours to Lincolnshire to see her partner, Phil Bellamy. They\u2019ve always had a long distance relationship and seen each other at weekends and on days off, but lockdown has kept them apart for months. \u201cI was weirdly nervous as I\u2019d hardly seen anyone in ages, but it\u2019s really exciting to be back here, and we\u2019ve just gone back to normal life,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a brew and we\u2019re sat in the garden. He\u2019s done the Iceland shop online, and tonight we\u2019re getting a takeaway from our favourite place.\u201d Reunions such as this are taking place across England this weekend, after Boris Johnson announced that people living alone or as single parents are allowed to combine with another household to form a \u201csupport bubble\u201d. The new rules mean they can go inside each other\u2019s houses and stay overnight without maintaining physical distancing. As well as reuniting couples, the change means some grandparents have been able to hug their grandchildren for the first time since March. Josie O\u2019Brien, who lives on her own in Lancashire, is spending the weekend with her daughter Emma Rawlinson, and grandchildren, Harris, four, and Rosa-May, two. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful feeling. The last few weeks I\u2019ve been saying \u2018don\u2019t go near me, keep two metres away\u2019, but they came running up to me and threw their arms around me. Human contact is a basic need, and having that has made such a difference.\u201d Any multi-person household will only be able to join with one single-person household, and some say this means choosing between family, friends or sex. \u201cA guy I was seeing wants to be in a bubble with me, but I\u2019ve never liked him that much,\u201d says 34-year-old Louise from Manchester, who lives alone. \u201cBut it\u2019s like everyone\u2019s come out of the woodwork. Friends who haven\u2019t been supportive at all are now asking if I want to be in a bubble. It feels way too late.\u201d The new rules are designed to alleviate loneliness among adults living alone. Some say lockdown had begun to take its toll. \u201cI lost my mum on 24 March, and I\u2019ve not had any human contact until this weekend. It\u2019s been very lonely, and my mental health has been affected,\u201d says O\u2019Brien. Her daughter, Emma, says it\u2019s been difficult. \u201cIt\u2019s been really tricky to see that the one person struggling the most was probably my mum. The kids missed her a lot, but being back together has been wonderful. We immediately felt like a normal family unit again.\u201d Victoria Benson, chief executive of Gingerbread, the charity for single-parent families, says that while some will benefit from new rules, the majority still have real worries around how they will care for their children while schools and nurseries stay closed. For Coleman, the pandemic has given her time to reassess what matters to her. She\u2019s been furloughed from her pub job, and although she\u2019s enjoying the break from work, being separated from Bellamy was harder than she expected. \u201cThe only thing I\u2019ve been unhappy about this whole time was not seeing him,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re used to being independent but I really missed him, and I won\u2019t take him for granted any more.\u201d Louise says that although it\u2019s nice to have options, the thought of being stuck with one person for the next few months feels strange. \u201cI\u2019ve already spent three months on my own, and I\u2019m sort of over it.

      "bodyText": "Most people can pinpoint the moment when it became real, the hot flush of panic when it dawned that coronavirus was not some far-off threat but rather one heading to our doorsteps, quickly, inexorably, hellbent on destruction. For English football, it came during the week that began with Leicester\u2019s 4-0 Premier League drubbing of Aston Villa on Monday 9 March and moved through Liverpool\u2019s Champions League elimination at the hands of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on the Wednesday. What an uncomfortable night that was at Anfield, thousands of diehards wanting to be there but, in their hearts, wondering why they had been allowed. Was it really safe? In Madrid, parents had been prevented from sending their children to school and elsewhere in Europe, notably Italy, people screamed for England to go inside and turn the key. Still, around 3,000 Madrile\u00f1os made the trip to Liverpool, many via London. It would be a last, foolhardy act of defiance. When the Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, tested positive the following night, the speed of the unravelling was extraordinary, the mounting anxiety suddenly prompting the inevitable. There would be no football for some time. In the fear and claustrophobia of lockdown, the simplest pleasures have brought heightened sensations. A walk in the park, a ray of sunshine. Everybody has craved release and football fans have missed their teams. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got till it\u2019s gone. The adage touches with precision. So how good will it be to welcome back the Premier League when Aston Villa host Sheffield United on Wednesday at 6pm \u2013 the start of a feast of action? The Bundesliga has been fun, a little like the group stage of a World Cup. You watch it because it is on and it is nice to discover new players, but has it stirred the passions? There is a difference between following a game as a neutral, however high-quality and entertaining, and watching your team. Only the true fan can feel it. And those people are about to feel it again. To say the Premier League is coming back with a bang is an understatement. After the longest postponement of competition since the second world war, there will be matches virtually every day, at various time slots, until the end of next month. It will all be televised with, happily, 33 of the 92 games on free-to-view platforms. If the title is a foregone conclusion, with Liverpool set to win for the first time since 1990, there is much to play for elsewhere. The race for Champions League qualification could include the clubs down to Burnley and Crystal Palace in 10th and 11th \u2013 if Manchester City\u2019s looming suspension from the competition is upheld next month \u2013 while the bottom six fight to avoid relegation. In a changed world, it will be a changed game and it is impossible to dress up the lack of fans inside stadiums as anything other than wholly unsatisfactory. The atmosphere at matches is better in other European countries, most notably Turkey and Greece, but, as Ars\u00e8ne Wenger notes, there is no place like England for the way that supporters \u201crespond to what\u2019s happening on the pitch\u201d. All players have played behind closed doors or in front of sparse crowds. It happens in pre-season or sometimes at clubs during international breaks. Last season, there was a training ground game between England\u2019s seniors and the under-21s at St George\u2019s Park. It will also take players back to their days in the reserves. But there is a difference between those occasions and the high stakes of a Premier League showdown. Although the motivation must come primarily from within, players do feed off the energy of a crowd. \u201cThe adrenaline is from the fans,\u201d says Mark Noble, the West Ham captain.

But the biggest thing is the noise from the crowd, how they can lift the home players and intimidate the visitors, not to mention putting pressure on the referee.

The spectacle will take some getting used to and it will certainly be a weird moment when Jordan Henderson hoists aloft the championship trophy to a backdrop of empty plastic seats.

Unable to get through to customer services to discuss a new deal, she attempted to terminate. However, she could find no option for cancelling online and, when she tried to call, an automated message informed her that lines were only open for vulnerable customers due to the pandemic.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s simple and swift to sign up to a broadband contract. Big coloured buttons beside each online deal invite custom with a few strokes on the keyboard. Exiting a contract is another matter. Hundreds of broadband customers have spent lockdown trapped on escalating tariffs as telecoms companies have become incommunicado to those who want to leave. When Suzanne Padisetti\u2019s 18-month contract with TalkTalk came to an end, her monthly bill shot up from \u00a320 to \u00a339 without warning. Unable to get through to customer services to discuss a new deal, she attempted to terminate. However, she could find no option for cancelling online and, when she tried to call, an automated message informed her that lines were only open for vulnerable customers due to the pandemic. She attempted \u201clive chat\u201d but says she was cut off both times. \u201cWe just cannot find a way to communicate with anybody to start the process of leaving,\u201d she says. \u201cIt appears that they are using the pandemic as an excuse to make it so hard for people to leave that they will stay, paying a much higher price than they need to.\u201d I feel like they are holding us to ransom Fellow TalkTalk customer, Bella Huang, also faced soaring bills because she was unable to break free. When her broadband contract came to an end, she arranged to switch to a new provider, but was informed that TalkTalk had rejected the move. She, too, was told that phone lines were only open to vulnerable customers and she says her messages via Facebook and Twitter went unanswered. \u201cI feel like they are holding us to ransom,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have said our monthly tariff will rise from \u00a317 to \u00a330 when our fixed-term contract ends, unless we sign up for another 18-month contract.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s taken a while but I think I\u2019ve identified what annoys me so much about the current phase of the government\u2019s public health \u201cstrategy\u201d (apart from all the obvious things, I mean). It\u2019s that the freedoms they have allowed us in this disastrously organised emergence from lockdown, our distracting bread and circuses, are a sort of Best of Basic British Summer: barbecues, park picnics and beach trips. \u201cThis is who we \u2013 well, you \u2013 are,\u201d the message seems to be. \u201cThis is what you people like, isn\u2019t it? Beers in the park and charred sausages, outdoor games and tea from a flask behind a windbreaker.\u201d Just throw in Morris dancing around a maypole carved in the image of Tim Henman for the full bingo card of honest British yeoman summer pastimes.</p> <p>The alternative explanation would be that it\u2019s our overlords who actually like this jolly, outdoor stuff.

It\u2019s been extended until October \u2013 meaning it will have been open for eight months and those self-isolating can continue to access the scheme. We\u2019re continuing to work hard to ensure those self-isolating get the support they need, including making statutory sick pay payable from day one, and we\u2019ve injected more than \u00a36.5bn into the welfare safety net.\u201d</p>",

If you\u2019re a courier and you\u2019re paid for how many boxes you deliver, how are you going to live?\u201d Caroline Nokes, the former cabinet minister, said: \u201cMany will not be able to afford to stay off work\u2026 for example, it will be incredibly hard to convince [Uber drivers] they must stay at home when the choice is between doing so and feeding their family.\u201d Former children\u2019s minister Tim Loughton said: \u201cThere is definitely an issue around financial impact, particularly on those who cannot work from home.\u201d Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, called for those self-isolating to be eligible for the job retention scheme, under which workers can be furloughed on 80% of their wages. \u201cFor an effective test-and-trace system to operate we need people\u2019s family finances to be protected if they are affected,\u201d he said. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \u201cThe government has taken bold steps to help many workers throughout the coronavirus crisis, but it needs to look again at how it can support people to do the right thing.\u201d A Treasury spokesperson said: \u201cOur furlough scheme has protected nearly nine million jobs. It\u2019s been extended until October \u2013 meaning it will have been open for eight months and those self-isolating can continue to access the scheme. We\u2019re continuing to work hard to ensure those self-isolating get the support they need, including making statutory sick pay payable from day one, and we\u2019ve injected more than \u00a36.5bn into the welfare safety net.\u201d",

In the summer of 1940, this was the industrial site where the fighter planes which won the Battle of Britain were built. A couple of hundred yards down from \u201cSpitfire Island\u201d, a source of 21st-century manufacturing pride is on display. In the \u201celectrification showroom\u201d, a white, gleaming exemplar of <a href=\"https://www.jaguar.co.uk/jaguar-range/i-pace/index.html?utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_source=Google&amp;utm_campaign=X590_C/UK/GB/JAG/03523683-001_CONVER-GET_MY19_1704-3112_ENG_JaguarBrand_BG_ALON_BMM_(OLD)_Retail_New&amp;utm_term=ipace%20jag&amp;utm_content=&amp;cm_mmc=PPC_Google-_-Retail-I%20PACE-_-X590_C/UK/GB/JAG/03523683-001_CONVER-GET_MY19_1704-3112_ENG_JaguarBrand_BG_ALON_BMM_(OLD)_Retail_New-_-&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIp6u48Nj86QIVArDtCh2T9g_FEAAYASAAEgK0PfD_BwE\">Jaguar\u2019s I-Pace</a> series is accompanied by a piece of purple publicity prose: \u201cBold, brave and undeniably beautiful, the Jaguar I-Pace takes electric vehicle design into a new dimension.\u201d</p> <p>There are no admiring visitors. JLR\u2019s Castle Bromwich plant, like the rest of British industry, shut down at the end of March. Nearly three months later, the showroom is still closed; beyond it, the vast battleship-grey production blocks, which operate at the cutting edge of Britain\u2019s green technology revolution, are silent. Of the company\u2019s 38,000-strong British workforce, based primarily in the Midlands but also in Merseyside, <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/news/central/2020-04-20/jaguar-land-rover-furlough-20-000-uk-staff-during-coronavirus-crisis/\">20,000 employees have been furloughed</a>. Some plants have reopened with social distancing restrictions, but last week it was confirmed that Castle Bromwich will stay shuttered <a href=\"https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/confirmed-jlrs-castle-bromwich-plant-stay-shut-until-august\">until at least 10 August</a>.</p> <p>No one knows if and when production will properly resume, or when demand, which has fallen through the floor, will pick up. Other Midlands manufacturers, including Rolls-Royce in Derby, have already shed thousands of jobs. Meanwhile, JLR is accumulating debt at such a rate that it is seeking state aid worth <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/23/jaguar-land-rover-in-talks-over-1bn-plus-state-loan\">at least \u00a31bn</a> from the Treasury.</p> <p>That might seem a great deal of money for the British government to hand a company which is a subsidiary of the Indian giant Tata Motors. On the other hand, as Des Quinn, a Midlands-based manufacturing specialist for the Unite union, points out: \u201cIt\u2019s going to cost companies like this billions to invest in green and other future technologies. That\u2019s going to be impossible in the context of Covid. Government is going to need to subsidise. Either it helps to finance business to get ahead in the green race \u2026 or it ends up paying people to be unemployed.\u201d</p> <p>Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s future will be just one high-profile test case as Boris Johnson and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, attempt to navigate their way through the economic wreckage left by the Covid-19 pandemic. The notion that the state should get its hands dirty in pursuing a proactive industrial policy \u2013 \u201cpicking winners\u201d as it is sometimes disparagingly described \u2013 has been deeply unfashionable in Britain since Margaret Thatcher was in her pomp. But these are extraordinary times; Whitehall assumptions which have dominated policy for 40 years are beginning to look threadbare and dated.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b404ee30b8ce887f80316ebb7d5a6443983a630\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b404ee30b8ce887f80316ebb7d5a6443983a630/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Employees works on a Jaguar automobile on the production line at Tata Motor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Jaguar production line at Castle Bromwich, in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Monday, businesses in England will take some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/non-essential-shops-to-open-in-england-from-monday-says-sharma-covid-19\">tentative steps</a> towards post-lockdown recovery, as high street shops begin to reopen and attempt to bounce back amid the challenges of physical distancing. They do so in the shadow of the most intimidating set of economic numbers since the war. On Friday, the Office for National Statistics <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/12/britains-gdp-falls-204-in-april-as-economy-is-paralysed-by-lockdown\">reported</a> that the economy slumped by 20.4% in the lockdown month of April \u2013 the biggest drop since such figures were kept. The grim revelation followed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/10/uk-economy-likely-to-suffer-worst-covid-19-damage-says-oecd\">a warning</a> from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which predicted that by the end of the year the UK economy is likely to have contracted by 11.5% \u2013 a steeper plunge than any of its European neighbours. Unemployment in Britain, the OECD forecast, could be running at close to 12%, as the world endures \u201cthe most severe economic recession in a century\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Only in this country are we so blind to the advantages of a strategic industrial policy</p> <footer> <cite>Ed Miliband, MP</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As private sector plans, projections and presumptions are ripped up and thrown in the bin, the strategic response by government in countries such as France and Germany has been swift. From both Paris and Berlin, the order has come to close ranks around sectors judged vital to the national interest. Along with a \u20ac130bn <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-angela-merkel-unveils-stimulus-package-to-kickstart-economy/a-53677420\">stimulus package</a> announced last week, Angela Merkel has backed a \u20ac9bn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/26/lufthansa-9bn-bailout-german-government-coronavirus-flights\">bailout</a> of Lufthansa. The state will take a 20% stake in the airline until at least 2023, as well as the power to block any hostile takeover attempt in a period of acute vulnerability. More money is available for similar deals in other sectors.</p> <p>The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has authorised an \u20ac8bn <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52814074\">aid package</a> for the car industry, including Renault, in which the government already owns a 15% share. As economic wagons are circled, Macron\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has told employers that the state will stand by them, but <a href=\"https://www.web24.news/u/2020/05/for-bruno-le-maire-the-french-automobile-industry-has-outsourced-too-much.html\">on condition</a> that vehicle production is gradually \u201crepatriated\u201d to French shores.</p> <p>Amid post-pandemic concerns over mountains of debt, economic security, the fragility of extended supply-chains and the geopolitical rise of China, the global economy appears to be entering a more cautious era. As societies accord a new priority to resilience against future shocks, the interventionist state, planning on their behalf, is making a comeback.</p> <p>In post-lockdown Britain, the political battle over what that might mean is just about to begin. The chancellor has already authorised the biggest programme of government subsidies seen in peacetime. On one estimate,<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2020/06/09/bill-furlough-scheme-business-loans-hits-90bn/\"> almost \u00a390bn</a> worth of taxpayer money has been handed to businesses and employees through the job-retention scheme and various loan packages. Public borrowing, as a result, is at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/may/22/uk-government-borrowing-record-high-april-retail-sales-slump-covid-19-coronavirus-business-live\">record high</a>. But eye-wateringly expensive as they were, these measures were conceived as a way of merely keeping businesses afloat during lockdown. The real test, as businesses reopen in a landscape transformed beyond recognition, is yet to come.</p> <p>Reacting to the latest cascade of dire statistics, the prime minister referred to the heavy cost of lockdown on an economy that has long been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/jun/12/uk-coronavirus-live-economy-slumps-as-boris-johnson-faces-calls-for-inquiry-into-health-crisis\">dominated by services</a>. But in unprecedented times, can Britain continue to neglect what\u2019s left of a manufacturing base that still plays a vital role in regions such as the Midlands?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f3e770f43e055c8e1cc822091020d82d58b34a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f3e770f43e055c8e1cc822091020d82d58b34a8/0_113_3397_2039/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chancellor Rishi Sunak\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chancellor Rishi Sunak has already authorised the biggest programme of government subsidies seen in peacetime.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last month, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d1dd8ff-c978-44c0-8e60-f50de8e8e641\">details emerged</a> of a Treasury plan to provide sustained state support for strategically key companies hit by the pandemic, whose collapse would \u201cdisproportionately harm the economy\u201d. \u201cProject Birch\u201d could see the government extending long-term loans or taking equity in some of the biggest names in British business. As well as JLR, there has also been speculation that Virgin Atlantic, Rolls-Royce and Tata Steel may become beneficiaries of state intervention.</p> <p>For a Tory chancellor, such a move would certainly be bold. But according to Will Tanner, a former adviser to Theresa May and director of the centre-right Onward thinktank: \u201cThis government is more willing to consider taking a strategic role in industry than has been the case for many years.\u201d</p> <p>Tanner points to the unsuccessful attempt to prop up Flybe, the regional airline that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/05/flybe-collapses-two-months-after-government-announces-rescue\">eventually collapsed</a> at the beginning of March. \u201cThe action to support Flybe was overwhelmed by coronavirus,\u201d he says. \u201cBut at the time it was significant. It showed a recognition of the value of the company in terms of regional connectivity. The truth is that a government will always be picking winners. It will always be deciding, according to some kind of method. You can\u2019t avoid the political dimension. Taking decisions according to some notion of pure economic value was one reason for the levels of regional disparity that have emerged in our economy.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, Tanner does not believe that a Sunak-led programme of part-nationalisation is coming any time soon. \u201cThe first preference would be for a loan rather than taking equity in businesses. Government has not actually got a good track record at managing large shareholders and representing the interests of taxpayers.\u201d</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, in Labour ranks, there is a desire for more ambition and daring. One of Sunak\u2019s predecessors, Alistair Darling, recently <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d1dd8ff-c978-44c0-8e60-f50de8e8e641\">told the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d1dd8ff-c978-44c0-8e60-f50de8e8e641\">Financial Times</a></em>: \u201cTaking equity might be a good thing for the taxpayer to do. If you\u2019re lending money, say to an airline, it\u2019s only right the taxpayer gets its fair share of the success at the end.\u201d</p> <p>The shadow business secretary and former Labour leader, Ed Miliband, believes Project Birch could provide a crucial opportunity to act on lessons already learned during the Covid-19 crisis. \u201cGovernment must do everything it can to help rescue companies in distress, but the idea that it should just be a kind of ambulance service and then get out of the way is very short-sighted.</p> <p>\u201cOnly in this country are we so blind to the advantages of a strategic industrial policy, in which the public and private sector collaborate together for the greater good. This crisis has shown us the mutual dependency of the public and the private. Industry agreed to shut down to protect public health. The state guaranteed to support industry while it did so. As we emerge, that relationship should continue to be fundamental to the recovery.\u201d</p> <p>Going back to a hands-off approach would, Miliband says, be to return to a discredited way of doing economics. As in so many other dimensions, the coronavirus crisis has brutally exposed faultlines and weaknesses which were already there. \u201cWe know that we had big economic problems when it came to productivity levels, inequality and job insecurity. We know that the manufacturing sector suffered from a financial system that didn\u2019t properly support it and that the economy was unbalanced, in favour of London and the south-east. Returning to the status quo isn\u2019t what\u2019s needed. We will only build the new economy we need with the state playing an active strategic role.\u201d</p> <p>In Britain\u2019s battered car industry, the need for strategic vision and a steady nerve has never been more pressing. The diesel crisis, Brexit and now the Covid shutdown have left an industry on its knees. \u201cIt\u2019s been a perfect storm,\u201d says David Bailey, professor of business economics at the Birmingham Business School. \u201cCovid is probably the biggest challenge the car industry has ever had. Covid plus a no-deal Brexit \u2013 and the tariffs that would bring \u2013 would be a catastrophe. And in the next 10-15 years, as a result of green targets and automation, there are probably going to be more dramatic changes in the industry than happened over the past 100.\u201d</p> <p>Bailey would be in favour of the state taking a stake in Jaguar Land Rover: \u201cIt would be good to have the government in there as a shareholder, providing finance, helping set long-term directions and keeping business in the UK. And it would lead to better communication and understanding about what the industry needs. For example, Britain has fallen badly behind in the battery manufacturing capacity that we need to compete with Germany and France in the electric-vehicle market.\u201d</p> <p>What is required, he suggests, is a change of cultural mindset and a belated abandonment of prejudices going back to the 1970s and 1980s.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a future for manufacturing in western economies but here in Britain we developed a cultural problem over it. At the high point of globalisation the assumption became that it would just go elsewhere. It\u2019s worth noting that the French government is more active in Renault and Peugeot than our government is. Or look at Lower Saxony in Germany, which has a stake in Volkswagen.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbddb9f2cc224b39aac529c3643757435bcc618c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbddb9f2cc224b39aac529c3643757435bcc618c/0_64_2408_1445/1000.jpg\" alt=\"German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">German chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Emmanuel Macron.

      "bodyText": "Approaching the Jaguar Land Rover assembly works in Castle Bromwich, the eye is drawn to a 16 metre-high sculpture commemorating the wartime production of Spitfires. In the summer of 1940, this was the industrial site where the fighter planes which won the Battle of Britain were built. A couple of hundred yards down from \u201cSpitfire Island\u201d, a source of 21st-century manufacturing pride is on display. In the \u201celectrification showroom\u201d, a white, gleaming exemplar of Jaguar\u2019s I-Pace series is accompanied by a piece of purple publicity prose: \u201cBold, brave and undeniably beautiful, the Jaguar I-Pace takes electric vehicle design into a new dimension.\u201d There are no admiring visitors. JLR\u2019s Castle Bromwich plant, like the rest of British industry, shut down at the end of March. Nearly three months later, the showroom is still closed; beyond it, the vast battleship-grey production blocks, which operate at the cutting edge of Britain\u2019s green technology revolution, are silent. Of the company\u2019s 38,000-strong British workforce, based primarily in the Midlands but also in Merseyside, 20,000 employees have been furloughed. Some plants have reopened with social distancing restrictions, but last week it was confirmed that Castle Bromwich will stay shuttered until at least 10 August. No one knows if and when production will properly resume, or when demand, which has fallen through the floor, will pick up. Other Midlands manufacturers, including Rolls-Royce in Derby, have already shed thousands of jobs. Meanwhile, JLR is accumulating debt at such a rate that it is seeking state aid worth at least \u00a31bn from the Treasury. That might seem a great deal of money for the British government to hand a company which is a subsidiary of the Indian giant Tata Motors. On the other hand, as Des Quinn, a Midlands-based manufacturing specialist for the Unite union, points out: \u201cIt\u2019s going to cost companies like this billions to invest in green and other future technologies. That\u2019s going to be impossible in the context of Covid. Government is going to need to subsidise. Either it helps to finance business to get ahead in the green race \u2026 or it ends up paying people to be unemployed.\u201d Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s future will be just one high-profile test case as Boris Johnson and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak, attempt to navigate their way through the economic wreckage left by the Covid-19 pandemic. The notion that the state should get its hands dirty in pursuing a proactive industrial policy \u2013 \u201cpicking winners\u201d as it is sometimes disparagingly described \u2013 has been deeply unfashionable in Britain since Margaret Thatcher was in her pomp. But these are extraordinary times; Whitehall assumptions which have dominated policy for 40 years are beginning to look threadbare and dated. On Monday, businesses in England will take some tentative steps towards post-lockdown recovery, as high street shops begin to reopen and attempt to bounce back amid the challenges of physical distancing. They do so in the shadow of the most intimidating set of economic numbers since the war. On Friday, the Office for National Statistics reported that the economy slumped by 20.4% in the lockdown month of April \u2013 the biggest drop since such figures were kept. The grim revelation followed a warning from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which predicted that by the end of the year the UK economy is likely to have contracted by 11.5% \u2013 a steeper plunge than any of its European neighbours. Unemployment in Britain, the OECD forecast, could be running at close to 12%, as the world endures \u201cthe most severe economic recession in a century\u201d. As private sector plans, projections and presumptions are ripped up and thrown in the bin, the strategic response by government in countries such as France and Germany has been swift. From both Paris and Berlin, the order has come to close ranks around sectors judged vital to the national interest. Along with a \u20ac130bn stimulus package announced last week, Angela Merkel has backed a \u20ac9bn bailout of Lufthansa. The state will take a 20% stake in the airline until at least 2023, as well as the power to block any hostile takeover attempt in a period of acute vulnerability. More money is available for similar deals in other sectors. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has authorised an \u20ac8bn aid package for the car industry, including Renault, in which the government already owns a 15% share. As economic wagons are circled, Macron\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, has told employers that the state will stand by them, but on condition that vehicle production is gradually \u201crepatriated\u201d to French shores. Amid post-pandemic concerns over mountains of debt, economic security, the fragility of extended supply-chains and the geopolitical rise of China, the global economy appears to be entering a more cautious era. As societies accord a new priority to resilience against future shocks, the interventionist state, planning on their behalf, is making a comeback. In post-lockdown Britain, the political battle over what that might mean is just about to begin. The chancellor has already authorised the biggest programme of government subsidies seen in peacetime. On one estimate, almost \u00a390bn worth of taxpayer money has been handed to businesses and employees through the job-retention scheme and various loan packages. Public borrowing, as a result, is at a record high. But eye-wateringly expensive as they were, these measures were conceived as a way of merely keeping businesses afloat during lockdown. The real test, as businesses reopen in a landscape transformed beyond recognition, is yet to come. Reacting to the latest cascade of dire statistics, the prime minister referred to the heavy cost of lockdown on an economy that has long been dominated by services. But in unprecedented times, can Britain continue to neglect what\u2019s left of a manufacturing base that still plays a vital role in regions such as the Midlands? Last month, details emerged of a Treasury plan to provide sustained state support for strategically key companies hit by the pandemic, whose collapse would \u201cdisproportionately harm the economy\u201d. \u201cProject Birch\u201d could see the government extending long-term loans or taking equity in some of the biggest names in British business. As well as JLR, there has also been speculation that Virgin Atlantic, Rolls-Royce and Tata Steel may become beneficiaries of state intervention. For a Tory chancellor, such a move would certainly be bold. But according to Will Tanner, a former adviser to Theresa May and director of the centre-right Onward thinktank: \u201cThis government is more willing to consider taking a strategic role in industry than has been the case for many years.\u201d Tanner points to the unsuccessful attempt to prop up Flybe, the regional airline that eventually collapsed at the beginning of March. \u201cThe action to support Flybe was overwhelmed by coronavirus,\u201d he says. \u201cBut at the time it was significant. It showed a recognition of the value of the company in terms of regional connectivity. The truth is that a government will always be picking winners. It will always be deciding, according to some kind of method. You can\u2019t avoid the political dimension. Taking decisions according to some notion of pure economic value was one reason for the levels of regional disparity that have emerged in our economy.\u201d Nevertheless, Tanner does not believe that a Sunak-led programme of part-nationalisation is coming any time soon. \u201cThe first preference would be for a loan rather than taking equity in businesses. Government has not actually got a good track record at managing large shareholders and representing the interests of taxpayers.\u201d Unsurprisingly, in Labour ranks, there is a desire for more ambition and daring. One of Sunak\u2019s predecessors, Alistair Darling, recently told the Financial Times: \u201cTaking equity might be a good thing for the taxpayer to do. If you\u2019re lending money, say to an airline, it\u2019s only right the taxpayer gets its fair share of the success at the end.\u201d The shadow business secretary and former Labour leader, Ed Miliband, believes Project Birch could provide a crucial opportunity to act on lessons already learned during the Covid-19 crisis. \u201cGovernment must do everything it can to help rescue companies in distress, but the idea that it should just be a kind of ambulance service and then get out of the way is very short-sighted. \u201cOnly in this country are we so blind to the advantages of a strategic industrial policy, in which the public and private sector collaborate together for the greater good. This crisis has shown us the mutual dependency of the public and the private. Industry agreed to shut down to protect public health. The state guaranteed to support industry while it did so. As we emerge, that relationship should continue to be fundamental to the recovery.\u201d Going back to a hands-off approach would, Miliband says, be to return to a discredited way of doing economics. As in so many other dimensions, the coronavirus crisis has brutally exposed faultlines and weaknesses which were already there. \u201cWe know that we had big economic problems when it came to productivity levels, inequality and job insecurity. We know that the manufacturing sector suffered from a financial system that didn\u2019t properly support it and that the economy was unbalanced, in favour of London and the south-east. Returning to the status quo isn\u2019t what\u2019s needed. We will only build the new economy we need with the state playing an active strategic role.\u201d In Britain\u2019s battered car industry, the need for strategic vision and a steady nerve has never been more pressing. The diesel crisis, Brexit and now the Covid shutdown have left an industry on its knees. \u201cIt\u2019s been a perfect storm,\u201d says David Bailey, professor of business economics at the Birmingham Business School. \u201cCovid is probably the biggest challenge the car industry has ever had. Covid plus a no-deal Brexit \u2013 and the tariffs that would bring \u2013 would be a catastrophe. And in the next 10-15 years, as a result of green targets and automation, there are probably going to be more dramatic changes in the industry than happened over the past 100.\u201d Bailey would be in favour of the state taking a stake in Jaguar Land Rover: \u201cIt would be good to have the government in there as a shareholder, providing finance, helping set long-term directions and keeping business in the UK. And it would lead to better communication and understanding about what the industry needs. For example, Britain has fallen badly behind in the battery manufacturing capacity that we need to compete with Germany and France in the electric-vehicle market.\u201d What is required, he suggests, is a change of cultural mindset and a belated abandonment of prejudices going back to the 1970s and 1980s. \u201cThere is a future for manufacturing in western economies but here in Britain we developed a cultural problem over it. At the high point of globalisation the assumption became that it would just go elsewhere. It\u2019s worth noting that the French government is more active in Renault and Peugeot than our government is. Or look at Lower Saxony in Germany, which has a stake in Volkswagen.\u201d There are good reasons why this government in particular may be receptive to such arguments.

      "body": "<p>In Ripon, on a once bustling high street not far from the Yorkshire Dales, Tracey Lidster is feeling \u201ca little bit nervous\u201d about reopening her shoe shop on Monday. Solemates Footwear on Queen Street has been shut since 24 March, with all staff placed on furlough. Now, Lidster is hoping hand sanitiser, tills with Perspex screens, social distancing measures and disposable socks will be enough to keep her \u2013 and her customers \u2013 safe.</p> <p>\u201cPart of you feels that you\u2019ve just got to get through it and get on with it,\u201d she told the <em>Observer</em>. Only three people will be allowed in at a time. Shoes that customers try on but do not purchase will be removed from the stock that\u2019s available to buy for at least two days. But Lidster is not planning to wear a face mask and won\u2019t expect her customers to do so. \u201cI just think you\u2019ve got to be sensible, keep your distance and sanitise your hands.\u201d</p> <p>After nearly three months without any income from the shop and three furloughed staff to support, the future of her business depends on the return of consumer confidence. \u201cI got a grant from the council, which was very helpful. But as soon as we reopen, I will have to pay my bills. Hopefully, the people of Ripon and the villages in the surrounding area will support us and come back.\u201d</p> <p>Just down the road, on Moss Arcade, Stephen Craggs is hoping the same thing. His parents started G Craggs electrical store 55 years ago but he has run it with his brother John since the 1990s, employing six staff. Most of them were placed on furlough in March but the two brothers have been working round the clock to keep their business going by taking orders online and over the telephone. Demand for bread makers, freezers and hair trimmers has increased during the lockdown \u2013 but overall, sales are down 50%.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been physically and emotionally exhausting,\u201d said Craggs. \u201cI\u2019ve had lots of sleepless nights worrying about the future and the viability of the business.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b22d52a6c9eaba85fe16849f4643efccde6e6ce5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b22d52a6c9eaba85fe16849f4643efccde6e6ce5/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen Craggs outside his electrical shop on Moss Arcade, Ripon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen Craggs outside his electrical shop on Moss Arcade, Ripon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton/the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He is reopening the shop on Monday to no more than three customers at a time, all of whom will have to ring the doorbell and use hand sanitiser before they can come in. But he is sceptical about whether high street shops reopening will herald a return to normal consumer spending patterns. \u201cJust because the shops are open, it doesn\u2019t mean that things are all rosy. Lots of people are still on furlough, worried about their future and their jobs. We are on the precipice of something awful.\u201d</p> <p>The brothers have tried to support their community by donating fridges and freezers to food banks and hospitals, and bought PPE so they could continue to deliver and install essential items such as washing machines and cookers. \u201cPeople have been appreciative of that. And that\u2019s not going to change, just because we\u2019re allowed to reopen the shop. We\u2019re in this situation for the long haul: at least a year or two.\u201d</p> <p>A five-minute walk away, on Westgate, Gill Edwards is feeling both nervous and excited about reopening the Ripon Bookshop this week. For the past three months, she and her daughters have been working almost fulltime, offering free deliveries of books to local customers. Although sales have dropped to 30% of normal levels, she has managed to keep afloat. \u201cA bookshop in the city makes a huge difference to lots of local people \u2013 they are delighted to support us, and we are relieved they feel that way.\u201d</p> <p>When the shop reopens, browsing books will be allowed, as customers will be asked to sanitise their hands when they enter. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite hard to buy books without picking them up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2792164c4d4b93b3cc1e4ff1e2550aa986805ea5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2792164c4d4b93b3cc1e4ff1e2550aa986805ea5/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gill Edwards outside her Westgate bookstore\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gill Edwards outside her Westgate bookstore, with an \u2018opening soon\u2019 poster in the window.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton/the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As an independent \u201cbricks and mortar\u201d bookshop, she is amazed by how much business she has been able to generate online during lockdown, for example by hosting book club meetings over Zoom. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fighting a battle [with online booksellers], and now we\u2019ve realised we can do it too. We can take our business in different directions \u2013 as well as providing a base on the high street for the community, we can offer more.\u201d</p> <p>Less than 100 yards away, Caroline Lodge is also planning to open her fabric, paint and furniture shop, Rosie and Clover, this week. Business has been brisk during lockdown, as her customers have had more time for DIY projects. So she is planning to reduce her opening hours and carry on working from home two days a week. \u201cI\u2019m only going to open the shop Wednesday to Saturday, so I can have Monday and Tuesday to paint furniture and keep on top of the demand for it.\u201d</p> <p>During opening hours, customers will need to make an appointment to view her fabrics and furniture in person, and will be offered gloves and a face mask to wear. Lodge is planning to wear a face covering and spend up to 15 minutes cleaning the shop between appointments. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be relentless \u2013 but then again, I don\u2019t know how busy I\u2019m going to be. Initially, it might be really quiet while people work up the nerve to come out.\u201d</p> <p>She says she feels apprehensive about the opening. \u201cUntil I start the process, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to be faced with.\u201d</p> <p>Richard Mudd is looking forward to reopening Appleton\u2019s butchers fully this week, for the first time since lockdown, and getting back to his his normal working hours. Staff will be protected by Perspex screens and only two people will be allowed in at a time, with markings on the floor so they can obey the two-metre rule. He is expecting long queues. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of loyal customers that travel for miles, just to get their pork pies from us,\u201d he said. \u201cThis shop has been here for over 150 years.\u201d The lockdown has threatened its survival. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that takings will go up and demand will go back to normal.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>For someone who has so incessantly bragged that his government is delivering a \u201cworld-beating\u201d response to the coronavirus crisis, Boris Johnson becomes peculiarly shy whenever anyone presents him with direct questions about how his government is doing in comparison with the rest of the planet. Recently taxed on why British casualties of the disease are amongst the highest in the world, the prime minister <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2020-06-10/debates/9FE27C8E-39E9-4936-AB62-C622C12A17C1/Engagements\">swerved the question</a> by contending that this wasn\u2019t helpful because \u201cwe must wait until the epidemic has been through its whole cycle in order to draw the relevant international comparisons\u201d. </p> <p>They are certainly not helpful to a government losing the battle to convince the public that its handling of the crisis has been competent. The most straightforward way to assess the UK\u2019s performance is to compare the number of deaths with the fatalities normally experienced for the time of year. The <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/weekending29may2020\">\u201cexcess death\u201d rate</a> over the average of the previous five years has topped 60,000. With 955 \u201cexcess deaths\u201d for every million people, the UK has the grimmest record of all countries providing comparable data. In that respect only can the Johnson government\u2019s performance be said to be \u201cworld-beating\u201d.</p> <p>The other side of the dismal coin is the economic calamity inflicted by this pandemic. On this measure, too, the record is likely to be bleaker than similar countries. The OECD is projecting that the UK will suffer the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/10/uk-economy-likely-to-suffer-worst-covid-19-damage-says-oecd\">deepest downturn</a> among advanced economies. It is only a forecast, but it chimes with other indicators suggesting that this country will pay a uniquely high price for its sluggish imposition of the lockdown and the government\u2019s chaotic mismanagement of the attempt to grope towards an exit. All of which is fuelling the fear that it will be Britain\u2019s fate to get the worst of both worlds: a higher death rate than comparable countries and a more ravaged economy. That dread now radiates from Tories like a pungent musk. One former cabinet minister says: \u201cIf the public conclude that we are a useless shower of incompetents who were asleep at the wheel, they\u2019ll start taking a serious look at Sir Keir Starmer QC.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/14/poll-uk-government-losing-public-approval-over-handling-of-virus\">Poll: UK government losing public approval over handling of virus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The polls suggest that voters are already beginning to do just that. The Opinium poll that we publish today indicates that public approval of the government\u2019s handling of the crisis has fallen to a new low of just 3 in 10. </p> <p>The UK has not been alone in struggling to cope with a novel disease, but voters are clocking that their country is a global stand-out in handling the crisis particularly badly. When the inevitable public inquiry is convened it will have to decide how much blame should be allocated to longstanding institutional weaknesses and how much can be attributed to the actions and inactions of particular individuals.</p> <p>Many Tory MPs are flashing knives at Public Health England, which they blame for early mis-steps in establishing an adequate testing regime. \u201cI can\u2019t see how Public Health England survives this,\u201d says one senior Tory representative of the many who hold this view. It is convenient for Johnsonites to blame failings by organisational structures that predate his arrival at Number 10. It is not helpful to the reputation of the Conservative party as a whole. The Tories have been in power for more than a decade and the NHS\u2019s current configuration is a result of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/sep/23/andrew-lansley-fails-recognise-nhs-reforms-dont-work\">Lansley reforms</a>\u201d implemented during David Cameron\u2019s premiership.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His inadequacies would not have mattered so much were the prime minister surrounded by capable ministers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The scandalously unchecked rampage of the disease through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/12/testing-coronavirus-uk-care-homes-complete-system-failure\">care homes</a> has cut deeply into the public consciousness. Everyone in politics has known for years that the care sector is fragmented and under-resourced. It could scarcely have been more at a risk. The scientific advisers on the Sage group flagged up the vulnerability of care homes as early as February. Yet the government devoted more zeal to protecting the prime minister\u2019s rule-breaking adviser, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/30/from-rose-garden-to-ridicule-how-a-week-of-disaster-for-tories-and-dominic-cummings-unfolded\">Dominic Cummings</a>, than it did to safeguarding the lives of the fragile elderly. A <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/press-release/readying-the-nhs-and-adult-social-care-in-england-for-covid-19/\">just-released report</a> by the National Audit Office estimates that 25,000 elderly people were discharged from hospitals into homes without being tested at the height of the pandemic. </p> <p>Institutional weaknesses might have been ameliorated by a government with an able character and organisational flair. It was Britain\u2019s misfortune for the emergency to occur under a prime minister notably ill-suited to handling a crisis of this nature and magnitude. Time and again, I have heard accounts from inside government of warnings given and action exhorted only for the machinery never to properly click into gear for want of decisive leadership. In an administration so shaped by the its leader\u2019s personality, this has flowed from the top. Boris Johnson was complacently late to grasp the gravity of the crisis and then animated by a panic-driven urge to try to impress the public by throwing out pledges he could not deliver. One critique, often to be heard now even from erstwhile admirers, is that his outfit at Number 10 is not so much a government as a campaign. More accomplished at generating propaganda than making policy, the Johnson gang has approached dealing with a disease as if it were no different to defeating Remainers or Jeremy Corbyn.</p> <p>To an extent perhaps still not fully appreciated, this Number 10 is obsessed with polling and focus grouping, which they conduct daily, and how things are projected in the media. \u201cThe problem with this government is that it is led by journalists,\u201d says one senior official. \u201c<a href=\"https://winstonchurchill.org/publications/finest-hour/finest-hour-177/action-this-day-churchill/\">Action this day</a>\u201d was one of Winston Churchill\u2019s famous injunctions. For Boris Johnson, it has been: \u201cAn empty pledge to get me through the day.\u201d Where energy ought to have been directed to making important things happen, it was expended on concocting brags that might temporarily garner approving headlines or neutralise hostile ones. The result has been a persistent pattern of over-promising and underperforming. At one point, Mr Johnson was hailing anti-body tests as \u201ca game-changer\u201d. Soon after, he had moved on to promising a \u201cworld-beating\u201d system for tracing and isolating infection. One that works would do. When their performance has failed to match ministerial boasts, data has been misrepresented to the public and so brazenly that it has attracted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/statistics-watchdog-ministers-still-misleading-public-on-coronavirus-tests\">a rare rebuke</a> from the head of the UK Statistics Authority. </p> <p>Some suggest that vital weeks were lost when Mr Johnson was struck down by the virus and the ministers left to mind the shop were too terrified to make any decisions. Alternative, even more damning, accounts from inside government suggest that the vacant prime ministerial chair had scant impact on the management of the crisis. When I asked one person at the heart of decision-making how much difference the prime minister\u2019s absence had made, he replied: \u201cTo be honest, not much.\u201d</p> <p>His inadequacies would not have mattered so much were the prime minister surrounded by capable ministers. His weaknesses have been magnified because he deliberately appointed a cabinet conspicuously light on talent \u2013 \u201cthe nodding dogs\u201d, as one senior Tory labels them. The cabinet were chosen not for their ability, dynamism or independence of thought, but for their devotion to a hard Brexit and obedience to Number 10.</p> <p>Thus Gavin Williamson is an education secretary more famous for his possession of a pet tarantula than for any expertise about education. Thus, even after three months to prepare a feasible plan for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/12/headteachers-berate-non-stop-guidance-changes-for-englands-schools\">reopening school</a>s, there isn\u2019t one. Thus we contemplate the ridiculous situation where <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/further-businesses-and-premises-to-close/further-businesses-and-premises-to-close-guidance\">zoos, pubs and bookies</a> will be open for business before many young people get back into the classroom.

      "bodyText": "For someone who has so incessantly bragged that his government is delivering a \u201cworld-beating\u201d response to the coronavirus crisis, Boris Johnson becomes peculiarly shy whenever anyone presents him with direct questions about how his government is doing in comparison with the rest of the planet. Recently taxed on why British casualties of the disease are amongst the highest in the world, the prime minister swerved the question by contending that this wasn\u2019t helpful because \u201cwe must wait until the epidemic has been through its whole cycle in order to draw the relevant international comparisons\u201d. They are certainly not helpful to a government losing the battle to convince the public that its handling of the crisis has been competent. The most straightforward way to assess the UK\u2019s performance is to compare the number of deaths with the fatalities normally experienced for the time of year. The \u201cexcess death\u201d rate over the average of the previous five years has topped 60,000. With 955 \u201cexcess deaths\u201d for every million people, the UK has the grimmest record of all countries providing comparable data. In that respect only can the Johnson government\u2019s performance be said to be \u201cworld-beating\u201d. The other side of the dismal coin is the economic calamity inflicted by this pandemic. On this measure, too, the record is likely to be bleaker than similar countries. The OECD is projecting that the UK will suffer the deepest downturn among advanced economies. It is only a forecast, but it chimes with other indicators suggesting that this country will pay a uniquely high price for its sluggish imposition of the lockdown and the government\u2019s chaotic mismanagement of the attempt to grope towards an exit. All of which is fuelling the fear that it will be Britain\u2019s fate to get the worst of both worlds: a higher death rate than comparable countries and a more ravaged economy. That dread now radiates from Tories like a pungent musk. One former cabinet minister says: \u201cIf the public conclude that we are a useless shower of incompetents who were asleep at the wheel, they\u2019ll start taking a serious look at Sir Keir Starmer QC.\u201d The polls suggest that voters are already beginning to do just that. The Opinium poll that we publish today indicates that public approval of the government\u2019s handling of the crisis has fallen to a new low of just 3 in 10. The UK has not been alone in struggling to cope with a novel disease, but voters are clocking that their country is a global stand-out in handling the crisis particularly badly. When the inevitable public inquiry is convened it will have to decide how much blame should be allocated to longstanding institutional weaknesses and how much can be attributed to the actions and inactions of particular individuals. Many Tory MPs are flashing knives at Public Health England, which they blame for early mis-steps in establishing an adequate testing regime. \u201cI can\u2019t see how Public Health England survives this,\u201d says one senior Tory representative of the many who hold this view. It is convenient for Johnsonites to blame failings by organisational structures that predate his arrival at Number 10. It is not helpful to the reputation of the Conservative party as a whole. The Tories have been in power for more than a decade and the NHS\u2019s current configuration is a result of the \u201cLansley reforms\u201d implemented during David Cameron\u2019s premiership. The scandalously unchecked rampage of the disease through care homes has cut deeply into the public consciousness. Everyone in politics has known for years that the care sector is fragmented and under-resourced. It could scarcely have been more at a risk. The scientific advisers on the Sage group flagged up the vulnerability of care homes as early as February. Yet the government devoted more zeal to protecting the prime minister\u2019s rule-breaking adviser, Dominic Cummings, than it did to safeguarding the lives of the fragile elderly. A just-released report by the National Audit Office estimates that 25,000 elderly people were discharged from hospitals into homes without being tested at the height of the pandemic. Institutional weaknesses might have been ameliorated by a government with an able character and organisational flair. It was Britain\u2019s misfortune for the emergency to occur under a prime minister notably ill-suited to handling a crisis of this nature and magnitude. Time and again, I have heard accounts from inside government of warnings given and action exhorted only for the machinery never to properly click into gear for want of decisive leadership. In an administration so shaped by the its leader\u2019s personality, this has flowed from the top. Boris Johnson was complacently late to grasp the gravity of the crisis and then animated by a panic-driven urge to try to impress the public by throwing out pledges he could not deliver. One critique, often to be heard now even from erstwhile admirers, is that his outfit at Number 10 is not so much a government as a campaign. More accomplished at generating propaganda than making policy, the Johnson gang has approached dealing with a disease as if it were no different to defeating Remainers or Jeremy Corbyn. To an extent perhaps still not fully appreciated, this Number 10 is obsessed with polling and focus grouping, which they conduct daily, and how things are projected in the media. \u201cThe problem with this government is that it is led by journalists,\u201d says one senior official. \u201cAction this day\u201d was one of Winston Churchill\u2019s famous injunctions. For Boris Johnson, it has been: \u201cAn empty pledge to get me through the day.\u201d Where energy ought to have been directed to making important things happen, it was expended on concocting brags that might temporarily garner approving headlines or neutralise hostile ones. The result has been a persistent pattern of over-promising and underperforming. At one point, Mr Johnson was hailing anti-body tests as \u201ca game-changer\u201d. Soon after, he had moved on to promising a \u201cworld-beating\u201d system for tracing and isolating infection. One that works would do. When their performance has failed to match ministerial boasts, data has been misrepresented to the public and so brazenly that it has attracted a rare rebuke from the head of the UK Statistics Authority. Some suggest that vital weeks were lost when Mr Johnson was struck down by the virus and the ministers left to mind the shop were too terrified to make any decisions. Alternative, even more damning, accounts from inside government suggest that the vacant prime ministerial chair had scant impact on the management of the crisis. When I asked one person at the heart of decision-making how much difference the prime minister\u2019s absence had made, he replied: \u201cTo be honest, not much.\u201d His inadequacies would not have mattered so much were the prime minister surrounded by capable ministers. His weaknesses have been magnified because he deliberately appointed a cabinet conspicuously light on talent \u2013 \u201cthe nodding dogs\u201d, as one senior Tory labels them. The cabinet were chosen not for their ability, dynamism or independence of thought, but for their devotion to a hard Brexit and obedience to Number 10. Thus Gavin Williamson is an education secretary more famous for his possession of a pet tarantula than for any expertise about education. Thus, even after three months to prepare a feasible plan for reopening schools, there isn\u2019t one. Thus we contemplate the ridiculous situation where zoos, pubs and bookies will be open for business before many young people get back into the classroom. No other European country has made such an abysmal mess of reopening schools. I talk to an increasing number of Tory MPs who fear that the combination of so many coronavirus blunders and a much more plausible leader of the opposition is a turning point. Two former senior cabinet ministers were recently in conversation and discovered they were both wondering if this is becoming another \u201cERM moment\u201d for their party. Back in 1992, a recently re-elected Conservative government under John Major shattered its reputation when Britain crashed out of the ERM on what became known as Black Wednesday. That Tory government never restored public faith in its competence. History never exactly repeats itself, but we can tell that this kind of comparison is beginning to rattle Boris Johnson. He has started insisting that it is \u201ctoo early to judge ourselves\u201d, a formulation that attempts to postpone and collectivise the reckoning. It is not too early and the public is beginning to judge him. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",

Previous Cobra meetings have also seen leaders at odds over issues such as face coverings. The devolved nations have since taken slightly different approaches to easing lockdown measures. Drakeford said that the Cobra system had become \u201cad hoc\u201d and that an invitation to a meeting to review the progress of the pandemic had never materialised. He also warned that the lack of a regular meeting meant there was no \u201cscaffolding you need to make a success of the United Kingdom\u201d. \u201cUp until the last decision point, we were all on a common, three-week decision-making cycle,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pattern had been that each three-week cycle had culminated in a Cobra meeting where we understand one another\u2019s decisions. I had simply assumed there would be one at the end of the last cycle, but it just never happened. There was no explanation. \u201cIt\u2019s not that if Cobra doesn\u2019t happen, nothing happens. But Cobra had become in this crisis the culminating point.\u201d Khan warned that sidelining the gatherings was a mistake. \u201cCovid-19 is the biggest health and economic crisis we have faced since the second world war \u2013 so it is clearly a mistake for the government to exclude regional and devolved leaders from crucial decision-making meetings,\u201d he said. \u201cLondon, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have a combined population of close to 20 million people as well as control over vital services that need to be coordinated to tackle the virus. It is vital that we have a seat at the table where crucial matters are discussed.\u201d A government spokesperson said the Cobra meeting was not the only forum for UK-wide discussions. \u201cAs we begin to roll out test and trace and implement a more targeted local approach to tackling coronavirus, it is crucial that we continue to work closely with the devolved administrations and local authorities,\u201d they said. \u201cThe chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster has regular calls with the first ministers and the prime minister spoke to them at the end of last month. The prime minister also recently held a call with the M9 group of mayors. We continue to implement the roadmap laid out by the prime minister last month, when he held a Cobra attended by the devolved administrations.\u201d",

Pollution levels are expected to soar and road deaths increase as cars crowd back on to roads to get to shops, zoos and workplaces opening for the first time since 23 March. Governments across the world have called for workers to use public transport only if they have no alternative, massively increasing car use where lockdown restrictions have eased. City mayors warned that increases in traffic congestion are already under way and likely to follow the path set by Stockholm and Wuhan, where car use is already above previous peak levels. Other European cities, including Paris and Berlin, have experienced a rapid jump back towards average levels following an easing of restrictions. According to a congestion index compiled by satnav provider TomTom, Paris\u2019s streets would regularly hit a congestion level of 100% before the lockdown, which means it would take double the time to make the journey than on an empty road. Last week, the congestion level in the French capital almost hit 60% , while Stockholm has regularly seen its rating jump above its usual 80% peak.

I would find it hard to disagree. Mid-2020, mid-Covid-19, anti-racism protests lacing our news, a temptation might be to retreat from culture wars \u2013 and goodness knows, that\u2019s the kind and gentle option \u2013 but the first stage of survival generally means opening one\u2019s eyes.&nbsp;</p> <p>It\u2019s not an easy watch. It\u2019s not a joyous watch. It features rape, heaving, bare-bottomed sex, anger, slums, counselling, slang, mad wigs. It also features humour \u2013 and says quite everything about Coel, who also stars, that she has managed, somehow, to combine the tale of a grim personal experience with such a valuable exploration of what \u201cconsent\u201d means, and make the whole eventually warm.</p> <p>It is often infuriating. But Coel has tackled so many subjects around which our generalised prejudices congregate, from recreational drugginess to bloodied tampon-sex to blackness, via the blitherings of mindfulness, the joys of sex and the horrors of sudden distrust, and done it with wit and several nods to the power of friendship. Goodness, but what a rethink to have come out of one drama.&nbsp;</p> <p>One of the strengths of <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p08g29ff/sitting-in-limbo\">Sitting in Limbo</a></strong> (also BBC One), which certainly didn\u2019t lack for strengths, was the fact that we the audience were never vouchsafed any more information than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/01/man-detained-threatened-with-removal-after-52-years-in-the-uk\">the real</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/dec/01/man-detained-threatened-with-removal-after-52-years-in-the-uk\"> Anthony Bryan</a> (played with just-so weary dignity by Patrick Robinson), whose life was just one of many upended in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/windrush-scandal\">the Windrush scandal</a> exposed by Amelia Gentleman in the <em>Guardian</em>. We never found out why Anthony, in his dealings with authorities, had to provide his mother\u2019s passport details from 1950 or whenever, nor why authorities had quietly destroyed all landing cards, nor how he had found himself in this MC Escher stairway: we were equally confused. (Turned out it had all been a brilliant lash-up by politicians keen on self-promotion. Hurrah! Such fun!) And such a grand story for all those who thought themselves to be British over 50 long, hardworking years until \u2013 imagine their surprise! An absorbing, rewatchable drama that quietly told loud truths, and wore its anger remarkably lightly.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0985aadf26b3747dcc02d5da5d9e131a1fdaeff5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0985aadf26b3747dcc02d5da5d9e131a1fdaeff5/0_114_4285_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Just-so weary dignity\u2019: Patrick Robinson and Nadine Marshall in Sitting in Limbo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patrick Robinson and Nadine Marshall in Sitting in Limbo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/Left Bank Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is one moment towards the middle of the third of four instalments of Netflix\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80224905\">Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich</a></strong>, between the searing testimonies of Sarah Ransome and Chauntae Davies, when you see a brief snapshot of Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein together, swanking and preening. There have been more beautiful pictorial encapsulations of the male persona. No one can have been left in any doubt whatsoever as to Epstein\u2019s guilt: and yet even incels, the \u201cinvoluntarily celibate\u201d of the far right, can not have been left in much doubt as to the nature of the dog turd which was the sum total of Epstein\u2019s moral balance. Nor the wit and gumption and, yes, beauty, of all those who came together, hand in hand, to have their final say in court, 18 years on: I almost understand now the concept of closure.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.sky.com/watch/mcmillions\">McMillions</a></strong>, the documentary which has been running on Sky Documentaries, came with sprightly fun at a far less brittle tale, that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/03/mcmillions-bizarre-story-how-one-man-stole-24m-mcdonalds-hbo\">the Monopoly scam</a> that dogged the burger giant around the turn of the millennium, in which hundreds of millions of fast-food customers peeled back tiny tokens unaware that the only winning tokens had been snaffled by one security chief over the course of a decade. Much more focused and enjoyable than <em>Tiger King</em>, which just went sad and loopy by the end, it was executive produced by Mark Wahlberg and thus had a gleeful sheen of vintage heist to it all.</p> <p>Arguably about one episode too long, it nonetheless drilled down with panache into the semi-fascinating lives of a staple of American fiction (and presumably life), which might best be termed \u201clikable scumbags\u201d: the borderline and the barfly, the dandy and the dude, the mobster\u2019s molls and the rueful Mormons. None of whom you could truly bring yourself to loathe or even dislike, despite the fact that theirs was&nbsp;hardly a victimless crime: the many lost jobs of blameless blue-collar printers and such, the huge knock-on effects of&nbsp;the scam on, as ever, the patsies who were least able to afford the fallout from the eventual sting. Never mind the damage to McDonald\u2019s reputation. Seriously, do not give a spat rat to that.</p> <p>For two such seemingly unrelated subjects, these lengthy televisual explorations had a couple of things in common: first, the doggedly stoic work undertaken by a couple of unremarked south-eastern law enforcement agencies \u2013 Palm Beach police department, and the teensy Jacksonville FBI. And weirdly, the scam posted up on that Jacksonville wall had precisely the same pyramid-scheme-style structure \u2013 mild culpability ensuring the secrecy of those recruited on a couple of levels, who then recruited more below them, and so on down the pyramid it spreads and infects \u2013 as that employed by Epstein with his pyramid of girls. He got them from the less serene side of Palm Beach, poor and thin and young and lucky only in their prettiness, and then they recruited again below\u2026 until a report happened to chance across the desk of an individual whose duty to self happened to outweigh their duty to greed or self-aggrandisement.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08dnl67\">Staged</a></strong> (BBC One) is the latest lockdown drama \u2013 lockdown dramas being an entire new genre, which Wikipedia will define as \u201ca needs-must 2020 phenomenon in which, under the strictures of coronavirus, a rich person is seen questioning their values, a poor person is seen struggling yet being gamely cheeky, and core workers are celebrated. The genre must feature a Zoom-glitch or similar technological embarrassment.\u201d And yet <em>Staged</em> was a hugely refreshing addition to the genre, featuring simply a couple of immensely personable actors playing heightened versions of themselves. David Tennant and Michael Sheen, aided hugely by wives Georgia Tennant and Anna Lundberg, are lockdown-rehearsing an unpalatable, 100-year-old absurdist Italian drama, urged and egged on by Simon Evans, who wrote and directed <em>Staged</em>, and gave himself, in fairness, the very worst lines, the lines which those aged eight to 80 will lift eyebrows to and wonder \u201cDid he <em>really</em> say that? What a dick.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39af55039fdef618e5848203ac592dfb73225223\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39af55039fdef618e5848203ac592dfb73225223/0_121_4361_2618/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Tennant and Georgia Tennant in Staged.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Grand fun\u2019: David and Georgia Tennant in Staged.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Stephenson/BBC/GCB Films/Infinity Hill</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is grand fun, even if slight, although I suspect that the good friends Sheen and Tennant are, no matter how inadvertently, auditioning even in lockdown for the next series of <em>The Trip</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p>For those who underwent series one of <strong><a href=\"https://www.sky.com/watch/title/series/4d18b5ea-a12a-4d26-b804-831775fb2301/das-boot\">Das Boot</a></strong>, das Sky Atlantic reboot of the classic 1981 Wolfgang Petersen film, you\u2019ll have known what to expect from series two, which launched this week. Far from a faithful, tense, bitterly claustrophobic paean to bravery and sacrifice in a submarine, we got a wider, bowdlerised tale of mutinous good crews with bad beards and bad crews with good beards, and stirring yearnings to have been part of the resistance in La Rochelle in 1942.</p> <p>And so it goes on. The handsome-but-evil SS is man is still hunting down local Jews, the decent, sad, bespectacled German is still trying to stay his hand, the French are either gorgeous and incompetently brave or possessed of ferret-faced cunning and playing both sides and deserve to die with bats gnawing their cheesy innards, and the one complexity we are permitted \u2013 a good-guy U-boat boss with, confusingly, a good beard \u2013 is trying to deliver his tin-can to the Americans, along with the Enigma machine.</p> <p>If Covid-19 gets us all, I would shudder to think burgeoning 26th-century civilisations might find this under a scrimshawed rune-rock and consider it a documentary of life as lived 1930-2030. Mind you, could say the same about <em>McMillions</em> or <em>Epstein</em>.</p>",

But Coel has tackled so many subjects around which our generalised prejudices congregate, from recreational drugginess to bloodied tampon-sex to blackness, via the blitherings of mindfulness, the joys of sex and the horrors of sudden distrust, and done it with wit and several nods to the power of friendship. Goodness, but what a rethink to have come out of one drama. One of the strengths of Sitting in Limbo (also BBC One), which certainly didn\u2019t lack for strengths, was the fact that we the audience were never vouchsafed any more information than the real Anthony Bryan (played with just-so weary dignity by Patrick Robinson), whose life was just one of many upended in the Windrush scandal exposed by Amelia Gentleman in the Guardian. We never found out why Anthony, in his dealings with authorities, had to provide his mother\u2019s passport details from 1950 or whenever, nor why authorities had quietly destroyed all landing cards, nor how he had found himself in this MC Escher stairway: we were equally confused. (Turned out it had all been a brilliant lash-up by politicians keen on self-promotion. Hurrah! Such fun!) And such a grand story for all those who thought themselves to be British over 50 long, hardworking years until \u2013 imagine their surprise! An absorbing, rewatchable drama that quietly told loud truths, and wore its anger remarkably lightly. There is one moment towards the middle of the third of four instalments of Netflix\u2019s Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich, between the searing testimonies of Sarah Ransome and Chauntae Davies, when you see a brief snapshot of Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein together, swanking and preening. There have been more beautiful pictorial encapsulations of the male persona. No one can have been left in any doubt whatsoever as to Epstein\u2019s guilt: and yet even incels, the \u201cinvoluntarily celibate\u201d of the far right, can not have been left in much doubt as to the nature of the dog turd which was the sum total of Epstein\u2019s moral balance. Nor the wit and gumption and, yes, beauty, of all those who came together, hand in hand, to have their final say in court, 18 years on: I almost understand now the concept of closure. McMillions, the documentary which has been running on Sky Documentaries, came with sprightly fun at a far less brittle tale, that of the Monopoly scam that dogged the burger giant around the turn of the millennium, in which hundreds of millions of fast-food customers peeled back tiny tokens unaware that the only winning tokens had been snaffled by one security chief over the course of a decade. Much more focused and enjoyable than Tiger King, which just went sad and loopy by the end, it was executive produced by Mark Wahlberg and thus had a gleeful sheen of vintage heist to it all. Arguably about one episode too long, it nonetheless drilled down with panache into the semi-fascinating lives of a staple of American fiction (and presumably life), which might best be termed \u201clikable scumbags\u201d: the borderline and the barfly, the dandy and the dude, the mobster\u2019s molls and the rueful Mormons. None of whom you could truly bring yourself to loathe or even dislike, despite the fact that theirs was hardly a victimless crime: the many lost jobs of blameless blue-collar printers and such, the huge knock-on effects of the scam on, as ever, the patsies who were least able to afford the fallout from the eventual sting. Never mind the damage to McDonald\u2019s reputation. Seriously, do not give a spat rat to that. For two such seemingly unrelated subjects, these lengthy televisual explorations had a couple of things in common: first, the doggedly stoic work undertaken by a couple of unremarked south-eastern law enforcement agencies \u2013 Palm Beach police department, and the teensy Jacksonville FBI. And weirdly, the scam posted up on that Jacksonville wall had precisely the same pyramid-scheme-style structure \u2013 mild culpability ensuring the secrecy of those recruited on a couple of levels, who then recruited more below them, and so on down the pyramid it spreads and infects \u2013 as that employed by Epstein with his pyramid of girls. He got them from the less serene side of Palm Beach, poor and thin and young and lucky only in their prettiness, and then they recruited again below\u2026 until a report happened to chance across the desk of an individual whose duty to self happened to outweigh their duty to greed or self-aggrandisement. Staged (BBC One) is the latest lockdown drama \u2013 lockdown dramas being an entire new genre, which Wikipedia will define as \u201ca needs-must 2020 phenomenon in which, under the strictures of coronavirus, a rich person is seen questioning their values, a poor person is seen struggling yet being gamely cheeky, and core workers are celebrated. The genre must feature a Zoom-glitch or similar technological embarrassment.\u201d And yet Staged was a hugely refreshing addition to the genre, featuring simply a couple of immensely personable actors playing heightened versions of themselves. David Tennant and Michael Sheen, aided hugely by wives Georgia Tennant and Anna Lundberg, are lockdown-rehearsing an unpalatable, 100-year-old absurdist Italian drama, urged and egged on by Simon Evans, who wrote and directed Staged, and gave himself, in fairness, the very worst lines, the lines which those aged eight to 80 will lift eyebrows to and wonder \u201cDid he really say that? What a dick.\u201d It is grand fun, even if slight, although I suspect that the good friends Sheen and Tennant are, no matter how inadvertently, auditioning even in lockdown for the next series of The Trip. For those who underwent series one of Das Boot, das Sky Atlantic reboot of the classic 1981 Wolfgang Petersen film, you\u2019ll have known what to expect from series two, which launched this week. Far from a faithful, tense, bitterly claustrophobic paean to bravery and sacrifice in a submarine, we got a wider, bowdlerised tale of mutinous good crews with bad beards and bad crews with good beards, and stirring yearnings to have been part of the resistance in La Rochelle in 1942. And so it goes on. The handsome-but-evil SS is man is still hunting down local Jews, the decent, sad, bespectacled German is still trying to stay his hand, the French are either gorgeous and incompetently brave or possessed of ferret-faced cunning and playing both sides and deserve to die with bats gnawing their cheesy innards, and the one complexity we are permitted \u2013 a good-guy U-boat boss with, confusingly, a good beard \u2013 is trying to deliver his tin-can to the Americans, along with the Enigma machine. If Covid-19 gets us all, I would shudder to think burgeoning 26th-century civilisations might find this under a scrimshawed rune-rock and consider it a documentary of life as lived 1930-2030. Mind you, could say the same about McMillions or Epstein.",

Like Hines, Watkins grew up in Barnsley. The book\u2019s hero, Billy Casper, finds escape through aviculture; Watkins found it through ballet. \u201cI feel dance is really great at painting that picture, where someone goes from being restricted by their environment to opening up through an emotional, physical journey,\u201d he told the Guardian. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=6&amp;v=2RLmaSOQET8&amp;feature=emb_logo\">A film version by director Ross MacGibbon</a>, with Chester Hayes as Casper and puppetry design by Rachael Canning, has been made available by The Space for free online until 18 June.</p> \n<h2>I Want My Hat Back trilogy</h2> \n<p>The Little Angel theatre has presented charming versions of three Jon Klassen picture books, directed and performed by Ian Nicholson, with characterful puppets made by Sam Wilde. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBJmp1c3XIQ\">I Want My Hat Back</a> finds an otherwise polite bear taking revenge on a bad bunny who has pinched his pointy red hat. It\u2019s eight and a half minutes of pure joy. The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF7q37SfF4w\">sequel</a>, This Is Not My Hat, also staged on a wooden dresser and told with music by Jim Whitcher, is a kind of Grand Theft Aqua in which a tiddler has stolen a handsome green bowler from a much bigger fish. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-8y3a7gqGw\">We Found a Hat</a> completes a triumphant trilogy.

Thompson steps in and out of his version of Hermann Hesse\u2019s fairytale Faldum, riffing with the young audience and spinning a handful of jazz LPs. I Wish I Was a Mountain embraces big questions about time and contentment. This is a short but profound show, directed by Lee Lyford, hatched by the Egg theatre\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theatreroyal.org.uk/take-part/artist-development/about/\">Incubator</a> development programme and cleverly designed by Anisha Fields. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/sep/24/i-wish-i-was-a-mountain-review-toby-thompson-hermann-hesse-the-egg-bath\">Read the full review</a>.</p> \n<h2>Hamilton</h2> \n<p>Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s phenomenal, Pulitzer prize-winning musical about the \u201c10-dollar founding father without a father\u201d was filmed in New York back in 2016 with the original Broadway cast.

The stage is still set for EV Crowe\u2019s play Shoe Lady, as seen from Chillingworth\u2019s static camera in the balcony. Occasionally it is cloaked in darkness and occasionally we hear messages of hope. Principally, the installation becomes a space to savour the importance of theatregoing until the Court invites audiences back to sit on those comfy leather chairs again.</p> \n<h2>Spymonkey</h2> \n<p>The anarchic physical theatre and comedy company are unlocking <a href=\"https://www.spymonkey.co.uk/news.html\">their vault</a> of inventive, irreverent shows with many becoming available each Sunday to be streamed for free.

Alternately rousing and yearning, this is a gorgeous hymn to barflies, precious memories and the joys of being a ghost, told with a dash of Edgar Allan Poe and Thelonious Monk.

Matthew Bourne\u2019s The Red Shoes from Home One of the major dance productions cut short by the coronavirus crisis was Matthew Bourne\u2019s tour of The Red Shoes, his rapturously received version of the Powell and Pressburger film. But Bourne\u2019s company New Adventures has unveiled a charming 12-minute film version, performed by the cast from home \u2013 among children\u2019s toys in their living rooms, on tables, in gardens and backyards, and in the kitchen. The costumes include football kits and, in one case, a couple of towels. Pass Over Antoinette Nwandu\u2019s blistering, Beckettian play about police brutality was filmed at Chicago\u2019s Steppenwolf theatre by Spike Lee for this 75-minute version, which crackles with humour, tension and tragedy. Lee skilfully weaves the audience, and the world outside the theatre, into a work that our critic Arifa Akbar gives five stars. Available on Amazon Prime. Read the full review. Toast It\u2019s not often that a play comes with its own recipe card. But that\u2019s what audiences get with this new online adaptation of Nigel Slater\u2019s food-filled memoir, available as an audio drama and an animated film online from 1\u201331 July.

Set in a Wiltshire suburb, Declan is described as \u201ca contemporary ghost story, exploring isolation, fear of the outside world and the distance between two friends\u201d. It\u2019s directed by Alexis Gregory, with videography by Layke Anderson. Available 19-28 June, tickets priced \u00a35-7. Noah and the Peacock Jeff James, who adapted and directed an irreverent version of Jane Austen\u2019s Persuasion at Manchester\u2019s Royal Exchange in 2017, has created a new, 40-minute lockdown show for five- to-nine-year-olds. Actors will perform live over Zoom from their homes and kids are invited to dress up as one of Noah\u2019s animals for the production, presented by Nottingham Playhouse. Tickets cost \u00a39 and it runs from 19-21 June. The Grinning Man For Bristol Old Vic\u2019s 250th anniversary, director Tom Morris staged a musical tragicomedy based on the Victor Hugo novel The Man Who Laughs, which was published a few years after Les Mis\u00e9rables. A grisly tale of fairground horror and romance, The Grinning Man was a twisted hit and transferred to the West End. Now, a \u201crare bootleg capture\u201d of the Bristol production will be available for a week from 26 June. Living With The Lights On In 1995, the actor Mark Lockyer was appearing in the RSC\u2019s Romeo and Juliet when he was overcome with anxiety, fear and paranoia. At one point he thought he was possessed by the devil. He was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder and turned his experience into a solo touring show. Lockyer has now created a lockdown version, filmed on his mobile, for the Scottish Mental Health Arts festival. Available until 15 June. Smoking Gun This intriguing interactive blend of theatre and gaming is spread across a whole week, with participants spending half an hour each night on an online chat app, sifting the evidence of a murky case involving an MP and big Pharma.

The Old Vic The Old Vic is pioneering \u201csocially distanced performances\u201d starting with a revival of Duncan Macmillan\u2019s two-hander Lungs, starring Matt Smith and Claire Foy, from 26 June to 4 July.

Reasons to Be Cheerful The fantastic Graeae theatre company\u2019s programme of digital shorts, Crips Without Constraints, has already provided plenty of reasons to be cheerful during lockdown. Now the disabled-led organisation is sharing a 2017 recording of their riotous musical tribute to Ian Dury and the Blockheads, staged at Theatre Royal Stratford East and directed by Jenny Sealey. The production blends British Sign Language and creative captioning. A separate audio-described version will also be available. Online until 3 August. Kes Reimagined In 2014, choreographer Jonathan Watkins won acclaim for a soaring dance-theatre adaptation of the Barry Hines novel, A Kestrel for a Knave, at Sheffield\u2019s Crucible. Like Hines, Watkins grew up in Barnsley. The book\u2019s hero, Billy Casper, finds escape through aviculture; Watkins found it through ballet. \u201cI feel dance is really great at painting that picture, where someone goes from being restricted by their environment to opening up through an emotional, physical journey,\u201d he told the Guardian. A film version by director Ross MacGibbon, with Chester Hayes as Casper and puppetry design by Rachael Canning, has been made available by The Space for free online until 18 June. I Want My Hat Back trilogy The Little Angel theatre has presented charming versions of three Jon Klassen picture books, directed and performed by Ian Nicholson, with characterful puppets made by Sam Wilde. I Want My Hat Back finds an otherwise polite bear taking revenge on a bad bunny who has pinched his pointy red hat. It\u2019s eight and a half minutes of pure joy. The sequel, This Is Not My Hat, also staged on a wooden dresser and told with music by Jim Whitcher, is a kind of Grand Theft Aqua in which a tiddler has stolen a handsome green bowler from a much bigger fish. We Found a Hat completes a triumphant trilogy. All three films are online until 30 June. The Little Angel\u2019s digital season also includes Toby Oli\u00e9\u2019s puppet version of the Ross Collins book What Does an Anteater Eat? (online until 1 September). Sea Wall \u201cShe had us, both of us, absolutely round her finger\u2026\u201d From that first line, Andrew Scott will have you hooked in this half-hour monologue by Simon Stephens that captures truths about family life, art, nature and much else besides. Scott performed the play at the Bush in 2008 and it was a hot ticket when he reprised it at the Old Vic 10 years later. This version was shot in a single take in 2011. Directed by Stephens and Andrew Porter, it is available to rent online. Brace yourself. I Wish I Was a Mountain With wonder, wit and sophisticated storytelling, performance poet Toby Thompson creates a beautiful show for over-sevens. Thompson steps in and out of his version of Hermann Hesse\u2019s fairytale Faldum, riffing with the young audience and spinning a handful of jazz LPs. I Wish I Was a Mountain embraces big questions about time and contentment. This is a short but profound show, directed by Lee Lyford, hatched by the Egg theatre\u2019s Incubator development programme and cleverly designed by Anisha Fields. Read the full review. Hamilton Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s phenomenal, Pulitzer prize-winning musical about the \u201c10-dollar founding father without a father\u201d was filmed in New York back in 2016 with the original Broadway cast. It was slated for a 2021 cinema release but has now been fast-tracked for release on the Disney+ streaming service on 3 July. It\u2019s directed by Thomas Kail, who staged the musical, and according to Miranda gives \u201ceveryone the best seat in the house\u201d for a show that has been one of the most wanted on both sides of the Atlantic. The Unknown Island For her opening production as the Gate\u2019s artistic director, Ellen McDougall staged an intimate, hour-long adaptation of a Jos\u00e9 Saramago short story, which famously saw the cast sharing bread, olives and wine with the audience. You\u2019ll have to supply the snacks yourself but this is a great chance to experience the bewitching 2017 production. The Gate\u2019s staging of Suzy Storck by Magali Mougel, directed by Jean-Pierre Baro, is also available. Both can be streamed until 30 June. Caretaker The Royal Court, like all UK theatres, is closed due to the lockdown. But you can visit it virtually in this intriguing installation by Hester Chillingworth. The stage is still set for EV Crowe\u2019s play Shoe Lady, as seen from Chillingworth\u2019s static camera in the balcony. Occasionally it is cloaked in darkness and occasionally we hear messages of hope. Principally, the installation becomes a space to savour the importance of theatregoing until the Court invites audiences back to sit on those comfy leather chairs again. Spymonkey The anarchic physical theatre and comedy company are unlocking their vault of inventive, irreverent shows with many becoming available each Sunday to be streamed for free. Highlights include, from 21 June, the Feydeau farce Every Last Trick. Lyric Theatre in Belfast Belfast\u2019s Lyric had to cancel its co-production of 1984 with Bruiser theatre company but instead launched the initiative New Speak: Re-imagined, in which Northern Irish talents including Amadan Ensemble, Dominic Montague and Katie Richardson respond to the lockdown crisis. They are being released in episodes on YouTube. The Lyric is also collaborating on six new five-minute drama commissions for the series Splendid Isolation: Lockdown Drama, to be broadcast on BBC Two Northern Ireland in June and made available afterwards on BBC Four and BBC iPlayer. Mountview Live \u2013 Giles Terera Meets \u2026 This isn\u2019t live drama, but should be essential viewing for theatre lovers and students as the Olivier award-winning actor Giles Terera talks to top names from the industry. The hour-long conversations on YouTube include questions from Mountview Academy of Theatre students. Guests include the fabulous Noma Dumezweni, who is a Mountview honorary doctorate, Judi Dench and Lin-Manuel Miranda. Expect some nuanced questions for that last one: Terera is best known for his knockout performance as Aaron Burr in Hamilton. The Place London\u2019s essential contemporary dance hub is celebrating its 50th birthday this year. Just as some of its dance classes have gone online, so has its performance programme.

Finborough theatre The tiny west London powerhouse is streaming past productions for free but welcomes donations as \u201cwe fall between the cracks of government and local authority support\u201d. Its 2019 production of Jane Clegg, written by St John Ervine during the votes for women campaign, was the first London production of the play for 75 years and is available until 5 August.

Dear Ireland The Abbey, Ireland\u2019s national theatre, assembled an extraordinary lineup of 50 actors and 50 writers for this series of rapid-response monologues about the coronavirus crisis, self-taped by the performers from isolation. The writers include Frank McGuinness, Iseult Golden, Stacey Gregg, Sarah Hanly, Nancy Harris, Enda Walsh and David Ireland; the cast includes Nicola Coughlan, Caoilfhionn Dunne, Denise Gough, Br\u00edd N\u00ed Neachtain and Brendan Gleeson. to a simple, rock\u2019n\u2019roll \u2026 song It may hail the alligator and watusi dance crazes of the 60s but music from Patti Smith\u2019s blistering 1975 album, Horses, drives some of Michael Clark\u2019s most deliriously thrilling modern choreography in the first act of this 2017 Barbican production now on BBC iPlayer. These moves are as arresting as any guitar riff, matching Smith\u2019s cantering repetition and a blizzard of trippy visuals from Charles Atlas. The second act celebrates Erik Satie and the third pays tribute to David Bowie. Schaub\u00fchne The celebrated Berlin theatre, run by Thomas Ostermeier, is streaming a selection of archive productions, many with English subtitles, and often for one night only.

As their current tour of The Strange Tale of Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel has been cut short, they are sharing shows from their vast archive which is stuffed with gems. Each is available for a week only \u2013 keep an eye on their site to see what\u2019s currently on offer. Wise Children Former Kneehigh and Shakespeare\u2019s Globe artistic director Emma Rice chose an adaptation of Angela Carter\u2019s carnivalesque final novel Wise Children as her first production for her new theatre company, which shares the same name as the book. Filmed at York Theatre Royal, it\u2019s available to stream on BBC iPlayer as part of the Culture in Quarantine programme. Expect twins, cartwheels, puppets and a palpable passion for theatre itself. Read the full review. What the Butler Saw Joe Orton\u2019s final farce, completed in the summer of 1967 just before the playwright\u2019s death, is a subversive satire about an irrational world, set in a psychiatrist\u2019s consulting room. Rufus Hound dons the white coat as the philandering Dr Prentice in Nikolai Foster\u2019s 2017 production for Leicester Curve and Theatre Royal Bath. The cast includes Dakota Blue Richards and Jasper Britton. Curve\u2019s productions of Memoirs of an Asian Football Casual and The Importance of Being Earnest are also online. Little Red Riding Hood The big bad wolf is soppy rather than scary in Northern Ballet\u2019s sweet retelling of the fairytale. He wouldn\u2019t dream of eating gran and ends up invited to a jolly tea party instead. A spring tour of the production has been cancelled but there is a version adapted for CBeebies online. An attractive introduction to ballet\u2019s magic. Read the full review. The Swan Birmingham Royal Ballet\u2019s new director Carlos Acosta has reworked The Dying Swan (originally choreographed by Mikhail Fokine for Anna Pavlova), and BRB principal dancer C\u00e9line Gittens performs the piece from her living room to yours. Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns\u2019s Le Cygne, from Le Carnaval des Animaux, is performed by pianist Jonathan Higgins and cellist Antonio Novais. \u201cThis is a dance of promises,\u201d says Acosta. Fleabag You\u2019ve watched both TV series. You\u2019ve read the scripts. Maybe you\u2019ve even seen the stage show more than once. But you\u2019ll probably still be streaming Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s performance of her wildly successful monologue, recorded at Wyndham\u2019s theatre in London where it sold out last summer. Fleabag is available to stream on Soho theatre\u2019s On Demand site and on Amazon Prime. All proceeds will go towards charities including the National Emergencies Trust, NHS Charities Together and Acting for Others, which provides support to all theatre workers in times of need. Shakespeare\u2019s Globe Itching to get back into that wooden O on the South Bank? Happily, the Globe Player has heaps of full productions to rent, including international productions from the 2012 Globe to Globe festival such as a Lithuanian Hamlet, a Turkish Antony and Cleopatra, a Japanese Coriolanus and an Armenian King John. There is also the candlelit Sam Wanamaker Playhouse\u2019s opening production, The Duchess of Malfi, starring Gemma Arterton. On the Globe\u2019s YouTube channel, a series of free streams, each available for a fortnight, continues with The Merry Wives of Windsor (2019). Mushy: Lyrically Speaking Musharaf Asghar became a reality TV star in 2013 when the schoolboy appeared on Educating Yorkshire, which documented how a teacher helped him with his lifelong speech impediment. Asghar\u2019s tale is now the subject of a new British musical, co-produced by Rifco theatre company and Watford Palace theatre and staged last year. It\u2019s online and free to view for the entire isolation period. Read the full review. Imitating the Dog The groundbreaking theatre company Imitating the Dog were midway through touring Night of the Living Dead \u2013 Remix when theatres shut down. Now, they are streaming this ambitious show in which a cast of actors remake George Romero\u2019s classic horror film shot by shot in real time. The company have also opened up their archive to stream a selection of creations from the last 20 years. Works will be released every fortnight and are available to watch on a pay-what-you-like basis. The Beast Will Rise Philip Ridley\u2019s new play The Beast of Blue Yonder was due to open at the Southwark Playhouse in London in April. It has now been postponed but a series of new monologues by Ridley responding to the current crisis have been performed online by members of the cast, starting with Gators, starring Rachel Bright. Read the full review. Belarus Free Theatre The internet has been vital to the success of Belarus Free Theatre, one of Europe\u2019s most essential theatre companies, which is forced to operate underground in its restrictive home country after the government banned it on political grounds. The company \u2013 which turns 15 this year \u2013 is streaming archive shows throughout June. Each show will be available online for 24 hours. A School for Fools, its adaptation of Sasha Sokolov\u2019s experimental novella, is performed live on Thursdays until 9 July. Read the full review. Now I\u2019m Fine What better time is there to watch a \u201cgrand-scale experimental pop opera about keeping it together\u201d? Ahamefule J Oluo\u2019s innovative show, staged at Seattle\u2019s Moore theatre in 2014, mixes standup-style routines with a mesmerising musical accompaniment and explores his experience of a rare autoimmune disease. It is one of many films, including Americana Kamikaze, that are available to stream from On the Boards. Read the full review. Five Encounters on a Site Called Craigslist With the help of a carrot, a sponge, the Miracles and some game audience members, Sam is going to tell you about five hook-ups he had through the casual encounters section of online classified-ads board Craigslist. Filmed at the Push festival in Home, Manchester, YESYESNONO\u2019s production is an open, affecting and troubling look at searching for intimacy and connection. This hour will leave you reencountering your own life. I, Cinna The outbreak of homeschooling caused by the coronavirus has found many of us playing the role of teacher while still in our dressing gowns. And here\u2019s one unexpected tutor who really commands your attention: Jude Owusu, clad in a dirty bathrobe, with a pen behind his ear and a notepad dangling around his neck. Owusu is Cinna, the poet from Julius Caesar, in this spellbinding film of Tim Crouch\u2019s monologue. Read the full review. Alonzo King Lines Ballet A handful of productions by San Francisco-based choreographer Alonzo King and his marvellous company Lines Ballet are available to rent on Marquee.tv. Dust and Light, Triangle of the Squinches and Scheherazade, all filmed in 2012, showcase the elegant nature of his work, which pushes beyond classical ballet. Read the full review. Boys Don\u2019t The Cure\u2019s Robert Smith tried to laugh about it, cover it all up with lies, because \u2013 all together now \u2013 boys don\u2019t cry. A powerful piece of rhyme-packed storytelling for the over-eights, Boys Don\u2019t is delivered by four compelling performers and based on real-life experiences of the expectations placed on \u201clittle men\u201d throughout the generations before they even get to the playground. Presented by Half Moon theatre, it\u2019s a Papertale production in association with Apples and Snakes, staged at Brighton festival in 2018. Funny Girl Showtunes don\u2019t get much more defiant or rousing than Don\u2019t Rain on My Parade. Sheridan Smith wards off the clouds with a gritty rendition as Fanny Bryce in this production of the classic musical at Manchester\u2019s Palace theatre in 2017. It\u2019s one of the many productions available from Digital Theatre, whose offerings also include The Crucible starring Richard Armitage at the Old Vic in London, and Maxine Peake\u2019s Hamlet at the Royal Exchange in Manchester. Fragments (Beckett by Brook) Is there a more fitting playwright for our current moment of isolation, uncertainty and endurance than Beckett? In this production, filmed at the marvellously atmospheric Bouffes du Nord in Paris in 2015, Peter Brook directs five Beckett shorts with a cast of three (Jos Houben, Marcello Magni and Kathryn Hunter). The production comprises Rough for Theatre I, Rockaby, Neither, Come and Go and Act Without Words II. Feel the rising panic and despair in Rockaby as the solitary, wide-eyed Hunter recounts a descent through long, lonely days. Palermo Palermo Even by Pina Bausch\u2019s standards it\u2019s an arresting opening: a huge wall collapses on stage and across the rubble comes Julie Shanahan, in high heels and a floral frock. After desperately commanding hugs from two suitors, she takes a seat and is pelted with rotten tomatoes. And so begins an epic patchwork of masochistic rituals, nightmares and games, blending the quotidian with the phenomenal, all inspired by the choreographer\u2019s trip to Sicily. A rare chance to watch one of Bausch\u2019s creations in full and for free online. Smashed At first sight they could be Pina Bausch\u2019s dancers: a procession of performers wearing smart suits and enigmatic smiles, gliding across a stage filled with apples. Bausch\u2019s company memorably balanced apples on their heads in Palermo Palermo, but as Smashed is created by those juggling supremos Gandini, the fruit is mostly in motion here. Their Bausch homage has the same childlike games, adult fantasy and bruised humour of the German choreographer\u2019s work. Smashed is crisp, fresh and full of flavour. You may never look at an apple in the same way again \u2026 Oscar Wilde season All four productions in Classic Spring\u2019s starry Oscar Wilde season in the West End can be watched on the online service Marquee TV, which is offering a 14-day free trial. Edward and Freddie Fox play father and son in An Ideal Husband; Eve Best is a memorable Mrs Arbuthnot in A Woman of No Importance; Kathy Burke directs Lady Windermere\u2019s Fan; and Sophie Thompson is horrified by theatre\u2019s most famous handbag in The Importance of Being Earnest. Original Theatre Company This touring company had to cut short its productions of Alan Bennett\u2019s The Habit of Art, about WH Auden and Benjamin Britten, and Ali Milles\u2019s The Croft, which intertwines the lives of women over time on a Scottish Highland outpost. Both were filmed on their final performances to empty auditoriums and are available to rent online. Gwen Taylor stars in The Croft and Matthew Kelly is in The Habit of Art. Ghost Quartet If you missed its run at Soho\u2019s Boulevard theatre, here\u2019s a chance to savour Dave Malloy\u2019s song cycle, filmed in New York in 2015. Alternately rousing and yearning, this is a gorgeous hymn to barflies, precious memories and the joys of being a ghost, told with a dash of Edgar Allan Poe and Thelonious Monk. It\u2019s a glorious get-together of a show, as warming as the whiskey handed out to the audience \u2013 but you\u2019ll have to pour your own. Key Change Open Clasp is a women\u2019s theatre company aiming to \u201cchange the world, one play at a time\u201d. Key Change, now available to stream online, is a fantastic introduction to their consistently impressive work with women who are on the margins of society; in this case, prisoners at HM Prison Low Newton, who devised the 2015 show with the theatre group over several months in order to break down stigma and enlighten audiences. It was filmed in partnership with The Space. Crossings Rural touring company Pentabus are releasing shows from their archive every Friday over a period of three months. Deirdre Kinahan\u2019s play Crossings is, according to our critic Arifa Akbar, \u201can unexpected and touching drama about unlikely friendships, postwar homosexuality and the cost of war for women\u201d. Read the full review. Snow Mouse You have to hunt to find full theatre productions for very young audiences online, so here\u2019s a little treat. To mark World Day of Theatre for Children on 20 March the lovely Egg in Bath released their wintry 40-minute tale for the under-fours. The Show Must Go Online The actor Robert Myles has set up a live-streamed reading group for professional and amateur actors to perform Shakespeare\u2019s complete plays in the order they\u2019re believed to have been written. The Guardian\u2019s very own Stephen Moss took on the role of the Duke of Burgundy in Henry VI Part I. Peeping Tom trilogy The brilliant Belgian dance-theatre company turned 20 this year and are best known in the UK for performing at London international mime festival and for their trilogy comprising Mother, Father and Child. Their brand of domestic terror, hope and ennui will strike a chord at this troubling time. Watch their first trilogy (Le Jardin, Le Salon and Le Sous Sol) online. The School for Wives Travel restrictions needn\u2019t prevent you from enjoying international theatre online. Paris\u2019s esteemed Od\u00e9on has released its 2018 production of Moli\u00e8re\u2019s satirical 1662 comedy of manners and cuckoldry. Claude Duparfait stars as the foolish Arnolphe, and St\u00e9phane Braunschweig directs. English subtitles available, \u00e9videmment. Read the full review. 5 Soldiers Rosie Kay\u2019s extraordinary 5 Soldiers: The Body Is the Frontline was staged in army drill halls around the UK, but, since its livestream is still available online, you can watch it from the comfort of your own sofa. Performing in close quarters to a score that mixes punk and opera, Kay\u2019s phenomenal company bring home the horror of combat and disarm audiences. The Wind in the Willows Julian Fellowes, George Stiles and Anthony Drewe teamed up to deliver a merry new version of Kenneth Grahame\u2019s classic, staged at the London Palladium in 2017, with Rufus Hound wearing 50 shades of green as Mr Toad. It\u2019s available to rent online, with the option to donate to help provide financial and emotional support to theatre workers. Girls Like That London\u2019s Unicorn theatre has a world-class reputation for theatre for young audiences and its production of Evan Placey\u2019s Girls Like That gripped the roomful of teenagers I watched it with in 2014. It\u2019s online in full and offers a raw account of adolescent anxiety, slut-shaming and self-belief. In-your-face theatre that stays in your mind. Le Patin Libre Think dance on ice and you\u2019d imagine sequins and staggering TV celebrities, but the Canadian troupe, Le Patin Libre, has taken the art form into a new dimension. In their double bill, Vertical Influences, the skaters turned the rink into a mesmerising stage slowly decorated by the patterns cut by their blades. John Leguizamo\u2019s Latin History for Morons Self-isolation may mean that many of us will use living rooms to both teach children and watch theatre. An opportunity to combine the two can be found courtesy of the super-charismatic John Leguizamo \u2013 an inspirational tutor if ever there was \u2013 whose one-man Broadway show, Latin History for Morons, is on Netflix. Woke LIVR is a subscription service that enables you to catch up on theatre in 360-degree virtual reality. Pop your smartphone into the headset they send you and experience a range of shows including Apphia Campbell\u2019s show Woke, which interweaves the stories of Black Panther Assata Shakur and the 2014 Ferguson riots. The award-winning Patricia Gets Ready, written by Martha Watson Allpress, is also available from LIVR. Timpson: The Musical Two households, both alike in dignity \u2026 well, sort of. Our narrator, a talking portrait, lays our scene in Victorian London, and this musical comedy imagines the founding of the popular shoe-repair chain as a union between two companies, the Montashoes and the Keypulets. Watch Gigglemug Theatre\u2019s show on YouTube. My Left Nut This is cheating as it\u2019s a TV series, but BBC Three\u2019s superb comedy drama is based on one of the most uproarious and affecting fringe theatre shows of recent years. It\u2019s based on Michael Patrick\u2019s own teenage experience of a medical condition that left his testicle \u201cso big you could play it like a bongo\u201d. Wince. Rosas Danst Rosas Love dance? Need to exercise at home? Then join the queen of Belgian avant-garde performance Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker as she talks you through how to perform her 1983 classic, Rosas Danst Rosas. All you need is a chair, a bit of legroom and enough space to swing your hair.",

But there was a lot about the situation that vexed me.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what actually happened. On a live late-night comedy show, speaking from her kitchen because of the lockdown, Margolyes described the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis as \u201ca disgrace\u201d and \u201ca public scandal\u201d and then went on: \u201cI had difficulty not wanting Boris Johnson&nbsp;to die, I wanted him to die, and then I thought that reflects badly on me and I don\u2019t want to be the sort of person who wants people to die. So, then I wanted him to get better, which he did do, he did get better, but he didn\u2019t get better as a human being and I really would prefer that.\u201d The remarks elicited 494 complaints (after being widely reported in the press) and led to \u201can initial investigation\u201d by Ofcom, which concluded on Monday that&nbsp;Margolyes will not face \u201can official investigation\u201d.</p> <p>For the avoidance of doubt, let me first say that I think what she said was absolutely fine. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actively nice to hope Boris Johnson dies, but neither does Margolyes, as she herself made clear \u2013 it was intrinsic to the point she was making. She found herself hoping it and didn\u2019t want to be someone who hoped it and so she stopped herself hoping it. What exactly is the problem? She was being interesting and truthful. In an age of relentless celebrity virtue-signalling, surely this is refreshing.</p> <p>Perhaps some people didn\u2019t believe she stopped hoping it. But then they\u2019ve only got her word for it that she hoped it in the first place. Are people cross because she might have lied about her hopes? Presumably not. Presumably they\u2019re mainly cross because she told the truth about her hopes. They think she should have kept her horrible hopes to herself. Or do they actually take issue with her right to hope what she hoped? Do they think that someone who could hope a nasty thing like that shouldn\u2019t be on television no matter what they say?</p> <p>Anyway, she\u2019s been \u201ccleared\u201d. But I don\u2019t love the sound of that. Someone on television honestly expressing the moral complexity of their feelings at an exceptionally difficult time has been condescendingly told, a month later, that actually that was OK after all. Of course it was OK! The very idea that it\u2019s not OK is what\u2019s not OK!</p> <p>Ofcom has investigated to the point where it has concluded that it doesn\u2019t need to investigate. But what\u2019s to investigate anyway? It\u2019s not a crime scene, it\u2019s a clip. Just watch the clip \u2013 investigation over. What would the full investigation have consisted of? Watching the clip a thousand times? Interrogating Margolyes to find out what other things she\u2019s hoped that might elicit Tory disapproval?</p> <p>The exoneration is expressed in such tentative terms: \u201cThese provocative comments had clear potential to offend viewers,\u201d Ofcom said, but excused them because Margolyes is \u201cknown for her forthright views\u201d, she \u201cimmediately qualified her comments\u201d and the audience was \u201cwarned in advance about the programme\u2019s adult humour\u201d. Except it wasn\u2019t really humour. She wasn\u2019t joking, laughingly saying she\u2019d toyed with wanting the prime minister to die. Frankly, the complainants\u2019 consternation would have been more justified if she had been. But she was just expressing how she felt.</p> <p>So what\u2019s the offence? The concept of someone hoping someone else dies is widely discussed in our culture; it\u2019s solidly pre-watershed and central to most murder mysteries. So that can\u2019t be the problem. And Margolyes hasn\u2019t alleged that anyone else hoped Johnson would die \u2013 that might have been problematic. Although implying that one person secretly hopes another person will die is quite a well-mined comic seam and the basis for half the jokes that are made about Prince Charles.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The concept of someone hoping someone else dies is widely discussed in our culture</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Coincidentally, around the same time as the Margolyes non-offence, I wanted to put a joke on Twitter about someone hoping Boris Johnson died. After he\u2019d recovered and was back in Downing Street, there was a headline on the BBC News website that read: \u201c\u2018Contingency plans\u2019 for Johnson\u2019s death made, says PM.\u201d And I was absolutely itching to quote it and add \u201cApparently Michael Gove was up all night\u201d. Or \u201cNever has Michael Gove worked so conscientiously\u201d. Or \u201cThat was a real passion project for Michael Gove\u201d.

But Gove\u2019s history of unsuccessful political treachery makes it funny to imagine him hoping it. His clumsy attempts at metaphorical backstabbing in the past make the thought of his feverishly plotting the aftermath of Johnson\u2019s viral demise an amusing image. To me, anyway.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t tweet it though, because social media is an absolute Willy Wonka\u2019s chocolate factory for confected outrage. Since I don\u2019t like the government, my joke would have been wilfully misinterpreted as an aggressive partisan statement. The humour would have been ignored and a claque of government loyalists would have spent a few days denouncing me for vindictively imputing such savage instincts to a selfless public servant like Michael Gove. And I didn\u2019t fancy that, so I kept quiet.</p> <p>Margolyes is made of sterner stuff. She was asked to say what she felt and she did. It didn\u2019t reflect well on the government. But the government doesn\u2019t have to address that. It\u2019s been let off the hook because 494 people declared themselves disgusted by the mere notion that hoping someone dies could be within the bounds of psychological possibility. So we have a superfluous and objectionable debate about whether the remark should have been allowed and her heartfelt criticism of the government\u2019s pandemic response is entirely neutralised.</p>",

Since I don\u2019t like the government, my joke would have been wilfully misinterpreted as an aggressive partisan statement. The humour would have been ignored and a claque of government loyalists would have spent a few days denouncing me for vindictively imputing such savage instincts to a selfless public servant like Michael Gove. And I didn\u2019t fancy that, so I kept quiet. Margolyes is made of sterner stuff. She was asked to say what she felt and she did. It didn\u2019t reflect well on the government. But the government doesn\u2019t have to address that. It\u2019s been let off the hook because 494 people declared themselves disgusted by the mere notion that hoping someone dies could be within the bounds of psychological possibility. So we have a superfluous and objectionable debate about whether the remark should have been allowed and her heartfelt criticism of the government\u2019s pandemic response is entirely neutralised.",

The fifth circuit, for example, covers the Republican strongholds of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, making it the likely final arbiter on the constitutionality of a slew of conservative laws.</p> <p>\u201cFor the overwhelming number of cases, the constitutional rights of the people in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi will be made by Kyle Duncan and the other ultra-conservatives on the fifth circuit,\u201d said Daniel Goldberg, legal director at the progressive judicial non-profit the Alliance for Justice.</p> <p>Five of the 17 active judges on the fifth circuit are Trump appointees, making an already right-leaning appeals court arguably \u201cone of the most, probably the most, conservative\u201d in the nation, Goldberg added.</p> <p>The mantle is significant. While most attention tends to fall on the supreme court, that court only hears around 100 cases in a year. Appeals courts collectively handle in the range of 50,000. The nation\u2019s 94 district courts are geographically organized into 12 circuits, which hear the bulk of appeals, and from those cases, the US Supreme Court chooses just a fraction.</p> <p>It was a fifth circuit panel that ruled to uphold Louisiana\u2019s admitting privileges law in 2018, despite the fact the Texas law had been struck down two years prior. In early 2019, the full bench of the fifth circuit voted to refuse to re-hear the case, forcing the supreme court\u2019s hand and setting the stage for this summer\u2019s looming decision. Since he\u2019d represented Louisiana, Duncan abstained from the court\u2019s decision.</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s other four appointees were among the nine judges that upheld Louisiana\u2019s law. One, James Ho, has since made headlines for decrying the <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/07/judge-james-ho-attacks-abortion-rights-while-accusing-a-lower-court-of-anti-christian-bias.html\">\u201cthe moral tragedy of abortion\u201d</a> in an opinion. Others have criticized the Voting Rights Act \u2013 a civil-rights era law that forced states with histories of violent voter suppression to obtain approval from the justice department over changes to elections, a law that conservatives on the supreme court gutted in 2013.</p> <p>Duncan is a lawyer with \u201cproven culture wars credentials\u201d, said Amanda Bursky-Hollis, author of Ideas with Consequences: The Federalist Society and the Conservative Counterrevolution. </p> <p>The vote to confirm his appointment to the fifth circuit bench split along party lines, 50-47, and his bid was aided by the conservative <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/leonard-leo-federalists-society-courts/\">Judicial Crisis Network</a> \u2013 an ally of the Federalist Society, a conservative group that has aided Trump by selecting judges for him to nominate. The Judicial Crisis Network spent tens of thousands of dollars on TV ads in Louisiana praising Duncan after Senator John Kennedy expressed skepticism at giving a seat conventionally held for a Louisianaian to a \u201cWashington lawyer\u201d. By the time of Duncan\u2019s nomination hearing, Kennedy hailed Duncan as \u201cstaunchly and vociferously pro-life\u201d and \u201cpro-religious liberty\u201d.</p> <h2>In favor of religious liberty</h2> <p>Duncan, a married father of five, was born in Baton Rouge in 1972. </p> <p>Religious liberty is Duncan\u2019s specialty, going back to his time in the mid-2000\u2019s as a professor of law at the University of Mississippi, where his scholarship centered on the separation of church and state. Duncan has argued alongside the religious liberty powerhouse the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/20/alliance-defending-freedom-multimillion-dollar-conservative-christian-group-attacking-lgbtq-rights\">Alliance Defending Freedom</a> (ADF) and taught at its <a href=\"http://www.adfmedia.org/News/PRDetail/8\">Blackstone Legal Fellowship</a>, a kind of career boot camp for elite Christian lawyers that the ADF calls a \u201cministry\u201d.</p> <p>Duncan made his name in 2014 at the boutique religious rights firm <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/becket-fund-law-firm-gaining-a-reputation-as-powerhouse-after-hobby-lobby-win/2014/07/20/c28931a4-104c-11e4-8936-26932bcfd6ed_story.html\">the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty</a>, when he was the lead counsel on the victorious supreme court contraception case <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jun/30/supreme-court-employers-religious-objections-contraception\">Burwell v</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jun/30/supreme-court-employers-religious-objections-contraception\"> Hobby Lobby Stores</a>. That pivotal decision laid the groundwork for corporations to opt out of providing birth control for employees based on religious objections, and it preceded <a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/supreme-court-to-consider-trump-policy-allowing-employers-and-universities-to-deny-birth-control-coverage-to-employees-and-students-2\">another major contraception case the court heard this spring</a>, one that could further favor the religious and moral objections of employers over the rights of their employees to access health care.</p> <p>Duncan is a devout Catholic. Before his appointment to the fifth circuit, on mornings before he was scheduled to argue before the supreme court, he would <a href=\"https://www.heritage.org/courts/commentary/scotus-101-very-federalist-podcast\">recite the rosary</a> to calm himself.</p> <p>A large part of his career as an appellate court specialist was spent defending Republican state laws popular with the religious right and social conservatives. He fought to keep Louisiana\u2019s same-sex marriage ban: the matter belongs in the states, would have \u201cunforeseen\u201d consequences, and LGBTQ rights have \u201c<em><a href=\"https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2015/04/14894/\">nothing</a></em>\u201d (his empasis) to do with civil rights cases, he argued. He defended a North Carolina anti-trans bathroom law and a similar Virginia school board policy. And he argued in favor of a North Carolina voter ID regulation that the fourth circuit found targeted African Americans \u201cwith almost surgical precision\u201d.</p> <p>Paul Baier, a law professor at LSU who never taught Duncan, supported his nomination despite having argued against him in the same-sex marriage case at the Louisiana supreme court. Duncan is a \u201csuperb advocate\u201d and a \u201cvery careful, painstaking judge\u201d, he said. He described Duncan\u2019s reasoning in his opinion to uphold Texas\u2019s coronavirus-related abortion ban as an \u201cexemplar of the studious judge judging\u201d.</p> <p>The Federalist Society acts as an alternative to the American Bar Association with a monopoly on Republican nominees, Hollis-Brusky said, strategically placing people like Duncan who can\u2019t be dismissed as a \u201ccrazy Christian\u201d or \u201cBible-thumper\u201d.</p> <p>Over the course of his nomination process in 2017, Democratic senator Diane Feinstein questioned him about some of the arguments he\u2019d made in past controversial cases. Duncan <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Duncan%20Responses%20to%20QFRs.pdf\">responded</a> by stating that \u201cin representing clients I do not advance my personal views, but the interests of my clients\u201d.</p> <p>During his nomination hearing, Duncan presented himself as fair-minded and reasonable. He strove especially to reassure Democratic Senator Dick Durbin over his record of advancing religious rights above all others.</p> <p>\u201cWhere do we draw the line with your right as an individual,\u201d asked Durbin, \u201cas opposed to my right to assert religious liberty?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a balance, it\u2019s gotta be a balance,\u201d Duncan replied.</p> <p>He referenced the Hobby Lobby case, describing it as a \u201cclose case\u201d because \u201cwomen would be deprived\u201d of contraception.</p> <p>Three years earlier, Duncan had used opposite terms. \u201cWe find ourselves in the midst of what we see, and what we see correctly, as one of the most flagrant attacks on religious liberty that that we\u2019ve ever seen in this country,\u201d Duncan told a panel in 2014.</p> <p>\u201cAnd most importantly, from our point of view, it\u2019s not about striking the appropriate balance,\u201d he went on. \u201cThe first amendment has struck the balance for us, and that balance is in favor of religious liberty.\u201d</p> <p>Few Trump appointees have survived the nomination process without outrage from progressive groups. Duncan is no exception.</p> <p>\u201cThe specific judges the Federalist Society supported are selected by the president to implement his agenda of dismantling health care, eliminating civil, women and workers rights and shielding his wealth and actions from public scrutiny,\u201d said Nan Aron, the founder of the Alliance for Justice.</p> <p>Duncan summed up his life\u2019s work in 2014, in <a href=\"https://issuu.com/dajohnson/docs/ilco_winter_2014_flipbook_web\">an article</a> for the Ivy League Christian Observer. \u201cAll I really want to do,\u201d he said, \u201cis what God wants me to do with the talents he gave me.\u201d</p>",

The case, June Medical Services v Russo, is one of the most high-profile supreme court cases of the year, after Donald Trump appointed two justices who tipped the balance of the court to a conservative majority. And it might never have reached the supreme court without the aid of another Trump-appointed judge, Stuart Kyle Duncan. The Louisiana case centers on law that would force abortion doctors to gain permission to admit and treat patients at nearby hospitals, known as \u2018admitting privileges\u2019 \u2013 a bureaucratic hurdle that has been shown to shut down a large swath of abortion clinics. The supreme court ruled an almost identical Texas law unconstitutional in 2016, but Louisiana is arguing that what is unconstitutional in Texas can still be constitutional across the state border. Duncan fought the Louisiana case while in private practice until the spring of 2018, when he was confirmed as one of Trump\u2019s five lifetime appointments to the fifth circuit court of appeals. This year, several states have sought to severely restrict a woman\u2019s right to abortion by designating it an elective treatment that is not necessary during the coronavirus pandemic.

In early 2019, the full bench of the fifth circuit voted to refuse to re-hear the case, forcing the supreme court\u2019s hand and setting the stage for this summer\u2019s looming decision. Since he\u2019d represented Louisiana, Duncan abstained from the court\u2019s decision. But Trump\u2019s other four appointees were among the nine judges that upheld Louisiana\u2019s law. One, James Ho, has since made headlines for decrying the \u201cthe moral tragedy of abortion\u201d in an opinion. Others have criticized the Voting Rights Act \u2013 a civil-rights era law that forced states with histories of violent voter suppression to obtain approval from the justice department over changes to elections, a law that conservatives on the supreme court gutted in 2013. Duncan is a lawyer with \u201cproven culture wars credentials\u201d, said Amanda Bursky-Hollis, author of Ideas with Consequences: The Federalist Society and the Conservative Counterrevolution. The vote to confirm his appointment to the fifth circuit bench split along party lines, 50-47, and his bid was aided by the conservative Judicial Crisis Network \u2013 an ally of the Federalist Society, a conservative group that has aided Trump by selecting judges for him to nominate. The Judicial Crisis Network spent tens of thousands of dollars on TV ads in Louisiana praising Duncan after Senator John Kennedy expressed skepticism at giving a seat conventionally held for a Louisianaian to a \u201cWashington lawyer\u201d. By the time of Duncan\u2019s nomination hearing, Kennedy hailed Duncan as \u201cstaunchly and vociferously pro-life\u201d and \u201cpro-religious liberty\u201d. In favor of religious liberty Duncan, a married father of five, was born in Baton Rouge in 1972. Religious liberty is Duncan\u2019s specialty, going back to his time in the mid-2000\u2019s as a professor of law at the University of Mississippi, where his scholarship centered on the separation of church and state. Duncan has argued alongside the religious liberty powerhouse the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) and taught at its Blackstone Legal Fellowship, a kind of career boot camp for elite Christian lawyers that the ADF calls a \u201cministry\u201d. Duncan made his name in 2014 at the boutique religious rights firm the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, when he was the lead counsel on the victorious supreme court contraception case Burwell v Hobby Lobby Stores. That pivotal decision laid the groundwork for corporations to opt out of providing birth control for employees based on religious objections, and it preceded another major contraception case the court heard this spring, one that could further favor the religious and moral objections of employers over the rights of their employees to access health care. Duncan is a devout Catholic. Before his appointment to the fifth circuit, on mornings before he was scheduled to argue before the supreme court, he would recite the rosary to calm himself. A large part of his career as an appellate court specialist was spent defending Republican state laws popular with the religious right and social conservatives. He fought to keep Louisiana\u2019s same-sex marriage ban: the matter belongs in the states, would have \u201cunforeseen\u201d consequences, and LGBTQ rights have \u201cnothing\u201d (his empasis) to do with civil rights cases, he argued. He defended a North Carolina anti-trans bathroom law and a similar Virginia school board policy. And he argued in favor of a North Carolina voter ID regulation that the fourth circuit found targeted African Americans \u201cwith almost surgical precision\u201d. Paul Baier, a law professor at LSU who never taught Duncan, supported his nomination despite having argued against him in the same-sex marriage case at the Louisiana supreme court. Duncan is a \u201csuperb advocate\u201d and a \u201cvery careful, painstaking judge\u201d, he said. He described Duncan\u2019s reasoning in his opinion to uphold Texas\u2019s coronavirus-related abortion ban as an \u201cexemplar of the studious judge judging\u201d. The Federalist Society acts as an alternative to the American Bar Association with a monopoly on Republican nominees, Hollis-Brusky said, strategically placing people like Duncan who can\u2019t be dismissed as a \u201ccrazy Christian\u201d or \u201cBible-thumper\u201d. Over the course of his nomination process in 2017, Democratic senator Diane Feinstein questioned him about some of the arguments he\u2019d made in past controversial cases. Duncan responded by stating that \u201cin representing clients I do not advance my personal views, but the interests of my clients\u201d. During his nomination hearing, Duncan presented himself as fair-minded and reasonable. He strove especially to reassure Democratic Senator Dick Durbin over his record of advancing religious rights above all others. \u201cWhere do we draw the line with your right as an individual,\u201d asked Durbin, \u201cas opposed to my right to assert religious liberty?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a balance, it\u2019s gotta be a balance,\u201d Duncan replied. He referenced the Hobby Lobby case, describing it as a \u201cclose case\u201d because \u201cwomen would be deprived\u201d of contraception. Three years earlier, Duncan had used opposite terms. \u201cWe find ourselves in the midst of what we see, and what we see correctly, as one of the most flagrant attacks on religious liberty that that we\u2019ve ever seen in this country,\u201d Duncan told a panel in 2014. \u201cAnd most importantly, from our point of view, it\u2019s not about striking the appropriate balance,\u201d he went on. \u201cThe first amendment has struck the balance for us, and that balance is in favor of religious liberty.\u201d Few Trump appointees have survived the nomination process without outrage from progressive groups. Duncan is no exception. \u201cThe specific judges the Federalist Society supported are selected by the president to implement his agenda of dismantling health care, eliminating civil, women and workers rights and shielding his wealth and actions from public scrutiny,\u201d said Nan Aron, the founder of the Alliance for Justice. Duncan summed up his life\u2019s work in 2014, in an article for the Ivy League Christian Observer. \u201cAll I really want to do,\u201d he said, \u201cis what God wants me to do with the talents he gave me.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>You probably will not have heard of Shopify, or be able to say what the company does, but you will almost certainly have used it. The joggers you found on Instagram at the beginning of lockdown and have worn continually since? Those Gymshark shorts you haven\u2019t used for months, now the gyms are closed? The coffee beans you bought online and ground at home, while you waited for the cafes to reopen? </p> <p>Shopify provides the technology for anyone to set up a store and sell their products online, from the visible end of the website to the processing capabilities necessary to add stock, track inventory and complete sales. Because it is affordable, Shopify is favoured by small- to medium-size brands that can\u2019t afford to pay for costly, custom website builds. Basic packages start at \u00a329 per month. About 1m brands use its services, including major names such as Pepsi and Fashion Nova, and 80,000 of those merchants are based in the UK.&nbsp;</p> <p>As the high street has struggled, and platforms such as Instagram become unlikely e-commerce giants, Shopify has exploded in popularity. Nearly 300 million consumers around the world purchased from a Spotify merchant in 2019 alone. It has proved to be a winning proposition: if <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/12/15/if-invested-5000-shopify-ipo-this-is-how-have-now.aspx\">you\u2019d invested</a> $5,100 in Shopify in 2015, when the company went public, your initial investment would be worth around $111,000: an astronomical 2,076% return on your investment.&nbsp;But Shopify still hasn\u2019t achieved mainstream consumer recognition. \u201cIt\u2019s everywhere, but nowhere at the same time,\u201d explains Prof Sean Sands, a retail and e-commerce expert at Swinburne University, Melbourne.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afcfaebd20ab6a11cbc656edba1d6482e36dffeb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afcfaebd20ab6a11cbc656edba1d6482e36dffeb/0_0_5184_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Employees at Shopify\u2019s Waterloo, Ontario, headquarters.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Employees at Shopify\u2019s Waterloo, Ontario, headquarters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not any more. With the launch of <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/shop\">Shop</a>, Shopify\u2019s new consumer shopping app, the company is stepping into the limelight. The new app saves stores from having to build their own and serves up product recommendations to users about brands that they\u2019ve already shown interest in \u2013 there are no ads. \u201cThe way to think about Shop is that it\u2019s really a personal shopping assistant,\u201d says Harley Finkelstein, Shopify\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cIt\u2019s an app that allows for a more intuitive online shopping experience.\u201d The app is already operational in the US; a British launch has not yet been set.</p> <p>It\u2019s an ambitious move that would position Shopify as a competitor to the likes of Amazon or Etsy. But Finkelstein is insistent that they aren\u2019t trying to steal Amazon\u2019s crown. \u201cThe intention is not to make a marketplace,\u201d he says, \u201cbut to allow consumers to find not only new local businesses, but also to interact with their favourite brands.\u201d Unlike Amazon, Shopify won\u2019t hold stock \u2013 brands will control their own supply chains, unless they choose to use Shopify\u2019s shipping capabilities.&nbsp;</p> <p>Whether or not Shop is an online marketplace is a moot point. It\u2019s worth pointing out that, unlike with other online marketplaces, brands using Shop won\u2019t get short shrift: apart from Shopify\u2019s payment transaction fee (which is between 2.4 and 2.9%), Shop won\u2019t charge brands commission to rent space on the platform. By comparison, Amazon charges 75p per item, plus fees of between 7% and 45%. \u201cThe way Shopify benefits is that [Shop] helps more consumers buy from more Shopify stores,\u201d Finkelstein explains. \u201cAs they succeed, we succeed with them.\u201d</p> <p>Is Shopify the next great retail behemoth? Not just yet. But that\u2019s how they want it. \u201cWe like the positioning of us being the brand behind the brand that makes entrepreneurs look great,\u201d says Finkelstein. \u201cI think maybe this is our Canadian side showing a little bit.\u201d (Shopify is based in Ottawa.) Analyst Richard Tse at the National Bank of Canada has been tracking Shopify stock since the company\u2019s 2015 flotation. \u201cEveryone says they\u2019re trying to compete with Amazon,\u201d says Tse. \u201cAnd on the surface it [Shop] may look like that. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59b9bb8c96e5c8c51ffa3a7e4bc32ac831101864\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59b9bb8c96e5c8c51ffa3a7e4bc32ac831101864/0_0_5340_3278/1000.jpg\" alt=\"an advertisement for shopify on new york\u2019s lower east side, 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"614\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An advertisement for Shopify on New York\u2019s Lower East Side, 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Levine/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> But what they\u2019re really trying to do is drive more business to their merchant clients.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Is there any cause for Amazon boss Jeff Bezos to feel alarmed? Possibly. Research from eMarketer showed that Shopify last year overtook eBay\u2019s share of e-commerce sales in the US, leaving it second only to Amazon. If Shop takes off, it will be an attractive proposition for small- to medium-size retailers tired of Amazon\u2019s high fees and aggressive approach to its vendor partners. Finkelstein has pledged that Shopify won\u2019t use Shop to imitate one of Amazon\u2019s most notorious practices: creating white-label versions of bestselling products and selling them at a cheaper price, effectively undercutting retailers.</p> <p>Shopify is almost comically simple to use: it requires next-to-no technical or coding skills. \u201cIt\u2019s really easy,\u201d says Tamsin Gordon, a marketing manager at boutique jewellery brand Maya Magal. Gordon used to work at online retailer Not on the High Street, where she\u2019d be reliant on developers to manage the website for her. When Gordon moved to Maya Magal, which is a much smaller operation \u2013 there are only four staff in the head office \u2013 she started managing the site herself. \u201cIt\u2019s straightforward,\u201d she says. \u201cI can change the front end of the website, do stock counts, pull analytics, check what\u2019s selling \u2013 I can do all that myself. Before, I\u2019d have to get the tech guys to do it.\u201d</p> <p>Shopify has made starting an online business accessible. \u201cTechnology has fundamentally democratised one\u2019s ability to build a big business,\u201d says Finkelstein, \u201cand Shopify is a major part of that\u2026 what we\u2019re trying to do is simply level the playing field, so that small businesses can compete with the largest hegemonic corporations and retailers.\u201d Finkelstein uses the example of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/19/kylie-jenner-makes-600m-from-selling-majority-share-in-her-beauty-company\">Kylie Cosmetics</a> \u2013 reality TV star Kylie Jenner recently sold a majority stake in the firm to Coty in a $600m deal \u2013 to illustrate his point. He tells me that Kylie Cosmetics only has 13 full-time employees. \u201cThey\u2019re challenging the likes of Sephora, Mac, and L\u2019Or\u00e9al, but doing it with fewer people,\u201d Finkelstein says. \u201cThey [Kylie Cosmetics] are able to use Shopify technology to leverage their existing community and sell to a global audience.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6bfb8c08a5ee22b3bac6b0089bb65f1fc9a9497b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bfb8c08a5ee22b3bac6b0089bb65f1fc9a9497b/0_0_2098_3144/667.jpg\" alt=\"kylie jenner, whose cosmetics company kylie cosmetics uses shopify\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kylie Jenner, whose cosmetics company Kylie Cosmetics uses Shopify.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Startraks/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What\u2019s also remarkable about Shopify is the fact that the company appears recession-proof. It was founded by Tobias L\u00fctke in 2006, after the German-born Canadian entrepreneur set up an online snowboard shop and realised there was a gap in the market for a technology platform that would easily allow you to create and customise an online store. In 2008, the nascent company hit the financial crisis and, astonishingly, continued to grow. \u201cWhen the economy is going through a tough time Shopify has traditionally done well,\u201d Finkelstein says. He explains: \u201cIf you\u2019ve lost your job or need to supplement your income, a great way to do that is by starting a small business.\u201d</p> <p>As in 2008, the coronavirus-induced global recession has proved lucrative.&nbsp;\u201cEven before the pandemic, between 10 and 15% of retail activities were conducted through e-commerce,\u201d says Tse. \u201cShopify recognised that there was an opportunity to build a platform, products and services that cater to that shift.\u201d Coronavirus has been a stiff tailwind in Shopify\u2019s sails. \u201cWe saw new stores created on our platform grow by 62% more between 13 March and 24 April than in the previous six weeks,\u201d says Finkelstein. \u201cFar more people now are trying their hand at entrepreneurship.\u201d In the UK, new online store creations grew 70% in the same period.</p> <p>To accommodate this surge in entrepreneurs registering new brands \u2013 and consumers increasingly turning online for their purchases \u2013 the team rushed out new, Covid-19-complementary features. \u201cThe objective was to create products to help entrepreneurs and small businesses survive this thing,\u201d says Finkelstein. They quickly introduced gift cards and features to enable in-store collection.</p> <p>Shopify\u2019s impact on retail is not uniformly positive \u2013 it is an enabler of the sometimes dubious practise of dropshipping. If you\u2019ve purchased clothes from an Instagram brand that took ages to arrive, looked nothing like the photographs and were terrible quality, you\u2019ve probably fallen victim to dropshippers. Some dropshippers set up Shopify stores to market products they\u2019ve found from other vendors \u2013 typically, AliExpress, the \u201cChinese Amazon\u201d \u2013 and use Instagram and Facebook ads to market them to consumers. When they bite, the dropshipper places the order with the vendor and has it shipped directly to the customer, pocketing the mark-up.&nbsp;</p> <p>Dropshipping from China is often a bad experience for buyers. Predictably, Finkelstein disagrees: many of Shopify\u2019s merchant vendors are dropshippers, who favour the platform for the ease and speed with which they can set up dropshipping stores. \u201cIn my view, dropshipping is basically a great entryway into entrepreneurship for people that are risk-averse,\u201d Finkelstein says. Later, he adds: \u201cCustomers don\u2019t really care [if their products are dropshipped].\u201d Dropshippers will be allowed on the Shop app.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"223de8d17e6c1b6a16f11b3faa2fb842ffafd096\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/223de8d17e6c1b6a16f11b3faa2fb842ffafd096/0_0_4208_2794/1000.jpg\" alt=\"shopify founder tobi l\u00fctke talks to the canadian prime minister, justin trudeau\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shopify founder and CEO Tobi L\u00fctke talks to the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, during the company\u2019s annual partner conference in Toronto, May 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Canadian Press/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sophie Slater, of the sustainable fashion brand Birdsong, which uses Shopify technology, is cautious about using Shop due to the dropshippers on the platform. \u201cIf you look at something like Etsy [the online marketplace],\u201d Slater says, \u201cthey had good intentions, were certified as a B Corp [an ethical accreditation system for businesses], but then they allowed dropshipping, which ruined its appeal.\u201d </p> <p>Shopify\u2019s impact on our retail habits has been disruptive. It has facilitated the challenger brands \u2013 small, scrappy upstarts with lean teams and low overheads \u2013 that even now are becoming the established incumbents - Kylie Cosmetics, Jeffree Star, Gymshark, Allbirds. Such is their ubiquity, it\u2019s easy to forget that all these companies were only founded in the last decade. All use Shopify. Older brands are increasingly looking to these new kids on the block and trying to imitate their success. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing larger brands trying to act more entrepreneurial\u2026 brands like Heinz ketchup or Lindt chocolate are using Shopify because they themselves want to be able to build a retail model that is flexible, adaptable and they don\u2019t necessarily want to hire 300 people to run a direct-to-consumer business,\u201d Finkelstein says.</p> <p>Already the coronavirus pandemic has cost us some leading brands: Warehouse,&nbsp;Debenhams and Laura Ashley have all gone into administration. The Centre for Retail Research <a href=\"https://www.drapersonline.com/news/coronavirus-20000-permanent-store-closures-on-horizon/7039932.article\">predicts that</a> more than 20,000 British shops will close in 2020, a 28% increase on 2019. Is Shopify accelerating the decline of our high streets? \u201cThis is really a tale of two retail worlds,\u201d says Finkelstein. \u201cOn the one side, there are the retailers that are resistant to change\u2026 on the other side, you have the resilient retailers, who have reacted to Covid in a completely different way. They\u2019ve embraced new opportunities, they\u2019ve enabled kerbside pickup and local delivery options.\u201d These resilient retailers will thrive, Finkelstein insists. </p> <p>Shopify\u2019s impact on our consumer and retail habits is only beginning to be felt. It transformed selling, making it possible for the Davids of the retail world to take on the corporate Goliaths and win. Will the Shop app transform the way we buy? Very possibly.</p>",

      "bodyText": "You probably will not have heard of Shopify, or be able to say what the company does, but you will almost certainly have used it. The joggers you found on Instagram at the beginning of lockdown and have worn continually since? Those Gymshark shorts you haven\u2019t used for months, now the gyms are closed? The coffee beans you bought online and ground at home, while you waited for the cafes to reopen? Shopify provides the technology for anyone to set up a store and sell their products online, from the visible end of the website to the processing capabilities necessary to add stock, track inventory and complete sales. Because it is affordable, Shopify is favoured by small- to medium-size brands that can\u2019t afford to pay for costly, custom website builds. Basic packages start at \u00a329 per month. About 1m brands use its services, including major names such as Pepsi and Fashion Nova, and 80,000 of those merchants are based in the UK. As the high street has struggled, and platforms such as Instagram become unlikely e-commerce giants, Shopify has exploded in popularity. Nearly 300 million consumers around the world purchased from a Spotify merchant in 2019 alone. It has proved to be a winning proposition: if you\u2019d invested $5,100 in Shopify in 2015, when the company went public, your initial investment would be worth around $111,000: an astronomical 2,076% return on your investment. But Shopify still hasn\u2019t achieved mainstream consumer recognition. \u201cIt\u2019s everywhere, but nowhere at the same time,\u201d explains Prof Sean Sands, a retail and e-commerce expert at Swinburne University, Melbourne. Not any more. With the launch of Shop, Shopify\u2019s new consumer shopping app, the company is stepping into the limelight. The new app saves stores from having to build their own and serves up product recommendations to users about brands that they\u2019ve already shown interest in \u2013 there are no ads. \u201cThe way to think about Shop is that it\u2019s really a personal shopping assistant,\u201d says Harley Finkelstein, Shopify\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cIt\u2019s an app that allows for a more intuitive online shopping experience.\u201d The app is already operational in the US; a British launch has not yet been set. It\u2019s an ambitious move that would position Shopify as a competitor to the likes of Amazon or Etsy. But Finkelstein is insistent that they aren\u2019t trying to steal Amazon\u2019s crown. \u201cThe intention is not to make a marketplace,\u201d he says, \u201cbut to allow consumers to find not only new local businesses, but also to interact with their favourite brands.\u201d Unlike Amazon, Shopify won\u2019t hold stock \u2013 brands will control their own supply chains, unless they choose to use Shopify\u2019s shipping capabilities. Whether or not Shop is an online marketplace is a moot point. It\u2019s worth pointing out that, unlike with other online marketplaces, brands using Shop won\u2019t get short shrift: apart from Shopify\u2019s payment transaction fee (which is between 2.4 and 2.9%), Shop won\u2019t charge brands commission to rent space on the platform. By comparison, Amazon charges 75p per item, plus fees of between 7% and 45%. \u201cThe way Shopify benefits is that [Shop] helps more consumers buy from more Shopify stores,\u201d Finkelstein explains. \u201cAs they succeed, we succeed with them.\u201d Is Shopify the next great retail behemoth? Not just yet. But that\u2019s how they want it. \u201cWe like the positioning of us being the brand behind the brand that makes entrepreneurs look great,\u201d says Finkelstein. \u201cI think maybe this is our Canadian side showing a little bit.\u201d (Shopify is based in Ottawa.) Analyst Richard Tse at the National Bank of Canada has been tracking Shopify stock since the company\u2019s 2015 flotation. \u201cEveryone says they\u2019re trying to compete with Amazon,\u201d says Tse. \u201cAnd on the surface it [Shop] may look like that. But what they\u2019re really trying to do is drive more business to their merchant clients.\u201d Is there any cause for Amazon boss Jeff Bezos to feel alarmed? Possibly. Research from eMarketer showed that Shopify last year overtook eBay\u2019s share of e-commerce sales in the US, leaving it second only to Amazon. If Shop takes off, it will be an attractive proposition for small- to medium-size retailers tired of Amazon\u2019s high fees and aggressive approach to its vendor partners. Finkelstein has pledged that Shopify won\u2019t use Shop to imitate one of Amazon\u2019s most notorious practices: creating white-label versions of bestselling products and selling them at a cheaper price, effectively undercutting retailers. Shopify is almost comically simple to use: it requires next-to-no technical or coding skills. \u201cIt\u2019s really easy,\u201d says Tamsin Gordon, a marketing manager at boutique jewellery brand Maya Magal. Gordon used to work at online retailer Not on the High Street, where she\u2019d be reliant on developers to manage the website for her. When Gordon moved to Maya Magal, which is a much smaller operation \u2013 there are only four staff in the head office \u2013 she started managing the site herself. \u201cIt\u2019s straightforward,\u201d she says. \u201cI can change the front end of the website, do stock counts, pull analytics, check what\u2019s selling \u2013 I can do all that myself. Before, I\u2019d have to get the tech guys to do it.\u201d Shopify has made starting an online business accessible. \u201cTechnology has fundamentally democratised one\u2019s ability to build a big business,\u201d says Finkelstein, \u201cand Shopify is a major part of that\u2026 what we\u2019re trying to do is simply level the playing field, so that small businesses can compete with the largest hegemonic corporations and retailers.\u201d Finkelstein uses the example of Kylie Cosmetics \u2013 reality TV star Kylie Jenner recently sold a majority stake in the firm to Coty in a $600m deal \u2013 to illustrate his point. He tells me that Kylie Cosmetics only has 13 full-time employees. \u201cThey\u2019re challenging the likes of Sephora, Mac, and L\u2019Or\u00e9al, but doing it with fewer people,\u201d Finkelstein says. \u201cThey [Kylie Cosmetics] are able to use Shopify technology to leverage their existing community and sell to a global audience.\u201d What\u2019s also remarkable about Shopify is the fact that the company appears recession-proof. It was founded by Tobias L\u00fctke in 2006, after the German-born Canadian entrepreneur set up an online snowboard shop and realised there was a gap in the market for a technology platform that would easily allow you to create and customise an online store. In 2008, the nascent company hit the financial crisis and, astonishingly, continued to grow. \u201cWhen the economy is going through a tough time Shopify has traditionally done well,\u201d Finkelstein says. He explains: \u201cIf you\u2019ve lost your job or need to supplement your income, a great way to do that is by starting a small business.\u201d As in 2008, the coronavirus-induced global recession has proved lucrative. \u201cEven before the pandemic, between 10 and 15% of retail activities were conducted through e-commerce,\u201d says Tse. \u201cShopify recognised that there was an opportunity to build a platform, products and services that cater to that shift.\u201d Coronavirus has been a stiff tailwind in Shopify\u2019s sails. \u201cWe saw new stores created on our platform grow by 62% more between 13 March and 24 April than in the previous six weeks,\u201d says Finkelstein. \u201cFar more people now are trying their hand at entrepreneurship.\u201d In the UK, new online store creations grew 70% in the same period. To accommodate this surge in entrepreneurs registering new brands \u2013 and consumers increasingly turning online for their purchases \u2013 the team rushed out new, Covid-19-complementary features. \u201cThe objective was to create products to help entrepreneurs and small businesses survive this thing,\u201d says Finkelstein. They quickly introduced gift cards and features to enable in-store collection. Shopify\u2019s impact on retail is not uniformly positive \u2013 it is an enabler of the sometimes dubious practise of dropshipping. If you\u2019ve purchased clothes from an Instagram brand that took ages to arrive, looked nothing like the photographs and were terrible quality, you\u2019ve probably fallen victim to dropshippers. Some dropshippers set up Shopify stores to market products they\u2019ve found from other vendors \u2013 typically, AliExpress, the \u201cChinese Amazon\u201d \u2013 and use Instagram and Facebook ads to market them to consumers. When they bite, the dropshipper places the order with the vendor and has it shipped directly to the customer, pocketing the mark-up. Dropshipping from China is often a bad experience for buyers. Predictably, Finkelstein disagrees: many of Shopify\u2019s merchant vendors are dropshippers, who favour the platform for the ease and speed with which they can set up dropshipping stores. \u201cIn my view, dropshipping is basically a great entryway into entrepreneurship for people that are risk-averse,\u201d Finkelstein says. Later, he adds: \u201cCustomers don\u2019t really care [if their products are dropshipped].\u201d Dropshippers will be allowed on the Shop app. Sophie Slater, of the sustainable fashion brand Birdsong, which uses Shopify technology, is cautious about using Shop due to the dropshippers on the platform. \u201cIf you look at something like Etsy [the online marketplace],\u201d Slater says, \u201cthey had good intentions, were certified as a B Corp [an ethical accreditation system for businesses], but then they allowed dropshipping, which ruined its appeal.\u201d Shopify\u2019s impact on our retail habits has been disruptive. It has facilitated the challenger brands \u2013 small, scrappy upstarts with lean teams and low overheads \u2013 that even now are becoming the established incumbents - Kylie Cosmetics, Jeffree Star, Gymshark, Allbirds. Such is their ubiquity, it\u2019s easy to forget that all these companies were only founded in the last decade. All use Shopify. Older brands are increasingly looking to these new kids on the block and trying to imitate their success. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing larger brands trying to act more entrepreneurial\u2026 brands like Heinz ketchup or Lindt chocolate are using Shopify because they themselves want to be able to build a retail model that is flexible, adaptable and they don\u2019t necessarily want to hire 300 people to run a direct-to-consumer business,\u201d Finkelstein says. Already the coronavirus pandemic has cost us some leading brands: Warehouse, Debenhams and Laura Ashley have all gone into administration. The Centre for Retail Research predicts that more than 20,000 British shops will close in 2020, a 28% increase on 2019. Is Shopify accelerating the decline of our high streets? \u201cThis is really a tale of two retail worlds,\u201d says Finkelstein. \u201cOn the one side, there are the retailers that are resistant to change\u2026 on the other side, you have the resilient retailers, who have reacted to Covid in a completely different way. They\u2019ve embraced new opportunities, they\u2019ve enabled kerbside pickup and local delivery options.\u201d These resilient retailers will thrive, Finkelstein insists. Shopify\u2019s impact on our consumer and retail habits is only beginning to be felt. It transformed selling, making it possible for the Davids of the retail world to take on the corporate Goliaths and win. Will the Shop app transform the way we buy? Very possibly.",

While case numbers were still low, an \u201cimmunity passport\u201d scheme was devised, but the government backtracked quickly when the WHO expressed concern over the plans and said there was no proven link between recovery and immunity. \u201cHealth system capacity was not the problem in Chile,\u201d said Dr \u00c1lvaro Erazo, a former health minister. \u201cBut our ability to handle the crisis has been negated by a lacklustre communications strategy that saw the government encourage people to go back to normal, all while the curve was soaring upwards.\u201d The health ministry had also promoted a strategy of \u201cdynamic\u201d lockdowns, in which quarantines were imposed and lifted strategically across the capital. The policy was unsuccessful because commuter travel between unrestricted regions continued to proliferate the spread of the virus. Ma\u00f1alich later admitted in a television interview that he had not appreciated the level of poverty and overcrowding in parts of the capital, which partly explained the government\u2019s inability to stem the spread of the virus in the poorer southern suburbs. His willingness to implement expert advice was also questioned. \u201cGiven the government\u2019s unpopularity at the onset of the pandemic, a more inclusive and participatory approach would certainly have been better,\u201d said Dr Ximena Aguilera, a member of the government\u2019s advisory committee. \u201cThe panel of experts was only convened in March when the virus had already arrived in Chile, and the scientific community did not get its wish with regard to the data it wanted published. We must hope that this improves with the change of leadership.\u201d Opposition politicians are considering a constitutional complaint against Ma\u00f1alich, a close friend of the president who survived a cabinet reshuffle a week before his resignation, alleging his complicity in the poor management of the pandemic. If upheld, he could be barred from holding public office for five years. Santiago has been under quarantine for over a month, and concern has shifted to the cities of Valpara\u00edso and Vi\u00f1a del Mar on Chile\u2019s central coastline, the country\u2019s second largest population centre, which were placed under lockdown on Friday following a steady rise in cases.",

When our baby arrives, will we be able to be there? Afterwards, will we be stuck in California for months on end, with a newborn and no family to help? This has happened to others. Will it be happening in a few months? No one knows.</p> <p>At a routine medical in my mid-20s it was discovered I have a heart condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which basically means one side of my heart muscle is too thick. While it can lead to deadly arrhythmias, my well-managed condition has not hugely affected my life so, after I met my husband in my early 30s, my consultants said I could carry a child naturally. However, there would be a 50% chance I could pass the condition to my baby, which may or may not be serious, life-limiting or even deadly. After much deliberation, we accepted the risks (as every prospective parent does, to a degree), and decided to try soon after we married in 2016. Over the next 18 months we had five devastating miscarriages before 12 weeks. We consulted nutritionists, acupuncturists, consultants. I reduced my working hours, we had every blood test, scan and analysis under the sun. No cause or reason was found.</p> <p>Then, for the next eight months of trying, nothing.</p> <p><em><strong>When I was diagnosed</strong></em> with HCM aged 26, I spiralled through a grieving process for what I\u2019d imagined my future to be. The discovery of my heart condition left me feeling \u201cdefective\u201d, that no one would ever want to marry me, that I\u2019d never have my \u201cown\u201d children\u2026 Time helped those feelings subside, yet I never dared to dream of a future with babies in it until I met my husband. He had the opposite experience. As a healthy man in his mid-30s, he\u2019d never fathomed not becoming a parent. But IVF was a no-no due to the potential effects of the necessary hormones on my heart. We looked into adoption and were told that my genetic heart condition and the fact that my husband\u2019s father had recently been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer would likely count against us. So in October 2018, we contemplated surrogacy.</p> <p>The year before, I\u2019d written an investigation into the process and found that, in terms of legal protection, ethical considerations, efficacy of medical treatment and ease of communication, America was a good place to begin a \u201csurrogacy journey\u201d. It\u2019s also the most expensive. There are ethical and communication considerations with other countries which offer the practice more affordably. Surrogacy is not legally recognised in the UK and while it does happen, it\u2019s on an altruistic basis, often informally, meaning surrogates cannot be paid, only reimbursed for \u201creasonable expenses\u201d. This means there is a massive mismatch in the number of surrogates versus demand. After spending nearly three years on this journey and both almost 40, we couldn\u2019t face several more seeking a surrogate here.</p> <p>And so, over Skype, we interviewed a clinic in California, a state regarded as offering the \u201cgold standard\u201d of the practice. Travel was easy and not only are surrogates available and well looked after financially, medically and psychologically, but there is legal protection for both the surrogate and us, as \u201cintended parents\u201d. We decided to select an egg donor due to my genetic condition.

More than a century after the 1918 calamity, South America\u2019s largest country is again being shaken by a devastating pandemic, and Varella is in disbelief. \u201cNobody thought this could happen. Perhaps they imagined it theoretically \u2013 that some kind of virus might come along,\u201d said the 77-year-old oncologist, author and broadcaster. \u201cBut even when this virus did show up, we didn\u2019t think it would cause a tragedy of such proportions.\u201d The precise magnitude of Brazil\u2019s Covid-19 tragedy remains unclear \u2013 but the story told by official statistics grows more wretched by the day. On Friday, Brazil overtook Britain as the country with the world\u2019s second-highest death toll: 41,901 deaths since the first fatality was confirmed in S\u00e3o Paulo on 17 March. A University of Washington projection indicated another 100,000 Brazilians could die before August, possibly placing Brazil ahead of the US as the country with the most deaths. As the catastrophe deepens there is growing anger at the conduct of president Jair Bolsonaro, whose jumbled and dysfunctional handling of a pandemic he has called a \u201cfantasy\u201d has made Boris Johnson\u2019s widely panned response look sober and efficient. \u201cThis is the worst public health crisis we\u2019ve faced \u2013 and it has come at a time when we have the worst government in the world,\u201d said Daniel Dourado, a public health expert and lawyer from the University of S\u00e3o Paulo who believes thousands of lives could have been saved by a swifter and less erratic response. \u201cThe country is adrift.\u201d There are uncanny and painful parallels between the impact of the Spanish flu \u2013 which historians say killed between 35,000 and 100,000 Brazilians \u2013 and the harm coronavirus is now inflicting. Claudio Bertolli Filho, the author of a book on the 1918 pandemic, said Brazil\u2019s then leaders had initially played down the unknown influenza \u2013 just as Bolsonaro has dismissed coronavirus as a \u201cbit of a cold\u201d. Then, too, authorities tried to hide the true scale of the disaster \u2013 just as Bolsonaro\u2019s health ministry has been accused of doing \u2013 until, like now, the determination of Brazilian journalists made that impossible. Then, like now, doctors pushed untested and potentially dangerous remedies, just as Brazil\u2019s populist leader has promoted the use of hydroxychloroquine despite limited scientific evidence of its effectiveness. Bertolli Filho said one S\u00e3o Paulo quack was famed for injecting Spanish flu patients with mercury. \u201cHe killed lots of people \u2013 and yet despite this many believed.\u201d As the Spanish flu ripped through cities, from Recife to Rio, religious leaders also touted miracle cures just as powerful televangelists today promise followers Covid-19 salvation with holy water and supernatural seeds. And in 1918, as now, the mysterious malady prompted an explosion of rumour and conspiracy, including claims German submarines had secretly spread the infirmity along the Brazilian coast. (In fact, it arrived on an English merchant ship called the Demerara). But perhaps no parallel is more cruel than the way in which both catastrophes obliterated the idea pandemics chose victims indiscriminately. Bertolli Filho said the 1919 death of Brazil\u2019s president-elect, Rodrigues Alves, from the Spanish flu was widely cited as proof epidemics were equal opportunity. In fact, cemetery records showed most of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s 5,000 dead hailed from working class, industrial districts such as Mooca, Ipiranga, and Br\u00e1s, where Varella\u2019s grandmother watched the corpse collectors at work. Today, the areas suffering most are blue collar communities such as Brasil\u00e2ndia, Freguesia do \u00d3 and Cap\u00e3o Redondo where many do not have the luxury of social distancing or working from home. In Rio, deprived western neighbourhoods such as Campo Grande, Realengo and Bangu have recorded some of the highest death tolls while densely populated favelas like Rocinha and the Complexo da Mar\u00e9 are also being punished. \u201cThe truth is, not even a pandemic is truly democratic,\u201d Bertolli Filho said. Varella, who lives in his grandmother\u2019s house to this day, said it was too soon to know just how high a price the poor would pay in a country where the richest 1% control 28% of the wealth. \u201cBrazil\u2019s situation is so worrying and so unique because if you look at the path the epidemic took \u2013 from China, through Asia, and then Europe and on to the US \u2013 Brazil was its first encounter with a country suffering from the kind of severe social inequality ours does.\u201d \u201cIt will hit other unequal countries, like India and Pakistan, but here was the first \u2013 and we are seeing this play out now in a country where 13 or 14 million people live in precarious conditions and great poverty.\u201d The omens were not good. \u201cEver since the epidemic began, I\u2019ve woken up every day feeling afflicted, thinking about what will happen and how,\u201d Varella said. \u201cThe biggest problem we are seeing across Brazil right now is the epidemic spreading through the outskirts of cities and their rundown centres where you have tenements and the homeless live. \u201cWhere this will end we have no clue \u2013 no clue at all,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBecause we are now right in the middle of the dissemination.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The majority of Australians believe extending jobkeeper and jobseeker would help the economy recover from Covid-19, but Coalition voters are the least likely to back continuing the $70bn wage subsidy and coronavirus supplement beyond September. Those are the results of the May Australian National University poll, which found that, among remedies for the coronavirus economic ills, support was strongest for investing in vaccine research, reopening pubs, clubs and cafes, followed by extending the jobkeeper and jobseeker programs and lastly opening borders. The poll of 3,219 Australians is the latest instalment of a longitudinal survey which found that the poorest 10% of households had actually seen their income increase during the Covid-19 contraction. That result, from the April survey, was attributed to the $1,500 fortnightly jobkeeper wage subsidy and the doubling of the jobseeker unemployment benefit to $1,100 a fortnight. With a Treasury review of jobseeker set to be concluded this month, the Morrison government faces an agonising choice about phasing out the payments, with calls from even within its own ranks to keep jobkeeper, at least in the hardest-hit industries, and some also opposed to dropping unemployment benefits back to $40 a day. Among those polled, 57.6% said extending jobkeeper and jobseeker beyond the current six months would do \u201csome\u201d or \u201ca great deal\u201d to fix Australia\u2019s economic problems, while 42.4% said it would do \u201conly a little\u201d or be \u201cno help at all\u201d. Support for the jobkeeper and jobseeker payments was highest among those aged 18 to 24 (70.5%) and 25 to 34 (60.1%), with slimmer majorities among Gen X and baby boomer generations. The policy recorded majority support among Labor voters (66.6%), Greens (70.2%), other parties (55.4%), and undecided voters (61%). Only Coalition voters were mostly opposed to the extension, with just 44.2% in favour. Scott Morrison has repeatedly said that jobkeeper and coronavirus supplement payments are only intended to be \u201ctemporary medication\u201d, although the government has flagged further economic support for the arts and tourism sectors. Among the other Covid-19 policies, 75.6% backed increased spending to find a vaccine, 71.7% approved of opening pubs, clubs and cafes, but just 47.2% backed opening national borders to tourists and international students. Report co-author Matthew Gray said \u2013 unlike support for jobkeeper and jobseeker \u2013 there was \u201cno significant difference across the political divide for the level of support for finding a vaccine or treatment, or easing restrictions on pubs, clubs and cafes\u201d. The report found that people who were anxious were less likely to support liberalisation measures on borders and hospitality, but more likely to support spending on vaccines and labour market programs. It concluded that this presented a \u201cchallenge for government\u201d because physical distancing will be needed to keep infection rates low but in order to restart the economy \u201cthis concern and perceived risk may need to be reduced\u201d. The study also found little change for Australians\u2019 support for key economic policies before and after the pandemic. \u201cBefore the pandemic, 85% of Australians agreed that increasing spending on healthcare, education and housing would help fix the economy,\u201d Gray said. \u201cIn May this figure was 82.1%.\u201d \u201cThe measure that actually gained support was cutting taxes \u2013 with 59.1% saying this would help the economy in May compared to 57.5% in January.\u201d Labor has repeatedly warned the government not to withdraw economic supports too soon, but the government has banked $60bn of savings from the smaller than expected jobkeeper program and focused instead on industry-specific measures such as its homebuilder construction subsidy. Morrison has proposed achieving growth through skills reform, tax reform including business tax cuts, and industrial relations reforms.",

The case was first brought in 2017, and initially dismissed by the National Bureau of Investigation because it was outside the statute of limitations. But in 2018 the Department of Justice allowed the case to proceed to trial, using an obscure law, Republic Act 3326, to extend the liability period for such cases from one to 12 years. Ressa and her legal counsel point out that the controversial cyber libel law did not exist at the time of publication, and was in fact only enacted four months after the story was written. However, the Department of Justice allowed the case to go ahead because the online article had been updated in February 2014 to correct a spelling error. In total, Rappler and its officers and staff have faced at least 11 government investigations and court cases. Ressa has won international plaudits for her journalism and refusal to be cowed by what rights groups have described as judicial harassment. She was among those named Time person of the year in 2018, and won the 2018 Knight International Journalism award as well as a press freedom award given by the Committee to Protect Journalists. Monday\u2019s verdict will be issued at a court in Manila where a limited number of people will be present as part of ongoing measures to reduce coronavirus transmission. Judge Rainelda Estacio-Montesa finished the trial in just eight months, far more quickly than other recent libel cases. The verdict can be appealed against in the supreme court.",

The number of cases stands at 7,766,952. The true figures for deaths and cases are likely to be higher, due to differing definitions and testing rates, time lags and suspected underreporting.</li> <li><strong>China reports 57 new virus cases, highest daily count since April. </strong>China on Sunday reported 57 new cases of the coronavirus, the highest daily figure since 13 April, as concerns grow about a resurgence of the disease. The National Health Commission said 36 of the new cases were domestic infections in Beijing, with 2 more domestic infections in northeastern Liaoning province. Local health officials said they were close contacts of the Beijing cases. The new cluster of domestic infections has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/13/beijing-china-new-covid-19-cases-linked-to-food-market\">prompted fresh lockdowns</a> with people ordered to stay home in 11 residential estates near to the market.

Only three in 10 people approve, giving the government an overall approval rating of -18 for its handling of the pandemic.</li> <li><strong>Chile Health Minister resigns amid coronavirus deaths. </strong>Chilean President Sebastian Pinera on Saturday replaced Health Minister Jaime Manalich amid controversy over the country\u2019s figures for deaths from the coronavirus outbreak. Pinera said Manalich had spared \u201cno effort\u201d in carrying out his \u201cdifficult and noble duty\u201d to protect Chileans\u2019 health. He replaced him with Oscar Enrique Paris, an academic and medical doctor.</li> <li><strong>Half of Brits support Brexit transition extension, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/13/more-than-half-of-british-people-support-brexit-transition-extension\">survey finds</a>. </strong>More than half of people in Britain support an extension to the Brexit transition period, while three-quarters believe the UK should work very closely with the European Union to combat coronavirus, a survey suggests.</li> <li><strong>New York State sees lowest deaths since pandemic started. </strong>New York saw its lowest death toll since the pandemic started on Friday.

If there\u2019s anything you think I\u2019ve missed, you can email me on frances.perraudin@theguardian.com or message me on twitter @fperraudin. Delhi is to use 500 railway coaches as hospital facilities after a surge in the number of coronavirus cases led to a shortage of hospital beds. India\u2019s federal government said on Sunday it will provide New Delhi\u2019s city authorities with 500 railway coaches that will be equipped to care for coronavirus patients, Reuters reports. The coaches will increase Delhi\u2019s capacity by 8,000 beds, home minister Amit Shah said on Twitter after a meeting with the capital\u2019s chief minister. The government will also ramp up testing in the city, especially in containment zones, conduct a door-to-door health survey of residents and provide sufficient supplies of oxygen cylinders and ventilators, he said. India is the fourth-worst affected country in the world, with cases steadily increasing. It reported a record single-day jump in cases on Sunday, adding nearly 12,000 confirmed infections and taking the total to more than 320,000, according to health ministry data. Prime minister Narendra Modi imposed a nationwide lockdown in late March that has since been loosened. Iran\u2019s daily virus death toll has exceeded 100, for the first time in two months, AFP reports. In televised remarks, health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari announced 107 Covid-19 fatalities in the past 24 hours, raising the overall toll to 8,837. Lari said: It was very painful for us to announce the triple-digit figure. This is an unpredictable and wild virus and may surprise us at any time. Iran last recorded triple-digit daily fatalities on April 13, with 111 dead. Lari also announced 2,472 new cases confirmed in the past day, bringing the total infection caseload to 187,427, with over 148,000 recoveries. There has been scepticism at home and abroad about Iran\u2019s official COVID-19 figures, with concerns the real toll could be much higher. Iran has struggled to contain what has become the Middle East\u2019s deadliest outbreak of the illness since it reported its first cases in the Shiite holy city of Qom in February. But since April it has gradually lifted restrictions to ease the intense pressures on its sanctions-hit economy. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Saturday reproached citizens for failing to observe measures designed to rein in the virus. Official figures have shown a rising trajectory in new confirmed cases since early May, which the government has attributed to increased testing rather than a worsening caseload. Hello, I\u2019m Nicola Slawson and I\u2019m taking over the liveblog from Frances Perraudin while she gets something to eat. Drop me a message or email if you think there is a story I\u2019m missing: Email: nicola.slawson@theguardian.com Twitter: @Nicola_Slawson Deaths worldwide pass 430,000. According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, which relies on official government figures, there have been 430,399 known coronavirus deaths worldwide since the start of the pandemic. The number of cases stands at 7,766,952. The true figures for deaths and cases are likely to be higher, due to differing definitions and testing rates, time lags and suspected underreporting. China reports 57 new virus cases, highest daily count since April. China on Sunday reported 57 new cases of the coronavirus, the highest daily figure since 13 April, as concerns grow about a resurgence of the disease. The National Health Commission said 36 of the new cases were domestic infections in Beijing, with 2 more domestic infections in northeastern Liaoning province. Local health officials said they were close contacts of the Beijing cases. The new cluster of domestic infections has prompted fresh lockdowns with people ordered to stay home in 11 residential estates near to the market. The cases are the first in Beijing in two months. Poll: UK government losing public approval over handling of virus. Less than a third of the public now approve of the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer. The poll found that approval of the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis is down four points to a new low. Only three in 10 people approve, giving the government an overall approval rating of -18 for its handling of the pandemic. The Afghan health ministry has said that it is not able to increase testing for coronavirus due to a lack of laboratories and an overload of suspected patients. Ahmad Jawad Osmani, acting health minister, said on Saturday that medical workers would determine new coronavirus patients through their symptoms, rather than through tests, as the country heads towards the peak of the crisis. The news comes as the number of confirmed infections in the capital Kabul topped 10,000. Chile Health Minister resigns amid coronavirus deaths. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera on Saturday replaced Health Minister Jaime Manalich amid controversy over the country\u2019s figures for deaths from the coronavirus outbreak. Pinera said Manalich had spared \u201cno effort\u201d in carrying out his \u201cdifficult and noble duty\u201d to protect Chileans\u2019 health. He replaced him with Oscar Enrique Paris, an academic and medical doctor. Spain will open its borders to countries in the European Union\u2019s Schengen area \u2013 excluding Portugal \u2013 on 21 June, Spanish media including El Pais newspaper and Ser radio station reported. The country\u2019s border with Portugal will open on 1 July, as previously announced. The two countries were in dispute earlier this month after Spain announced that they would open the border without consulting the government in Lisbon. Evacuation flight for British Nationals leaves Colombia. The flight is operated by the South American country\u2019s flag carrying airline Avianca. On Saturday night 230 passengers, mostly British nationals, were boarding the aircraft. The plane will return back to Colombia from the UK with Colombian evacuees on Sunday. Israel has noted a spike in coronavirus cases as schools, businesses, restaurants, bars, tourist attractions and other establishments reopen, leading to 177 schools and educational institutions throughout the country closing again after 493 students and teachers tested positive for the virus. France reported 24 new coronavirus deaths over the 24 hours to Saturday, taking the total to 29,398 and marking the fourth day with under 30 fatalities. A steep rise in coronavirus cases in Chile has plunged the government into crisis and prompted intense criticism of its management of the pandemic, reports John Bartlett. Divisions between the government and sectors of the medical community led to the resignation of the health minister, Jaime Ma\u00f1alich, on Saturday, shortly after 234 deaths in 24 hours had been confirmed, the highest daily toll to date. Chile is among the countries with the highest number of cases relative to population size. \u201cI want to call for dialogue and cooperation between research centres, the medical union and scientific community,\u201d Ma\u00f1alich\u2019s successor, Dr Enrique Paris, a former head of Chile\u2019s medical union, said. \u201cHere begins a new era in which we must hear contrasting opinions.\u201d The pandemic has claimed the lives of 3,101 people who have tested positive for the virus in Chile, but the government\u2019s statistics has been repeatedly questioned. An investigation found on Friday that according to unpublished health ministry data more than 5,000 people had died when probable coronavirus deaths were incorporated into the total, as per World Health Organization guidelines. Here are some newly released coronavirus case figures from around the world. Malaysia has reported eight new cases, taking the total to 8,453 infections. The health ministry also reported one more death, raising the total number of fatalities from the outbreak to 121. The Philippines has reported 539 more infections, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 25,930. The government also recorded 14 additional fatalities related to the virus, taking the death toll to 1,088. Indonesia has reported 857 new coronavirus cases and 43 new deaths, bringing the total death toll to 2,134. Singapore has reported 407 new cases, taking the total to 40,604. It has recorded 26 deaths. Spain will open its borders to countries in the European Union\u2019s Schengen area \u2013 excluding Portugal \u2013 on 21 June, Spanish media including El Pais newspaper and Ser radio station reported. The country\u2019s border with Portugal will open on 1 July, as previously announced. The two countries were in dispute earlier this month after Spain announced that they would open the border without consulting the government in Lisbon. The Spanish government has previously said it will allow foreign tourists to enter Spain on 1 July without self-quarantining. The Balearic Islands will start receiving some tourists from Monday as part of a test programme. The Afghan health ministry has said that it is not able to test for coronavirus due to a lack of laboratories and an overload of suspected patients, reports Akhtar Mohammad Makoii. The news comes as the number of confirmed infections in the capital Kabul topped 10,000. Ahmad Jawad Osmani, acting health minister, said on Saturday that medical workers would determine new coronavirus patients through their symptoms, rather than through tests, as the country heads towards the peak of the crisis. \u201cThe new decision that we have made is that any patient that visits health centres with clinical symptoms, they will be recognised as a coronavirus patient and will be admitted for treatment,\u201d Osmani said. He also said that the medical equipment which UNICEF pledged has not arrived yet. We could not activate testing centres in [all] 34 provinces. Right now, we have laboratories in 11 provinces, but the medical equipment which was pledged to us by UNICEF has not arrived. The equipment that would have enabled us to expand the testing process to 34 provinces. We have a plan to increase testing capacity in 34 provinces, but this needs time and it is out of the control of the Ministry of Public Health. Osmani declared \u201cpublic mobilisation\u201d against the virus on Thursday and warned that a large number of the country\u2019s population was infected with Covid-19. At least twenty patients died overnight, including six in Kabul, meaning the country\u2019s Covid-19 death toll now stands at 471. There have been 4,725 recoveries. The country\u2019s health ministry has so far tested 55,981 patients. The number of confirmed infections in the capital, Kabul, has passed 10,000 following a continued surge of transmission. Kabul is the country\u2019s worst affected area with 10,035 confirmed cases, 316 of them new. Local officials in Kabul have warned that the actual number of infections in the capital is significantly higher than official figures show. Eastern province of Nangarhar where a roadside bomb killed at least one civilian killed and wounded two others this morning, recorded nine deaths from Covid-19 overnight. Health officials tested 9 patients in the province of whom 7 came back positive. Germany plans to make \u20ac500m available to firms to prevent a collapse in company training and apprenticeships due to the coronavirus crisis, a document seen by Reuters has showed. Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government has already agreed two stimulus packages totalling \u20ac880bn to mitigate the impact of a lockdown to contain the pandemic as Europe\u2019s biggest economy braces for its worst recession since World War Two. An outline of the plan, due to be approved by Merkel\u2019s cabinet on Wednesday, said: We must prevent the COVID-19 crisis from turning into a crisis for the professional future of young people and for securing skilled workers. The programme includes a training bonus of up to \u20ac3,000 for small and mid-sized companies that have been hit hard by the crisis. Aid will also be available to firms that avoid putting apprentices on a short-time work scheme or if they take on trainees from insolvent firms. Tokyo has confirmed 47 new coronavirus infections, the highest since the government lifted the state of emergency nationwide in late May. The daily figure was also the highest since May 5, the Asahi television reported. Of these 47 cases, said Jiji news agency, 18 were working at a club which provides male drinking companions for women. The way Russia counts fatalities during the coronavirus pandemic could be one reason why its official death toll of 6,829 is far below many other countries, reports the Associated Press. Despite the comparatively low number of fatalities, Russia has reported 520,000 infections, behind only the United States and Brazil. The paradox also has led to allegations by critics and Western media that Russian authorities might have falsified the numbers for political purposes to play down the scale of the outbreak. Even a top World Health Organization official said the low number of deaths in Russia certainly is unusual. Russian authorities have bristled at the suggestions. We have never manipulated the official statistics, said Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova. Finding the true numbers during the pandemic is difficult, since countries count cases and deaths in different ways and testing for the virus is uneven. Still, several factors could contribute to Russia\u2019s low virus mortality rate, including the way it counts deaths, a tendency among some officials to embellish statistics, its vast geography and the shorter life expectancy of its population. An autopsy is mandatory in Russia in every confirmed or suspected case of Covid-19, with a determination on the cause of death made by a commission of specialists, said Dr Natalia Belitchenko, a pathologist in the medical examiner\u2019s office in the region around St Petersburg. She deals with coronavirus deaths almost daily, but said only about 20% of them have been attributed to COVID-19. In other cases, the virus was determined to be an underlying condition. In the vast majority of cases, the pneumonia itself wouldn\u2019t have led to death, had the underlying conditions not flared up to a point of becoming fatal, she said. The Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent, Kim Wilsher, has this report from Paris, where streets have been pedestrianised and the mayor has turned parking spaces into cycle lanes. It is evening rush hour and the Rue de Rivoli, a major east-west road through central Paris, is heaving. Pre-coronavirus, it would have been one long traffic jam, paralysed by increasingly frustrated and angry motorists. Now, though, with private cars banned, it is busy with pedestrians, cyclists and a smattering of taxis and buses. North of Rue de Rivoli, in the Marais, a maze of narrow cobbled streets, cafes, restaurants and bars have spread out across pavements and parking places. As France returns to normal, after what President Emmanuel Macron described as the \u201cwar\u201d on Covid-19, the battle is now on for public space in Paris. The pedestrianisation of Rue de Rivoli has crystallised the divide between competing interests: celebrated by cyclists and described by popular French TV star Thierry Ardisson as \u201ca dream\u201d; seen by motorists as part of City Hall\u2019s \u201cobsession\u201d to drive them out of the capital. Hello from London. I\u2019m Frances Perraudin and I\u2019ll be guiding you through the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic across the world. You can send me hints and tips on frances.perraudin@theguardian.com and contact me on twitter @fperraudin. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. Thanks for following along. Here are the key global developments from the last few hours: Deaths worldwide pass 430,000. According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, which relies on official government figures, there have been 430,128 known coronavirus deaths worldwide since the start of the pandemic. The number of cases stands at 7,766,952. The true figures for deaths and cases are likely to be higher, due to differing definitions and testing rates, time lags and suspected underreporting. China reports 57 new virus cases, highest daily count since April. China on Sunday reported 57 new cases of the coronavirus, the highest daily figure since 13 April, as concerns grow about a resurgence of the disease. The National Health Commission said 36 of the new cases were domestic infections in Beijing, with 2 more domestic infections in northeastern Liaoning province. Local health officials said they were close contacts of the Beijing cases.

More than half of people in Britain support an extension to the Brexit transition period, while three-quarters believe the UK should work very closely with the European Union to combat coronavirus, a survey suggests. New York State sees lowest deaths since pandemic started. New York saw its lowest death toll since the pandemic started on Friday. State Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Saturday in the US, and the lowest number of hospitalisations since late March. Evacuation flight for British Nationals leaves Columbia. The flight is operated by the South American country\u2019s flag carrying airline Avianca. On Saturday night 230 passengers, mostly British nationals, were boarding the aircraft. The plane will return back to Colombia from the UK with Colombian evacuees on Sunday. Egypt saw a record daily rise in infections and deaths, as it confirmed 1,677 new coronavirus cases and 62 deaths on Saturday. In total, the Arab world\u2019s most populous country has registered 42,980 cases including 1,484 deaths, the ministry said in a statement. Israel has noted a spike in coronavirus cases as schools, businesses, restaurants, bars, tourist attractions and other establishments reopen, leading to 177 schools and educational institutions throughout the country closing again after 493 students and teachers tested positive for the virus. France reported 24 new coronavirus deaths over the 24 hours to Saturday, taking the total to 29,398 and marking the fourth day with under 30 fatalities. The president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, reproached citizens on Saturday for their reduced adherence to health measures designed to stop the spread of coronavirus. Lebanese protesters took to the streets in Beirut and other cities on Saturday in mostly peaceful protests against the government, calling for its resignation as the small country sinks deeper into economic distress amid lockdown restrictions. The main developments in Australia: Australia considering shorter quarantine for students and low-transmission countries. Senior Morrison government ministers have flagged shorter quarantine periods for international students and business travellers as part of a suite of measures to reopen Australia to international travel. The Sunday Telegraph reported the Coalition was considering halving quarantine times to one week for countries with low rates of Covid-19 infection, including Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea. NRL postpones match amid Covid-19 scare. The National Rugby League has postponed a match between Canterbury and the Sydney Roosters following a coronavirus scare. Victoria confirms nine new cases, announces easing of restrictions. The state of Victoria, Australia has announced nine new cases of coronavirus today, three of whom are in hotel quarantine. In addition to 50 people being allowed in cafes, restaurants and pubs and patrons being allowed to consume alcohol without a meal, restrictions on some community sports will be eased. Non-contact community sport will return on 22 June \u2013 for both adults and kids, both indoor and outdoor. NSW recorded nine new Covid-19 cases from 13,591 tests in the 24 hours to 8pm on Saturday. Eight of the cases are among returned travellers in hotel quarantine and one is a teacher at Laguna Street Public School in southern Sydney. All students at the primary school have been deemed close contacts and have been told to self-isolate. The school will stop on-site learning until 24 June. Authorities are investigating the source of the teacher\u2019s infection. No cases are in intensive care. The 50-person limit at cafes, restaurants, and churches will be scrapped in NSW with venues instead to follow the one person per four-square-metre rule. The new rule, announced by the NSW government on Sunday, will be in place from 1 July and applies to most indoor venues including pubs and workspaces. Outdoor cultural and sporting venues with a capacity of up to 40,000 will from 1 July also be allowed to seat 25% of their normal capacity. The Queensland state government is committing AU$250m (US$172m) to reduce elective surgery waitlists, which have blown out following the pandemic. More than 7,000 Queenslanders have waited longer than medically recommended for their procedures. Western Australia reports zero new coronavirus cases. WA Western Australia has reported no new cases of Covid-19 overnight, with the State\u2019s total number of cases remaining at 602, according to the WA Department of Health. China has reported its highest daily number of new coronavirus cases in months as parts of Beijing remained under lockdown, offering a second-wave warning to the rest of the world as the pandemic rages in South America and global cases approach 7.8 million. The shock resurgence in domestic infections on Sunday has rattled China, where the disease emerged late last year but had largely been tamed through severe restrictions on movement that were later emulated across the globe. It also provides a bleak insight into the difficulties the world will face in conquering Covid-19 \u2013 even as countries in Europe prepare to reopen borders at the beginning of the summer holiday season after an encouraging drop in contagion. Of the 57 new cases logged by Chinese authorities, 36 were domestic infections in the capital, where a large wholesale food market at the centre of the outbreak has been closed and nearby housing estates put under lockdown. \u201cPeople are scared,\u201d a fruit and vegetable trader at another local market in central Beijing told AFP. \u201cThe meat sellers have had to close. This disease is really scary,\u201d said the man, adding that there were fewer customers than normal. At least 430,000 people worldwide have died from Covid-19, and the total number of confirmed cases has doubled to 7.78 million in slightly over a month. The disease is now spreading most rapidly in Latin America, where it is threatening healthcare systems and sparking political turmoil. With time on his hands, our restaurant critic turns chef Do I need tell you that I miss restaurants? I miss their noise and promise and menus and dishwashers. That got me thinking. I can\u2019t bring the restaurant into my home, but perhaps I could bring the food. Wouldn\u2019t that be great? Pick a few of my favourite dishes and scatter them through my week like suddenly-blooming nasturtium seeds. It would be my food fantasies made flesh, and many other food groups besides. I start simply with the kind of dish I would once have described pompously, as a \u201cpleasing piece of assembly\u201d: the duck starter served to me at Grazing by Mark Greenaway in Edinburgh. There was a pristine disc of fried duck egg, sunrise-yellow yolk dead centre, layered with torn hunks of duck confit, slices of duck ham, fried breadcrumbs and dollops of parsley mayo. Happily, in my south London neighbourhood I have shops selling duck eggs, duck confit and flat-leaf parsley. I can\u2019t get duck ham but I can substitute with jamon Iberico. In lockdown we all must make sacrifices. Oh, the humanity. Less than a third of the public now approve of the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer. The poll found that approval of the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis is down four points to a new low. Only three in 10 people approve, giving the government an overall approval rating of -18 for its handling of the pandemic. However, the pollsters found that disapproval of the way Boris Johnson is acting as prime minister appears to have levelled off, with no significant increases in either approval or disapproval over the past three weeks. He has a net approval score of -6 points. Meanwhile, Keir Starmer\u2019s approval ratings remain very high on +24, but have dropped four points since last week. Johnson still only has a one-point lead when voters are asked who makes the best prime minister \u2013 a historic low for him. Significantly more women than men are experiencing problems with their mental health as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. New research by Lisa Spantig and Ben Etheridge, economists at the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex, suggests it is because women are more adversely affected by social isolation during lockdown. The study reveals that the proportion of people who are reporting that they are experiencing at least one severe underlying mental health problem has increased among both genders. Among men it has risen from 7% of men before the pandemic to 18% after its onset. But for women, it has risen from 11% to 27%. The Lancet\u2019s editor: \u2018The UK response to coronavirus is the greatest science policy failure for a generation\u2019 There is a school of thought that says now is not the time to criticise the government and its scientific advisers about the way they have handled the Covid-19 pandemic. Wait until all the facts are known and the crisis has subsided, goes this thinking, and then we can analyse the performance of those involved. It\u2019s safe to say that Richard Horton, the editor of the influential medical journal the Lancet, is not part of this school. An outspoken critic of what he sees as the medical science establishment\u2019s acquiescence to government, he has written a book that he calls a \u201creckoning\u201d for the \u201cmissed opportunities and appalling misjudgments\u201d here and abroad that have led to \u201cthe avoidable deaths of tens of thousands of citizens\u201d. The Observer view: as Britain flounders, Europe charts its recovery If the struggle against the pandemic resembles a war, as Boris Johnson believes, then it\u2019s pretty clear who is losing. By any pertinent measure, including the most damning one \u2013 the number of excess deaths compared with last year \u2013 Britain is being outdone by countries across Europe, most notably Germany. Johnson dislikes international comparisons. It\u2019s shamefully obvious why. Britain is not second rate. He is. Late into lockdown, late on PPE, late on testing, test and trace, late on halting the avoidable care homes catastrophe and late on the reopening of schools, Johnson\u2019s government now lags behind in launching an economic stimulus package to mitigate the potentially disastrous long-term effects of the virus. Last week\u2019s report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development shows just how urgent the need is. Britain\u2019s economy is likely to suffer the worst damage of any country in the developed world, with a projected 2020 fall in national income of 11.5% amid un-budgeted, virus-related costs of \u00a3133bn. Germany\u2019s shortfall in contrast will be 6.6%, the OECD predicted. This is not happening because Britain is unlucky. It\u2019s happening because of its relative failure to suppress the virus and the resulting, ongoing restrictions on economic activity. The comparative slowness of Britain\u2019s recovery stems from this continuing inability to safely reboot key sectors such as services \u2013 hospitality, shops, restaurants and pubs. Dithering over the arbitrary \u201ctwo metre rule\u201d is one example of how the government makes matters worse. Another is the delay to the promised stimulus package and Johnson\u2019s elusive economic recovery bill, now expected by the autumn. Australian trade minister, Simon Birmingham, says the federal government has secured weekly freight flights from Queensland to Hong Hong and Singapore to get farmers\u2019 produce into key overseas export markets. From Sunday, Cathay Pacific will start a weekly direct freight flight carrying local beef, pork, eggs, fruit and vegetables from Toowoomba\u2019s Wellcamp Airport to Hong Kong. From Friday, Singapore Airlines will also start a weekly freight flight between Toowoomba and Singapore, carrying between 30-40 tonnes of local produce. Federal Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said that the Covid-19 pandemic had created barriers for exporters and these flights would make it easier for local farmers to get their high-quality produce overseas. \u201cWith very few passenger planes flying overseas at present, we need to make sure local farmers and producers across south east Queensland still have avenues to get their produce over to their overseas customers,\u201d Minister Birmingham said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cThe more local product we can get out the door, the more local jobs we can protect and the more export dollars we can generate for the region.\u201d Senior Morrison government ministers have flagged shorter quarantine periods for international students and business travellers as part of a suite of measures to reopen Australia to international travel. On Sunday, the health minister, Greg Hunt, confirmed that modifications to the existing mandatory two-week hotel quarantine could be enacted in addition to travel bubbles with safe countries, such as New Zealand, which would not require quarantine. The Sunday Telegraph reported the Coalition was considering halving quarantine times to one week for countries with low rates of Covid-19 infection, including Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea. Plunging oil prices and collapsing state revenues have seen Nigerian authorities vow an end to a controversial fuel subsidy scheme long criticised as a graft-ridden drain on public finances, AFP reports. But there are major doubts that Africa\u2019s most populous country is finally ready to wean itself off a system that has helped some in high places syphon billions from government coffers. The fuel subsidy scheme has been described as a sprawling web of patronage and mismanagement that encapsulates the dysfunction plaguing the continental powerhouse. Despite being Africa\u2019s largest oil producer, OPEC member Nigeria has limited refinery capacity and actually imports the bulk of its refined products, including fuel. That fuel is then sold at a subsidised rate in an opaque system aimed at keeping average Nigerians happy - but it also left plenty of scope for corruption by officials and traders. Over the past few months the coronavirus crisis and turmoil worldwide has upended all this. The fall in global oil prices means that fuel coming in from outside no longer needs to be subsidised, just as Nigeria\u2019s state revenues have taken a major hit. Taking advantage of the slump to save its much-needed reserves, the Nigerian authorities announced an end to the old system in April. \u201cThere is no subsidy and it is zero forever,\u201d said Mele Kyari, the head of state-run Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation. From now on, officials pledged, the market would determine the cost at the pump. Beijing should expand the scope of nucleic acid testing for the new coronavirus in and the scope of sampling in the Chinese capital, a city government spokesman said on Sunday. He told a news conference Beijing has entered an \u201cextraordinary period\u201d after the city reported a record 36 confirmed new cases of the virus for Saturday. Here are the key developments from around the world from the last few hours: Deaths worldwide pass 430,000. According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, which relies on official government figures, there have been 430,128 known coronavirus deaths worldwide since the start of the pandemic. The number of cases stands at 7,766,952. The true figures for deaths and cases are likely to be higher, due to differing definitions and testing rates, time lags and suspected underreporting. China reports 57 new virus cases, highest daily count since April. China on Sunday reported 57 new cases of the coronavirus, the highest daily figure since 13 April, as concerns grow about a resurgence of the disease. The National Health Commission said 36 of the new cases were domestic infections in Beijing, with 2 more domestic infections in northeastern Liaoning province. Local health officials said they were close contacts of the Beijing cases. The new cluster of domestic infections has prompted fresh lockdowns with people ordered to stay home in 11 residential estates near to the market. The cases are the first in Beijing in two months. Chile Health Minister resigns amid coronavirus deaths. Chilean President Sebastian Pinera on Saturday replaced Health Minister Jaime Manalich amid controversy over the country\u2019s figures for deaths from the coronavirus outbreak. Pinera said Manalich had spared \u201cno effort\u201d in carrying out his \u201cdifficult and noble duty\u201d to protect Chileans\u2019 health. He replaced him with Oscar Enrique Paris, an academic and medical doctor. Half of Brits support Brexit transition extension, survey finds. More than half of people in Britain support an extension to the Brexit transition period, while three-quarters believe the UK should work very closely with the European Union to combat coronavirus, a survey suggests. New York State sees lowest deaths since pandemic started. New York saw its lowest death toll since the pandemic started on Friday. State Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Saturday in the US, and the lowest number of hospitalisations since late March. Evacuation flight for British Nationals leaves Columbia. The flight is operated by the South American country\u2019s flag carrying airline Avianca. On Saturday night 230 passengers, mostly British nationals, were boarding the aircraft. The plane will return back to Colombia from the UK with Colombian evacuees on Sunday. Egypt saw a record daily rise in infections and deaths, as it confirmed 1,677 new coronavirus cases and 62 deaths on Saturday. In total, the Arab world\u2019s most populous country has registered 42,980 cases including 1,484 deaths, the ministry said in a statement. Israel has noted a spike in coronavirus cases as schools, businesses, restaurants, bars, tourist attractions and other establishments reopen, leading to 177 schools and educational institutions throughout the country closing again after 493 students and teachers tested positive for the virus. France reported 24 new coronavirus deaths over the 24 hours to Saturday, taking the total to 29,398 and marking the fourth day with under 30 fatalities. The president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, reproached citizens on Saturday for their reduced adherence to health measures designed to stop the spread of coronavirus. Lebanese protesters took to the streets in Beirut and other cities on Saturday in mostly peaceful protests against the government, calling for its resignation as the small country sinks deeper into economic distress amid lockdown restrictions. The main developments in Australia: NRL postpones match amid Covid-19 scare. The National Rugby League has postponed a match between Canterbury and the Sydney Roosters following a coronavirus scare. Victoria confirms nine new cases, announces easing of restrictions. The state of Victoria, Australia has announced nine new cases of coronavirus today, three of whom are in hotel quarantine. In addition to 50 people being allowed in cafes, restaurants and pubs and patrons being allowed to consume alcohol without a meal, restrictions on some community sports will be eased. Non-contact community sport will return on 22 June \u2013 for both adults and kids, both indoor and outdoor. NSW recorded nine new Covid-19 cases from 13,591 tests in the 24 hours to 8pm on Saturday. Eight of the cases are among returned travellers in hotel quarantine and one is a teacher at Laguna Street Public School in southern Sydney. All students at the primary school have been deemed close contacts and have been told to self-isolate. The school will stop on-site learning until 24 June. Authorities are investigating the source of the teacher\u2019s infection. No cases are in intensive care. The 50-person limit at cafes, restaurants, and churches will be scrapped in NSW with venues instead to follow the one person per four-square-metre rule. The new rule, announced by the NSW government on Sunday, will be in place from 1 July and applies to most indoor venues including pubs and workspaces. Outdoor cultural and sporting venues with a capacity of up to 40,000 will from 1 July also be allowed to seat 25% of their normal capacity. The Queensland state government is committing AU$250m (US$172m) to reduce elective surgery waitlists, which have blown out following the pandemic. More than 7,000 Queenslanders have waited longer than medically recommended for their procedures. Western Australia reports zero new coronavirus cases. WA Western Australia has reported no new cases of Covid-19 overnight, with the State\u2019s total number of cases remaining at 602, according to the WA Department of Health. The Seattle Times reports that a 70-year-old man named Michael Flor, who was in hospital with coronavirus for 62 days, has received a bill for more than $1 million for his stay. The man is insured and may not have to foot the bill himself, but the 81-page document explaining the charges is a reminder of the dire state of the US healthcare system. Seattle Times Journalist Danny Westneat writes: The total tab for his bout with the coronavirus: $1.1 million. $1,122,501.04, to be exact. All in one bill that\u2019s more like a book because it runs to 181 pages. The bill is technically an explanation of charges, and because Flor has insurance including Medicare, he won\u2019t have to pay the vast majority of it. In fact because he had Covid-19, and not a different disease, he might not have to pay anything. ... Flor was in Swedish Medical Center in Issaquah with Covid-19 for 62 days, so he knew the bill would be a doozy. He was unconscious for much of his stay, but once near the beginning his wife Elisa Del Rosario remembers him waking up and saying: \u201cYou gotta get me out of here, we can\u2019t afford this.\u201d New York saw its lowest death toll since the pandemic started. State Governor Andrew Cuomo announced on Saturday in the US, and the lowest number of hospitalisations since late March: Joe Parkin Daniels reports for the Guardian from Bogot\u00e1, Colombia: An evacuation flight of British nationals and residents is about to take off from Colombia, headed for London Heathrow. The flight is operated by the South American country\u2019s flag carrying airline Avianca. On Saturday night 230 passengers, mostly British nationals, were boarding the aircraft. The plane will return back to Colombia from the UK with Colombian evacuees on Sunday. The flight, which was organised between the airline and the governments of Colombia and Britain, was over-subscribed. Colombian president Iv\u00e1n Duque has cancelled all international air travel until September, except for rare evacuation flights like the one that left on Saturday. At capital Bogot\u00e1\u2019s barely operational El Dorado airport on Saturday night, many people waiting in the long, socially-distanced queue, were relieved to be getting home. \u201cThere is a lot of relief from those who feel fortunate to have got a seat through the British embassy, some having initially been rejected,\u201d Luke Taylor, a reporter on the flight, told The Guardian. \u201cBut like myself many are also sad to cut their time in Colombia short without the chance for a real farewell.\u201d Colombia, which is relaxing some of its lockdown measures, currently has confirmed 46,858 cases of Covid-19, with 1545 deaths. Daily cases are climbing, with 1646 confirmed on Saturday, worrying experts that the worst is about to hit. Neighbouring Brazil and Peru both continue to be ravaged by virus. An official at the World Health Organization warned last month that \u201cin a sense, South America has become a new epicenter for the disease.\u201d Satuday\u2019s evacuation flight, which is scheduled to land at Heathrow on Sunday afternoon, will not provide hot food or in-flight entertainment - in line with global protocols to combat the pandemic. The British embassy in Colombia advised passengers on the flight to \u201cplease bring your own reading materials, music and/or films\u201d, in an email sent out last week. \u201cBut most of all, we wish you a safe and pleasant return to the UK.\u201d Australian animal welfare groups are outraged a live export ship is being allowed to sail from Western Australia to the Middle East despite the northern summer ban, after the federal Department of Agriculture granted an exemption, AAP reports. The Al Kuwait has been stranded at Fremantle Port for the past three weeks due to a coronavirus outbreak among crew. Rural Export and Trading WA was initially denied an exemption to the three-and-a-half month ban, which began on June 1 and was prompted by thousands of sheep dying from heat stress aboard the Awassi Express in 2017. But on Saturday the department said it had approved a fresh application. WA agriculture minister Alannah MacTiernan said a 25% reduction in stocking density and stopping at only one port should go some way toward addressing animal welfare concerns. Animals Australia says the decision is \u201cinconceivable\u201d and has collected more than 15,000 signatures against it in an online campaign. \u201cClearly these new welfare laws aren\u2019t worth the paper they\u2019re written on,\u201d the organisation wrote. World Animal Protection said the exemption should not have been granted. The state of Western Australia has reported no new cases of Covid-19 overnight, with the State\u2019s total number of cases remaining at 602, according to the WA Department of Health: There are currently 11 active cases in the state, five are Western Australians and six are crew members from the Al Kuwait livestock carrier. To date, 582 people have recovered from the virus in WA. Yesterday 476 people presented to Covid-19 clinics \u2013 457 were assessed and 450 were swabbed. To date there have been 141,905 Covid-19 tests performed in WA. Of those tested, 25,070 were from regional WA. That announcement comes as Queensland announced no new coronavirus cases and just five active cases across the state. Queensland\u2019s chief health officer Dr Jeanette Young said more than 3,200 tests had been conducted over the past 24 hours. She said the reopening of borders was still pencilled in for July 10 when Stage 3 restrictions would be triggered although she left room for the date to be brought forward. \u201cIf things were a lot better, then of course we could bring that date forward, as it happened for this month on Stage 2,\u201d Dr Young said. \u201cIt\u2019s really what happens at the end of June as to what will happen then for that Stage 3 of the road map.\u201d Mr Miles said modelling had been undertaken on opening up to NSW first but their preference was \u201cto lift the borders all at once.\u201d In Australia, the Queensland state government is committing AU$250m (US$172m) to reduce elective surgery waitlists which have blown out following the pandemic, AAP reports. The state health minister, Steven Miles, outlined the quarter of a billion dollar investment on Sunday that will ease the rising patient waitlist numbers and include ramping-up specialist appointments. More than 7,000 Queenslanders have waited longer than medically recommended for their procedures. \u201cWe will be able to deliver 6000 additional operations, effectively clearing that long wait list,\u201d Mr Miles told reporters. He said the funding would assist with 25,000 specialist appointments. The additional funds will also provide extra theatre lists at night and on weekends and also buy theatre time in the private sector. Queensland had more than 52,200 patients on elective surgery lists on 1 June. We\u2019ve got the latest update from Germany. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country increased by 247 on Saturday to 186,269, according to data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases. The reported death toll rose by six to 8,787. Hundreds of demonstrators angered by a deepening economic crisis rallied across Lebanon for a third consecutive day on Saturday, after violent overnight riots sparked condemnation from the political elite. Protesting against the surging cost of living and the government\u2019s apparent impotence in the face of Lebanon\u2019s worst economic turmoil since the 1975-1990 civil war, protesters in central Beirut brandished flags and chanted anti-government slogans. Lebanon \u2013 one of the most indebted countries in the world, with a sovereign debt of more than 170% of GDP \u2013 went into default in March. Unemployment has soared to 35% nationwide. It started talks with the International Monetary Fund last month in a bid to unlock billions of dollars in financial aid. Dialogue is ongoing. The country enforced a lockdown in mid-March to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus, dealing a further blow to businesses. More than half of people in Britain support an extension to the Brexit transition period, while three-quarters believe the UK should work very closely with the European Union to combat coronavirus, a survey suggests. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove formally told the EU on Friday that the UK would not ask for a delay despite concerns that its departure would compound the economic chaos inflicted by the pandemic. A survey from the Health Foundation indicated public support for an extension to the transition period to allow the government to focus on Covid-19, across two sample groups. Among the first sample, who were told that the transition period for leaving the EU would end on 31 December, 54% said the government should request an extension, while 40% said it should not. According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, which relies on official government figures, there have been 429,666 known coronavirus deaths worldwide since the start of the pandemic. The number of cases stands at 7,764,977. The true figures for deaths and cases are likely to be higher, due to differing definitions and testing rates, time lags and suspected underreporting. Here are the ten countries with the highest number of known cases: US: 2,074,082 Brazil: 850,514 Russia: 519,458 India: 308,993 United Kingdom: 295,828 Spain: 243,605 Italy: 236,651 Peru: 220,749 France: 193,746 Germany: 187,267 NSW recorded nine new Covid-19 cases from 13,591 tests in the 24 hours to 8pm on Saturday. Eight of the cases are among returned travellers in hotel quarantine and one is a teacher at Laguna Street Public School in southern Sydney. All students at the primary school have been deemed close contacts and have been told to self-isolate. The school will stop on-site learning until 24 June. NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant on Sunday said authorities are investigating the source of the teacher\u2019s infection. There have now been 3128 cases of coronavirus in NSW, with 47 people being treated as of Sunday. No cases are in intensive care. Australian trade minister Simon Birmingham hopes China agrees to talks to soothe tensions between the two countries \u201csooner rather than later\u201d, AAP reports. Senator Birmingham\u2019s Chinese counterpart has previously ignored his phone calls to try and and heal growing frictions, which appeared to start when Australia pursued an investigation into the origin of the coronavirus. China has since slapped a hefty tariff on imports on Australian barley, blocked certain beef imports and warned tourists and students not to travel to Australia because they say it is unsafe and racist. In another development in the relationship with Australia\u2019s number one trading partner, China announced on Saturday it was sentencing an Australian drug smuggler, Karm Gilespie, to death after being in prison there since 2013. Asked on Sky New\u2019s Sunday Agenda program whether he thought this incident was linked to the ongoing political row between China and Australia, the senator said: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t necessarily view it as such.\u201d But he rejected any suggestion that Australia is not a safe country for visitors and students to live and study in. \u201cAs a country we offer high quality education, an amazing lifestyle for those who come here, opportunities to experience the Australian way of life and, of course, a very safe environment,\u201d Senator Birmingham said. He said over the past couple of years China had made similar types of warnings and that hadn\u2019t stopped Chinese students and tourists from coming to Australia. The minister said he would like to visit China in person when it is appropriate given present international travel bans because of the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cBut I do think that in terms of dealing with points of difference between nations ... is dialogue, open discussion,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that we will see China agree to that and do so, ideally, sooner rather than later. It doesn\u2019t need to wait for a visit, it can be done through virtual summits, phone calls or otherwise.\u201d Mexico\u2019s health ministry reported 3,494 new confirmed coronavirus infections along with 424 additional fatalities on Saturday, bringing the total in the country to 142,690 cases and 16,872 deaths. The government has said the real number of infected people is likely significantly higher than the official count. Guardian Australia\u2019s Greg Jericho has this explainer on what is happening to stock markets at the moment: When the coronavirus hit, stock markets around the world sank as fast as they ever have. Both in Australia and in the US, the market fell about 35% in less than a month. That at least makes sense to people: the economy is about to shut down so you would expect the value of companies\u2019 stocks to fall. But over the past three months the Australian stock market has risen strongly and by Wednesday was back to where it was in February last year and only about 15% below the peak of February this year. In the US things were even \u201cbetter\u201d. The S&amp;P500 was down just 5% on the pre-virus peaks, and the technology based Nasdaq Index had not only recovered all the losses of February and March it was breaking records. So the bad news is over? We\u2019re back and fully functioning again? Well, no. While there may be some link with reality and the value of stocks, a large proportion of what we\u2019re seeing is a reaction to things seemingly not being as bad as first thought, and also a wilful desire to pretend things are not as bad as they are. Oxford University researcher and founder of Our World In Data explains below why Chile\u2019s coronavirus infections are so worrying: Chilean president Sebastian Pinera on Saturday replaced health minister Jaime Manalich amid controversy over the country\u2019s figures for deaths from the coronavirus outbreak, AFP reports. Pinera said Manalich had spared \u201cno effort\u201d in carrying out his \u201cdifficult and noble duty\u201d to protect Chileans\u2019 health. He replaced him with Oscar Enrique Paris, an academic and medical doctor. Manalich, a tough-talking kidney specialist who once ran one of Chile\u2019s top hospitals, has won praise for an aggressive campaign to keep hospitals supplied with ventilators and protective equipment and leading detailed daily press conferences. But there have been frequent reports of spats among health ministry officials, and Manalich has been criticised by opposition politicians, mayors, medical experts and social groups for refusing to release more detailed contagion data or apply lockdowns sooner and for successive changes in criteria for recording deaths and cases. The sudden reshuffle comes as Chile faces its toughest month in the pandemic so far, with spiralling active cases and deaths rates. The country now has the highest number of confirmed cases per million people in Latin America, reporting 167,355 cases on Saturday and 3,101 deaths. The new minister, Enrique Paris, is a former head of the Chilean College of Doctors (Colmed) and a university deacon. Jos\u00e9 Miguel Bernucci, Colmed\u2019s national secretary, welcomed the appointment, saying he was looking forward to a more consensual approach and a \u201cchange in strategy to jointly confront the pandemic.\u201d Back to Australia: The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has also given some guidance on restrictions. On Friday, the national cabinet agreed that under step three of the national guidelines, states could possibly remove the 100 person cap for venues and implement a one person per four square metre rule instead. Meaning that some larger venues could have more than 100. Andrews said Victoria was still \u201ctesting\u201d whether this would work for venues in the state. And that the national cabinet could still alter that rule. \u201cThat work will be done over the next fortnight and when we next meet as a national cabinet, a fortnight from last Friday, we will make a decision or not, but that matter is being tested, if you like,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause I know that there are a number of pubs, for instance, a number of venues where there is no way of getting 50 patrons in but enclosed space because the room simply isn\u2019t big enough, from a square metre point of view.\u201d He also said that electronic gambling could be back by 20 July. \u201cElectronic gaming, that is still some way off, and you will see in the release that we have foreshadowed the 20th of next month. \u201cIt is probably longer than the industry would have liked, but it is important to be cautious about this. It will not be electronic gaming as we know it. It will be spacing, there will be not necessarily every machine, all that is to be worked through.\u201d In Beijing, AFP reporters saw hundreds of police officers, many wearing masks and gloves, and dozens of paramilitary police deployed at the market. The new cases have prompted worries about the safety of the food supply chain and some other markets in the city have also been closed. Beijing\u2019s market supervision authorities ordered a city-wide food safety inspection focusing on fresh and frozen meat, poultry and fish in supermarkets, warehouses and catering services. Nine nearby schools and kindergartens have been closed and Beijing has delayed the return of students to primary schools. Sporting events, group dining and cross-provincial tour groups have also been stopped. The rest of the cases reported Sunday were brought into the country by Chinese nationals returning home from overseas. More now on China, which on Sunday reported 57 new cases of the coronavirus, the highest daily figure since 13 April, as concerns grow about a resurgence of the disease. The National Health Commission said 36 of the new cases were domestic infections in Beijing, with 2 more domestic infections in northeastern Liaoning province. Local health officials said they were close contacts of the Beijing cases. The new cluster of domestic infections has prompted fresh lockdowns with people ordered to stay home in 11 residential estates near to the market. The cases are the first in Beijing in two months. The 50-person limit at cafes, restaurants, and churches will be scrapped in NSW with venues instead to follow the one person per four square metres rule, AAP reports. The new rule, announced by the NSW government on Sunday, will be in place from 1 July and applies to most indoor venues including pubs and workspaces. It will allow for more people to attend gatherings, but the size of the space will be crucial with one person allowed for every four square metres. Outdoor cultural and sporting venues with a capacity of up to 40,000 will from 1 July also be allowed to seat 25% of their normal capacity. The relaxation of restrictions is in line with the national cabinet\u2019s decision on Friday to tweak the third stage of easing Covid-19 rules. It comes as all students at a primary school in southern Sydney have been told to stay at home after a staff member tested positive for Covid-19. Laguna Street Public School will stop on-site learning until Thursday following the diagnosis, according to the NSW education department. All school students have been deemed close contacts of the employee and should start self-isolating, a statement from the department said on Saturday night. A staff member at Rose Bay Public School in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs was also confirmed to have tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday. The Australian government\u2019s push for economic talks among finance ministers from countries in the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance remains vague, with no details yet about the frequency of meetings or their agenda. But some experts have argued the move to coordinate economic policies with Australia\u2019s traditional security partners reflects a \u201cvery deep misunderstanding\u201d of our modern economic interests given the group excludes Asia and most of Europe. The government indicated this week that Australia had secured support from the other countries in the Five Eyes pact \u2013 the United Kingdom, United States, Canada and New Zealand \u2013 to hold \u201cregular\u201d meetings to coordinate economic responses during the Covid-19 pandemic. The existing intelligence-sharing arrangement has its origins in the 1940s \u2013 and during the Cold War was focused on the Soviet Union \u2013 but over time the cooperation between partners has broadened beyond signals intelligence to include issues such as terrorism, organised crime, law-enforcement and borders: Moving away from Australia for a moment to China, which has reported 57 new coronavirus cases \u2013 the highest since April, according to AFP. More on this shortly: In addition to 50 people being allowed in cafes, restaurants and pubs and patrons being allowed to consume alcohol without a meal, restrictions on some community sports will be eased. Victorian health minister, Jenny Mikakos, also said that non-contact community sport would return on 22 June \u2013 for both adults and kids, both indoor and outdoor. Under 18s will be able to play competitively with full contact from 22 June, while adults will be able to train with contact from 13 July, then resume with full contact competition from 20 July. The state of Victoria, Australia has announced nine new cases of coronavirus today, three of whom are in hotel quarantine. One person contracted the virus from an unknown origin, and that is being investigated. Five cases are linked to two known outbreaks, including an outbreak linked to a GP who tested positive. \u201cThe GP worked at three different clinics but did absolutely the right thing,\u201d the health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said. The doctor was tested and stopped working while waiting for results. Mikakos said they expect six new hotel quarantine cases each day in the state, as residents return home. Staying in Australia for the time being, the National Rugby League has postponed a match between Canterbury and the Sydney Roosters following a coronavirus scare. AAP reports that Canterbury forward Aiden Tolman was notified on Saturday night a teacher at his child\u2019s school had tested positive to the virus. The Laguna Street public school in Sydney\u2019s south has been closed until 25 June, with a warning there\u2019s a possibility children may have brought the virus home. More on this below: In Australia, the Premier of the state of Victoria has announced that restrictions will be eased further from midnight on 21 June \u2013 more on this shortly. Hi, Helen Sullivan here in cold, wet Sydney. Cockatoos are making a fuss in the trees outside, there is a small, white dog asleep beside me and I\u2019m on the blog. If you\u2019re following along, get in touch on Twitter or via email: helen.sullivan@theguardian.com. I\u2019d love to hear a bit about where you\u2019re reading this from. The world is anxiously watching Beijing, after a new cluster of locally transmitted cases emerged 55 days after the last known locally transmitted case in the city, which had almost returned to normal life. Meanwhile Brazil\u2019s death toll, currently at 42,720, overtook the UK\u2019s to become the second-worst worldwide. The country also has the second-highest number of cases, with 850,514 known infections. Here are the latest developments from around the world: Parts of Beijing have reimposed lockdown measures, after a cluster of locally transmitted coronavirus cases emerged nearly two months after the Chinese capital appeared to have stamped out the virus. The outbreak, linked to a major wholesale food market, raised serious questions about the challenges of keeping the disease at bay, even in countries such as China where authoritarian rule allows harsh containment regulations and invasive tracing systems. Egypt saw a record daily rise in infections and deaths, as it confirmed 1,677 new coronavirus cases and 62 deaths on Saturday. In total, the Arab world\u2019s most populous country has registered 42,980 cases including 1,484 deaths, the ministry said in a statement. Infections in Turkey have been increasing since travel restrictions were lifted and facilities reopened at the beginning of the month. Israel has noted a spike in coronavirus cases as schools, businesses, restaurants, bars, tourist attractions and other establishments reopen, leading to 177 schools and educational institutions throughout the country closing again after 493 students and teachers tested positive for the virus. France reported 24 new coronavirus deaths over the 24 hours to Saturday, taking the total to 29,398 and marking the fourth day with under 30 fatalities. The president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, reproached citizens on Saturday for their reduced adherence to health measures designed to stop the spread of coronavirus. Algeria will further relax its coronavirus lockdown on Sunday, easing a curfew, allowing public transport to resume in the cities and reopening some more businesses, the government said on Saturday. Travellers from Germany, Iceland and Norway are to be permitted to enter Denmark from Monday as long as they have booked accommodation for at least six nights, as the country gradually lifts its coronavirus-related travel restrictions. Lebanese protesters took to the streets in Beirut and other cities on Saturday in mostly peaceful protests against the government, calling for its resignation as the small country sinks deeper into economic distress amid lockdown restrictions.",

In a speech to the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia (Ceda) on Monday, the prime minister will also provide an update on the deregulation agenda of his jobs package, which he says will be \u201ca focus\u201d for the recovery. The speech follows Morrison\u2019s proposals to reform the allocation of $1.5bn of federal skills funding and announcement of five industrial relations roundtables in May. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, will use his speech to Ceda to accuse the government of \u201cwaste and mismanagement\u201d in its handling of the robodebt and jobkeeper programs, including paying some workers \u201cmore money \u2026 than they were before the pandemic while other workers are missing out altogether\u201d. Albanese proposes a new national skills body and calls for \u201cintelligent budgets and a progressive tax system that incentivises investment in capital and people\u201d. With the bulk of the government\u2019s $134bn of economic supports set to expire in September, Morrison is under pressure to explain what industry assistance will be provided if jobkeeper is withdrawn and to create jobs for those on the jobseeker unemployment benefit. Since November, the government has already brought forward $7.8bn in infrastructure spending, with a further $1.5bn to be announced on Monday consisting of $500m for road safety and $1bn for other shovel-ready projects. In excerpts of the speech, seen by Guardian Australia, Morrison announces the commonwealth, states and territories will set up \u201cjoint assessment teams\u201d to fast-track approval for 15 major projects worth more than $72bn in public and private investment. Morrison sets a target to halve commonwealth assessment and approval times, from an average of 3.5 years to 21 months. The priority list includes the Melbourne to Brisbane inland rail line, the Marinus Link between Tasmania and Victoria, the Olympic Dam extension in South Australia, emergency town water projects in New South Wales; and road, rail and iron ore projects in Western Australia. In February Infrastructure Australia listed town and city water security projects and connectivity of the east coast electricity market, including the Marinus Link, as high priority initiatives and the inland rail as a priority. \u201cThese are immediate actions we are taking today, but working within existing systems will only take us so far,\u201d Morrison says. \u201cAll levels of government, business and the community must rethink how these systems can better contribute to our recovery from the pandemic. \u201cWe need to bring the same common sense and cooperation we showed fighting Covid-19 to unlocking infrastructure investment in the recovery.\u201d Morrison praises states that \u201chave already cut approval times\u201d \u2013 citing the approval of Snowy 2.0 in New South Wales within two years \u2013 but says he has \u201casked them all to lift their ambition further, and work with us through the national cabinet to make deregulation a focus of Australia\u2019s economic recovery\u201d. In May Guardian Australia revealed the manufacturing taskforce advising the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission had recommended Australian taxpayers underwrite a massive expansion of the domestic gas industry, which has lead to accusations the body is too focused on gas as the main path out of recession. In his speech, seen by Guardian Australia, Albanese presents \u201cpolicy confusion\u201d on energy policy as one of a number of handbrakes on Australia\u2019s growth, calling for certainty and clean, cheap energy. Albanese notes science agency CSIRO has found that \u201cnet zero emissions by 2050 would result in higher wages, higher growth and lower energy costs\u201d. Albanese says Labor wants the tax system to give \u201cbusinesses incentives to invest in themselves \u2013 both in their equipment and in their workers\u201d. Albanese argues the vocational education sector has been \u201cseverely run down and mismanaged by the Morrison government\u201d, citing $3bn in funding cuts and a reduction in apprentice numbers by 140,000. \u201cWe need a [vocational education and training] system that not only trains people for current needs, but that provides workers with transferable skills, and the capacity to upgrade them. \u201cThis is of such importance I announced Labor\u2019s plans for Jobs and Skills Australia, a body that will be a genuine partnership across all sectors.\u201d Albanese defends Labor\u2019s record in opposition, setting out that it had \u201cscrutinised the government\u2019s actions and put forward constructive ideas\u201d but ultimately passed its emergency fiscal measures. Albanese accuses the government of facilitating a \u201craid on superannuation\u201d that is a \u201ctime bomb in the making\u201d and announces that a future Labor government will \u201cmove quickly to develop and implement a positive ageing strategy\u201d, if elected. \u201cIt will outline a plan to help Australians in their final years of paid work, to build the nest egg that will let them retire when and how they want.\u201d Albanese suggests Labor would help \u201crebuild our capacity to have constructive national conversations\u201d which he says has \u201cbeen corroded by culture wars \u2014 but it is not beyond repair\u201d. \u201cWe owe Australians the vision and courage to imagine and create a better future. A future underpinned by the togetherness that got us through the coronavirus.\u201d",

Chief Superintendent Alan Murray said: \u201cPolice Scotland can confirm that officers were aware of a disturbance near George Square, Glasgow today. \u201cAt this time the incident does not appear to be connected to a Black Lives Matter protest.\u201d The original protest was cancelled by Glasgow Youth Art Collective after it claimed it could not access George Square and \u201cpolice targeting activists\u201d. You can read more about one of the instances here. Scotland\u2019s education secretary John Swinney says that schools are likely to continue with the \u2018blended learning\u2019 model from August until the end of the next school year. With pupils across Scotland expected to return on August 11 to a mixture of at-home and in-school learning, Swinney told Sunday Police Scotland that things were \u201cunlikely\u201d to return to normal before the end of the school year since social distancing will be required for some time yet. Some councils have already made public plans that involve children being in school buildings for only two days out of every five. He also said that, while he understands some parents will be nervous about sending their children back to school, it will be a legal requirement. Teaching unions and parents groups area already expressing concerns that the new model with impact especially on poorer families and those parents who are unable to work from home. A little more information from Chancellor Rishi Sunak\u2019s appearance on Sophy Ridge\u2019s programme on Sky News this morning... Sunak claims there have been 9 million jobs protected through the furlough scheme \u201csorry\u201d that not everyone got \u201cwhat they wanted\u201d through government support schemes. The Labour Party has launched a \u2018Holidays Without Hunger\u2019 petition to get the government to offer free school meals during the summer holidays. \u201cThe coronavirus crisis has left millions of people up and down the country with an uncertain future, struggling to make ends meet,\u201d the petition says. \u201cIn England, 1.3 million kids rely on Free School Meals. Parents know how important a healthy diet is for children \u2013 and for children from struggling families, these meals are a lifeline. Once school is out, these families\u2019 kids get left behind. Since schools closed because of the crisis, a voucher scheme has made sure these children don\u2019t go hungry. Now, the Government is planning to take these vouchers away.\u201d During the pandemic, free school meals have been operated on a voucher system, which meant parents can trade in the voucher at local supermarkets if their child cannot come in for their lunch, but this will stop during the holidays. Protesters calling for the removal of a statue of Metropolitan Police founder Robert Peel and counter-protesters have been separated by police in Glasgow. A group of protesters calling for the removal of the statue were being escorted down North Hanover Street when they overtook the police escort and began running towards George Square. Hundreds of counter-protesters then ran towards the group, before police intervened to get between the two groups. Protesters calling for the statue\u2019s removal were forced back up North Hannover Street. A police helicopter was deployed and could be seen flying over the city centre. Prime minister Boris Johnson has released a video message saying he is committed to uncovering the causes of the Grenfell Tower Fire and ensuring it is never repeated, on the third anniversary of the tragedy. He also acknowledged the impact of coronavirus on grieving friends and relatives, saying that he understood that this anniversary was \u201cparticularly hard\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve introduced stricter laws on fire safety, launched a billion-pound fund to remove dangerous cladding and created a new watchdog to protect the residents of tall buildings,\u201d Johnson said in the video. \u201cWe\u2019re working to implement every recommendation made by the first phase of the public inquiry. And the second phase, while it\u2019s been delayed by coronavirus, is slowly but surely getting to the definitive truth of how this disaster was allowed to happen.\u201d \u201cI know this anniversary is particularly hard, coming at a time when so many survivors and bereaved can\u2019t even come together to share a hug,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile those affected by Grenfell are not able to gather in person, I want you to know that all of us in this country are with you in spirit.\u201d \u201cYou will not be forgotten. We stand with you, we weep with you and we are with you, today and always,\u201d he added. There have still been no arrests made over the fire, which killed 72 people after cladding on the building caught fire and spread rapidly. The Labour Party have warned that 56,000 people still living in buildings with Grenfell-style cladding.

Thanks in advance! Chancellor Rishi Sunak has defended the Government\u2019s \u201creasonable and measured\u201d approach to schools reopening, after the Children\u2019s Commissioner for England said that it was undermining children\u2019s right to an education During a round of broadcast interviews this morning, Sunak said that every day children were away from school was a \u201ctragedy\u201d but insisted the Government had acted correctly. With most pupils likely to stay home until September, Children\u2019s Commissioner Anne Longfield told the Observer that \u201cvery dangerous\u201d threat to the right to guaranteed education and that next year\u2019s academic year could be seriously impacted. You can read more from my colleagues Michael Savage and Liz Lightfoot here: Ministers are set to mount a new push this week to get more primary school children back school ahead of the summer break. Currently, primary schools in England are opening to pupils in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6, but ministers will reaffirm that schools can host children from other year groups - as long as they have the resources and space to do so safely. This means limiting class sizes to 15 and introducing protective measures such as regular hand washing to reduce the likelihood of coronavirus spreading. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) has said it will monitor any moves by the UK to introduce a \u201clight touch\u201d approach to goods entering the country from the EU after the Brexit transition period. It comes after the the UK Government said on Friday that it was exploring whether to adopt fewer checks on imports from the EU for around six months. Roberto Azevedo, director-general of the WTO, said that such a move is \u201cnot a no-go by definition\u201d, but that the UK would have to follow strict rules. He told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: \u201cYou have transitional periods in most of these trade deals. So, you may have a period where that \u2018light touch\u2019 may be part of the transitional agreement and other members of the WTO may take that as something acceptable. It may, however, be done in a way that challenges the rules of the WTO a little bit more and then members, I think, will be looking very carefully.\u201d He also said he believes there is a \u201cpretty good chance\u201d of the UK and EU finding a deal before the end of the transition period. A couple who were arrested when armed police stormed their home and held them for 36 hours over the flying of drones at Gatwick Airport will receive \u00a3200,000 in compensation and an apology from police. Paul and Elaine Gait, who were questioned after the airport was forced to cancel flights and repeatedly close over a three day period during the height of Christmas travel in 2018, have settled their claims for wrongful arrest and false imprisonment in an out-of-court settlement package with Sussex Police. To this day, no-one has been charged over the incident, and police have said that some reported drone sightings may have been Sussex Police\u2019s own craft. Hi everyone, I\u2019m Molly Blackall, taking over the blog from my colleague Josh Halliday for a little while. Returning briefly to Rishi Sunak\u2019s interview on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show, the chancellor said the economy was taking a \u201cenormous hit\u201d from coronavirus but insisted that the government had protected millions of jobs through the furlough scheme. Sunak said he hoped the opening of non-essential shops in England from Monday, coupled with the ability for companies to take on workers part-time next month, would help \u201cdrive the recovery\u201d before the furlough scheme ends in October. Asked about research by the Institute for Employment Studies, which suggests that 3 million people are currently unemployed \u2013 the highest since the 1980s \u2013 and that by Autumn the level of unemployment would be the highest in UK history, Sunak said there would be \u201chardship ahead\u201d and that the government was dealing with an unprecedented situation and that the virus would have \u201can enormous cost\u201d. \u201cWhat I do know is the situation would be a lot worse if we hadn\u2019t acted in the way we did,\u201d he added. Sunak said it was important people had the confidence to go shopping because the government had \u201cmade enormous progress\u201d in tackling the virus, and that shops would have safety measures in place. On the 14-day quarantine of arrivals to Britain, Sunak said it would keep it under review and that it was \u201clooking at all options,\u201d including opening up travel corridors with other countries. He did not demur from the suggestion that the quarantine would be relaxed. Sunak said a second spike in infections would be \u201cvery damaging\u201d and that all countries were \u201cfeeling our way through\u201d the virus. He added: Until there\u2019s a cure, a vaccine, everything we do carries some degree of risk. I think everybody acknowledges that. Our job is to execute the plan we put in place, which is to protect people, make sure the NHS isn\u2019t overwhelmed and that is what thus far we\u2019ve been able to achieve. Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer will today join people across the country in marking the third anniversary of the Grenfell Tower tragedy. A video message from the prime minister will be shown at a virtual service being hosted by the Bishop of Kensington this morning. This evening, Downing Street will be illuminated to commemorate those who lost their lives. Several other landmarks, including the Palace of Westminster, Trafalgar Square fountains and Grenfell Tower have also been lit up this weekend, while digital screens at the site of the tower carry messages from local stakeholder groups. \u201cWe can all remember where we were three years ago today when we saw this tragedy unfolding on our screens and across the London skyline,\u201d Johnson recalls in his message. Sadiq Khan, the London mayor, said he would be \u201crelentless\u201d in ensuring those responsible for the disaster are held to account: David Lammy, the Labour MP, has released this powerful interview with Channel 4 News in which he says that a crucial part of Britain\u2019s safety net for vulnerable people - safe housing \u2013 is \u201cfalling apart around our eyes\u201d: Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has said a decision on whether to ease the two-metre rule in England will be for ministers rather than the government\u2019s scientific advisers. Sunak said the public would take confidence from the fact ministers were being advised by chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and chief medical officer for England, Professor Chris Whitty. He told BBC1\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance throughout all of this have provided advice to ministers. Ultimately it is for ministers. We are the people who are elected to make decisions in this country. People should hold us responsible and accountable for making those decisions. I think that people are comforted and have confidence in those decisions if they know that we are taking advice from our scientists. Pippa Crerar, the Daily Mirror\u2019s political editor, points out that taking such a decision without the express backing of Vallance and Whitty would be even trickier if the pair are \u201con resignation watch,\u201d as the Sunday Times reports today. Labour\u2019s shadow justice secretary David Lammy has accused the government of having \u201cburied\u201d recommendations from a report by Public Health England looking at the disproportionate toll Covid-19 has had on people from a black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) background. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, Lammy said: It\u2019s horrifying that at the moment across this country it\u2019s hard to be black or Asian and not know someone, or someone who knows someone, who has died. I\u2019ve lost an uncle. I\u2019ve lost a classmate who died at 45 due to this terrible virus. The point is it\u2019s a scandal if one week Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock say \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 and then we find out today that they buried part of the review that had the recommendations in it to do something about it. He added: \u201cGet on it with it because people are dying every day and you said \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019. It\u2019s no wonder why people are upset.\u201d A 28-year-old man has been arrested in Essex on suspicion of outraging public decency after a man was photographed urinating next to the memorial dedicated to PC Keith Palmer, the Metropolitan Police has said. The man is currently in custody in Essex after presenting himself at a police station, the force said. Speaking yesterday in response to an image circulating on social media, Commander Bas Javid said: \u201cWe are aware of a disgusting and abhorrent image circulating on social media of a man appearing to urinate on a memorial to PC Palmer. \u201cI feel for PC Palmer\u2019s family, friends and colleagues. We have immediately launched an investigation, and will gather all the evidence available to us and take appropriate action.\u201d Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has suggested he is very much in favour of reducing the two-metre social distancing rule. Unsurprising, perhaps, for the minister responsible for the economy but important nonetheless that he has said it. On Sky News, Sunak said \u201cI very much understand the positive impact it will have\u201d on the economy but \u201cat the same time we must make sure it\u2019s safe to do so\u201d. He suggested that reducing the rule could be the \u201cdifference between three quarters and a third of pubs opening, for example\u201d \u2013 an example that will almost certainly win the backing of some newspapers. Sunak also said Norway and Denmark had recently reduced their social distancing guide from two metres. He welcome that Boris Johnson was overseeing a \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d of the policy, which Sunak said would consider evidence from economists as well as scientists \u201cso we can look at it in the round\u201d. When Sophy Ridge said it sounded like Sunak was very much in favour of shortening the rule, the chancellor said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to pre-empt the findings of [the review] ... it\u2019s right to look at it and I\u2019m glad we\u2019re doing so.\u201d The chancellor Rishi Sunak has described the clashes between police and protestors in London yesterday as \u201cshocking and disgusting\u201d but said the UK had made \u201cenormous progress\u201d on issues of race. Appearing on Sophy Ridge\u2019s programme on Sky News, Sunak confirmed that the justice secretary Robert Buckland would meet Conservative MPs this week to discuss strict new measures against those who vandalise a war memorial, including potential 10-year jail terms. \u201cThere will always be a small minority who maintain prejudice and indeed are racist but that\u2019s not the description that I would make of our country,\u201d he said, adding that things have changed \u201cenormously for the better\u201d. Labour\u2019s shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, has said the party would potentially support proposals to jail for 10 years anyone who desecrates a war memorial. The Sunday Telegraph reports that ministers are considering plans to make it easier to prosecute those who vandalise historic monuments, including with jail terms of up to a decade. Speaking on the Sky News Sophy Ridge programme, Thomas-Symonds said he was \u201cextremely disturbed\u201d by the \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d scenes of violence on the streets following protests on Saturday. My colleague Peter Walker tweets: A variety of stories make the front pages of Sunday\u2019s newspapers, with some focusing on the violent scenes in London yesterday and others on coronavirus. The Observer leads with a warning from England\u2019s children\u2019s commissioner Anne Longfield that there was a \u201cvery dangerous\u201d threat to the historic right to education for children after the government said most schools would not reopen until September at the earliest. The Sunday Times reports that plans to allow people to change their legal gender by self-identifying as a different sex have been scrapped. The Mail on Sunday says Boris Johnson has paved the way for the two-metre social distancing rule to be scrapped by \u201ctaking personal control of the decision to axe it\u201d. It says the prime minister has commissioned a \u201ccomprehensive No 10 review\u201d of the policy. The Sunday Mirror leads with a simple one-word headline: \u201cShameful\u201d as it depicts the violent demonstrations by far-right activists in London. The Independent on Sunday reports on Brexit (remember that?) and a poll suggesting that most Britons would support an extension to the transition period for leaving the European Union due to Covid-19. The Sunday Telegraph says ministers are considering proposals to jail for 10 years anyone who desecrates a war memorial. And finally... the Daily Star Sunday reports on \u201ca big flap\u201d in the Royal household after \u201ceight of the Queen\u2019s racing pigeons died in quarantine\u201d. The paper says the poor pigeons died in crates after being flown to South African to take part in a race. A \u201cPalace coo\u201d is underway, it says. Good morning and welcome to the UK liveblog. There is widespread condemnation of the violent protest in central London yesterday, which saw thousands of demonstrators \u2013 including far-right activists \u2013 descend on the capital prompting clashes with the police. As of 9pm on Saturday, the Metropolitan police said it had made more than 100 arrests at the protest which Boris Johnson said had descended into \u201cracist thuggery\u201d. The clashes with police and journalists came after thousands of white nationalists poured into London to \u201cprotect the monuments,\u201d after graffiti on the statue of Winston Churchill and the Cenotaph in London, and the toppling of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, during Black Lives Matter protests last weekend. Elsewhere today, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is touring the TV studios ahead of the reopening of non-essential shops in England on Monday as the government attempts to reboot the economy. It\u2019s also emerged that the prime minister has ordered an official review of the two-metre social distancing rule, potentially providing a further boost for business. However, any move to one metre is likely to split the government\u2019s scientific advisors who have repeatedly expressed caution about reducing the rule.",
