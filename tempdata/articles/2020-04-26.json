      "bodyText": "We\u2019ve launched a new global coronavirus news blog at the link below: Eight mobile coronavirus testing units staffed by the army are starting to travel around Britain, with dozens more to follow, to help the government approach its target of 100,000 tests a day for the new coronavirus, Reuters reports. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has promised that number of daily tests by 30 April, but by Friday only 28,760 had been achieved. Refitted vehicles will collect throat swabs, which will be sent to laboratories for processing, the Department of Health said in a statement on Sunday. A further 96 of the units will start operating during May. The units can be set up in under 20 minutes and will carry out tests on essential staff such as those who work in care homes, the police and prisons, and have found it difficult to travel to fixed, drive-through test centres. There are concerns that a lack of testing could slow Britain\u2019s gradual exit from lockdown and delay the revival of its economy, the world\u2019s fifth-largest. The mobile units carried out a trial run last week in Salisbury, Southport and Teesside. In Northern Ireland, the units will be staffed by contractors, not the army, the statement said. Hundreds of thousands of state employees in Belarus, including doctors and nurses, took part in a government-decreed national day of civic labor Saturday despite worries about the country\u2019s sharply rising coronavirus infections, AP reports. The work, including painting, tree-planting and general clean-ups, was ordered by President Alexander Lukashenko, who has dismissed concerns about the virus even though Belarus has recorded more cases than neighbouring Ukraine, a county with four times as many people. Lukashenko, a former collective farm manager, has retained many Soviet-era practices during his quarter-century in power, including the day of civic labor known as a subbotnik from the Russian word for Saturday. The Belarusian government has not imposed social-distancing requirements or restricted public activities in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Of the hundreds of people working along with the president, none were seen wearing masks. Sainsbury\u2019s top man steps down just as the panic-buying revenues roll in Mike Coupe is preparing to deliver Sainsbury\u2019s annual results on Thursday, his last presentation to investors as head of Britain\u2019s second biggest supermarket chain. After almost six years at the top, the 59-year-old is retiring on 31 May, and will hand over to Simon Roberts, the group\u2019s retail and operations director. You wonder how Roberts might be feeling about that. Few could have predicted the challenges facing the retailer, and the country, when Coupe\u2019s departure was announced in January \u2013 just as Public Health England was declaring that the risk to the British public from coronavirus was low. Even for a business that goes back 150 years, Sainsbury\u2019s (and its retail rivals) are dealing with truly historic circumstances, and huge pressure on supply chains. China has been accused of using the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to take some bold and provocative actions, including expansions in the South China Sea, crackdowns on activists in Hong Kong and further detention of activists in the mainland. Some analysts have suggested Beijing is sending a message that China\u2019s aggressive foreign policy is still business as usual, or testing its adversaries for weaknesses. Here are some examples: Hi, Helen Sullivan with you now. I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic from around the world for the next few hours. You can get in touch with my directly on Twitter @helenrsullivan. The total number of people to die worldwide after contracting the novel coronavirus has surpassed 200,000, figures show. The global death toll increased to 202,368 on Saturday, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally. The figures for infections are likely to underestimate the true scale of the pandemic due to suspected under-reporting and differing testing regimes. Death toll figures are also controversial, with some countries reporting deaths as confirmed Covid-19 cases on the basis of symptoms and in the absence of a positive test, while others are not including them. Boris Johnson will return to work on Monday and is \u2018raring to go\u2019, a Downing street spokeswoman has confirmed. The prime minister has been recovering in his country residence after spending three nights in intensive care in April. He returns to face a dilemma over whether to ease the coronavirus lockdown, as leading scientists warn that the number of new cases remains much too high. German police arrested dozens of protesters in Berlin on Saturday for flouting the coronavirus lockdown measures they were demonstrating against. About 1,000 people turned out for the rally, which has become a weekly event in the German capital. Saturday\u2019s protest attracted mainly far-left activists but there were also right-wing supporters and members of other fringe groups. Paraguayan authorities have laid out details of a plan to begin lifting the country\u2019s total quarantine. Health minister Julio Mazzonleni announced at press conference on Friday that a new \u201cintelligent quarantine\u201d will begin on 4 May. It will gradually reintroduce public freedoms and economic activities through a four-stage plan set to run until early July. The UK\u2019s biggest steel producer needs about \u00a3500m in government support to see it through the coronavirus crisis, according to Welsh MP Stephen Kinnock. Tata Steel has reportedly approached the UK and Welsh governments for a bailout after its big European customers halted production. The company employs 8,385 people across the UK, including more than 4,000 workers at the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales. Spain could lift more lockdown restrictions and allow adults out to exercise from 2 May if efforts to contain the spread of the virus continue to pay off, prime minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez has said. The strict lockdown enacted after the declaration of a state of emergency on 14 March has been extended until 9 May, but children under the age of 14 will be allowed out for an hour\u2019s exercise each day from Sunday. As rumours of Kim Jong-un\u2019s death circulate on social media, one news agency has suggested that he may be sheltering from Covid-19 in a North Korean resort town. On Friday, South Korean news agency Newsis said that a special train for Kim\u2019s use had been spotted by intelligence sources in the town of Wonsan. A Washington-based North Korea monitoring project called 38 North has captured satellite images which also appear to show a special train, possibly belonging to the Northern Korean leader, in Wonsan. Though the group said it was probably Kim Jong Un\u2019s train, Reuters has not been able to confirm that independently, or whether he was in Wonsan. Donald Trump stays away from briefings amid fallout from disinfectant comments After more than a month of near-daily White House coronavirus press briefings, Donald Trump stayed behind closed doors on Saturday after advisers reportedly warned the president that his appearances were hurting his campaign. In recent weeks Trump has used the briefings to dole out unproven and debunked medical advice, suggesting that things like sunlight and an anti-malaria drug are cures to Covid-19, often causing his own medical experts to try to correct the record. But on Friday Trump surprised observers by taking no questions and stalking out of the room after an unusually short briefing of just 22 minutes. Some took the move as an acknowledgement from Trump himself that he may have taken things too far when he said on Thursday that disinfectant could be used to cure Covid-19. My colleague Lauren Aratani has the full report: Key workers should be given face masks \u2013 BMA The chair of the British Medical Association (BMA) has urged the government to provide all essential workers with face masks to combat the spread of Covid-19. It is currently not compulsory to wear a mask or face covering in public, but ministers are considering recommendations made by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) following a review of current advice. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the BMA council, is calling on the government to ask all members of the public to cover their mouths and noses when going outside. He told the Daily Telegraph that the doctors\u2019 union believes all key workers outside of the NHS should be provided with masks or suitable face coverings. He said this includes \u201ctransport workers, shopkeepers, carers or supermarket staff\u201d who are unable to abide by social distancing. \u201cCommon sense tells you that a barrier between people must offer a level of protection, however small,\u201d Dr Nagpaul said. He added: The Government must pursue all avenues of reducing the spread of infection. This includes asking the public to wear face coverings to cover mouths and noses when people leave home for essential reasons.\u201d He said that until \u201csufficient supplies of PPE are provided\u201d to the frontline, this may initially mean members of the public wearing cloth masks and scarves. Current UK guidance has emphasised the importance of masks for doctors and nurses, but does not suggest widespread usage. However, scientific advisers for the government have carried out a review of the use of face masks, despite the World Health Organization (WHO) saying that there is no evidence to support their use by the general population. Turkey\u2019s health ministry has reported 2,861 new confirmed cases of coronavirus and 106 more deaths but says the rate of positive tests for the virus is decreasing. The daily figures the health minister, Fahrettin Koca, shared on Saturday brought the total number of virus-related deaths recorded by the Turkish government to 2,706. Turkey ranks seventh in the world for confirmed infections, surpassing China and Iran, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally. The government reported a total of 107,773 cases as of Saturday. But experts believe many more people have gotten sick or died during the pandemic than the ones included in the Johns Hopkins University project due to limited testing for the virus, the difficulty of counting the dead during the crisis and other factors. An unexpected consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic is that sewing factories in the Gaza Strip are back to working at full capacity for the first time in years. The AP his this report on how garment manufacturers in the enclave are producing masks, gloves and protective gowns, some of which are bound for Israel: It\u2019s a rare economic lifeline in the coastal territory, which has been blockaded by Israel and Egypt since the Hamas militant group seized power from rival Palestinian forces in the strip in 2007. The blockade, and three wars between Hamas and Israel, have devastated the local economy, with unemployment hovering around 50%. But the sudden opportunity also shows how Gaza\u2019s economy is at the mercy of those enforcing the blockade and how depressed wages have become. Workers earn as little as $8 a day. So far, Gaza appears to have been largely spared from the coronavirus pandemic, with only 17 cases detected, all within quarantine facilities set up for those returning from abroad. Many still fear an outbreak in the impoverished territory, which is home to two million people and where the health care system has been battered by years of conflict. But for now, authorities are cautiously allowing most businesses to stay open. Rizq al-Madhoun, owner of the Bahaa garment company, said he has produced more than one million masks in the past three weeks, \u201call for the Israeli market.\u201d Gaza may not have the advanced machinery seen in other places, but he said residents\u2019 sewing skills are unmatched. He added: Gaza workers are distinguished in handiwork and they are better than workers in China or Turkey. Another factory, Unipal 2000, is able to employ 800 workers across two shifts to produce protective equipment around the clock. Both factories import fabric and other materials from customers in Israel and then produce items like masks, gloves and surgical gowns. Unipal makes about 150,000 pieces a day, and demand is high as countries around the world grapple with shortages. Asked about doing business with Israeli customers, both factory owners said they did not want to discuss politics and framed their work in terms of business and humanitarian needs. Bashir Bawab, the owner of Unipal 2000, said: Despite the siege in Gaza, we export these masks and protective clothes to the whole world without exception. We feel we are doing a humanitarian duty. Gisha, an Israeli group that advocates for easing the blockade on Gaza, appealed to Israeli leaders to do more to promote economic activity in the territory. \u201cThe pandemic has created demand for these products,\u201d it said. It added: But Israel must lift restrictions on trade entirely so that Gaza residents can work and so that Gaza\u2019s faltering economy can brace itself as much as possible against the wider global crisis caused by the pandemic. Dozens of anti-lockdown protesters arrested in Berlin, AFP reports. German police arrested dozens of protesters in Berlin on Saturday for flouting the coronavirus lockdown measures they were demonstrating against. About 1,000 people turned out for the rally, which has become a weekly event in the German capital. Saturday\u2019s protest attracted mainly far-left activists but there were also right-wing supporters and members of other fringe groups. Police put up barriers around Rosa Luxemburg square, where the protesters were headed, leaving the participants to gather in nearby roads. The protest \u201cis not in line with the rules\u201d in place to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 virus, police said on Twitter, telling those taking part to disperse. Some of the demonstrators wore T-shirts accusing Chancellor Angela Merkel of \u201cbanning life\u201d while others simply called for \u201cfreedom\u201d. Others brandished placards bearing slogans such as \u201cStop the pharmaceutical lobby\u201d. The protest was unauthorised as a result of emergency rules in Berlin banning gatherings of more than 20 people. The protest organisers\u2019 website called for \u201can end to the state of emergency\u201d and played down the threat posed by the virus. Public discontent with the confinement rules has been growing gradually in Germany, as in other countries, though Merkel\u2019s popularity remains high. She has received plaudits for her management of the health crisis which has seen Germany\u2019s Covid-19 toll \u2013 5,500 according to an AFP tally \u2013 remain significantly lower than in Italy, Spain, France and Britain where the death tolls have all risen above 20,000. Opposition to the lockdown measures is being led by the far-right, the main opposition force in the German parliament. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party accuses the government of exaggerating the risk posed by the virus and has called for the immediate reopening of all businesses. Boris Johnson will return to Downing Street on Monday and is \u201craring to go\u201d, Sky News reports. The PM was discharged from hospital on Easter Sunday, after spending three nights in intensive care. He may host on Monday\u2019s daily Downing Street news conference and take on new Labour leader Keir Starmer at PMQs on Wednesday, depending the advice of doctors. \u201cHe is \u2018raring to go\u2019 and will be back Monday,\u201d a Downing Street source told Sky News. Johnson now faces a dilemma over whether to ease lockdown measures. Leading scientists have warned the number of new cases of Covid-19 being diagnosed is still much too high, as highlighted in this report: Algeria has taken further steps to ease restrictions over coronavirus by allowing several businesses to reopen \u201cto reduce the economic and social impact of the health crisis\u201d caused by the pandemic, the prime minister\u2019s office said on Saturday. It said shops to be reopened include those for materials for building and public works, appliances, fabrics, jewellery, clothing and shoes, cosmetics and perfumes, home and office furniture, pastries and hairdressers in addition to urban transport by taxi. The government on Thursday decided to ease confinement measures by shortening the curfew for some provinces but called on citizens to be \u201cvigilant\u201d. That measure came hours before the start of the holy fasting month of Ramadan on Friday. Algeria has said restrictions linked to coronavirus has significantly hit the economy which is under financial pressure due to a sharp fall in global oil prices. The government has reported a total of 3,256 confirmed infections with the virus, with 419 deaths and 1,479 recoveries. As unconfirmed rumours of Kim Jong-un\u2019s death circulate on social media, one news agency has suggested that he may be sheltering from Covid-19 in a North Korean resort town. On Friday, South Korean news agency Newsis said that a special train for Kim\u2019s use had been spotted by intelligence sources in the town of Wonsan. It suggested he may be sheltering from the novel coronavirus. Washington-based North Korea monitoring project, 38 North, also captured satellite images of special train possibly belonging to the Northern Korean leader in Wonsan. A report the project published on Saturday said that the train was parked at the \u201cleadership station\u201d in Wonsan on April 21 and April 23. The station is reserved for the use of the Kim family, it said. Though the group said it was probably Kim Jong Un\u2019s train, Reuters has not been able to confirm that independently, or whether he was in Wonsan. \u201cThe train\u2019s presence does not prove the whereabouts of the North Korean leader or indicate anything about his health but it does lend weight to reports that Kim is staying at an elite area on the country\u2019s eastern coast,\u201d the report said. It comes after a series of conflicting and unconfirmed reports on the leader\u2019s health and whereabouts. Speculation about Kim\u2019s health first arose due to his absence from the anniversary of the birthday of North Korea\u2019s founding father and Kim\u2019s grandfather, Kim Il Sung, on April 15. China has dispatched a team to North Korea including medical experts to advise on Kim Jong-un, according to three people familiar with the situation. Venezuelan food and beverage producer Empresas Polar, the largest private company in the socialist country, on Saturday called a new government move to supervise the company\u2019s food unit\u2019s sales amid rising prices nationwide \u201carbitrary.\u201d Vice President Delcy Rodriguez announced the measure on Friday as part of a slew of steps to try to control prices and slow inflation during the coronavirus pandemic, which together with an acute fuel shortage complicating the transport of goods is prompting a rise in consumer prices. Inflation was 124% in the first three months of 2020, according to the central bank. \u201cThere is no reason or justification for this arbitrary measure,\u201d Empresas Polar\u2019s chairman, Lorenzo Mendoza, said in a statement calling on the government to walk back the move targeting Alimentos Polar, the company\u2019s food unit, which manufactures many Venezuelan staples including corn flour dough. Venezuela\u2019s information ministry, which fields media requests on the government\u2019s behalf, did not respond to a request for comment. The move toward price controls marks a shift away from a gradual liberalization of economic policy in the OPEC nation. In the face of U.S. sanctions imposed early last year, President Nicolas Maduro relaxed enforcement of decades-old price controls and eased restrictions on the use of foreign currency. That has not been enough to turn around a six-year economic recession marked by hyperinflation, shortages of basic goods and a collapse in public services such as electricity and water. Gasoline shortages have grown worse in recent months, prompting sporadic lootings in eastern Venezuela last week. The government also said it would supervise the sales of Plumrose, a meat producer, and a 180-day intervention at cooking oils producer Coposa. It also announced fixed prices on 27 basic products. \u201cThis action is completely contrary to what the population expects at this moment,\u201d Mendoza said in the statement. \u201cIt is a threat to the public and private supply chains the company serves. Far from calming the country down, it generates anxiety and panic.\u201d In the UK, the selection of Trevor Phillips to investigate why Covid-19 is killing more Black, Asian and minority ethnic people has sparked a row after leading Muslims criticised his appointment as \u201cinsensitive\u201d. Phillips, the former chairman of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, was asked by Public Health England to provide expert support to an inquiry into why increasing numbers of victims of the coronavirus pandemic are from BAME backgrounds. Philips has been suspended from the Labour party over allegations of Islamophobia. The Muslim Council of Britain\u2019s general secretary, Harun Khan, has said that Phillips has a \u201cconsistent record in pushing the divisive narrative of Muslims being apart from the rest of British society\u201d. Prof Kevin Fenton, PHE\u2019s regional director, London, said Phillips and Prof Richard Webber have been selected as \u201ctheir specialist consultancy has the right skills and experience\u201d. Here is the full report: In Israel, several thousand protestors took to the streets of Tel Aviv to denounce a unity government deal reached last week that leaves prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu in power as he prepares to go on trial for corruption charges. The protest filled central Tel Aviv\u2019s Rabin Square, although demonstrators stayed two metres apart from each other in line with health regulations in place for weeks meant to halt the spread of the coronavirus. Here is a selection of photos from the protests: The UK\u2019s biggest steel producer needs about \u00a3500m in government support to see it through the coronavirus crisis, according to Welsh MP Stephen Kinnock. Tata Steel has approached the UK and Welsh governments for a bailout after its big European customers halted production, Sky News reported on Saturday. The company employs 8,385 people across the UK, including more than 4,000 workers at the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales. Here is the full report: Prime minister \u00c9douard Philippe will present France\u2019s parliament with a plan to unwind the nation\u2019s lockdown on Tuesday, according to Reuters. The nation has been subject to confinement measures since March 17. Mobile phone data shows Britons beginning to ignore lockdown Health officials fear Britons are starting to get complacent about the Covid-19 lockdown after traffic and mobile phone data revealed more of us are on the roads and looking for directions, PA reports. Mobility data released by Apple shows that, despite a dramatic drop in requests for directions, in recent days searches for maps for walking or driving have increased by eight percentage points. The news came as professor Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, said on Saturday \u201cthere was a little bit of concern\u201d after the unseasonably warm weather drew big crowds to public spaces. At the Downing Street briefing, Prof Powis said traffic levels are down 59% compared to February, but grew by three percentage points in the last seven days compared to the previous week. Prof Powis said: It won\u2019t take much for this virus to start increasing its transmission again and to spread more widely. He added: It would be foolish and not right if we lost the benefits that we have gained over the last four weeks, which I know have been hard for everybody. So it\u2019s really important that despite the weather, we stay at home, we keep to the guidelines that we\u2019ve been issued with. Elsewhere, B&amp;Q\u2019s decision to reopen 130 stores saw massive queues forming outside its outlets in Bristol and in Swansea, as the public use the shutdown to catch up on DIY. The Metropolitan Police Federation (MPF), a body representing Met officers, said despite its assertions to the contrary, the government was sending out mixed messages around the shutdown. MPF chairman Ken Marsh questioned the wisdom of allowing DIY stores to reopen. Mr Marsh said: Police officers are on the front line of combating the coronavirus crisis We need clear and unambiguous laws, guidance and communication from the Government around what the public can and can\u2019t do. What is essential and what isn\u2019t. If officers are confused about all this then so will the public be. UK government \u2018reviewing\u2019 NHS surcharge for migrant medics The UK government is \u201creviewing\u201d the surcharge that some migrant doctors and nurses working in the NHS must pay to access the health service, the home secretary Priti Patel has said. The government was criticised in December for planning to increase the immigration health surcharge for migrants from outside the European Economic Area, including nurses and doctors, from \u00a3400 to \u00a3625 a year each. The fees were introduced in 2015. In the daily press conference at Downing Street on Saturday, Patel was asked if this is the right to abolish it for NHS workers. She said: You\u2019ll be aware of many changes we have already made around the immigration status and the visa status for NHS workers for extending their visas already if they were coming up for expiry. We have a range of measures that are, like most things in government, under review, and we are looking at everything including visa surcharge \u2026 We are looking at everything we can do to continue to support everyone on the frontline in the NHS. My colleague Mattha Busby has the full report: Spain could lift more lockdown restrictions and allow adults out to exercise from 2 May if efforts to contain the spread of the virus continue to pay off, the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has said. The strict lockdown enacted after the declaration of a state of emergency on 14 March has been extended until 9 May, but children under the age of 14 will be allowed out for an hour\u2019s exercise each day from tomorrow. Addressing the nation on Saturday night, S\u00e1nchez said: \u201cIf things keep going in a positive direction with the pandemic, from 2 May people will be allowed out to exercise individually or to go out for a walk with the person they live with.\u201d However, the prime minister stressed that the loosening of the lockdown would depend on continuing progress to halt the virus. S\u00e1nchez also warned once again that any \u201cde-escalation\u201d would be gradual. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get back to all kinds of activity and social movement right away,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it in stages.\u201d Experts have warned that anti-Muslim hatred India could undermine the country\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic. The AP has this report: India\u2019s government is blaming an Islamic missionary meeting for a surge in coronavirus cases, triggering a wave of violence, business boycotts and hate speech toward Muslims that experts warn could worsen the pandemic in the world\u2019s second-most populous country. The stigma faced by India\u2019s Muslims, poorer and with less access to health care than other groups, is making health workers\u2019 battle against the virus even tougher, according to veterans of other epidemics. India has about 24,500 confirmed coronavirus cases about one in five of which have been linked to the missionary meeting and 775 deaths, and the outbreak may not peak until June. Dr. Anant Bhan, a bioethics and global health expert, said: Not only is the (Muslim) community at a higher risk of being infected, but they will also be at a high risk of spreading the virus. It becomes a cycle that will continue. About 8,000 people in the Tablighi Jamaat congregation met for three days in March at the group\u2019s compound in the crowded Nizamuddin area of New Delhi, shortly before the Indian government banned large gatherings. The compound stayed open, later giving shelter to people stranded in a 21-day lockdown imposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24, according to the group\u2019s spokesman, Mujeeb ur Rehman. On the second day of the lockdown, a government raid on the compound discovered the largest virus cluster in India. Police filed a case against some of the group\u2019s leaders for violating the ban, a charge the group denies. Officials said Tuesday they have arrested 29 people, including 16 foreigners, who participated in the missionary meeting. India\u2019s communal fault lines, still stressed by deadly riots over a new naturalisation law that excludes Muslims, were split wide open by the allegations against Jamaat. Politicians in Modi\u2019s ruling Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party were quoted on TV and in newspapers describing the Jamaat incident as \u201ccorona terrorism.\u201d False news targeting Muslims began to circulate, including video clips purportedly showing congregation members spitting on authorities. The clips were quickly proven to be fake, yet by April 1, the hashtag \u201cCoronaJihad\u201d was trending on Twitter in India. Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary of India\u2019s health ministry, repeatedly called out the congregation by name in daily news briefings. On April 5, he said the number of virus cases was doubling in just 4.1 days, and would have been a slower 7.4 days \u201cif the additional ... cases due to the Tablighi Jamaat meeting would not have arisen.\u201d That same day, Dilshad Mohammad took his life. Panic, blame and stigma were spreading across India when the 37-year-old chicken peddler was shunned by his neighbours in Bangarh, a village in the hilly state of Himachal Pradesh, for giving two members of the Jamaat congregation a ride to their village on his scooter. Neighbours accused him of deliberately trying to infect them with the virus, which causes the Covid-19 disease. Karthikeyan Gokulachandran, the district police superintendent, blamed his suicide on stigma. Doctors who studied previous epidemics warn that stigma and blame for a contagious disease weaken trust in marginalised communities, threatening decades-long efforts against illnesses such as polio and tuberculosis by making people less likely to seek treatment. Stigma in general is adding to India\u2019s coronavirus death toll, said Dr. Randeep Guleria, head of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi and among the architects of the country\u2019s response. He said: It is actually causing increasing morbidity and mortality. Because of the stigma that is happening, many patients who have COVID-19 or who have flu-like symptoms are not coming forward. Muslims were already at a disadvantage when the coronavirus entered India. India\u2019s 200 million Muslims account for 14% of the population and are the largest minority group in the Hindu-majority nation and also the poorest, surviving on an average of 32.6 rupees ($0.43) per day, a 2013 government survey found. Muslims also have less access to health care. About 40% of villages with large Muslims populations don\u2019t have medical facilities, a government report in 2006 said. The \u201cvilification of Muslims was done to hide the government\u2019s mismanagement in dealing with the virus and their callousness,\u201d said Professor Tanweer Fazal, a sociologist at the University of Hyderabad. Paraguayan authorities have laid out details of a plan to begin lifting the country\u2019s total quarantine. Health minister Julio Mazzonleni announced at press conference on Friday that a new \u201cintelligent quarantine\u201d will begin on 4 May. It will gradually reintroduce public freedoms and economic activities through a four-stage plan set to run until early July. On Saturday, Paraguay had 223 coronavirus cases and nine deaths \u2013 according to figures from researchers at Johns Hopkins University \u2013 among the lowest rates in South America. The government has built two emergency hospitals and recently received a large cargo flight of medical supplies. The total number of people to die worldwide after contracting the novel coronavirus has surpassed 200,000, figures show. The Coronavirus Resource Centre, run by researchers at Johns Hopkins University, shows that the global death toll stands at 200,698 as of Saturday. The figures for infections are likely to underestimate the true scale of the pandemic due to suspected under-reporting and differing testing regimes. Death toll figures are also controversial, with some countries reporting deaths as confirmed Covid-19 cases on the basis of symptoms and in the absence of a positive test, while others are not including them. If you\u2019re only just joining us \u2013 here is a recap of the biggest global developments in the coronavirus pandemic as of 6pm on Saturday. This is Aaron Walawalkar, in London, keeping you updated for the next eight hours or so with the latest in coronavirus world news developments. If you have any tips, comments or suggestions for coverage, please send me a direct message on Twitter (@AaronWala). Due to the overwhelming interest, I may not be able to respond to all messages but I will certainly read them. Once we have a vaccine, how will it be shared fairly around the world? While we may not yet be at the point of having a tried-and-tested vaccine against the novel coronavirus, experts say that governments must start looking now for an ethical and equitable distribution process. With vaccines seen as one of the few real routes out of the coronavirus crisis, fears of \u201cvaccine nationalism\u201d are already increasing. Each step of creating, testing and mass-producing a vaccine is an epic challenge \u2013 but the political and ethical decisions around its subsequent distribution pose another. How will any eventual vaccine be shared out? Who decides? Will supplies go to the highest bidder? My colleague Michael Savage has this report: The death toll in France from the coronavirus has risen by 369 to stand at 22,614, the health ministry said on Saturday. Nigerian state governors have asked President Muhammadu Buhari to approve the compulsory use of face masks in public as confirmed coronavirus cases rise, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Saturday. The 36 state governors argued the approval was necessary to have a uniform and coordinated policy at federal and state levels to tackle the virus, the letter from the Nigeria Governors\u2019 Forum (NGF) said. Nigeria reported 114 new cases of the coronavirus on Friday, bringing its total to 1,095 with 32 deaths. A total of 28 states have so far reported cases, with more than half of those in the commercial hub Lagos. Nigeria, with 200 million people, is Africa\u2019s most populous country. Some 20 million reside in Lagos. Among measures to be announced by Buhari the governors want the government to incorporate a lockdown on flights and on interstate movement, restrictions on large gatherings, overnight curfews and compulsory face mask use in public. The measures would exclude movement of food, beverages, medical and pharmaceuticals, petroleum supplies and agricultural products, said the governors who on Thursday agreed to ban interstate movement for two weeks. Lagos and Ogun states, as well as the capital Abuja, are already under federally imposed lockdowns, while various states have instigated their own containment measures. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said on Saturday that he would allow independent pharmacists to collect samples to test for the novel coronavirus and would expand screening for antibodies, starting with first responders and other essential workers. Cuomo also told a daily briefing that hospitalisations across his state for Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, had fallen to same level as 21 days ago. There now around 1,100 hospitalisations per day \u2013 down from 1,300 seen previously, he said. Italy\u2019s coronavirus death toll rose by 415 on Saturday, five deaths fewer than on Friday and the lowest day-to-to increase since 17 March. The total number of people who have died after contracting the virus now stands at 26,384, while the number who have recovered has risen to 63,120. The number of people currently infected with the virus fell for the sixth day in a row, by 680 to 105,847, while the number of intensive care beds in use has fallen by almost half since 31 March. Italy has recorded 195,351 coronavirus cases to date, including the victims and survivors. The total number of coronavirus deaths in Canada has risen to 2,350, according to public health agency data. Figures released on Saturday show an increase of 153 deaths in the 24 hours since April 23. The total number of cases has risen to 44,364 from 42,750. South Africa\u2019s government and specialists appointed to try to save the state-owned airline have agreed to extend a deadline for trade unions to agree staff severance terms, Reuters reports. South African Airways (SAA) entered a form of bankruptcy protection in December and its fortunes deteriorated further when the coronavirus pandemic forced it to suspend all commercial flights. The airline offered severance packages to its roughly 5,000-strong workforce after the government said it would not provide more funds for rescue efforts. The proposal was put to trade union leaders, with the business rescue team advising that a deal should be reached by Saturday. However, that deadline has been extended until 1 May. The department of public enterprises minister, Pravin Gordhan, issued a letter to the unions at the airline on Saturday. It said: We advise that the department agreed with Business Rescue Practitioners on moratorium on the signing of the retrenchment (layoffs) agreements until Friday 1 May 2020. It added: As a result, the employees are not obliged to sign the collective agreement for the retrenchments for the period of the moratorium. Public enterprises ministry spokesman Sam Mkokeli confirmed the contents of the letter and said the department would issue a statement later. SAA has not been profitable since 2011 and has received more than 20bn rand ($1.05bn) in bailouts in the past three years, a drain on public resources at a time of weak economic growth. Far-right groups in the UK, US and EU are exploiting the coronavirus crisis to push their anti-minority agendas and win new support. A report by the Zinc Network, a communications agency that tracks disinformation and propaganda, suggests there has been a clear pivot among far-right movements to \u201cutilise the pandemic to bring new relevancy, attention and support for their key grievances\u201d. A favoured tactic among these extremist groups is to put fake documents into circulation, designed to look like real medical or government communications. My colleague Jamie Doward has the full report: Chelsea have said they will not impose a pay cut on their first-team squad in response to the coronavirus outbreak. But the Premier League side added they had asked players to continue donating to charities during the ongoing pandemic. It has been reported the west London club have been in talks with their players about a salary reduction of about 10% in a bid to reduce costs at a time when football has been suspended because of the virus. That figure, however, is significantly lower than the Premier League\u2019s suggestion of 30% for all clubs. But that has not stopped the Stamford Bridge side from taking their own course of action as they highlighted the \u001dPlayersTogether initiative launched by Premier League players earlier this month, which aims to raise and distribute funds for charities supporting the NHS. The said club representatives of the Chelsea board had held \u201cextensive talks with the men\u2019s first team to discuss how they can contribute financially to the club during the coronavirus crisis\u201d. The statement said: The objective of these talks has been to find a meaningful partnership around ensuring we preserve jobs for staff, compensate fans and participate in activities for good causes. We are grateful to the team for having played their role in assisting the club with community activities as well as all the charitable causes they have been supporting in their respective home countries and through the Players Together initiative supporting the NHS. It added: At this time, the men\u2019s first team will not be contributing towards the club financially and instead the board have directed the team to focus their efforts on further supporting other charitable causes. As this crisis develops the club will continue to have conversations with the men\u2019s first team regarding financial contributions to the club\u2019s activities. Meanwhile, the Blues said they would not be taking advantage of the British government\u2019s coronavirus job retention or furlough scheme, with casual workers and matchday staff being compensated by the club through to 30 June. In the UK, home secretary, Priti Patel, is delivering the daily Downing Street briefing on the coronavirus crisis. She is joined by Lynne Owens, director general of the National Crime Agency, and NHS England director, Stephen Powis. She said there has been an overall drop in crime rates during lockdown, with car crime, burglary and shoplifting down on this time last year. However, she added that sophisticated criminals are trying to exploit the crisis, citing how police have seized \u00a31m worth of cocaine smuggled into the UK in boxes of face masks.

Due to the overwhelming interest, I may not be able to respond to all messages but I will certainly read them. People on South Africa will have to wear face masks from 1 May when coronavirus lockdown restrictions will begin to be eased, the government said on Saturday. \u201cIt is going to be mandatory to use a cloth mask as you step out of your home,\u201d Traditional Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma told a press conference in Pretoria, AFP reports. \u201cYou will need to have your nose and mouth covered in public,\u201d Dlamini-Zuma said, adding that people could use a scarf or T-shirt if they do not have a mask. South Africa has been on lockdown since 27 March. On Thursday, Cyril Ramaphosa, the president, said restrictions would gradually begin to be eased from the beginning of next month. The industry and commerce minister, Ebrahim Patel, said on Saturday that among the changes, agriculture will be allowed to resume completely; restaurants can open but only for home delivery while mines can restart some activities. But Dlamini-Zuma said restrictions would remain in place for those not working in essential industries. \u201cIf you are not an essential worker or do not work in the prioritised sectors continue to stay at home, except when you are buying essential goods or services or for emergency medical services,\u201d she said. The vast illegal wildlife trade and humanity\u2019s excessive intrusion into nature is to blame for the coronavirus pandemic, according to a leading US scientist who says \u201cthis is not nature\u2019s revenge, we did it to ourselves\u201d, Phoebe Weston, the Guardian\u2019s biodiversity writer, reports. Scientists are discovering two to four new viruses are created every year as a result of human infringement on the natural world, and any one of those could turn into a pandemic, according to Thomas Lovejoy, who coined the term \u201cbiological diversity\u201d in 1980 and is often referred to as the godfather of biodiversity. Lovejoy, a senior fellow at the United Nations Foundation and professor of environment science at George Mason University, said: This pandemic is the consequence of our persistent and excessive intrusion in nature and the vast illegal wildlife trade, and in particular, the wildlife markets, the wet markets, of south Asia and bush meat markets of Africa \u2026 It\u2019s pretty obvious, it was just a matter of time before something like this was going to happen. In the UK, a further 813 people have died in hospital after testing positive for Covid-19, taking the country\u2019s total to 20,319. It comes almost six weeks after the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, said on 17 March that keeping the toll under 20,000 would be \u201ca good outcome in terms of where we would hope to get\u201d. Follow our UK blog for more updates: As lockdowns drag on and the economic consequences are felt, particularly among the poorest, organised crime groups are stepping in to fill a gap vacated by officials, according to Roberto Saviano, the Italian journalist famous for his work on the Mafia, in an article for the Observer. He writes: The art of profit is based on exploiting need, and no one has perfected that dark art better than organised crime. The Covid-19 pandemic is already demonstrating this. With their usual business acumen, criminal organisations have, in recent decades, invested in a number of companies that have turned out to be very relevant to the present crisis: multi-service businesses (catering, cleaning or disinfection), industrial laundries, transport, funeral homes, waste collection, food distribution \u2013 and the health. All of these sectors have become fundamental to our survival over recent weeks, and will probably remain so for a good while. Today is World Malaria Day. As we approach 200,000 deaths so far this year from Covid-19, it\u2019s worth remembering that the World Health Organization has warned that deaths from malaria could double to 700,000 this year as a result of the disruption caused by the new disease. Dozens of doctors and nurses in Pakistan have launched a hunger strike over a lack of protective masks and other equipment for treating patients with Covid-19. More than 150 doctors in Pakistan have tested positive for coronavirus, according to the Young Doctors Association in Punjab, the country\u2019s worst-hit province. Several doctors and nurses have already died from Covid-19, including a 26-year-old physician who had recently started his career. An official told AFP that a specialist at a state-run hospital died from the disease on Saturday. Salman Haseeb, head of the Punjab\u2019s Grand Health Alliance, said about 30 doctors and nurses in Punjab were on hunger strike. The protesters have kept working in their hospitals while taking turns to demonstrate outside the health authority offices in provincial capital Lahore, where they have been joined by up to 200 colleagues. \u201cWe do not intend on stopping until the government listens to our demands. They have been consistently refusing to adhere to our demands,\u201d Haseeb told AFP. \u201cWe are on the frontline of this virus and if we are not protected then the whole population is at risk.\u201d The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the Netherlands rose by 655 to 37,190, health authorities said on Saturday, with 120 new deaths, Reuters reports. The country\u2019s death toll stands at 4,409, the Netherlands Institute for Public Health (RIVM) said in its daily update. The actual numbers are probably higher, as not all suspected cases are tested, the RIVM said. Health officials in Iran have raised fears of a \u201cfresh outbreak\u201d of coronavirus cases in their country, already the worst-affected in the region. As the predominantly Shia country marked the start of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, a day later than much of the Muslim world, Alireza Zali, the anti-coronavirus coordinator for the capital, Tehran, criticised \u201chasty reopenings\u201d. Since 11 April, Iran has allowed the reopening of a number of businesses that were closed as part of measures to curb Covid-19. Zali was quoted by the official news agency, Irna, as saying reopenings could \u201ccreate new waves of sickness in Tehran and complicate efforts to bring the epidemic under control\u201d, Reuters reports. Iran reported 76 new deaths from coronavirus on Saturday, raising its total death to 6,650. Announcing the latest figures on Saturday, health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said social distancing and hygiene measures to guard against the coronavirus needed to remain in place. The ministry\u2019s infectious diseases department head, Mohammad Mehdi Gouya, warned of signs of a fresh outbreak in provinces such as Gilan and Mazandaran in the north and Qom in central Iran, \u201cwhere we made great efforts to control the epidemic\u201d. The number of new coronavirus cases in Russia has risen by 5,966 over the past 24 hours, bringing its nationwide tally to 74,588, the country\u2019s coronavirus crisis response centre said on Saturday, according to Reuters. It also reported 66 new deaths from Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, bringing the total death toll to 681. The number of coronavirus cases in Russia began rising sharply this month, although it had reported far fewer infections than many western European countries in the early stages of the outbreak. The Singapore ministry of health has announced it has detected a further 618 cases of coronavirus infection, \u201cthe vast majority of whom are work permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories\u201d. Singapore reacted quickly and aggressively to the virus as soon as it was identified earlier this year. It seemed that the city state had controlled its spread but from Monday it registered more than 1,000 new confirmed cases for four days in a row, mainly among migrant workers. More details on the latest infections will be published later, the ministry said. For more on how the virus has spread through Singapore\u2019s army of migrant workers, who perform many of the basic functions that keep the city running, see this report by Rebecca Ratcliffe, the Guardian\u2019s south-east Asia correspondent. Kenya has detected seven more cases of coronavirus, bringing the total in the country to 343, the country\u2019s president, Uhuru Kenyatta, said as he extended lockdown measures for a further three weeks. Confirmed coronavirus cases on the Italian Costa Atlantica cruise ship are nearing 150, AFP reports. Almost a quarter of the 623 crew members on the ship, docked in western Japan, have tested positive for the coronavirus, an official said on Saturday. The Costa Atlantica has no passengers onboard and arrived in the southern port of Nagasaki for repairs in January. Its operator first notified local authorities of suspected virus infections last weekend. All crew members have now been tested, with another 57 testing positive on Saturday, raising the number of cases to 148, a local official told reporters. Further details, such as their nationalities or age, were not immediately available, the official said. Japan has already dealt with one virus outbreak on a cruise ship \u2013 the Diamond Princess, which docked in Yokohama in February after a former passenger tested positive for the disease. Authorities ordered an on-ship quarantine but more than 700 people were infected with the virus and 13 died. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the Netherlands rose by 655 to 37,190, health authorities said on Saturday, with 120 new deaths, Reuters reports. The country\u2019s death toll stands at 4,409, the National Institute for Public Health (RIVM) said in its daily update. The actual numbers are probably higher, as not all suspected cases are tested, the RIVM said. A reader has written in to alert me to these striking images of Sergio Mattarella, the Italian president, celebrating Liberation Day alone, wearing a protective mask, in front of the Altare della Patria monument in Rome. Liberation Day is a national holiday commemorating the end of the Nazi occupation during the second world war and the victory of Italy\u2019s resistance. Serbia has sent four planes carrying medical equipment including gloves, masks and protective suits to Italy on Saturday, as a donation. Another four equipment-laden planes will be sent in the next two days, also donated by the Serbian government, the president Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107said, according to Reuters. \u201cWe will win together, be brave Italy, Serbia is with you,\u201d Vu\u010di\u0107 wrote on one of the boxes of equipment before it was loaded on to a plane. \u201cOn its path to Europe, Serbia always had help from Italy,\u201d Vu\u010di\u0107 said, noting that during devastating floods in 2014, Italy was one of the first countries to send aid. \u201cThis is our opportunity to say thank you,\u201d he said. Last year, Italy was Serbia\u2019s second-largest trade partner after Germany, data from January showed. Italian companies including Fiat employ more than 20,000 people in Serbia. Serbia has so far reported 7,483 cases of people infected with the coronavirus and 144 deaths. India reopened neighbourhood stores on Saturday, which many of the country\u2019s 1.3 billion people rely on. The country\u2019s extremely strict lockdown was imposed on 24 March, and with only a few hours\u2019 warning, causing widespread anger in the population. But the relaxation of the restrictions came with significant caveats, the Associated Press reports. Hundreds of quarantined towns and other infection hotspots are exempt from the eased measures. The outbreak has killed at least 780 people in India and created huge pressure on the millions of people living in slum conditions too crowded for social distancing. Shopping malls also remained closed across the country. Last week, India allowed manufacturing and farming activities to resume in rural areas to ease the economic plight of millions of daily wage-earners left without work by the lockdown, under which people can only leave their homes to buy food, medicine or other essentials. Spain\u2019s coronavirus death toll rose to 22,902 on Saturday, up from 22,524 the day before, media outlets including El Pa\u00eds and El Mundo reported. The number of daily fatalities was 378, a slight increase on Friday\u2019s 367, which was the lowest figure recorded in the past month. The overall number of coronavirus cases rose to 223,759 from 219,764 the day before. Spain\u2019s health ministry could not immediately confirm the figures, Reuters reports. Hello, I\u2019m taking over briefly while my colleague Damien Gayle takes a well-deserved break. Please feel free to get in touch via email or Twitter if you have any interesting updates to flag. Hong Kong\u2019s top epidemiologist has warned against easing lockdowns in Europe, saying \u201cyou need a sledgehammer\u201d to bring down the rate of infections before reopening society. Gabriel Leung, the dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong, told Der Spiegel that lockdowns of the kind that have frozen societies and economies will be \u201ca marathon, not a sprint\u201d, and the world needs to learn to live with the coronavirus. \u201cContainment has failed everywhere,\u201d Leung said. \u201cWhat we need is suppression, or better: cycles of suppression and lift, probably many of them,\u201d he said, adding that measures needed to be tuned to the \u201csurge capacity\u201d of national health systems. Taking the example of the flu, which kills tens of thousands every year in Europe, Leung said: Nobody likes it, but it is tolerated. Nobody asks for zero flu deaths. But if you exceed the capacity of your ICUs, then you would be breaching a very red line. So, somewhere between what people tolerate by implication every year and having completely overwhelmed ICUs like in New York City, somewhere between these extremes lie your tolerance levels ... If you have a sustained [coronavirus] outbreak like in most of Europe, you need the sledgehammer to bring down the Rt to below 1. Rt is the virus\u2019s actual transmission rate at a given moment. But you need to go much below 1 to bring the baseline level to a low enough level that you can accept. Read more of the interview in Der Spiegel. Germany will focus its six-month presidency of the European Union from 1 July on the fight against the coronavirus and its social and economic impact, as well as environmental issues, the chancellor, Angela Merkel, said on Saturday, according to Reuters. \u201cIt will be clearly dominated by the issue of combating the pandemic and its consequences,\u201d Merkel said of the presidency in her weekly video podcast. She added that as long as there was no vaccine, the virus would dominate life in Europe. Merkel said Germany would promote the idea of an efficient European healthcare system for all member states, as well as a financial transaction tax, minimum tax rates and a joint carbon emissions trading system for ships and planes. The German cabinet will hold a special session on Wednesday to discuss the agenda for the German presidency of the EU, along with Jeppe Tranholm-Mikkelsen, the secretary-general of the European council. In this video, people protest against the Brazilian president after the resignation of popular minister S\u00e9rgio Moro. There were calls for Bolsonaro\u2019s impeachment and an investigation into claims he had improperly interfered in the country\u2019s federal police. Bolsonaro denied claims from his outgoing justice minister that he had sought to appoint a new federal police chief in order to gain access to secret intelligence reports. Iran\u2019s coronavirus death toll has risen by 76, to a total of 5,650, health ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said on state TV on Saturday. The total number of people diagnosed with the disease is 89,328, of whom 3,096 are in a critical condition, he added. The World Health Organization said on Saturday there was currently \u201cno evidence\u201d that people who have recovered from coronavirus are protected from a second infection \u2013 even if they now have antibodies against it. In a statement, the UN health agency warned against issuing \u201cimmunity passports\u201d or \u201crisk-free certificates\u201d to people who have been infected, saying the practice may actually increase the risk of spread as they may ignore standard advice. It also warned that the accuracy and reliability of tests for antibodies to coronavirus were not certain. \u201cInaccurate immunodiagnostic tests may falsely categorise people in two ways,\u201d the WHO\u2019s latest scientific brief said. \u201cThe first is that they may falsely label people who have been infected as negative, and the second is that people who have not been infected are falsely labelled as positive. Both errors have serious consequences and will affect control efforts.\u201d Chile said last week it would begin handing out \u201chealth passports\u201d to people deemed to have recovered from the illness, Reuters reports. Once screened to determine if they have developed antibodies to make them immune to the virus, they could immediately rejoin the workforce. But, the WHO said: \u201cAt this point in the pandemic, there is not enough evidence about the effectiveness of antibody-mediated immunity to guarantee the accuracy of an \u2018immunity passport\u2019 or \u2018risk-free certificate\u2019. People who assume that they are immune to a second infection because they have received a positive test result may ignore public health advice. The use of such certificates may therefore increase the risks of continued transmission.\u201d Haberdashery shops in France have been authorised to reopen before the official end of the lockdown to allow people to buy materials to make face masks, Kim Willsher, the Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent, reports. Only specialised shops whose primary business is \u201cselling fabrics, material, threads and other sewing articles\u201d are allowed to trade according to the new decree, which came into effect immediately on Friday. \u201cThe government is working with the textile industry in order to release a guide in the next few days on how to use the materials and the correct shapes to create home-made masks that will be completely effective,\u201d the junior economy minister Agn\u00e8s Pannier-Runacher, said in a statement. \u201cIt is important, given the approaching end of the lockdown, to give each French person who wishes to make a mask, the means to do so,\u201d the minister added. Non-essential shops and businesses, including haberdashers, known in France as \u2018merceries\u2019, have been closed since the strict lockdown began in France on 17 March. The French government is expected to release details of how the lockdown will be eased on 11 May, but is likely to make it obligatory for anyone using public transport to wear a mask. South Africa remains the African country with the most cases of coronavirus, while Algeria has recorded the most deaths, according to the daily tally of figures on the continent published by the World Health Organization\u2019s regional office. A predicted surge of cases in Africa has yet to occur, with strict lockdowns across the continent apparently successfully halting the spread of the virus. However, this week the WHO\u2019s regional director for the continent, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, issued a warning that the stresses on civil society and healthcare systems caused by the response to the outbreak could lead to a doubling of deaths from malaria to 700,000. Nato has urged warring sides in Afghanistan to declare an immediate ceasefire as the war-torn country reported a record number of cases for the third day straight, triggered by a surge in transmission in Kandahar, writes Akhtar Mohammad Makoii in Herat. In a statement, Nato called for both sides \u201cto demonstrate good will by accelerating the release of prisoners\u201d as a confidence building measure, and to embrace the international community\u2019s call \u201cfor an immediate humanitarian ceasefire\u201d. \u201cThe continued spread of the Covid-19 pandemic underscores the urgency of such measures. We call on the Taliban to do their part to prevent the spread of Covid-19 among the Afghan people,\u201d NATO said. The Nato call came hours after the Taliban rejected the president, Ashraf Ghani\u2019s, plea for a ceasefire. Ghani, speaking on the eve of Ramadan, asked the militant group to declare a ceasefire during the holy month as the nation is struggling with coronavirus. But the Taliban\u2019s spokesman, Suhail Shaheen, tweeted late Thursday a rejection of the request, citing ongoing disagreements over a potential peace process and delayed prisoner exchange as reasons to keep fighting. \u201cAsking for ceasefire is not rational and convincing,\u201d wrote Shaheen as he accused the government of putting prisoners\u2019 lives at risk during the outbreak. The Taliban have intensified their war against the Afghan government in recent days, killing about 100 security forces in the last week, according to local media. A government spokesman said 34 civilians were killed in Taliban attacks. Wahidullah Mayar, the health ministry spokesman, said on Saturday the country is in a \u201cvery sensitive\u201d time and and once again called on the Taliban to agree to a ceasefire. He said: \u201cNo one is secure against the the virus, we are all vulnerable. we need an immediate ceasefires, instead of fighting with ourselves, let\u2019s get united and fight with one enemy.\u201d Meanwhile, the country\u2019s health ministry has reported a record number of cases for the third day straight. In the past 24 hours, 133 new cases were confirmed, pushing the total number of infections to 1463. The death toll from Covid-19 reached 47, with four more confirmed today. Afghanistan reported 83 cases on Thursday and 95 on Friday. There have so far been 188 recoveries. The number of new infections continued to surge in Kandahar on Saturday as 20 new patients tested positive for Covid-19. Kandahar has so far recorded 203 cases. In Kabul, which is the country\u2019s worst-affected area, 16 new cases were confirmed, taking the total number to 446. Mayar said the country\u2019s struggle with a shortage of RNA extraction kits has been solved as the ministry received 10,000, with more arriving in coming days, and will increase number of tests. Bill Gates, the Microsoft tycoon, has said the global coronavirus pandemic is his \u201cworst nightmare\u201d, and he will fund the manufacture of several vaccines even prior to their being approved so they are ready to distribute as quickly as possible. In an interview with the Times, the billionaire \u2013 whose charitable foundation is reportedly the biggest funder of the World Health Organization \u2013 said he had been concerned about the impact of a viral pandemic for years. Gates told the Times the global health charity in his name will arrange funding to build factories to produce billions of doses of different potential vaccines, so it is ready to distribute around the world. In particular, he said, he was speaking to pharmaceutical companies about scaling up production of a vaccine under development at Oxford university, for which human trials have begun. They are going to put it in humans fairly soon . . . if their antibody results are one of the ones that are promising then we and others in a consortium will help make sure that massive manufacturing gets done. \u2026 Fortunately nobody doing the vaccines expects they\u2019re going to make money on them \u2026 They know this is a public good \u2014 partly because they will need indemnification as part of the regulatory approval, which will have to be expedited. Three months after you dose the humans you will see those responses and you will know at that point. Maybe there will be four or five that we will build factories for even though in the end we may only use one or two of them. That compresses the time. Germany\u2019s confirmed coronavirus cases increased by 2,055 to 152,438, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Saturday - a second day of deceleration after three days of acceleration in new infections, Reuters reports. On Friday confirmed coronavirus cases had increased by 2,337. The reported death toll rose by 179 to 5,500, the tally showed on Saturday. Greece is preparing to reverse lockdown measures with the country\u2019s prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis holding back-to-back teleconference calls today to discuss how best to revoke the restrictions, Helena Smith, the Guardian\u2019s Athens correspondent, reports. Return to normality is expected to begin Monday, 4 May, when small shops, hairdressers, barbers and beauticians will be to go back to work again. One senior government aide told the Guardian the opening of barbers and hairdressers was regarded as a much-needed \u201cpsychological boost\u201d after what would be almost two months of lockdown. \u201cPeople can\u2019t only be ordered around,\u201d he said. \u201cThey also need psychological support.\u201d The centre right administration took a \u201chard and early\u201d approach to enforcing restrictions, closing schools on 10 March amid fears of Greece\u2019s austerity-hit health system being quickly overwhelmed. Within days cafes, restaurants, malls, museums and shops followed. After a decade of riding the country\u2019s roller coaster debt crisis it was thought that a nation more usually associated with civil disobedience would rebel against adhering to the barrage of rules and regulations that containment of the pandemic has demanded. Instead they were adhered to in almost exemplary fashion. As a result Greece, to date, has had a sum total of 2,490 confirmed coronavirus cases and 130 fatalities. \u201cThe objective of the confinement measures is not to remain in a glass bowl, stuck in our homes,\u201d government spokesman Stelios Petsas said earlier this week. \u201cThe objective is to take back our lives and win back our way of life temporarily deprived of us by this cunning and invisible enemy.\u201d But recent outbreaks in a migrant facility and medical clinics in Athens have also proved there is no room for complacency. \u201cThe situation is good but can easily slip,\u201d the infections diseases professor and health ministry spokesman on the coronavirus, Sotiris Tsiodras, told reporters Thursday. With that in mind the loosening of restrictions will be gradual and, officials say, staggered over the course of several weeks possibly through to July. Schoolchildren are expected to begin returning to class on 11 May but younger pupils may not be back at school until the end of the month. Mitsotakis, who has deferred to scientific advice throughout the crisis, is expected to address the nation on Monday to explain how the easing of measures will unfold. Hundreds of people who live in Poland and work in Germany protested on Friday evening in the south-western Polish border town of Zgorzelec against a mandatory coronavirus quarantine for those who cross the border, Reuters reports. About 300 people gathered at the Polish side and some 100 at the German, some wearing face masks. The two groups were separated by a provisional metal fence that has been erected in the middle of the bridge to prevent people from crossing the border. Poland was one of the first European Union states to close borders due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus. It also imposed a mandatory two-week lockdown for those who enter its territory \u2013 a major jolt for those who live their lives in between two EU states. The protest was the latest in a swelling wave of dissent over lockdown measures to curb the spread of coronavirus. Protesters have already gathered in several US cities, and a protest in the Austrian capital, Vienna, was broken up by police on Friday. On Friday, protests were staged also in other Polish towns located on the German and Czech borders, according to Reuters. While the US president has apparently suggested that transfusions of disinfectant could be used to cure coronavirus, in the UK it has emerged that British armed forces are to be given insect repellant to protect them against Covid-19 infection. The Ministry of Defence confirmed on Friday that it plans to buy stocks of a product containing a lemon eucalyptus oil extract called citriodiol. But questions remain over its effectiveness, with British officials refusing to reveal any evidence it would work, writes Guardian reporter Kevin Rawlinson. After the news emerged, Public Health England confirmed the government\u2019s guidance does not include using any such substance to protect against Covid-19 infection. Similarly, the World Health Organization said there was no evidence the virus can be transmitted by mosquitoes and that an insect repellant would therefore be ineffective. The use of citriodiol to prevent infection does not form part of its advice. The World Health Organization has warned agains the introduction of \u201cimmunity passports\u201d or \u201crisk-free certificates\u201d that would exempt people who have developed immunity to Covid-19 from lockdown conditions. Some governments had suggested the introduction of such certifications, which would be given to individuals who are found to have antibodies to the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes the disease and enable them to travel or return to work. But in a scientific brief circulated on Saturday, the WHO said there was so far no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 are immune to a second infection \u2013 even if they are found to have antibodies. The UN health body said: At this point in the pandemic, there is not enough evidence about the effectiveness of antibody-mediated immunity to guarantee the accuracy of an \u2018immunity passport\u2019 or \u2018risk-free certificate\u2019. People who assume that they are immune to a second infection because they have received a positive test result may ignore public health advice. The use of such certificates may therefore increase the risks of continued transmission. The British health service has launched an awareness campaign to urge people to seek medical help if they need it, after visits to hospital emergency departments fell by almost half this month amid fears over the coronavirus outbreak. National Health Service (NHS) officials said they were worried that people were avoiding hospitals for fear of catching , thereby jeopardising survival and potentially becoming collateral damage to the virus, the PA news agency reports. PA reported that recent research found four in 10 people are too worried about being a burden on the NHS to seek help from their GP. Recent messaging from the government has ordered Britons to: \u201cStay home; save lives; protect the NHS.\u201d However, a predicted surge in admissions to hospitals as a result of Covid-19 has not materialised. Announcing the campaign, Sir Simon Stevens, the chief executive of the NHS, said: While NHS staff have pulled out all the stops to deal with coronavirus, they have also worked hard to ensure that patients who don\u2019t have Covid-19 can safely access essential services. Ignoring problems can have serious consequences - now or in the future. Prof Carrie MacEwen, chair of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, said: We are very concerned that patients may not be accessing the NHS for care because they either don\u2019t want to be a burden or because they are fearful about catching the virus. Everyone should know that the NHS is still open for business and it is vitally important that if people have serious conditions or concerns they seek help. Recent figures reported by the UK\u2019s Private Eye magazine showed that in a single week in April there were 6,000 more deaths than the average for the previous five years, but that half were not linked to the coronavirus. The British Heart Foundation has reported a 50% fall in the number of people attending A&amp;E with heart attacks, thereby risking their survival. And, earlier this week, Cancer Research UK warned 2,250 new cases of the disease could be going undetected each week \u2013 partly down to patients\u2019 reluctance to go and see their GP. This is Damien Gayle taking over the live blog in London now, keeping you updated for the next eight hours or so with the latest in coronavirus world news developments. If you have any tips, comments or suggestions for coverage, please send me an email to damien.gayle@theguardian.com, or a direct message on Twitter to @damiengayle. I\u2019ll hand over to my colleagues in London shortly. In the meantime catch up with the most recent developments with our \u2018Coronavirus: at a glance\u2019 here. Thailand reported 53 new coronavirus cases and the death of a 48-year-old Thai man who was infected with the virus along with four other family members. Of the new cases, three were linked to previous cases, one had no known links, and 42 are migrant workers who have been under quarantine at an immigration detention centre in the southern province of Songkhla. Seven other new cases were reported from the southern province of Yala, where authorities are aggressively testing the population because of high infection rates there, said Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman for the government\u2019s Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration. Since the outbreak escalated in January, Thailand has reported a total of 2,907 cases and 51 deaths, while 2,547 patients have recovered and gone home. Catch up on our global report here. Nearly 60 new cases found on cruise ship in Japan, as Thailand reports more infections, and report says China pressured EU to tone down assessment of disinformation campaign by Beijing. With the US coronavirus death toll topping 51,000 and nearly one in six workers out of a job, Georgia, Oklahoma and several other states took tentative steps at reopening businesses on Friday, despite disapproval from President Donald Trump and medical experts. Sri Lanka has reimposed a countrywide 24-hour curfew after a surge in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases, most of them navy sailors who were hunting those evading quarantine. The 46 new infections on Friday were the highest in a day, bringing the total to 420, including seven deaths. Sri Lanka partially lifted a monthlong curfew on Monday during daytime hours in more than two thirds of the country. The new curfew remains in effect until Monday. Police have arrested more than 30,000 violators. Among the newly infected were 30 navy sailors from a camp on the outskirts of the capital, Colombo. A total 60 sailors so far have been infected and the camp isolated. Boris Johnson is expected to return to work soon after his recovery from Covid-19, as pressure mounts on his government to explain how to get Britain out of lockdown. Johnson, 55, has been recuperating at the British prime ministerial retreat, Chequers, outside London since his release from hospital on 12 April. But there have been increasing signs his return to Downing Street could be imminent, after officials said he had spoken to Queen Elizabeth II and also US President Donald Trump. The Daily Telegraph, Johnson\u2019s former employer, suggested he could be back at his desk on Monday, and hold briefing meetings with individual cabinet ministers. But health secretary Matt Hancock was more cautious, despite the prime minister\u2019s progress. \u201cI spoke to him yesterday, he\u2019s cheerful, and he\u2019s ebullient and he\u2019s definitely on the mend in a big way,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cWhen exactly he comes back is a matter for him and his doctors.\u201d Australia\u2019s national sporting codes - like most in the world - have been shut down by the pandemic, but its national rugby league competition is determined to come back as soon as possible. There\u2019s been talk of staging a televised competition on an island, or another dedicated site cut off from the outside world. The organisation also went rogue and declared it would restart in May, despite government advice or a plan on how to do it. Today, the chairman of the Australian Rugby League Commission has floated the possibility of having rugby fans download an app and \u201cself-isolate\u201d for 14 days if they want to go to the State of Origin - one of the year\u2019s most significant and competitive series of games. Peter V\u2019landys made the comments to Triple M radio this morning, saying he was looking at ways to hold the event with a safer or smaller crowd. The ARLC has already announced that a three-game Origin series will be held at the end of the year, but the exact details are yet to be determined. Today V\u2019landys floated a number of possibilities, including holding the games in a way that \u201crewards health workers\u201d. \u201cWe may not have the crowds of a normal State of Origin, but a limited crowd with social distancing, and there\u2019s a few ideas we have in rewarding the emergency workers,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s another one where we put people on an app and if you\u2019re a really hardcore supporter and you can stay at home for 14 days and isolate yourself and we track you on the app, you can go to the game. \u201cThere\u2019s a few things we can do in that period of time.\u201d Why do female leaders seem to be more successful at managing the coronavirus crisis? Plenty of countries with male leaders have also done well. But few with female leaders have done badly, write my colleagues John Henley and Eleanor Ainge Roy. Jacinda Ardern, 39, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, has held Kiwis\u2019 hands through the lockdown, delivering empathetic \u201cstay home, save lives\u201d video messages from her couch and communicating daily through non-combative press conferences or intimate Facebook Live videos, her favourite medium. In Germany, Angela Merkel has been hailed for direct but uncharacteristically personal public interventions, warning that up to 70% of people would contract the virus \u2013 the country\u2019s \u201cgreatest challenge\u201d since 1945 \u2013 and lamenting every death as that of \u201ca father or grandfather, a mother or grandmother, a partner \u2026\u201d Taiwan\u2019s president Tsai Ing-wen responded equally fast, activating the country\u2019s central epidemic command centre in early January and introducing travel restrictions and quarantine measures. Mass public hygiene measures were rolled out, including disinfecting public areas and buildings. Read more: About 150 Australians and New Zealanders are scheduled to leave Buenos Aires on Saturday afternoon local time in what will be the final government-supported repatriation flight from Argentina. The Qantas flight is due to land in Melbourne at 7.30pm on Sunday. It was announced last weekend, after an earlier attempt to organise a commercial flight was delayed. Argentina has closed its borders, meaning the flight was only open to those already in the country. Another flight is due to leave Uruguay on Sunday. The US navy has recommended reinstating the fired captain of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, whose crew hailed him as their hero for risking his job to safeguard their lives from coronavirus, officials have said. The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the navy\u2019s leadership made the recommendation to reinstate Brett Crozier to the defence secretary, Mark Esper, on Friday, three weeks after Crozier was relieved of command after the leak of a letter he wrote calling on the navy for stronger measures to protect the crew. Crozier was fired by the navy\u2019s top civilian, then-acting navy secretary Thomas Modly, against the recommendations of uniformed leaders, who suggested he wait for an investigation into the letter\u2019s leak. Modly\u2019s decision backfired badly, as members of the crew hailed their captain as a hero in an emotional sendoff captured on video that went viral on social media. Around one quarter of the crew on board an Italian cruise ship docked in Japan have been diagnosed with Covid-19, after 57 new cases were reported on Saturday. All 623 crew members on board the Costa Atlantica have been tested, with almost 150 returning a positive reading, TV Asahi and NHK reported. One person is in hospital. The ship has been docked at Nagasaki since February for repairs and maintenance after the pandemic prevented scheduled repairs in China. Nagasaki authorities had quarantined the vessel on arrival, and ordered its crew not to venture beyond the quay except for hospital visits. But prefecture officials said earlier this week that some of the crew had departed without their knowledge, and sought detailed information on their movements. Ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s has downgraded its outlook for Greece on forecasts the economy will plunge into recession on the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, while maintaining the country\u2019s credit rating. S&amp;P forecast the Greek economy would contract by around 9% in 2020 on \u201cuncertainty about the duration of the pandemic and resulting economic crisis\u201d, revising its outlook from \u201cpositive\u201d to \u201cstable\u201d. After a nearly decade-long debt crisis and the loss of almost a quarter of GDP, the Mediterranean country had expected growth of at least 2.4% for 2020. The Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, recently warned of a \u201cdeep\u201d recession due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, before a recovery in 2021. Meanwhile Italy\u2019s economically punishing coronavirus lockdown, combined with big-spend stimulus packages to support families and firms, will push public debt and deficit to dizzying heights, the government said on Friday. The cabinet approved the spring budget document (DEF), which forecast that the eurozone\u2019s third-largest economy would plunge into a deep recession this year, with gross domestic product retracting by 8%. The government is widening the budget deficit by \u20ac55bn, the \u201cshock cure necessary to enable the country to face this difficult phase\u201d, Riccardo Fraccaro, cabinet undersecretary, was quoted as saying by Italian media. Poland\u2019s health minister, who is also a cardiologist, said Friday that delaying next month\u2019s presidential election untill 2022 would be \u201cthe only safe option\u201d given the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cOne option would be to put this whole issue on hold for two years and really deal with the epidemic. I think that\u2019s the best option and I recommend it,\u201d Minister Lukasz Szumowski told Poland\u2019s Polsat commercial television. Despite pressure from the opposition, medical workers, the majority of the public and even members and allies of the ruling conservative party, the government has refused to postpone the May 10 ballot. Reuters: China sought to block a European Union report alleging that Beijing was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak, according to four sources and diplomatic correspondence reviewed by Reuters. The report was eventually released, albeit just before the start of the weekend Europe time and with some criticism of the Chinese government rearranged or removed, a sign of the balancing act Brussels is trying to pull off as the coronavirus outbreak scrambles international relations. The Chinese Mission to the EU was not immediately available for comment and China\u2019s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to faxed questions about the exchange. An EU spokeswoman said \u201cwe never comment on content or alleged content of internal diplomatic contacts and communication with our partners from another countries.\u201d Another EU official Reuters said that the disinformation report had been published as usual and denied any of it had been watered down. Four diplomatic sources told Reuters that the report had initially been slated for release on April 21 but was delayed after Chinese officials picked up on a Politico news report hat previewed its findings. A senior Chinese official contacted European officials in Beijing the same day to tell them that, \u201cif the report is as described and it is released today it will be very bad for cooperation,\u201d according to EU diplomatic correspondence reviewed by Reuters. The correspondence quoted senior Chinese foreign ministry official Yang Xiaoguang as saying that publishing the report would make Beijing \u201cvery angry\u201d and accused European officials of trying to please \u201csomeone else\u201d - something the EU diplomats understood to be a reference to Washington. The four sources said the report had been delayed as a result, and a comparison of the internal version of the report obtained by Reuters and the final version published late Friday showed several differences. For example, on the first page of the internal report shared with EU governments on April 20, the EU\u2019s foreign policy arm said: \u201cChina has continued to run a global disinformation campaign to deflect blame for the outbreak of the pandemic and improve its international image. Both overt and covert tactics have been observed.\u201d In Australia, remote Indigenous communities have been closed to outsiders for weeks. The communities are at high risk from Covid-19 because of the much lower life expectancy, poorer health outcomes and higher rates of pre-existing conditions, and drastically reduced access to the level of healthcare available elsewhere in Australia. In Arnhem Land, in the country\u2019s north, this means that important cultural gatherings and a number of events planned for the approaching dry season have been cancelled, including the annual Garma festival. It\u2019s a blow to tourism, and a huge interruption to cultural life. But as Guardian Australia\u2019s Indigenous affairs editor, Lorena Allam, reports, some are finding a way around it. Artists in north-east Arnhem Land are giving free performances online instead, with live music and bunggul (dance) to keep people connected. Yirrmal Marika is the son of Witiyana Marika, manikay singer for Yothu Yindi and an accomplished singer-songwriter in his own right. \u201cWe sing stories about the country, what we feel and what we have been told by our elders, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re sharing,\u201d Marika says, on the phone from Nhulunbuy. \u201cElders are really scared because the virus would impact them and they have great knowledge to teach us, for the next generation who will stand strong in this part of the country,\u201d Yirrmal Marika said. \u201cAnd they see that Arnhem Land is the most beautiful country and they see we are lucky enough that we still have language here in this part of the country, so that\u2019s why we all have to be aware of it and really alert.\u201d There are moves to scale back Donald Trump\u2019s public presence on the US\u2019s coronavirus response, the AP reports. There have been discussions within the White House about changing the format of the briefings to curtail the president\u2019s role, according to four White House officials and Republicans close to the White House who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly. The briefings often stretch well beyond an hour and feature combative exchanges between Trump and reporters. Trump was angry after a day of punishing headlines Friday, largely about his comment at the previous evening\u2019s briefing wondering if it would be helpful to inject disinfectant into people to fight the coronavirus. That idea drew loud warnings from health experts who said the idea was dangerous and sharp criticism from Democrats. Trump did answer questions from reporters earlier Friday and claimed that his suggestion about disinfectant had been sarcastic.\u201d That doesn\u2019t square with a transcript of his remarks. For weeks, advisers have been urging the president to scale back his appearances at the briefings, saying that he should come before the cameras only when there is major news or a positive development to discuss, according to the officials. Otherwise, they suggested, he should leave it to Vice President Mike Pence and health officials to take the lead. Trump has been reluctant to cede the spotlight at the briefings, which are the closest thing he currently has to his beloved political rallies. South and Central America is experiencing a significant crisis with the virus. We earlier reported on Brazil and fears that its health system was on the verge of collapse. Here are some more updates from the region: In Brazil\u2019s Manaus, the biggest city in the Amazon, officials said a cemetery has been forced to dig mass graves because there have been so many deaths. Workers have been burying 100 corpses a day, triple the pre-virus average of burials. So far, the health ministry has confirmed nearly 53,000 Covid-19 cases and more than 3,600 deaths. Experts warned that paltry testing means the true number of infections is far greater. Honduras has reported nearly 600 confirmed coronavirus cases to date, as well around 50 deaths. An estimated 40% of the population already live in extreme poverty and the pandemic has also pushed many more into homelessness, Reuters reports. Since 25 March, the government has delivered to an estimated 3.2m people care packages of basic foodstuffs door-to-door, which include items like beans, rice, hand sanitiser, and face masks. But the newly homeless who Reuters spoke said that without their own place, they had received nothing. \u201cWe\u2019re all here because we don\u2019t have anywhere else to go,\u201d said Jose Cruz, a 27-year-old, who now camps out along with his mother. In Ecuador, which has been hit particularly hard in Guayaquil on the coast, the official reported figure more than doubled after the release of delayed test results on Thursday. Interior Minister Maria Paula Romo said it wasn\u2019t a \u201crebound\u201d of numbers, bu a reflection of an increased capacity to test. People have died without being tested and autopsies have been complicated by social distancing measures. To address those shortcomings, the government said Thursday it would begin conducting \u201cverbal autopsies,\u201d using consultations with family members about what symptoms a person had before dying to determine their cause of death. Inmates at an Argentine prison in Buenos Aires set fire to mattresses and protested on the roof of the jail, demanding some people be released due to fears of infection by the coronavirus, according to local media and a Reuters witness. Indigenous tribes in Peru\u2019s Amazon say the government has left them to fend for themselves against the coronavirus, risking \u201cethnocide by inaction,\u201d according to a letter from natives to the United Nations and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Water shortages are leaving poorer Mexicans high and dry in the coronavirus fight. Grappling with the largest public health crisis in modern times, Mexican health authorities battling to stem a jump in new coronavirus infections have made the phrases \u201cwash your hands\u201d and \u201cstay at home\u201d their mantras. The Costa Rican economy is seen contracting 3.6% this year due in large part to falling exports and consumer spending as the coronavirus pandemic causes widespread economic pain, the central bank announced on Friday. A doctor in the Colombian city of Cali said this week that he was forced from his apartment just eight days after he moved in because other residents of the building feared he would bring the new coronavirus into their homes. It is the latest example of hostility to medical workers in Latin America, who have faced discrimination and even attacks amidst concerns they could be spreading the virus. AP: New York reported its lowest number of daily Covid-19 deaths in weeks on Friday. The state said there were 422 deaths Thursday. That\u2019s the fewest since March 31, when it recorded 391 deaths. More than 16,000 people have died in the state from the outbreak. \u201cAgain, this is at an unimaginable level, and it\u2019s dropping somewhat. But it\u2019s still devastating news,\u201d governor Andrew Cuomo said at his daily briefing. The total number of people hospitalised statewide continues to drop slowly, hitting 14,258, though the number of new patients coming into hospitals is basically flat at around 1,300, Cuomo said. Though the overall trends provide some hope, the governor continued to stress that any gains could be lost quickly if social distancing restrictions are relaxed too quickly. Some new reported figures. Mainland China says it has 12 new cases, of which 11 were people who travelled into the country. One locally transmitted case was in Heilongjiang. The national health commission reported 29 new asymptomatic cases. More than 84,000 people have been reported to have had Covid-19 in China. Panama has reported 172 new cases, bringing the country\u2019s total number of people infected by Covid-19 to 5,338. 154 people have died. n Australia and New Zealand it is Anzac Day, the annual day of remembrance for armed forces. With both countries under lockdowns or strict social distancing rules, there was not the usual parades or public dawn services. Instead, people were encouraged to stand at the ends of their driveways for moments of silence. New Zealand\u2019s prime minister Jacinda Ardern was one of many thousands of Kiwis who spent at least a minute of their mornings in contemplation by their letterbox, while Australia\u2019s leader Scott Morrison attended a ceremony at the national War Memorial in Canberra. The AP has this report from Brazil, which is on the way to becoming a major virus outbreak centre: Cases of the new coronavirus are overwhelming hospitals, morgues and cemeteries across Brazil as Latin Americas largest nation veers closer to becoming one of the world\u2019s pandemic hot spots. Medical officials in Rio de Janeiro and at least four other major cities have warned that their hospital systems are on the verge of collapse, or already too overwhelmed to take any more patients. Health experts expect the number of infections in the country of 211 million people will be much higher than what has been reported because of insufficient, delayed testing. Meanwhile, President Jair Bolsonaro has shown no sign of wavering from his insistence that Covid-19 is a relatively minor disease and that broad social-distancing measures are not needed to stop it. He has said only Brazilians at high risk should be isolated. In Manaus, the biggest city in the Amazon, officials said a cemetery has been forced to dig mass graves because there have been so many deaths. Workers have been burying 100 corpses a day, triple the pre-virus average of burials. Hello, and welcome to our continuing global coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. This is Helen Davidson in Sydney to take you through the next few hours. Here\u2019s a quick look at the latest big developments: Global confirmed death toll passes 195,000 According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, at least 195,920 people are confirmed to have died worldwide, while at least 2.7 million are known to have been infected. The figures are likely to significantly underestimate the true scale of the pandemic due to suspected under-reporting and differing testing regimes. Political adviser attends independent scientific advisory meetings Questions are being raised about political interference as it emerges that the UK prime minister\u2019s chief political aide has been participating in meetings of the government\u2019s group of independent scientific advisers; membership of which Downing Street had insisted on keeping secret until the list was leaked to the Guardian. After the news emerged, No 10 acknowledged that, while Dominic Cummings and another adviser have been attending and participating in the committee\u2019s meetings, they are not members of the committee. US authorities warn doctors against prescribing hydroxychloroquine The US Food and Drug Administration warned doctors against prescribing the malaria drug Donald Trump has been touting, citing reports of sometimes fatal heart side effects among patients. The warning excluded hospital and research studies. Chinese delegation goes to North Korean leader\u2019s aid \u2013 report China has dispatched a team to North Korea that includes medical experts to advise on the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, according to a Reuters report. The news agency cites three people familiar with the situation. The trip by the Chinese doctors and officials comes amid conflicting reports about the health of the North Korean leader. There was no indication of what, if anything, it signalled in terms of Kim\u2019s health. Air France to get state backing The airline will receive a \u20ac7bn (\u00a36.1bn) loan package backed by the French government to avert a cash crisis brought on by the pandemic, the country\u2019s finance minister Bruno Le Maire announces. France will issue \u20ac3bn in direct loans and guarantees on another \u20ac4bn in bank lending to the carrier, part of airline group Air France-KLM, Le Maire said. US navy captain should be reinstated, say officials Senior officials recommend the reinstatement of the commander of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, who was fired after he pleaded for help with a coronavirus outbreak onboard. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, officials told the Reuters news agency the recommendation to reinstate Captain Brett Crozier was made during a meeting on Friday between the US defence secretary, Mark Esper, and navy leaders. UK records 684 more hospital deaths The Department for Health and Social Care reports 684 more deaths in UK hospitals, bringing the death toll to 19,506. Friday\u2019s update also showed an increase of 5,386 confirmed cases, bringing the UK total to at least 143,464. Recoveries outstrip infections in Spain Authorities in Spain, which has seen the second largest number of confirmed cases in the world, pointed out that more people are being diagnosed as cured than are falling sick for the first time since the beginning of the outbreak. On Friday, there were 2,796 new infections confirmed while 3,105 overcame the infection. \u201cWith all the effort that we have done, the evolution of the epidemic is obviously beginning to be where it should be,\u201d said Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the ministry\u2019s health emergency centre coordinator. Italy to ease lockdown, local media report Newspapers in Italy are reporting that the country\u2019s lockdown, the longest and toughest in Europe, is to be eased over the next four weeks. There has been no official confirmation, however.",

Almost two months into isolation, after weeks of one-off or serialised livestreamed performances popping up across social media, the first all-star event was broadcast on Channel 9 on Saturday night. Described as \u201can Anzac Day concert for the fight against Covid-19\u201d, Music from the Home Front had the ambitious goal of honouring returned service people and essential workers of the frontline of the current pandemic, while also putting on a lively show. The broadcast was presented as the brainchild of the chairman of the Mushroom Group, Michael Gudinski, and his mate Jimmy Barnes, whose son David Campbell shared hosting duties with singers Delta Goodrem and Guy Sebastian and radio host Christian O\u2019Connell. Behind them in their respective homes were a smattering of Aria statues, jauntily arranged Australian flags and, in O\u2019Connell\u2019s case, a lineup of Sherrins \u2013 which only served as a reminder to me of the games of AFL I\u2019d usually be watching this weekend, often squeezing between bodies at the pub or MCG. That, or sweating inside a venue, seeing a band. On my couch alone, live music is just not quite the same. The show opened with Ben Lee, who recruited artists Jack River and Lime Cordiale and dozens of his fans and friends to join his rendition of We\u2019re All in This Together, a song written almost 20 years ago which he says has \u201ctaken on a new meaning\u201d now.

Even new artists like Tones and I and DMA\u2019S \u2013 included on the strength of their respective success in recent years \u2013 were relegated to performing ballads from past eras. For Tones, who was filmed in her cavernous living room with a shelf of weighty awards on display from her Dance Monkey success, that meant a cover of Alphaville\u2019s Forever Young. Coming so soon after Crowded House\u2019s isolated edition of Don\u2019t Dream It\u2019s Over, DMA\u2019S\u2019 cover of Better Be Home Soon had a lot to live up to. It did more than stand up to the original: it proved to be a stand-out moment from the whole night. When Archie Roach solemnly acknowledged the sacrifices of First Nations diggers in wars \u2013 sacrifices, he said, that were \u201coften overlooked\u201d \u2013 it was over two hours into the broadcast. The closest Music From the Home Front got at an acknowledgement of country was a small sign placed into frame for Courtney Barnett\u2019s stripped-back performance of Depreston. The song, which on the surface is about house-hunting, is cast in a different light tonight, as the version of Barnett in the lyrics steps into a house of an elderly past owner, one whose life is imprinted on the walls and who displayed a treasured photograph of a soldier from the Vietnam war.

Isabella Manfredi of the Preatures danced through her performance of Never Tear Us Apart with INXS; Vance Joy\u2019s rendition of Lay It on Me made a star out of an enthusiastic percussionist performing on an upturned bin; and G Flip\u2019s time spent writing and recording her music in her bedroom gave her a leg-up when it came time to perform her breakout single About You in the same space. A video message from Kylie Minogue \u2013 who offered a \u201cvirtual hug\u201d \u2013 early in the broadcast has me desperately wishing she\u2019d dust off her Golden-era cowgirl hat and sing about going out dancing.

      "body": "<p>When Marama Davidson, ahead of an official trip to New Zealand\u2019s Hawkes Bay, found out that low-income families living in motels there would be evicted to make way for visiting dignitaries like her, she refused to be part of it.</p> <p>After Davidson \u2013 co-leader of the left-leaning Green party that is part of New Zealand\u2019s power-sharing government led by Jacinda Ardern\u2019s Labour \u2013 saw the headlines, she cancelled the booking and packed a tent in her suitcase instead.</p> <p>\u201cThey were kicking people out of motels that were being used for emergency housing,\u201d she says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, I hate that we\u2019ve got people living in motels, but I don\u2019t want to be the reason for them to live in the car for a week.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Davidson had an even better time at the campground during the trip to visit the M\u0101ori performing arts festival Te Matatini, she says. The young performers and their families were staying there too; she fixed her hair and makeup for official events in the communal bathroom block alongside them and \u201cwas stealing all their babies\u201d while groups rehearsed.</p> <p>\u201cCamping is my deal,\u201d Davidson, 46, says. So are the arts; her father is the actor Rawiri Paratene and her mother an activist; she was raised at the heart of a kind of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/28/google-disney-maori-new-zealand\">M\u0101ori cultural renaissance</a> \u2013 political, linguistic, creative \u2013 with some of New Zealand\u2019s most towering Indigenous writers, artists and agitators as her doting babysitters. Leadership was natural; parliamentary politics was not.</p> <p>When the Guardian visited her office in the capital, Wellington, in February \u2013 before parliament closed for the national lockdown intended to eliminate Covid-19 from New Zealand \u2013 Davidson was barefoot and dispensing hugs to anyone who arrived.</p> <p>There is tension between her idealism and her pragmatism in the story about sleeping in a tent while on official business. \u201cI understand that we need to solve the systemic issue and me camping for two nights does not solve the systemic issue,\u201d she says. \u201cI got all that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/22/flattening-curve-new-zealand-coronavirus\">Crunching the coronavirus curve is better than flattening it, as New Zealand is showing | Devi Sridhar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is also reflective of the Greens\u2019 uneasy relationship with power: the party of activists and environmentalists returned its best electoral results while in opposition against the previous centre-right government, and the current electoral term is the first time the party \u2013 with its eight parliamentarians \u2013 has been part of the ruling group.</p> <p>But the trade-off for the discomfort, Davidson says, are policies such as the one she was shortly to announce: a plan to reduce the housing agency\u2019s reliance on motel rooms for emergency accommodation for the homeless, and to build more short-term housing for those on New Zealand\u2019s longest-ever public housing waiting list, at a cost of $300m.</p> <p>\u201cEssentially, we are operating in a system which goes against our values,\u201d she says of the Green party.

      "bodyText": "When Marama Davidson, ahead of an official trip to New Zealand\u2019s Hawkes Bay, found out that low-income families living in motels there would be evicted to make way for visiting dignitaries like her, she refused to be part of it. After Davidson \u2013 co-leader of the left-leaning Green party that is part of New Zealand\u2019s power-sharing government led by Jacinda Ardern\u2019s Labour \u2013 saw the headlines, she cancelled the booking and packed a tent in her suitcase instead. \u201cThey were kicking people out of motels that were being used for emergency housing,\u201d she says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, I hate that we\u2019ve got people living in motels, but I don\u2019t want to be the reason for them to live in the car for a week.\u2019\u201d Davidson had an even better time at the campground during the trip to visit the M\u0101ori performing arts festival Te Matatini, she says. The young performers and their families were staying there too; she fixed her hair and makeup for official events in the communal bathroom block alongside them and \u201cwas stealing all their babies\u201d while groups rehearsed. \u201cCamping is my deal,\u201d Davidson, 46, says. So are the arts; her father is the actor Rawiri Paratene and her mother an activist; she was raised at the heart of a kind of M\u0101ori cultural renaissance \u2013 political, linguistic, creative \u2013 with some of New Zealand\u2019s most towering Indigenous writers, artists and agitators as her doting babysitters. Leadership was natural; parliamentary politics was not. When the Guardian visited her office in the capital, Wellington, in February \u2013 before parliament closed for the national lockdown intended to eliminate Covid-19 from New Zealand \u2013 Davidson was barefoot and dispensing hugs to anyone who arrived. There is tension between her idealism and her pragmatism in the story about sleeping in a tent while on official business. \u201cI understand that we need to solve the systemic issue and me camping for two nights does not solve the systemic issue,\u201d she says. \u201cI got all that.\u201d It is also reflective of the Greens\u2019 uneasy relationship with power: the party of activists and environmentalists returned its best electoral results while in opposition against the previous centre-right government, and the current electoral term is the first time the party \u2013 with its eight parliamentarians \u2013 has been part of the ruling group. But the trade-off for the discomfort, Davidson says, are policies such as the one she was shortly to announce: a plan to reduce the housing agency\u2019s reliance on motel rooms for emergency accommodation for the homeless, and to build more short-term housing for those on New Zealand\u2019s longest-ever public housing waiting list, at a cost of $300m. \u201cEssentially, we are operating in a system which goes against our values,\u201d she says of the Green party. Parliament is \u201ca little, insulated bubble of disconnection,\u201d inhabited by a \u201chostile\u201d politics. \u201cBut if I wasn\u2019t here, if we weren\u2019t here, people would be missing out on the difference that we are making,\u201d she adds. That will be the pitch for the Green party at September\u2019s election, Davidson says: telling stories about what its lawmakers did when they touched the levers of power. She mentions bolstered protections for victims of domestic abuse, safeguards for water and the environment, collective M\u0101ori approaches to Indigenous matters. Her party has to prove it\u2019s not just \u201csimilar to Labour\u201d in order to survive. That was in February; by April, New Zealand had been shut down in the government\u2019s efforts to combat the coronavirus and Davidson\u2019s parliamentary world had collided, hard, with her refuge at home where time \u201con the couch with my babies\u201d is prized. The household \u201cbubble\u201d in self-isolation at her South Auckland home numbers eight people: Davidson, her husband of more than 20 years, her eldest daughter and three youngest children, her son-in-law and her baby granddaughter. Two other adult children live nearby. Davidson is working \u201c14 to 16 hour\u201d days in politics, representing the Green party on a parliamentary committee set up to scrutinise the government\u2019s response to the virus. She seeks refuge from the chaos in the garage, or with her laptop balanced atop a stack of books on two bar stools in the bedroom. \u201cOn the one hand I\u2019ve been able to put my children to bed every night and that has been an absolute luxury for me,\u201d she says, adding that in order to spend time with her family in the evenings, she is often still working at 2am. Politics is emphatically not \u201cfor life\u201d for Davidson, but her husband and children agreed that the chance to lead a political party was worth the sacrifice. \u201cI think what helps us all get through as a family is going, \u2018Holy crap, what an opportunity this is for me, for them, for us,\u2019\u201d she says. Davidson has helmed the party jointly with Shaw since 2018, after the spectacular downfall of her friend, the former co-leader Metiria Turei \u2013 the woman who \u201cshowed me that it was possible to be in this space and still operate as authentically as I can,\u201d Davidson says. Turei resigned her post after a media furore when she volunteered that she had claimed larger benefits than she was entitled to as a young mother on social welfare. Her point about the difficulties of survival on welfare in New Zealand was drowned out by rancour over her wrongdoing, but Davidson says Turei\u2019s \u201cbravery\u201d had \u201cchanged the narrative\u201d about poverty in New Zealand.

      "bodyText": "A new report, cited by the chief medical officer as the federal government advocates the reopening of schools, says children are unlikely to transmit Covid-19 between each other or to adults. The study by NSW Health\u2019s Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCIRS), released on Sunday, examined transmission of the virus in NSW schools and childcare centres between March and mid-April. Examining the spread 18 of coronavirus cases (nine students and nine staff) from 15 schools, the report\u2019s preliminary findings were that only one primary school student and one high school student \u201cmay have contracted Covid-19 from the initial cases at their schools\u201d. \u201cNo teacher or staff member contracted Covid-19 from any of the initial school cases,\u201d the report added. The low transmission rate was despite 735 students and 128 staff being \u201cclose contacts\u201d of the initial 18 cases. The study, which will soon be peer reviewed, says the NSW government\u2019s announcement on 23 March to encourage parents to keep their children home from school \u201cmay have impacted the results of this investigation\u201d. \u201cThe findings from this detailed investigation are preliminary,\u201d the report said. \u201cHowever, they do suggest that spread of Covid-19 within NSW schools has been very limited.\u201d On Friday, the chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, cited the report when he confirmed Australian Health Protection Principal Committee guidelines that insist there is no need for social distancing in classrooms. In response to warnings from teachers unions against reopening schools, Scott Morrison told Sky News the risk for educators was \u201cin the staff room\u201d not the classroom. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee issued a document on Friday stating that in classrooms there is no need for the four-metre-rule which outlines how many people are allowed in an enclosed space, nor the 1.5-metre social distancing rule between people. But the Australian Education Union remained concerned by the prospect of schools reopening on Friday, saying the document \u201cprovide little clarity about how governments are going to ensure a safe working environment for teachers, principals and support staff\u201d. \u201cIt is still not clear how governments expect schools to manage social distancing for adults,\u201d the union\u2019s federal president, Correna Haythorpe, said. \u201cIt is contradictory to have one set of rules for adults outside of the school gate and another inside.\u201d The union has called for a phased implementation of a return to normal business for schools. In Victoria, which has taken the hardest line on the issue, schools remain shut in Victoria for all students except the children of essential workers. The state\u2019s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, said his advice had not changed on schools, despite the NSW study and calls from the Victorian Liberal opposition for schools to allow students and staff back to schools. School will resume in Tasmania on Tuesday and students have been encouraged to attend school in South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. In Queensland, the government is also facing calls from Queensland\u2019s independent schools to allow all Year 11 and 12 students to return to school immediately. Schools are open only for students of essential workers and vulnerable children, otherwise they remain closed until May 22 in Queensland. NSW has indicated schools will reopen for one day a week for all students from 11 May. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, said the new report showed \u201cschools are amongst the safest places to be \u2026 and that obviously is a very important message to all of us who are parents\u201d. The report, led by NCIRS director Prof Kristine Macartney, said it was \u201cnotable that half of the initial cases that occurred in schools were in staff\u201d, which was \u201cconsistent with the higher rate of Covid-19 seen in adults than in children\u201d. Macartney said the findings built on emerging data overseas showing children were not likely to spread the virus between themselves or to adults. \u201cA unique aspect of this work is that we were able to look specifically for spread in schools over many weeks and utilise additional testing methods,\u201d she said. The NSW government said that although school aged children represented around 16% of the NSW population, only 1.7% of Covid-19 cases had been recorded in this age group.",

Scott Morrison and his finance team, including Josh Frydenberg and Mathias Cormann, have laid out an \u201ceverything is on the table\u201d approach, outside of tax increases, with Morrison declaring \u201cfresh eyes\u201d will be needed to weather the incoming economic storms. That has placed the abandoned company tax cuts back on the agenda, with many in the Coalition hopeful the government will now have the support needed to enact a key policy it was forced to abandon after failing to win over the Senate crossbench. Speaking to the ABC on Sunday, Labor\u2019s Kristina Keneally maintained opposition to company tax cuts, reiterating there was no evidence a lower tax rate for big business would lead to economic growth. She said Labor\u2019s position was not based on ideology. \u201cIt\u2019s based on economics, on evidence and on the cost of the thing. If there was evidence that cutting the company tax rate in any country in the world has led to economic growth, you can be sure the government would have been trumpeting it from the rooftops last year when they were trying to get it through the Senate. \u201cWe know that a company tax rate is more likely to see the benefits go overseas in the form of share buybacks, increased dividends and executive salaries. There are better ways to support business, such as an investment allowance, and we encourage the government to look at that.\u201d A recent survey by The Australia Institute found a majority of Australians believe the company tax rate should remain where it is, or increase. The poll, which questioned 1,020 people across Australia on 23 April, and carries a margin of error of 3.1%, found 59% of respondents believed the company tax, which for big businesses sits at 30%, should remain the same. The institute\u2019s executive director, Ben Oquist, said the wider economic benefits of dropping the tax rate for large companies were scarce, with businesses traditionally preferring to put any savings into dividends, rather than increased workforces. \u201cAt a time when the economy will need aggregate demand support, company tax cuts for big business will deliver little more than windfall gains for already profitable enterprises,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, Australia\u2019s dividend imputation regime means Australia\u2019s effective company tax rate is already much lower than 30%.\u201d Last week, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Philip Lowe, estimated Australia\u2019s jobless rate would double to 10% by June, and could expect to hover above 6% for the foreseeable future. The International Monetary Fund also predicted a shrinking job market for Australia, as the \u201cGreat Lockdown\u201d ushered in one of the greatest threats to economies across the globe since the 1930s. The grim predictions have dimmed government declarations of an economic \u201csnap back\u201d in six months time, when many of the $230bn worth of measures it has put in place to keep the economy afloat, including wage subsidies and increased social security payments, are set to expire. Keneally said Labor would be pushing for the government to \u201ccome to the table, not with ideological positions but with an open mind\u201d. \u201cWith solutions that fit the unprecedented challenges that we are facing,\u201d she said, adding that the opposition would view any option put forward with the same open mind.

      "body": "<p>As a young person in Britain, I read Will Hutton\u2019s article with both despair and relief (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/19/young-britons-have-been-hit-hard-we-owe-them-a-future-they-can-believe-in\" title=\"\">Young Britons have been hit hard. We owe them a future they can believe in</a>\u201d, Comment). Relief that the palpable challenges facing those maturing in the post-2008 era are being acknowledged, but despair at the pace with which our prospects continue to wither. The exceptional circumstances we face will alter the already fragile futures of young people, but what these circumstances underline is that the exception has become the norm.</p> <p>I have experienced the meritocratic messages given out in formal education from both sides of the fence (as a pupil and a zero-hours contracted teacher in a working-class area of Sheffield). These messages, which often continue to be sticks with which to beat young people, eventually led me to leaving teaching as I felt morally unable to promote an idea of the good life to those for whom it was unattainable. For those without pre-existing professional connections, or the intangible characteristic of \u201cpolish\u201d, the future has been little more than zero-hours contracts, an unsustainable housing market and \u201clow-skilled\u201d employment opportunities for a decade and more. I welcome Hutton\u2019s call to build a society that inspires young people, but would remind him that the \u201cformer\u201d inequalities, both within and between generations, are very much alive.<br><strong>Jack Aizlewood</strong><br>Sheffield<br></p> <p>Will Hutton posits a poignant call to arms to save our disenfranchised youth as post-pandemic economic projections are bleak. His theory supports the importance of ethical \u201csustainable business models\u201d leading to a cultural and societal hiatus, so the next generation of young people are not used as \u201cdisposable commodities\u201d, which I fully support.</p> <p>He refers to \u201clow-skilled work\u201d but the very term is irksome, especially when the government has repeatedly equated low pay with low skill. Language can covertly reinforce the very inequality we are trying to undermine. Should we not change our view from \u201clow-skilled\u201d to \u201cessential\u201d \u2013 especially at a time when such work has become central to our survival?<br><strong>Jayne Sanders</strong><br>Sheffield<br> </p> <h2>Local authorities, local heroes<br></h2> <p>Andrew Rawnsley discusses the future of some of our institutions after Covid-19 ends (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/19/this-crisis-is-stress-testing-the-strengths-and-frailties-of-our-national-institutions\" title=\"\">This crisis is stress testing the strengths and frailties of our national institutions</a>\u201d, Comment). He mentions the army, the BBC and of course the NHS, all of which are playing a crucial role during the crisis. He omits to mention local authorities, however. These too have come in for some consistent bashing from the Conservatives and have suffered massive budget cuts during austerity. They have been cast, in similar fashion to the civil service, as hidebound and inefficient.</p> <p>Now, scarcely a No 10 briefing passes without the minister praising them and saying what more he is asking them to do. Suddenly, they are vital to getting through the pandemic. Whether it\u2019s help for rough sleepers or small businesses, they are the ones doing the work. Perhaps they too, when this is all over, will be \u201creminding the nation why they are essential to Britain\u201d.<br><strong>Peter Curbishley</strong><br>Great Durnford, Salisbury<br>Wilts<br></p> <h2>Me, Jay and a gastro wedding<br></h2> <p>I hate to rain on Jay Rayner\u2019s own wedding narrative (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/19/enduring-love-30-years-of-the-great-british-gastropub\" title=\"\">Blackboard menus, sanded floors, posh grub and a pint: it\u2019s a recipe that\u2019s served gastropubs very well</a>\u201d, Magazine), but\u2026.</p> <p>Late January 1991 I wandered into a new London pub, the Eagle. It was empty, beyond owners David Eyre and Mike Belben, who described their intention: serious food, definitely not a restaurant, art gallery upstairs. Evidence of their cooking intent was clear, with the kitchen on show. Nice lads, I thought; good luck.</p> <p>A few months later I was arranging my own wedding. We had virtually no money. I remembered the conversation with the lads at the bar. Thought I would do them a favour. I phoned and said I would give them \u00a3400 with which to cook whatever they wished for the wedding meal; they could choose the wine. Bless them. It saved me having to accept my future father-in-law\u2019s conditional offer that he\u2019d pay for the reception so long as it was held at the Connaught Rooms. The wedding was 28 September 1991.</p> <p>Many years later, Mike trained my son Ivan as a chef. I see the Eagle imitated around the world. Nowhere can replicate the fusion of informality and culinary quality. Remarkably, the kitchen is as good today as ever. Jay is bang on there.<br><strong>Stephen Chambers</strong><br>London N5<br></p> <h2>Cuban car love not all it seems<br></h2> <p>I always enjoy reading about the Cuban love affair with their old cars and how they pass on skills down the generations (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/take-me-to-your-lada-cubas-passion-for-a-little-russian-box\" title=\"\">Take me to your Lada: Cubans\u2019 passion for a little Russian box</a>\u201d, Focus). However, the cosy back-street mechanic pictures belie the desperate shortage of parts and new vehicles imposed on the Cubans by the American blockade. This is not nostalgia, but necessity. Taking the story of the Lada in Cuba out of context imposes another representative form of news blockade on the people of Cuba.<br><strong>Alan Hunter</strong><br>Somersham, Huntingdon<br>Cambs <br></p> <h2>It\u2019s not all about forgiveness<br></h2> <p>Nick Cohen says that it was unchristian of Christ to say that \u201cto everyone who has will more be given, but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away\u201d (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/18/beware-a-new-wave-of-populism-born-out-of-coronavirus-induced-economic-inequity\" title=\"\">Beware a new wave of populism, born of virus-induced inequity</a>\u201d, Comment). Were he to read the whole of Matthew\u2019s gospel, from which this quote is taken, he would see that love and forgiveness are only part of Jesus\u2019s teaching.

      "bodyText": "As a young person in Britain, I read Will Hutton\u2019s article with both despair and relief (\u201cYoung Britons have been hit hard. We owe them a future they can believe in\u201d, Comment). Relief that the palpable challenges facing those maturing in the post-2008 era are being acknowledged, but despair at the pace with which our prospects continue to wither. The exceptional circumstances we face will alter the already fragile futures of young people, but what these circumstances underline is that the exception has become the norm. I have experienced the meritocratic messages given out in formal education from both sides of the fence (as a pupil and a zero-hours contracted teacher in a working-class area of Sheffield). These messages, which often continue to be sticks with which to beat young people, eventually led me to leaving teaching as I felt morally unable to promote an idea of the good life to those for whom it was unattainable. For those without pre-existing professional connections, or the intangible characteristic of \u201cpolish\u201d, the future has been little more than zero-hours contracts, an unsustainable housing market and \u201clow-skilled\u201d employment opportunities for a decade and more. I welcome Hutton\u2019s call to build a society that inspires young people, but would remind him that the \u201cformer\u201d inequalities, both within and between generations, are very much alive. Jack Aizlewood Sheffield Will Hutton posits a poignant call to arms to save our disenfranchised youth as post-pandemic economic projections are bleak. His theory supports the importance of ethical \u201csustainable business models\u201d leading to a cultural and societal hiatus, so the next generation of young people are not used as \u201cdisposable commodities\u201d, which I fully support. He refers to \u201clow-skilled work\u201d but the very term is irksome, especially when the government has repeatedly equated low pay with low skill. Language can covertly reinforce the very inequality we are trying to undermine. Should we not change our view from \u201clow-skilled\u201d to \u201cessential\u201d \u2013 especially at a time when such work has become central to our survival? Jayne Sanders Sheffield Local authorities, local heroes Andrew Rawnsley discusses the future of some of our institutions after Covid-19 ends (\u201cThis crisis is stress testing the strengths and frailties of our national institutions\u201d, Comment). He mentions the army, the BBC and of course the NHS, all of which are playing a crucial role during the crisis. He omits to mention local authorities, however. These too have come in for some consistent bashing from the Conservatives and have suffered massive budget cuts during austerity. They have been cast, in similar fashion to the civil service, as hidebound and inefficient. Now, scarcely a No 10 briefing passes without the minister praising them and saying what more he is asking them to do. Suddenly, they are vital to getting through the pandemic. Whether it\u2019s help for rough sleepers or small businesses, they are the ones doing the work. Perhaps they too, when this is all over, will be \u201creminding the nation why they are essential to Britain\u201d. Peter Curbishley Great Durnford, Salisbury Wilts Me, Jay and a gastro wedding I hate to rain on Jay Rayner\u2019s own wedding narrative (\u201cBlackboard menus, sanded floors, posh grub and a pint: it\u2019s a recipe that\u2019s served gastropubs very well\u201d, Magazine), but\u2026. Late January 1991 I wandered into a new London pub, the Eagle. It was empty, beyond owners David Eyre and Mike Belben, who described their intention: serious food, definitely not a restaurant, art gallery upstairs. Evidence of their cooking intent was clear, with the kitchen on show. Nice lads, I thought; good luck. A few months later I was arranging my own wedding. We had virtually no money. I remembered the conversation with the lads at the bar. Thought I would do them a favour. I phoned and said I would give them \u00a3400 with which to cook whatever they wished for the wedding meal; they could choose the wine. Bless them. It saved me having to accept my future father-in-law\u2019s conditional offer that he\u2019d pay for the reception so long as it was held at the Connaught Rooms. The wedding was 28 September 1991. Many years later, Mike trained my son Ivan as a chef. I see the Eagle imitated around the world. Nowhere can replicate the fusion of informality and culinary quality. Remarkably, the kitchen is as good today as ever. Jay is bang on there. Stephen Chambers London N5 Cuban car love not all it seems I always enjoy reading about the Cuban love affair with their old cars and how they pass on skills down the generations (\u201cTake me to your Lada: Cubans\u2019 passion for a little Russian box\u201d, Focus). However, the cosy back-street mechanic pictures belie the desperate shortage of parts and new vehicles imposed on the Cubans by the American blockade. This is not nostalgia, but necessity. Taking the story of the Lada in Cuba out of context imposes another representative form of news blockade on the people of Cuba. Alan Hunter Somersham, Huntingdon Cambs It\u2019s not all about forgiveness Nick Cohen says that it was unchristian of Christ to say that \u201cto everyone who has will more be given, but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away\u201d (\u201cBeware a new wave of populism, born of virus-induced inequity\u201d, Comment). Were he to read the whole of Matthew\u2019s gospel, from which this quote is taken, he would see that love and forgiveness are only part of Jesus\u2019s teaching. Judgment is there also. Peter Smith Halifax Stormin\u2019 Norman I was very sad to hear that Norman Hunter, one of the great footballing heroes of the 1960s, had succumbed to the Covid-19 virus. Norman was a role model for my generation and Jonathan Bouquet\u2019s excellent article brought back many memories (\u201cMay I have a word\u201d, Comment). Some years after Hunter\u2019s heyday, when I was working in Luxembourg for one of the European institutions, we had a brilliant football match against colleagues from other institutions. Our team, made up of British and Irish colleagues, faced a mixed European team. We were the \u201cAnglo-Irish Disagreements\u201d.

The Navajo Nation already has lost more people to coronavirus than have 13 states. Four of the 10 largest-known sources of infection in the United States have been correctional facilities. These three groups aren\u2019t getting what they need to survive this crisis because they don\u2019t have lobbyists and political action committees to do their bidding in Washington or state capitals. The Remotes among us should be concerned, and not just because of the unfairness of the Covid-19 class divide. If the Essentials aren\u2019t sufficiently protected, the Unpaid are forced back to work earlier than is safe, and if the Forgotten remain forgotten, no one is secure. Covid-19 will continue to spread sickness and death for months, if not years to come.",

Citizens must also \u201cdress neatly\u201d in public and not go shirtless \u2013 an apparent reference to the so-called \u201cBeijing bikini\u201d, in which men roll T-shirts up to expose their stomachs in hot weather. Authorities reported no new deaths for the 10th straight day in China, where the virus originated. South Korea reported just 10 fresh cases, the eighth day in a row its daily increase was under 20. There were no new deaths for the second straight day. In the US, the states of Georgia, Oklahoma and Alaska started loosening restrictions on businesses despite warnings from experts that such steps might be premature. Donald Trump has said he will no longer give daily coronavirus briefings after he promoted the dangerous internal use of disinfectant as a possible treatment \u2013 the latest in a string of debunked, unproven or potentially lethal ideas he has mentioned at the press conferences. The UK\u2019s prime minister, Boris Johnson, is expected to return to work on Monday and will face the dilemma of how and when to ease restrictions on British life. Other developments around the world: The number of confirmed deaths in the coronavirus pandemic increased to 202,846 on Saturday, according to Johns Hopkins University. There are 2,896,746 confirmed cases. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is considering replacing its secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, because of early missteps in the handling of the coronavirus pandemic, the Wall Street Journal and Politico reported. A White House spokesperson denied the claim. State media in Saudi Arabia are reporting that the curfew will be partially lifted for all regions starting Sunday, but that a 24-hour curfew will be maintained in Mecca. Some economic and commercial activities, including retail stores, will reopen during Ramadan, from 29 April to 13 May. German police arrested dozens of protesters in Berlin on Saturday for flouting the coronavirus lockdown measures they were demonstrating against. About 1,000 people turned out for the rally, which has become a weekly event in the German capital. Saturday\u2019s protest attracted mainly far-left activists but there were also rightwing supporters and members of other fringe groups. Spain could lift more lockdown restrictions and allow adults out to exercise from 2 May if efforts to contain the spread of the virus continue to pay off, the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has said.",

I\u2019ve never seen it and apocalypse does feel very now so why not use all this time \u2013 so much time! \u2013 to get through all the films and books I promised myself if life allowed? Except life is very much allowing it and my brain is very much not.</p> <p>The zapping of our concentration and attention spans may seem anecdotal, but there is substantial neuroscience to explain it. Living through a pandemic plugged with sadness, fear and uncertainty is a mind soup designed to tip us <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/anxiety-on-rise-due-to-coronavirus-say-mental-health-charities\">off balance</a>. Rationally, I know this. Studies have shown time and again that the impact of stress on the brain robs it of its ability to process information, retain it and focus. Be it big-picture worries or everyday life adjustments, stress accumulates.</p> <p>My attention span is shot at the best of times. Getting frustrated because I can\u2019t find comfort in fiction is wildly wasted energy and yet it didn\u2019t stop me from spending a whole day taking all my books off the shelves and re-ordering them, hoping I\u2019d trick myself into reading again. (I edited them into \u201cthemes\u201d. Honestly, how did I resist?)</p> <p><a href=\"https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/kate-mclaughlin\">Katie Ann McLaughlin</a>, a clinical psychologist and Harvard professor, smiled when I told her about my unrelaxing methods to try to relax. The only way to regain focus, she said, is to actually relax: breathing exercises and mindfulness are mentioned as scientifically proved ways to buffer stress. Doing good for others also ranks high.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a limited capacity system; we don\u2019t have enormous bandwidth to cope with all the channels competing for attentional resources,\u201d she told me. \u201cStress saps you. An increase in stress can age your working memory by a decade.\u201d Terrifying, but not necessarily permanent.

I\u2019ve never seen it and apocalypse does feel very now so why not use all this time \u2013 so much time! \u2013 to get through all the films and books I promised myself if life allowed? Except life is very much allowing it and my brain is very much not. The zapping of our concentration and attention spans may seem anecdotal, but there is substantial neuroscience to explain it. Living through a pandemic plugged with sadness, fear and uncertainty is a mind soup designed to tip us off balance. Rationally, I know this. Studies have shown time and again that the impact of stress on the brain robs it of its ability to process information, retain it and focus. Be it big-picture worries or everyday life adjustments, stress accumulates. My attention span is shot at the best of times. Getting frustrated because I can\u2019t find comfort in fiction is wildly wasted energy and yet it didn\u2019t stop me from spending a whole day taking all my books off the shelves and re-ordering them, hoping I\u2019d trick myself into reading again. (I edited them into \u201cthemes\u201d. Honestly, how did I resist?) Katie Ann McLaughlin, a clinical psychologist and Harvard professor, smiled when I told her about my unrelaxing methods to try to relax. The only way to regain focus, she said, is to actually relax: breathing exercises and mindfulness are mentioned as scientifically proved ways to buffer stress. Doing good for others also ranks high. \u201cWe have a limited capacity system; we don\u2019t have enormous bandwidth to cope with all the channels competing for attentional resources,\u201d she told me. \u201cStress saps you. An increase in stress can age your working memory by a decade.\u201d Terrifying, but not necessarily permanent. McLaughlin described what plenty of us are going through as ego depletion \u2013 ego in the psychological, not everyday sense \u2013 where the resources needed for willpower and self-control to concentrate on anything but, say, all nine seasons of the US version of The Office, are severely limited.

      "body": "<p>Barbara Parry* arranged to switch her phone and broadband account from Sky to Now TV in March, a week before lockdown. Instead, she was left incommunicado as her line was cancelled and her phone number reallocated.</p> <p>During the following four weeks, as she pleaded in vain to be reconnected, her partner contracted Covid-19. He died four days later in hospital. Due to the blunders by Now TV, he was unable to call Parry from his deathbed and she was unable to say goodbye. The news was broken by a relative as the hospital could not get through on her cancelled number.</p> <p>\u201cNow TV\u2019s failed promises have left a 79-year-old woman, grieving for a lost loved one, completely on her own, with friends and family unable to contact her,\u201d says her son-in-law, Anthony. \u201cThe day after her partner died, the company reneged on a promise to retrieve her old number and said it was not possible. Instead of promised call backs, we\u2019ve had auto-generated emails asking why we cancelled the contract and I\u2019ve spent over seven fruitless hours on the phone explaining it was a life-and-death situation and trying to get her connected.\u201d</p> <p>Coronavirus has turned telecoms into a lifeline. Service delays that would once have been an inconvenience can now prove catastrophic. Figures from the Office of National Statistics show that 77% of people cited phone and internet contact as the most common coping strategy.</p> <p>However, service providers are struggling with some companies losing up to 40% of staff to sickness and self-isolation.</p> <p>Ofcom, which regulates the industry, has eased some of the obligations of telecoms firms to reflect the challenges. They are absolved from having to fix problems within the usual 30-day window for customers receiving less than their guaranteed broadband speed and automatic compensation, introduced last year for each day of delay to a repair or installation. Companies are expected to explain to customers why they will not receive a payout and to stop charging those without a service.</p> <p>\u201cBroadband and mobile firms are focusing their efforts on keeping their customers connected, particularly those who are vulnerable and depend on their services the most,\u201d Ofcom says. \u201cWe think this is absolutely the right approach. And we recognise this might affect the companies\u2019 ability to comply with some of our rules. We have written to the providers explaining that we will take account of the unique circumstances when enforcing our rules.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the current climate we are both classed as extremely vulnerable but in an emergency have no means of contacting anyone</p> <footer> <cite>Colin Noddings</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The problem is that customers with mental or physical impairments had to be registered as vulnerable with their service providers in order to be prioritised before the pandemic. Now anyone self-isolating due to age or a medical condition falls into that category, but may not be flagged up on their provider\u2019s database.</p> <p>Pensioners Colin and Anne Noddings* found that their landline had been disconnected after Vodafone installed a broadband service. They were told it would take 10 days to restore and Colin had to borrow mobile phones from neighbours to call for updates.</p> <p>Three days later, the couple was informed that their contract had been cancelled for reasons unknown and the phone number they\u2019d had for 30 years, withdrawn. It would take an estimated 15 days to reconnect them.</p> <p>\u201cMy 73-year-old wife is classed as disabled as her mobility is extremely limited and I have a heart condition, diabetes and have recently been diagnosed with asthma and COPD,\u201d says Colin. \u201cIn the current climate we are both classed as extremely vulnerable but in an emergency have no means of contacting anyone.\u201d</p> <p>Ofcom says it expects companies to provide self-isolating customers alternative means of communication if their issue can\u2019t be prioritised. However, Vodafone only acted when the <em>Observer </em>intervened. It reinstated the line and the original number 13 days after the couple were disconnected and has given them \u00a350 and two months free line rental.</p> <p>Charlotte Hughes* lost her internet connection in January after a cable to her flat was severed. Virgin Media claimed it was unable to reconnect her because of scaffolding on the council block where she lives.

      "bodyText": "Barbara Parry* arranged to switch her phone and broadband account from Sky to Now TV in March, a week before lockdown. Instead, she was left incommunicado as her line was cancelled and her phone number reallocated. During the following four weeks, as she pleaded in vain to be reconnected, her partner contracted Covid-19. He died four days later in hospital. Due to the blunders by Now TV, he was unable to call Parry from his deathbed and she was unable to say goodbye. The news was broken by a relative as the hospital could not get through on her cancelled number. \u201cNow TV\u2019s failed promises have left a 79-year-old woman, grieving for a lost loved one, completely on her own, with friends and family unable to contact her,\u201d says her son-in-law, Anthony. \u201cThe day after her partner died, the company reneged on a promise to retrieve her old number and said it was not possible. Instead of promised call backs, we\u2019ve had auto-generated emails asking why we cancelled the contract and I\u2019ve spent over seven fruitless hours on the phone explaining it was a life-and-death situation and trying to get her connected.\u201d Coronavirus has turned telecoms into a lifeline. Service delays that would once have been an inconvenience can now prove catastrophic. Figures from the Office of National Statistics show that 77% of people cited phone and internet contact as the most common coping strategy. However, service providers are struggling with some companies losing up to 40% of staff to sickness and self-isolation. Ofcom, which regulates the industry, has eased some of the obligations of telecoms firms to reflect the challenges. They are absolved from having to fix problems within the usual 30-day window for customers receiving less than their guaranteed broadband speed and automatic compensation, introduced last year for each day of delay to a repair or installation. Companies are expected to explain to customers why they will not receive a payout and to stop charging those without a service. \u201cBroadband and mobile firms are focusing their efforts on keeping their customers connected, particularly those who are vulnerable and depend on their services the most,\u201d Ofcom says. \u201cWe think this is absolutely the right approach. And we recognise this might affect the companies\u2019 ability to comply with some of our rules. We have written to the providers explaining that we will take account of the unique circumstances when enforcing our rules.\u201d The problem is that customers with mental or physical impairments had to be registered as vulnerable with their service providers in order to be prioritised before the pandemic. Now anyone self-isolating due to age or a medical condition falls into that category, but may not be flagged up on their provider\u2019s database. Pensioners Colin and Anne Noddings* found that their landline had been disconnected after Vodafone installed a broadband service. They were told it would take 10 days to restore and Colin had to borrow mobile phones from neighbours to call for updates. Three days later, the couple was informed that their contract had been cancelled for reasons unknown and the phone number they\u2019d had for 30 years, withdrawn. It would take an estimated 15 days to reconnect them. \u201cMy 73-year-old wife is classed as disabled as her mobility is extremely limited and I have a heart condition, diabetes and have recently been diagnosed with asthma and COPD,\u201d says Colin. \u201cIn the current climate we are both classed as extremely vulnerable but in an emergency have no means of contacting anyone.\u201d Ofcom says it expects companies to provide self-isolating customers alternative means of communication if their issue can\u2019t be prioritised. However, Vodafone only acted when the Observer intervened. It reinstated the line and the original number 13 days after the couple were disconnected and has given them \u00a350 and two months free line rental. Charlotte Hughes* lost her internet connection in January after a cable to her flat was severed. Virgin Media claimed it was unable to reconnect her because of scaffolding on the council block where she lives. The inconvenience for the first two months, when lack of wifi impeded her search for a job, turned to hardship when lockdown began a week after she underwent surgery for cancer. She was unable to order food online and had to risk trips to the supermarket, despite an NHS letter requiring her to shield, and she was unable to seek comfort from friends and family. \u201cSkype is the main way I connect, and I simply cannot say what it meant not to have a reliable enough connection to talk to people,\u201d she says. \u201cThis was especially difficult at a time of diagnosis and pre- and post-operative treatment for cancer. I was told that the cable had been severed by a Virgin Media technician connecting a neighbouring flat, but the company displays no sense of urgency or responsibility and clearly has no reliable mechanism for communicating between departments or flagging up unresolved problems.\u201d Virgin Media says that it believed the cable was severed by builders, and that health and safety risks prevented it reinstating the line while scaffolding was in place. After involvement from the Observer, however, it dispatched a \u201cspecialist crew\u201d and completed the repair. It has credited Hughes\u2019 account for the 11 weeks she was without service and given her an extra two months free. The online resolution service Resolver reports a doubling of complaints about telecoms service issues since lockdown. \u201cMost people are pragmatic enough to expect service disruptions and slow speeds, but they weren\u2019t expecting poor customer service,\u201d says spokesperson Martyn James. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been more reliant on broadband and mobile phone networks, but our data suggests some firms are falling short.\u201d Customers who are self-isolating or in financial straits are advised to contact their provider to receive priority status.

      "bodyText": "Schools are facing demands to step up their efforts to reach vulnerable pupils, following warnings that more children are being put at risk during the coronavirus lockdown. With the number of vulnerable children turning up to schools far below official expectations, council officials are sounding the alarm that the number of those needing help from schools and social services is growing. The lockdown makes tracking new and worsening cases extremely hard. There are concerns that schools\u2019 success in keeping an eye on their vulnerable pupils is patchy. The Department for Education\u2019s own figures suggest that just 5% of pupils identified as vulnerable were attending school in England. Ofsted, the education watchdog, is warning of a \u201cworrying blindspot\u201d resulting from schools and nurseries being unable to alert social services about potential neglect or abuse. Anne Longfield, the Children\u2019s Commissioner for England, who released a report on Saturday warning that hundreds of thousands of young people were off the radar as a result of the lockdown, said there was evidence that some schools could be doing more. \u201cWe now know that only a very small percentage of the vulnerable children who are supposed to be in school are attending,\u201d she said. \u201cMany of these children are living in homes with a cocktail of risks \u2013 ranging from domestic violence to poor parental health, alcohol addiction and neglect. Keeping them in school is essential. \u201cI know some schools have been very active in reaching out to parents of vulnerable children and are doing all they can. I\u2019ve heard teachers talking about their sleepless nights, worrying about what is going on behind closed doors in the homes of their most vulnerable kids. It\u2019s also clear from the low attendance figures that some schools are not doing enough.\u201d Yvette Stanley, Ofsted\u2019s national director for regulation and social care, said referrals to councils from schools and nurseries about potential abuse and neglect were much lower than usual. \u201cThis creates a worrying blind spot,\u201d she said. \u201cOther vulnerable children, like those with special educational needs and disabilities, may also have their services and support disrupted, putting families under additional pressure. \u201cWith our routine inspections suspended, we\u2019ve been working with councils to boost capacity where it\u2019s most needed.

She added: \u201cLocal authorities are reporting referrals to children\u2019s social care as being lower than usual, which is an obvious worry for us, but we are absolutely clear that where children and families need help and support we are here for them. \u201cSocial workers are prioritising face-to-face contact with children most at risk, many schools and early years settings are keeping in touch with those they actively support, and local safeguarding partnerships have been working and continue to work hard to raise awareness of hidden harm.\u201d Longfield\u2019s report warned that there was a \u201creal risk\u201d of criminal gangs recruiting young people.

      "bodyText": "A pensioner missed the chance to say goodbye to her partner who was dying from the coronavirus when blunders by her telecoms provider resulted in her phone line being cut off. The 79-year-old woman was left without a landline for three weeks after switching to Now TV, part of the Sky Group. As her family pleaded with the company to reconnect her, her partner contracted coronavirus. He died in hospital four days later, after trying in vain to make a final call. The news of his death was broken by a relative, because the hospital could not get through on her cancelled number. Telecoms companies are struggling with a depleted workforce and unprecedented demand as customers rely on phones and broadband during lockdown. New figures released by O2 show phone calls have increased by 25% in the past month. The woman, who has asked not be named, was told by a relative that her partner had died after he was unable to get through to her on the cancelled number. She has a mobile phone but found it difficult to use and relied on her landline. When Now TV was contacted by the Observer about the problem, the line was reconnected and the old number retrieved. Regulator Ofcom has relaxed its service obligations to allow the industry to focus on keeping vulnerable customers connected, but some self-isolating households are being left without communication due to service failures. One cancer sufferer was unable to book online food deliveries after a severed cable left her without broadband for 11 weeks, and an elderly couple contacted the Observer after a fortnight without a phone line. Ofcom says it expects companies to provide self-isolating customers with an alternative means of communication if their issue can\u2019t be prioritised. The dispute resolution scheme, Ombudsman Services, has promised to fast-track complaints from customers who are left unconnected. The pensioner whose dying partner could not reach her was left very distressed. Marina Storti, managing director of Now TV, said: \u201cWe know we\u2019ve let the customer and her family down. We\u2019ve spoken to the family and, while we know that no amount of money can make things right, we have met the customer\u2019s request for compensation and offered to match it with a donation to a charity of their choice.\u201d The grieving woman said that her misery was beyond words. \u201cI know my partner tried to call me at the end and couldn\u2019t get through,\u201d she said. \u201cNow he\u2019s gone.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>There have not been too many encouraging graph lines in recent weeks. One that does offer a breath of optimism, however, is the slight downward curve that implies one of the most toxic trends of our times \u2013 the anti-vaxx movement \u2013 might just be in retreat. The shift is incremental, but in a UK-wide survey in mid-March, 7% of people insisted they would refuse to have a coronavirus vaccine if one were available. By early April, with hospital wards and mortuaries filling up, that number had dropped to 5%. Perhaps vaccine conspiracy cannot bear too much pandemic reality.</p> <p>As with the strategies against the virus itself, however, the response to any likely \u201ccure\u201d seems likely to vary from country to country. A similar survey in France, also conducted by the London-based <a href=\"https://www.vaccineconfidence.org/\">Vaccine Confidence Project</a>, suggested 18% of people would refuse a vaccine, while in a poll in New York, the city worst affected by the pandemic, 29% insisted they would not consent, a number that may render any programme ineffective.</p> <p>The depth of misplaced fear about vaccination \u2013 which remains one of the unambiguous triumphs of global public health \u2013 has been further illustrated in widely shared remarks from lockdown. Novak Djokovic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/19/novak-djokovic-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccination-tennis\">last week volunteered</a> that he would have to think seriously about whether he could even carry on playing tennis if a vaccine were to become mandatory to travel. The rapper MIA went further in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/22/mia-claims-british-vogue-pulled-article-about-her-over-anti-vax-comments\">informing her 650,000 Twitter followers</a> melodramatically, that \u201cif I have to choose the vaccine or a [location-tracking] chip, I\u2019m gonna choose death\u201d.</p> <p>The most prominent American anti-vaxxer, Robert Kennedy Jr, meanwhile, amplified an unhinged conspiracy that believes Bill Gates is using the virus as part of a supposed plot to control the world\u2019s population through immunisation.</p> <p>All pandemics trail a ready market in superstition, quackery and prejudice \u2013 a sense of powerlessness generates in some the need for catch-all theories, however deranged. At the time of the great plague in London, the spread of miracle cures and scapegoating prophecy was almost harder to contain than the infection itself. As part of its strategy the government was moved, <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/376/376-h/376-h.htm\">Daniel Defoe reported</a> in his <em>A Journal of the Plague Year</em>, to \u201csuppress the printing of such Books and Pamphlets as terrify the People\u201d. The efforts to prevent the spread of damaging conspiracies across our own media have shared a similar profile \u2013 and often a similar success rate \u2013 to the efforts to curb the disease.</p> <p>In this respect, the pandemic is something of a test case for the social media monopolies of Silicon Valley to deliver on their widely trumpeted commitment to slow the spread of dangerously false information. After being confronted with the evidence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/10/facebook-fake-news-election-conspiracy-theories\">manipulation in the elections of 2016</a>, and the spread of such vile conspiracies as that which argued that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/31/alex-jones-pay-sandy-hook-conspiracy-theory\">Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax</a>, Facebook and Google and the rest have been forced to step up efforts to monitor and block extreme misinformation campaigns on their various platforms. Arguably, that effort is finally starting to show some effect.</p> <p>Counterintuitively, some evidence for that might be found in the response to the most pernicious of the current conspiracies which has, entirely without scientific foundation, sought to link the spread of coronavirus with the rollout of the 5G data network. The real-world effects have been the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/04/uk-phone-masts-attacked-amid-5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">acts of vandalism and arson</a> against mobile phone masts in the past weeks. Up to 50 such attacks have been reported, mostly on Merseyside and in the West Midlands, including the burning of the 5G mast adjacent to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/14/arsonists-attack-phone-mast-serving-nhs-nightingale-hospital\">new Nightingale hospital</a> outside Birmingham.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7f04146b7f7c20d9d8156d5698993736094abca3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f04146b7f7c20d9d8156d5698993736094abca3/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eamonn Holmes on This Morning\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This Morning received more than 400 complaints after presenter Eamonn Holmes gave credence to Covid-19 5G conspiracy theories.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV This Morning</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A report from the independent verification charity Full Fact <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/online/5g-and-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories-came/\">last week revealed</a> how this copycat campaign was only the most dramatic expression of a conspiracy theory with different strains, which include \u201cthat all the symptoms [of the virus] are actually caused by 5G\u2026 [and] that there is no disease at all, and the outbreak is a gigantic hoax to enable the government to install 5G under the cover of lockdown\u201d. It should go without saying that there is no possible connection between the 5G radio waves and the spread of a virus. Even so, the government was forced to address the fears, calling them \u201cdangerous nonsense\u201d.</p> <p> Thinking about contagious ideas now, I recall <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/mar/12/scienceandnature.features1\">interviewing Daniel Dennett</a>, the philosopher of evolution, back in 2006, just before the launch of Twitter. Dennett was talking excitedly of a word that he and Richard Dawkins had coined to describe how Darwinist idea-germs could be sent into battle against the politicised viruses of creationism. He called these idea-germs \u201cmemes\u201d. Nah, I thought at the time; it will never catch on.</p> <p>In the 14 years since, it has become second nature to trace the originators of particularly incendiary memes. <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">A story in </a><em><a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">Wired </a></em><a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">magazine</a> located the origin of the 5G conspiracy in an interview of 22 January in a Belgian newspaper with Kris Van Kerckhoven, a general practitioner from Putte, near Antwerp. He was quoted as saying that \u201c5G is life-threatening\u201d, but then added a speculative comment (\u201cI have not done a fact-check\u201d) that linked that falsehood to the virus then confined to China. The \u201clink\u201d became an ill-advised clickbait headline. (The piece, in <em>Het Laatste Nieuws</em>, was subsequently withdrawn.)</p> <p>If these words marked the moment when the 5G conspiracy established its RNA, however, the \u201cwet market\u201d for those ideas to jump species and spread human to human was a conference given on 11 March at the Health and Human Rights Summit, in Tucson, Arizona. The headline act was the original anti-vaxxer Andrew Wakefield, the discredited English doctor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/may/24/mmr-doctor-andrew-wakefield-struck-off\">who was struck off</a> by the GMC after being shown to have deliberately falsified evidence to make bogus claims of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Wakefield was in this case upstaged by a Californian, Thomas Cowan, author of <em>Cancer and the New Biology of Water</em>, who is serving a five-year suspension from medical practice for prescribing unlicensed drugs to cancer patients. Cowan claimed, entirely falsely, that Covid-19 was caused by electromagnetic waves and, also incorrectly, that Wuhan, where it originated, had been the guinea-pig city for 5G.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/04/uk-phone-masts-attacked-amid-5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">UK phone masts attacked amid 5G-coronavirus conspiracy theory</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Videos of this talk were viewed 1.8 million times on YouTube and widely shared on Facebook before the sites moved to take the posts down.</p> <p>In their book <em>A Lot of People Are Saying</em>, their study of conspiracism in the Trump era, Russell Muirhead and Nancy Rosenblum classify people such as Cowan as \u201cconspiracy entrepreneurs\u201d. Once he had seeded his conspiracy virus, multiple other wilder mutations followed, some linking it to an Illuminati plot, others to the \u201cblood sacrifice\u201d of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/27/kobe-bryant-obituary\">Kobe Bryant </a>in a helicopter crash.</p> <p>In Britain, some of those contagious fantasies found a population in which they could move as easily as coronavirus among Cheltenham Festival racegoers. Their combination with media attention around the decision to allow Huawei to supply some of the UK\u2019s 5G infrastructure, and the fact that telecoms engineers were designated key workers, appears to have ignited dangerous lockdown fears. Challenges were laid down in Facebook groups and Reddit threads for \u201cfirestarters\u201d to \u201ctake the 5G out\u201d.</p> <p>Social media platforms, fearing sanction, took long overdue action. Facebook has accepted a responsibility <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/facebook-acts-to-halt-far-right-groups-linking-covid-19-to-5g\">to remove false claims</a> that 5G technology causes Covid-19, while promising a modification that will direct people who look for such content toward accurate information from the NHS and the WHO.</p> <p>Some of the belated efforts to police \u201calt-right\u201d conspiracy content in the past couple of years are also helping to contain the spread of the madness. There has been no more virulent \u201cconspiracy entrepreneur\u201d than Alex Jones and his web channel, InfoWars. Jones has predictably loud-hailered the 5G and anti-vaxx lines: \u201cThis is the plan, folks,\u201d he grunted at his viewers. \u201cThey plan \u2013 if they\u2019ve fluoridated you and vaccinated you and stunned you and mesmerized you with the TV and put you in a trance \u2013 on killing you.\u201d Meanwhile, \u201cthey\u201d were determined \u201cto make sure you don\u2019t learn about the known antivirals\u201d. Prominent among these, apparently, were Jones\u2019s own \u201cwellness\u201d products: SuperSilver Whitening Toothpaste and ABL Nano Silver Gargle which, he claimed, \u201ckills the sars-corona family at point-blank range\u201d. (The only scientifically proven effect of the active ingredient in these products, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/does-colloidal-silver-work/\">colloidal silver</a>, is that it turns your skin blue.)</p> <p>Up until last year Jones\u2019s vicious untruths would have been spread by millions of followers on YouTube and Facebook and Twitter.

      "bodyText": "There have not been too many encouraging graph lines in recent weeks. One that does offer a breath of optimism, however, is the slight downward curve that implies one of the most toxic trends of our times \u2013 the anti-vaxx movement \u2013 might just be in retreat. The shift is incremental, but in a UK-wide survey in mid-March, 7% of people insisted they would refuse to have a coronavirus vaccine if one were available. By early April, with hospital wards and mortuaries filling up, that number had dropped to 5%. Perhaps vaccine conspiracy cannot bear too much pandemic reality. As with the strategies against the virus itself, however, the response to any likely \u201ccure\u201d seems likely to vary from country to country. A similar survey in France, also conducted by the London-based Vaccine Confidence Project, suggested 18% of people would refuse a vaccine, while in a poll in New York, the city worst affected by the pandemic, 29% insisted they would not consent, a number that may render any programme ineffective. The depth of misplaced fear about vaccination \u2013 which remains one of the unambiguous triumphs of global public health \u2013 has been further illustrated in widely shared remarks from lockdown. Novak Djokovic last week volunteered that he would have to think seriously about whether he could even carry on playing tennis if a vaccine were to become mandatory to travel. The rapper MIA went further in informing her 650,000 Twitter followers melodramatically, that \u201cif I have to choose the vaccine or a [location-tracking] chip, I\u2019m gonna choose death\u201d. The most prominent American anti-vaxxer, Robert Kennedy Jr, meanwhile, amplified an unhinged conspiracy that believes Bill Gates is using the virus as part of a supposed plot to control the world\u2019s population through immunisation. All pandemics trail a ready market in superstition, quackery and prejudice \u2013 a sense of powerlessness generates in some the need for catch-all theories, however deranged. At the time of the great plague in London, the spread of miracle cures and scapegoating prophecy was almost harder to contain than the infection itself. As part of its strategy the government was moved, Daniel Defoe reported in his A Journal of the Plague Year, to \u201csuppress the printing of such Books and Pamphlets as terrify the People\u201d. The efforts to prevent the spread of damaging conspiracies across our own media have shared a similar profile \u2013 and often a similar success rate \u2013 to the efforts to curb the disease. In this respect, the pandemic is something of a test case for the social media monopolies of Silicon Valley to deliver on their widely trumpeted commitment to slow the spread of dangerously false information. After being confronted with the evidence of manipulation in the elections of 2016, and the spread of such vile conspiracies as that which argued that the Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax, Facebook and Google and the rest have been forced to step up efforts to monitor and block extreme misinformation campaigns on their various platforms. Arguably, that effort is finally starting to show some effect. Counterintuitively, some evidence for that might be found in the response to the most pernicious of the current conspiracies which has, entirely without scientific foundation, sought to link the spread of coronavirus with the rollout of the 5G data network. The real-world effects have been the acts of vandalism and arson against mobile phone masts in the past weeks. Up to 50 such attacks have been reported, mostly on Merseyside and in the West Midlands, including the burning of the 5G mast adjacent to the new Nightingale hospital outside Birmingham. A report from the independent verification charity Full Fact last week revealed how this copycat campaign was only the most dramatic expression of a conspiracy theory with different strains, which include \u201cthat all the symptoms [of the virus] are actually caused by 5G\u2026 [and] that there is no disease at all, and the outbreak is a gigantic hoax to enable the government to install 5G under the cover of lockdown\u201d. It should go without saying that there is no possible connection between the 5G radio waves and the spread of a virus. Even so, the government was forced to address the fears, calling them \u201cdangerous nonsense\u201d. Thinking about contagious ideas now, I recall interviewing Daniel Dennett, the philosopher of evolution, back in 2006, just before the launch of Twitter. Dennett was talking excitedly of a word that he and Richard Dawkins had coined to describe how Darwinist idea-germs could be sent into battle against the politicised viruses of creationism. He called these idea-germs \u201cmemes\u201d. Nah, I thought at the time; it will never catch on. In the 14 years since, it has become second nature to trace the originators of particularly incendiary memes. A story in Wired magazine located the origin of the 5G conspiracy in an interview of 22 January in a Belgian newspaper with Kris Van Kerckhoven, a general practitioner from Putte, near Antwerp. He was quoted as saying that \u201c5G is life-threatening\u201d, but then added a speculative comment (\u201cI have not done a fact-check\u201d) that linked that falsehood to the virus then confined to China. The \u201clink\u201d became an ill-advised clickbait headline. (The piece, in Het Laatste Nieuws, was subsequently withdrawn.) If these words marked the moment when the 5G conspiracy established its RNA, however, the \u201cwet market\u201d for those ideas to jump species and spread human to human was a conference given on 11 March at the Health and Human Rights Summit, in Tucson, Arizona. The headline act was the original anti-vaxxer Andrew Wakefield, the discredited English doctor, who was struck off by the GMC after being shown to have deliberately falsified evidence to make bogus claims of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Wakefield was in this case upstaged by a Californian, Thomas Cowan, author of Cancer and the New Biology of Water, who is serving a five-year suspension from medical practice for prescribing unlicensed drugs to cancer patients. Cowan claimed, entirely falsely, that Covid-19 was caused by electromagnetic waves and, also incorrectly, that Wuhan, where it originated, had been the guinea-pig city for 5G. Videos of this talk were viewed 1.8 million times on YouTube and widely shared on Facebook before the sites moved to take the posts down. In their book A Lot of People Are Saying, their study of conspiracism in the Trump era, Russell Muirhead and Nancy Rosenblum classify people such as Cowan as \u201cconspiracy entrepreneurs\u201d. Once he had seeded his conspiracy virus, multiple other wilder mutations followed, some linking it to an Illuminati plot, others to the \u201cblood sacrifice\u201d of Kobe Bryant in a helicopter crash. In Britain, some of those contagious fantasies found a population in which they could move as easily as coronavirus among Cheltenham Festival racegoers. Their combination with media attention around the decision to allow Huawei to supply some of the UK\u2019s 5G infrastructure, and the fact that telecoms engineers were designated key workers, appears to have ignited dangerous lockdown fears. Challenges were laid down in Facebook groups and Reddit threads for \u201cfirestarters\u201d to \u201ctake the 5G out\u201d. Social media platforms, fearing sanction, took long overdue action. Facebook has accepted a responsibility to remove false claims that 5G technology causes Covid-19, while promising a modification that will direct people who look for such content toward accurate information from the NHS and the WHO. Some of the belated efforts to police \u201calt-right\u201d conspiracy content in the past couple of years are also helping to contain the spread of the madness. There has been no more virulent \u201cconspiracy entrepreneur\u201d than Alex Jones and his web channel, InfoWars. Jones has predictably loud-hailered the 5G and anti-vaxx lines: \u201cThis is the plan, folks,\u201d he grunted at his viewers. \u201cThey plan \u2013 if they\u2019ve fluoridated you and vaccinated you and stunned you and mesmerized you with the TV and put you in a trance \u2013 on killing you.\u201d Meanwhile, \u201cthey\u201d were determined \u201cto make sure you don\u2019t learn about the known antivirals\u201d. Prominent among these, apparently, were Jones\u2019s own \u201cwellness\u201d products: SuperSilver Whitening Toothpaste and ABL Nano Silver Gargle which, he claimed, \u201ckills the sars-corona family at point-blank range\u201d. (The only scientifically proven effect of the active ingredient in these products, colloidal silver, is that it turns your skin blue.) Up until last year Jones\u2019s vicious untruths would have been spread by millions of followers on YouTube and Facebook and Twitter. However, with trials pending involving the bereaved Sandy Hook parents he repeatedly called \u201cactors\u201d, his platforms were finally shut down for \u201chate speech\u201d. Having curtailed some of the spread of the most noxious threads, social media platforms apparently hope to rely, at least a little, on herd immunity to contain the conspiracy. When celebrity \u201csuper-spreaders\u201d of the 5G claims have emerged in recent weeks \u2013 including the actor Woody Harrelson, the boxer Amir Khan and the breakfast show host Eamonn Holmes \u2013 they have the experienced the chill of immediate social media isolation and distancing. It is still early days in this ongoing battle between fact and fantasy, but perhaps the general global compliance with lockdown measures, and the increasing appetite for verifiable facts and figures, indicates that rational voices might yet be in the ascendancy. Even those on the frontline of protest against distancing measures in the southern American states have looked conspicuously conflicted. Several have marched under \u201ccoronahoax\u201d banners while wearing face masks, hedging bets. Perhaps they have listened to the snake-oil \u201chunches\u201d and tantrums of their president while the bodies pile up, and wondered. Perhaps they fear, privately, the tragic irony in the story of John McDaniel, 60, of Ohio, who spent March posting conspiracy \u2013 \u201cDoes Anybody Have The Guts to Say This Covid-19 is a Political Ploy? Asking For A Friend. Prove Me Wrong\u201d \u2013 before, last week, becoming the first person in his county to die from the disease. History shows that pandemics change things in surprising ways. Much has been made of the superstition that has attended other epidemics, but they have also generated great advances in public health, including vaccination; even the wildest conspiracy entrepreneur probably knows deep down that the only way out of the current tragedy is careful application of the scientific method. In the past few weeks we have been exposed to a reality that all human generations before ours \u2013 and many millions in our own times in less advantaged parts of the planet \u2013 have known as a fact of life: that we exist in a precarious world of rapidly transmitted infectious diseases without an obvious cure. Though the sight of mass graves being dug and economies floundering has caused some to double-down on their pet grievances, to set fire to phone masts and indulge their fantasies about the Illuminati, it may yet cause more to think about getting back in touch with reality.",

New Covidsafe tracing app launches Australians can now download the government\u2019s controversial coronavirus contact tracing app, Covidsafe, amid ongoing concerns about privacy of those using the app. The app, based on source code from Singapore\u2019s Tracetogether software,maintains a log of bluetooth connections a person\u2019s phone makes with the phones of those they have come into contact with, making it easier for health authorities to trace potential Covid-19 carriers in the case of a positive diagnosis. For the app to be successful, just under half the population would need to carry it on their phones.

Report finds children unlikely to transmit virus A new report, cited by the chief medical officer as the federal government advocates the reopening of schools, says children are unlikely to transmit Covid-19 between each other or to adults. The study by NSW Health\u2019s Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCIRS), released on Sunday, examined transmission of the virus in NSW schools and childcare centres between March and mid-April. Examining the spread of 18 coronavirus cases (nine students and nine staff) from 15 schools, the report\u2019s preliminary findings were that only one primary school student and one high school student \u201cmay have contracted Covid-19 from the initial cases at their schools\u201d. \u201cNo teacher or staff member contracted Covid-19 from any of the initial school cases,\u201d the report added.

Foreign minister Marise Payne raised the idea of an international inquiry a week ago, calling for greater transparency on how Covid-19 originated and how it was subsequently handled. \u201cWe want more transparency within the communist party of China in the way they have dealt with this virus issue,\u201d Dutton told Sky News on Sunday.

On Friday morning the testing website could not cope and it told applicants that there were no more tests available, an administrative hitch for which the government swiftly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/key-workers-denied-coronavirus-tests-as-hancock-scheme-falters-on-first-day\">apologised</a>.</p> \n<p>Those in the queue on the outskirts of Milton Keynes had, however, logged on before the crash. Several told the <em>Observer</em> they wanted tests as much for their patients, or the people they worked and lived with, as for themselves. Many had signed up in the small hours, including a school key worker who had gone online at 2am to register.</p> \n<p>\u201cI work around Covid patients, although we wear full PPE,\u201d said one nurse who asked not to be named. \u201cThis is the first opportunity we\u2019ve had to get tested. It\u2019s for my patients as well as myself, so I don\u2019t risk infecting them.\u201d She had travelled with her sister who works in care, and her parents who are isolating with them. Their father\u2019s diabetes makes him a high risk if he contracts Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Once inside the car park the symptom carriers were directed into one of five bays, and greeted by a worker in full protective equipment, holding up a mobile phone number to ring from inside the car. The person on the phone explained how to take the test, and then provided a kit.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou had to get a swab and rub it along the back of your throat and tonsils, and then use the same swab up your nose,\u201d said Charlie Dawkins, a pre-school worker who signed up for a test after coming down with a fever and sore chest. \u201cI\u2019m quite glad we got to do it ourselves, I feel that if someone else did it I would have been sick. We had to keep stopping.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dawkins had driven for around half an hour with her mother, a key worker in a school who received an email saying she was eligible for tests the previous day.

She has a complex underlying medical condition. \u201cA test would help me manage my other underlying conditions better,\u201d she said. \u201cThe symptoms may be related to something else \u2013 this would help me rule it in or rule it out.\u201d Mitchell\u2019s partner is considered to be an essential worker, so they managed to book a test online.</p> \n<p>The nearest centre for her was in Worcester, 22 miles from her home in Cheltenham. Before attending, she said it would be \u201cvery scary\u201d because she hadn\u2019t left the house since 4 January when she got back from holiday incredibly ill. \u201cActually, going into the outside world is something that gives me a high level of anxiety, so going 22 miles makes it worse,\u201d she added.</p> \n<p>When Mitchell arrived at the testing site at Worcester Warriors rugby club just before 3pm on Saturday, she was told that there would be a two and a half hour wait \u2013 but the centre would shut at 5pm regardless. The only option was to attempt to rebook. \u201cThey told me they couldn\u2019t cope,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was very disappointing.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"28f9c4c8-d8b6-4f17-bdd6-1264330215a7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/akiXEfWW-V0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The tents of the Milton Keynes test centre are visible from nearby roads, normally busy with shoppers and office workers, and now emptied by coronavirus.

Milton Keynes has one of the biggest labs in the country, based at the<a href=\"https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/uk-biocentre-2/\"> UK Biocentre</a>, just a few miles from the car park test centre, which handles swabs sent from at least 20 testing centres across the country.</p> \n<p>The labs are largely manned by scientists who volunteered to step away from their usual research to carry out testing, which is labour-intensive work.</p> \n<p>At Milton Keynes, the scientists operate in pairs working 12-hour shifts, and together can handle around 400 to 500 swabs a day. The lab\u2019s daily capacity, at full stretch, is around 8,000 tests.</p> \n<p>Inside the lab there are three work stations, the first of which is protected by a biosecurity hood, where samples are treated with a solution to kill everything inside. In the second, the virus\u2019s genetic material (or the material of anything picked up by the sample) is extracted. In the third, that genetic material is put through a machine that multiplies it, so that there is enough for the test to detect, then checked for coronavirus. The biggest challenge, experts say, is not the science but the logistics of getting the tests in, then scaling up and bringing in robots.</p> \n<p>The Milton Keynes lab is part of a centralised approach to testing in the UK that has puzzled many scientists and may have been a key contributor to the slowincrease of testing capacity.</p> \n<p>Other countries that have rolled out more rapid testing programmes have relied at least in part on letting existing labs become testing centres with their own teams and equipment, who are able to start testing almost immediately on site.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c05ac5d1537c13ecc40c1c46ddaa339971772f2\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c05ac5d1537c13ecc40c1c46ddaa339971772f2/0_99_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Technicians carry out a sample transfer during the opening of the new Covid-19 testing lab at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Technicians carry out a sample transfer during the opening of the new Covid-19 testing lab at Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow last week.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WPA/Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the UK, by contrast, authorities have chosen to bring equipment and scientists together in government-established centres, which are slower to get going because logistics and supply issues need to be worked out.</p> \n<p>Prof Allyson Pollock, of Newcastle University, says one of the many reasons the UK\u2019s reaction has been late and, until now at least, fairly ineffective is that it can no longer respond to local need, because of endless reorganisations and years of austerity. She also says the government is treating this pandemic as a national one, when actually it is a series of local ones, requiring dedicated local responses.</p> \n<p>But what angers scientists, health workers, experts and others more is why it was left until so recently \u2013 when Hancock was already admitting the peak was near \u2013 for this mass process of testing and contact tracing to be ordered across the country. And why has it all seemed so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/06/uk-missed-coronavirus-contact-tracing-opportunity-experts-say\">chaotic and poorly planned</a>?</p> \n<p>The criticism of ministers and their advisers is all the greater because they know the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/31/two-people-in-britain-test-positive-for-coronavirus\">started on the right road</a> only to halt, change course, then resume when the virus had spread and all that could be achieved was damage limitation.</p> \n<p>In early March, during the \u201ccontainment phase\u201d, Public Health England (PHE) began testing and contact tracing of the few cases identified. Just under 300 staff were hired at that time. The team, working around the clock, traced 3,500 people and supported the 3% of contacts found to be infected to self-isolate. But tracing was then scaled back when the UK moved to the \u201cdelay phase\u201d.</p> \n<p>Governments that have contained larger scale outbreaks once they are under way, perhaps <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/test-trace-contain-how-south-korea-flattened-its-coronavirus-curve\">most notably South Korea</a>, which at one point was the worst affected country outside China, have done it through large-scale testing and rigorous tracing of the contacts of infected people.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe fact is that the UK was not able to operate a testing and tracing campaign like the one used in South Korea,\u2019 says Prof James Naismith, of Edinburgh University. \u201cWe, like many countries, did not have the infrastructure in place to maintain a testing programme in the first wave. South Korea - and Germany - did. However, as with being on the Titanic after it hit the iceberg, there is no time for recriminations, we need to act now to save lives. While we have lagged behind in testing and tracing, if we focus we can catch up.\u201d</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>After the UK stopped its testing and contact tracing, the World Health Organization ordered all countries to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/mar/16/test-test-test-who-calls-for-more-coronavirus-testing-video\">test, test, test</a>\u201d. But in a vital period last month, the UK resisted. Only recently, as pressure to limit the lockdown has grown from businesses, Conservative MPs and a frustrated public, and as Hancock\u2019s testing target looked in danger, has the government completely changed course.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c89ca9ae45963ef0f8b0510eeeb95a0f9bfcd88\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8c89ca9ae45963ef0f8b0510eeeb95a0f9bfcd88/0_7_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers direct cars at a coronavirus testing site in a car park at Chessington World of Adventures, south-west London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers direct cars at a coronavirus testing site in a car park at Chessington World of Adventures, south-west London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There is dismay among health workers who see daily the effects of Covid-19, that early efforts to \u201cramp up\u201d testing (before key workers were included from last Thursday) were suboptimal to say the least.</p> \n<p>Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said: \u201cThere has been a lot of zig-zagging and veering on what is the policy, who is responsible for mobilising it, what is the plan.\u201d When Hancock first announced his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/matt-hancock-sets-target-of-100000-coronavirus-tests-a-day\">target of 100,000 tests a day</a> she says no one really knew how it would work. \u201cIn our view it was not clear. It was just a number that was put out there.\u201d Cordery says it is not clear who the 100,000 should be initially, nor who would be involved in the testing. Should those to be tested include NHS staff, patients, who? </p> \n<p>This lack of action was irksome for scientists, who last week pointed to the UK\u2019s massive but ignored capacity for carrying out <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/the-two-tests-that-will-help-to-predict-spread-of-covid-19\">genetic testing</a>. Medical virology, molecular cancer and regional genetic laboratories as well as other academic centres around the country routinely use PCR [polymerase chain reaction] technology, which could easily have been turned to Covid-19 work a long time ago, they say.</p> \n<p>\u201cOnly the US has a greater capacity to do testing,\u201d said ProfGerome Breen, of King\u2019s College London. \u201cBut the NHS has refused to reply to many offers of help from research centres to supply tests.\u201d One of these offers came from Breen, a geneticist whose department already carries out PCR testing on a large scale. \u201cA month ago we offered to turn our laboratory over to Covid-19 work and test medical staff at King\u2019s College Hospital to find out who might have been infected with the virus. We could have started within a fortnight and would have been doing thousands of tests a day by now. We had a couple of emails from the department but heard nothing from them after that. It was intensely frustrating.\u201d</p> \n<p>Prof Martin Marshall, the chairman of the Royal College of GPs, suggested GPs should have been able to play a bigger role in referring patients for testing and helping the testing process. This admittedly would have required them to have the correct PPE, which has proved another challenge altogether.</p> \n<p>\u201cHave they been a bit slow in getting to general practice, understanding the needs of general practice, understanding the PPE needs, for example, which took a time, understanding the role of general practice in identifying vulnerable patients understanding the testing needs for general practice? I think all of that has been slower than we would have liked to see.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked if the government knew who it ought to be testing, he said: \u201cI think the testing programme has been influenced more by the politics of the availability of testing than it has by the epidemiology of what\u2019s required.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou can have a good policy on testing, but you can only deliver it if you\u2019ve actually got the kit.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"69bc2609-b61f-4a43-a042-0af3c62f3de7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3GqhApWmFtA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>This weekend, with the UK passing 20,000 hospital deaths from Covid-19 , and the WHO insisting that testing and contact tracing is essential before life can go back to normal, both are suddenly back at the heart of government policy.</p> \n<p>But have the U-turns and the delays cost? And what if the lockdown has to continue for months more because effective testing and contact tracing has not been put in place?</p> \n<p>Already business leaders and Conservative MPs are beginning to warn that without an <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52389967\">easing of the lockdown</a> based on testing and contact tracing, the economy faces ruin. Last week, the crisis facing small businesses and the need for a balance to be struck between saving lives and saving the economy was raised in a heated, virtual meeting of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers.</p> \n<p>The former cabinet minister, David Davis, said: \u201cThere is deep concern among backbenchers about the fate of the vast numbers of small businesses, which will determine how fast we come out of this economic slump. Unless we are very quick and very effective at bringing as many as possible back into work in a few weeks\u2019 time, the scars of this problem will go on for a decade.\u201d</p> \n<p>Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee, said: \u201cAll members of parliament must be receiving representations from businesses large and small needing further assistance or some sense of when they can start to plan for at least a partial release from these measures.\u201d</p> \n<p>Charles Walker, the committee\u2019s vice-chair, added: \u201cOur inboxes are full of desperate people who own small businesses, some of which are their lives\u2019 work, who now risk losing everything. We need to have a cabinet minister put in charge of small business.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"77142d5a-0bf3-4a80-b538-c47a11b57f6a\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications-detail/advice-on-the-use-of-masks-in-the-community-during-home-care-and-in-healthcare-settings-in-the-context-of-the-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-outbreak\">guidance on face masks</a> has remained consistent during the coronavirus pandemic. It has stuck to the line that masks are for healthcare workers \u2013 not the public.<b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>\u201cWearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures that can limit the spread of certain respiratory viral diseases, including Covid-19. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection, and other measures should also be adopted,\u201d the WHO has stated.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, as some countries have eased lockdown conditions, they have been making it mandatory to wear face coverings outside, as a way of trying to inhibit spread of the virus. This is in the belief that the face covering will prevent people who cough and sneeze ejecting the virus any great distance.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>There is no robust scientific evidence \u2013 in the form of trials \u2013 that ordinary masks block the virus from infecting people who wear them. There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There is another, even more pressing need to start testing in increasing numbers, says Prof Charles Swanton, of the Francis Crick Institute in London, who is an oncologist and the chief clinician at Cancer Research UK. He said studies of infected hospital patients in Wuhan, in China, where Covid-19 first emerged, indicated that around 40% had contracted the disease inside the hospital. \u201cHospital transmission is a very likely source of ongoing Covid-19 infection in the middle of a lockdown,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>For some patients \u2013 for instance, those with life-threatening cancers \u2013 this is a very serious issue. \u201cPatients are avoiding going to their GPs and GPs are making fewer hospital referrals. There are also 200,000 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/coronavirus-crisis-is-stopping-vital-cancer-care-doctors-say\">fewer cancer screenings</a> taking place each week in the UK, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. That, in turn, means there are approximately 2,000 to 2,500 cancer diagnoses being missed each week.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many scientists now believe reliable testing on a large scale really does offer the UK a route out of its Covid-19 crisis. However, merely reaching a figure of 100,000 tests a day on its own is not enough, warned Naismith.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt won\u2019t matter if we can test numbers of that order if we cannot then rapidly trace the contacts of those who are found to be positive and then isolate them. Once a person is found to be positive we will have to trace their contacts very, very quickly \u2013 within a day \u2013 and then test them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Such tracing will inevitably require technological aids \u2013 mainly by using mobile phones to track a person\u2019s movements, said Naismith. \u201cInevitably, that will have privacy issues,\u201d he added. \u201cHowever, these will have to be dealt with because testing and tracing offers us the best chance we have for dealing with Covid-19 at the moment.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 April 2020 to correct a quote from James Naismith.</p>",

On Friday afternoon a queue of about 20 cars had formed up on the road outside, carrying key workers from schools, hospitals and care homes. Men in high-vis jackets working for the accountancy giant Deloitte, which runs the centre, patrolled the street and tried to clear it of anyone not coming to be tested, even though they admitted they had no legal authority to do so. Those who had arrived had been given the postcode to put into their satnavs but there were almost no signposts to the hub on nearby ring roads or streets, perhaps to keep it a secret from curious locals or passersby. Less than 24 hours earlier, the health secretary, Matt Hancock \u2013 desperate to \u201cramp up\u201d testing (and then contact tracing) in the hope of getting somewhere near his target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April \u2013 had announced that all key workers with symptoms could apply to be checked for coronavirus. Huge pent-up demand from people would defeat the system within hours of it going live. On Friday morning the testing website could not cope and it told applicants that there were no more tests available, an administrative hitch for which the government swiftly apologised. Those in the queue on the outskirts of Milton Keynes had, however, logged on before the crash. Several told the Observer they wanted tests as much for their patients, or the people they worked and lived with, as for themselves. Many had signed up in the small hours, including a school key worker who had gone online at 2am to register. \u201cI work around Covid patients, although we wear full PPE,\u201d said one nurse who asked not to be named. \u201cThis is the first opportunity we\u2019ve had to get tested. It\u2019s for my patients as well as myself, so I don\u2019t risk infecting them.\u201d She had travelled with her sister who works in care, and her parents who are isolating with them. Their father\u2019s diabetes makes him a high risk if he contracts Covid-19. Once inside the car park the symptom carriers were directed into one of five bays, and greeted by a worker in full protective equipment, holding up a mobile phone number to ring from inside the car. The person on the phone explained how to take the test, and then provided a kit. \u201cYou had to get a swab and rub it along the back of your throat and tonsils, and then use the same swab up your nose,\u201d said Charlie Dawkins, a pre-school worker who signed up for a test after coming down with a fever and sore chest. \u201cI\u2019m quite glad we got to do it ourselves, I feel that if someone else did it I would have been sick. We had to keep stopping.\u201d Dawkins had driven for around half an hour with her mother, a key worker in a school who received an email saying she was eligible for tests the previous day. She too registered in the middle of the night. Dawkins said she found the experience as smooth as testing for a terrifying disease could be ever be. \u201cThe people were really nice, everyone was so friendly.\u201d She has been told to expect results by text or email within 48 hours, linked to a QR code she was given on registration, and scanned when collecting the test kits. Across the country key workers and their families and friends, some who had worried about their exposure and health for weeks, were going through this extraordinary, novel and anxiety-inducing procedure. Nic Mitchell, a property and financial services adviser, began developing symptoms a few days ago, which forced her partner, the head engineer at a food processing factory, to go into isolation with her. She has a complex underlying medical condition. \u201cA test would help me manage my other underlying conditions better,\u201d she said. \u201cThe symptoms may be related to something else \u2013 this would help me rule it in or rule it out.\u201d Mitchell\u2019s partner is considered to be an essential worker, so they managed to book a test online. The nearest centre for her was in Worcester, 22 miles from her home in Cheltenham. Before attending, she said it would be \u201cvery scary\u201d because she hadn\u2019t left the house since 4 January when she got back from holiday incredibly ill. \u201cActually, going into the outside world is something that gives me a high level of anxiety, so going 22 miles makes it worse,\u201d she added. When Mitchell arrived at the testing site at Worcester Warriors rugby club just before 3pm on Saturday, she was told that there would be a two and a half hour wait \u2013 but the centre would shut at 5pm regardless. The only option was to attempt to rebook. \u201cThey told me they couldn\u2019t cope,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was very disappointing.\u201d The tents of the Milton Keynes test centre are visible from nearby roads, normally busy with shoppers and office workers, and now emptied by coronavirus. The silent streets, with the test queue the only sign of life, were a reminder of the abrupt distortion of normality. The swabs are not tested on site, because they need sophisticated laboratory processing. Milton Keynes has one of the biggest labs in the country, based at the UK Biocentre, just a few miles from the car park test centre, which handles swabs sent from at least 20 testing centres across the country. The labs are largely manned by scientists who volunteered to step away from their usual research to carry out testing, which is labour-intensive work. At Milton Keynes, the scientists operate in pairs working 12-hour shifts, and together can handle around 400 to 500 swabs a day. The lab\u2019s daily capacity, at full stretch, is around 8,000 tests. Inside the lab there are three work stations, the first of which is protected by a biosecurity hood, where samples are treated with a solution to kill everything inside. In the second, the virus\u2019s genetic material (or the material of anything picked up by the sample) is extracted. In the third, that genetic material is put through a machine that multiplies it, so that there is enough for the test to detect, then checked for coronavirus. The biggest challenge, experts say, is not the science but the logistics of getting the tests in, then scaling up and bringing in robots. The Milton Keynes lab is part of a centralised approach to testing in the UK that has puzzled many scientists and may have been a key contributor to the slowincrease of testing capacity. Other countries that have rolled out more rapid testing programmes have relied at least in part on letting existing labs become testing centres with their own teams and equipment, who are able to start testing almost immediately on site. In the UK, by contrast, authorities have chosen to bring equipment and scientists together in government-established centres, which are slower to get going because logistics and supply issues need to be worked out. Prof Allyson Pollock, of Newcastle University, says one of the many reasons the UK\u2019s reaction has been late and, until now at least, fairly ineffective is that it can no longer respond to local need, because of endless reorganisations and years of austerity. She also says the government is treating this pandemic as a national one, when actually it is a series of local ones, requiring dedicated local responses. But what angers scientists, health workers, experts and others more is why it was left until so recently \u2013 when Hancock was already admitting the peak was near \u2013 for this mass process of testing and contact tracing to be ordered across the country. And why has it all seemed so chaotic and poorly planned? The criticism of ministers and their advisers is all the greater because they know the UK started on the right road only to halt, change course, then resume when the virus had spread and all that could be achieved was damage limitation. In early March, during the \u201ccontainment phase\u201d, Public Health England (PHE) began testing and contact tracing of the few cases identified. Just under 300 staff were hired at that time. The team, working around the clock, traced 3,500 people and supported the 3% of contacts found to be infected to self-isolate. But tracing was then scaled back when the UK moved to the \u201cdelay phase\u201d. Governments that have contained larger scale outbreaks once they are under way, perhaps most notably South Korea, which at one point was the worst affected country outside China, have done it through large-scale testing and rigorous tracing of the contacts of infected people. \u201cThe fact is that the UK was not able to operate a testing and tracing campaign like the one used in South Korea,\u2019 says Prof James Naismith, of Edinburgh University. \u201cWe, like many countries, did not have the infrastructure in place to maintain a testing programme in the first wave. South Korea - and Germany - did. However, as with being on the Titanic after it hit the iceberg, there is no time for recriminations, we need to act now to save lives. While we have lagged behind in testing and tracing, if we focus we can catch up.\u201d After the UK stopped its testing and contact tracing, the World Health Organization ordered all countries to \u201ctest, test, test\u201d. But in a vital period last month, the UK resisted. Only recently, as pressure to limit the lockdown has grown from businesses, Conservative MPs and a frustrated public, and as Hancock\u2019s testing target looked in danger, has the government completely changed course. There is dismay among health workers who see daily the effects of Covid-19, that early efforts to \u201cramp up\u201d testing (before key workers were included from last Thursday) were suboptimal to say the least. Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said: \u201cThere has been a lot of zig-zagging and veering on what is the policy, who is responsible for mobilising it, what is the plan.\u201d When Hancock first announced his target of 100,000 tests a day she says no one really knew how it would work. \u201cIn our view it was not clear. It was just a number that was put out there.\u201d Cordery says it is not clear who the 100,000 should be initially, nor who would be involved in the testing. Should those to be tested include NHS staff, patients, who? This lack of action was irksome for scientists, who last week pointed to the UK\u2019s massive but ignored capacity for carrying out genetic testing. Medical virology, molecular cancer and regional genetic laboratories as well as other academic centres around the country routinely use PCR [polymerase chain reaction] technology, which could easily have been turned to Covid-19 work a long time ago, they say. \u201cOnly the US has a greater capacity to do testing,\u201d said ProfGerome Breen, of King\u2019s College London. \u201cBut the NHS has refused to reply to many offers of help from research centres to supply tests.\u201d One of these offers came from Breen, a geneticist whose department already carries out PCR testing on a large scale. \u201cA month ago we offered to turn our laboratory over to Covid-19 work and test medical staff at King\u2019s College Hospital to find out who might have been infected with the virus. We could have started within a fortnight and would have been doing thousands of tests a day by now. We had a couple of emails from the department but heard nothing from them after that. It was intensely frustrating.\u201d Prof Martin Marshall, the chairman of the Royal College of GPs, suggested GPs should have been able to play a bigger role in referring patients for testing and helping the testing process. This admittedly would have required them to have the correct PPE, which has proved another challenge altogether. \u201cHave they been a bit slow in getting to general practice, understanding the needs of general practice, understanding the PPE needs, for example, which took a time, understanding the role of general practice in identifying vulnerable patients understanding the testing needs for general practice? I think all of that has been slower than we would have liked to see.\u201d Asked if the government knew who it ought to be testing, he said: \u201cI think the testing programme has been influenced more by the politics of the availability of testing than it has by the epidemiology of what\u2019s required. \u201cYou can have a good policy on testing, but you can only deliver it if you\u2019ve actually got the kit.\u201d This weekend, with the UK passing 20,000 hospital deaths from Covid-19 , and the WHO insisting that testing and contact tracing is essential before life can go back to normal, both are suddenly back at the heart of government policy. But have the U-turns and the delays cost? And what if the lockdown has to continue for months more because effective testing and contact tracing has not been put in place? Already business leaders and Conservative MPs are beginning to warn that without an easing of the lockdown based on testing and contact tracing, the economy faces ruin. Last week, the crisis facing small businesses and the need for a balance to be struck between saving lives and saving the economy was raised in a heated, virtual meeting of the 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers. The former cabinet minister, David Davis, said: \u201cThere is deep concern among backbenchers about the fate of the vast numbers of small businesses, which will determine how fast we come out of this economic slump. Unless we are very quick and very effective at bringing as many as possible back into work in a few weeks\u2019 time, the scars of this problem will go on for a decade.\u201d Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee, said: \u201cAll members of parliament must be receiving representations from businesses large and small needing further assistance or some sense of when they can start to plan for at least a partial release from these measures.\u201d Charles Walker, the committee\u2019s vice-chair, added: \u201cOur inboxes are full of desperate people who own small businesses, some of which are their lives\u2019 work, who now risk losing everything. We need to have a cabinet minister put in charge of small business.\u201d There is another, even more pressing need to start testing in increasing numbers, says Prof Charles Swanton, of the Francis Crick Institute in London, who is an oncologist and the chief clinician at Cancer Research UK. He said studies of infected hospital patients in Wuhan, in China, where Covid-19 first emerged, indicated that around 40% had contracted the disease inside the hospital. \u201cHospital transmission is a very likely source of ongoing Covid-19 infection in the middle of a lockdown,\u201d he said. For some patients \u2013 for instance, those with life-threatening cancers \u2013 this is a very serious issue. \u201cPatients are avoiding going to their GPs and GPs are making fewer hospital referrals. There are also 200,000 fewer cancer screenings taking place each week in the UK, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. That, in turn, means there are approximately 2,000 to 2,500 cancer diagnoses being missed each week.\u201d Many scientists now believe reliable testing on a large scale really does offer the UK a route out of its Covid-19 crisis. However, merely reaching a figure of 100,000 tests a day on its own is not enough, warned Naismith. \u201cIt won\u2019t matter if we can test numbers of that order if we cannot then rapidly trace the contacts of those who are found to be positive and then isolate them. Once a person is found to be positive we will have to trace their contacts very, very quickly \u2013 within a day \u2013 and then test them.\u201d Such tracing will inevitably require technological aids \u2013 mainly by using mobile phones to track a person\u2019s movements, said Naismith. \u201cInevitably, that will have privacy issues,\u201d he added. \u201cHowever, these will have to be dealt with because testing and tracing offers us the best chance we have for dealing with Covid-19 at the moment.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 26 April 2020 to correct a quote from James Naismith.",

Until the end of the last century, virtually all clinical trials by western pharmaceutical companies were conducted in Europe or America. The majority still are. But over the past 20 years, US, European and, increasingly, Chinese companies have taken to offshoring trials to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4428044/#b2\">low- and middle-income countries</a>. In 2017, 90% of new drugs approved by the US Food and Drugs Agency <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2017/09/08/clinical-trials-overseas-data/\">were tested</a> at least in part outside the US and Canada. At a time when so much attention -and hope - is focused on the possibilities of a Covid-19 vaccine, it\u2019s worth reminding ourselves of what the development of medicines means for most of the world.</p> <p>The reasons for conducting tests offshore are not hard to discern.

It has a huge population, enormous levels of poverty, almost 20% of the global disease burden and a pitiable health infrastructure. It also has highly trained scientists and medics, skilled technicians and good laboratories. As a result, in the first decade of this century, India became the poor country of choice for many pharmaceutical companies. The proportion of <a href=\"http://isid.org.in/pdf/WP179.pdf\">global clinical trials</a> conducted in India rose from less than 1% in 2008 to 5% six years later \u2013 just about on par with the UK.</p> <p>The globalisation of clinical research has many potential benefits. It could help tackle diseases long ignored, develop medical and scientific innovation in non-western countries, improve their health infrastructure and increase the diversity of trial subjects and thereby the quality of the final product. In reality, too little of this has happened because offshore clinical trials have at their heart not a concern for the welfare of subjects or the health of local populations but the need to cut costs and generate profits.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In India, many poor people were recruited to HIV trials without knowing that they were taking part in experiments</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ethical guidelines for clinical research normally require participating patients to have access to the best available treatments for their condition.

Across the country, in teenage bedrooms and house shares, Brits stuck at home by the coronavirus lockdown are firing up <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/en/\">TikTok</a>, propping their phones against walls and hitting record.</p> <p>Founded in 2012 by Chinese entrepreneur Zhang Yiming, TikTok is one of the most popular video-sharing apps in the world, downloaded more than 2bn times globally. Users create 15-second clips set to music or soundbites, which they can overlay with digital special effects.</p> <p>Before the coronavirus pandemic, TikTok was predominantly favoured by British teenagers, who posted prank videos or the latest trending dance routine on it. But since the lockdown, TikTok has become a seething leviathan of user-generated content, chewing down our boredom, our fatigue and our fear and spitting them back at us in 15-second chunks, to be digested ad infinitum.</p> <p>According to mobile industry analysts Sensor Tower, one in three Brits \u2013 24 million people \u2013 has TikTok installed on their devices. The week before Boris Johnson announced the lockdown, 278,000 UK users downloaded TikTok on their phones, up 6% from the week previously. For the week of 23 March, when lockdown was enforced, UK installations surged by 34%. In lieu of going to bars, pubs or clubs, Britons would be staying in \u2013 and whiling away our time on TikTok.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Madeline Mai-Davis on TikTok\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tiktok-embed&quot; cite=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@maddiedavies.x/video/6808242769916595461&quot; data-video-id=&quot;6808242769916595461&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;&quot; &gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;@maddiedavies.x&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@maddiedavies.x&quot;&gt;@maddiedavies.x&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next door neighbour trying hard not to get caught whilst on lockdown... &lt;a title=&quot;foryou&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryou&quot;&gt;##foryou&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;fyp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp&quot;&gt;##fyp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;foryoupage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryoupage&quot;&gt;##foryoupage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;viral&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/viral&quot;&gt;##viral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;tiktok&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tiktok&quot;&gt;##tiktok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;foryoupagethis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryoupagethis&quot;&gt;##foryoupagethis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;safehands&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/safehands&quot;&gt;##safehands&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;4u&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/4u&quot;&gt;##4u&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;\u266c original sound - maddiedavies.x&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6808233740066622213&quot;&gt;\u266c original sound - maddiedavies.x&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>I keep asking 18-year-old <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nGYpWK/\">Madeline Mai-Davies</a> what it\u2019s like to be an overnight TikTok celebrity, but all she can do is rattle off numbers for me. \u201cSo the bush-man video went viral on 16.5m views,\u201d Mai-Davies says giddily, \u201cand the video where I pretended to surprise my boyfriend naked, now that\u2019s got 12.5m views.\u201d</p> <p>After joining TikTok just six days ago, the unemployed waitress from Stevenage \u2013 like almost everyone else in the hospitality sector, coronavirus cost Mai-Davies her job \u2013 has 210,000 followers. In less time than it takes for a banana to go brown, she has accrued an online following double the circulation of some national newspapers. How does she feel? \u201cTo be fair, it has been a headfuck,\u201d she responds, before reeling off more figures.</p> <p>Mai-Davies became a TikTok influencer after a video she posted of her boyfriend pretending to break the coronavirus lockdown \u2013 by creeping down their road in a grass-covered costume \u2013 went viral. (At the time of writing, it had 1.6m views.) Sudden fame has left Mai-Davies punch-drunk on her own celebrity. \u201c<em>This Morning</em> got in contact with me,\u201d she says breathlessly. \u201cThey want me to FaceTime Holly and Phil. We\u2019ve been in hundreds of articles in 20 different counties.\u201d</p> <p>Becoming a TikTok influencer is now a viable career. \u201cI want to be a content creator and make people laugh,\u201d says 24-year-old <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nsT2WV/\">Akafi Ali</a>, from London. Ali quit his job as a Sainsbury\u2019s cashier to pursue his TikTok dream: his videos satirise Somali culture or feature Ali on caterwauling form. \u201cEveryone is going to the supermarket to grab toilet rolls!\u201d Ali says in one video. \u201cAre you serious? Just wash your ass!\u201d</p> <p>Ali says TikTok was already popular before coronavirus, but that the lockdown has supercharged it. \u201cThere are a lot more people jumping on,\u201d he says. With this influx of new influencers comes competition. \u201cBefore, if you uploaded a video, you could easily get 100,000 views in the first hour,\u201d says Ali. \u201cBut now you don\u2019t get on the For You page as easily as before.\u201d (For You is the landing page on TikTok, tailored to users\u2019 interests.)</p> <p>Mai-Davies also plans to give the TikTok influencer thing a go and is posting daily videos. \u201cWhen I go to bed, I think about ideas for tomorrow\u2019s video,\u201d she says. She tells me that some young girls have set up a fan page about her on Instagram. \u201cThey write, \u2018I love her so much, she\u2019s my Queen,\u2019\u201d she says. She sounds bemused. \u201cThis is so crazy. How have I got a fan page?\u201d</p> <p>The most important thing to understand about TikTok is that it is anarchic: it has no internal logic or guiding principle. Many TikTok videos are absurdist jokes. People surprise family members, impersonate celebrities or set up elaborate punchlines. The platform frequently has the surreal quality of a fever dream: videos riff on arcane internet ephemera or make nonsensical jokes. Non-sequiturs are common. Creativity is paramount.</p> <p>\u201cSurrealism is embedded into the DNA of the internet,\u201d says Kenneth Goldsmith, author of <em>Wasting Time on the Internet</em>. He sees TikTok\u2019s popularity as a natural reaction to the oppressive mania of a global lockdown \u2013 it is a pressure valve for people cooped up indoors. \u201cThe only response to an existential situation is absurdity and humour,\u201d Goldsmith says. \u201cIt brings us back to the darker side of surrealism.\u201d</p> <p>On Instagram, we are primped and preening, on Twitter, loudmouthed and strident, but on TikTok, we can just be weird. Which makes it the perfect platform to ride out a pandemic that has nearly one-third of the world\u2019s population trapped at home. \u201cIt\u2019s therapeutic,\u201d Goldsmith explains. \u201cIf we look at Freud\u2019s theorising of the joke, the joke is always about showing humour in the face of death.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sort of embarrassed by it,\u201d says <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nGNWao/\">John Palmer</a> of his TikTok account. The 17-year-old, from County Durham, specialises in the sort of hyper-surreal videos you\u2019d expect to jump into through a chalk pavement drawing \u2013 if Mary Poppins used TikTok. Typically, Palmer\u2019s videos refer to popular memes or obscure internet jokes.</p> <p>In one video, Palmer rips a much-memed Michelle Obama soundbite to make a joke about Prince William using coronavirus to leapfrog Charles in the line of succession. In another, he pretends to talk to the squadron of imaginary friends he\u2019s made in self-isolation. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of about finding the template, but pushing the meme as far as it will go, making it weirder and weirder, until it gets to a point where it doesn\u2019t make sense unless you\u2019ve seen everything else before,\u201d Palmer says. \u201cIt spirals down into something else.\u201d</p> <p>This is TikTok as pure subculture: in order to participate at Palmer\u2019s level, you need to have swum through digital water since childhood, a graceful stroke through each platform \u2013 Facebook, Vine, Instagram \u2013 that is easy and assured. There is no need for gatekeepers: the price of admission to this subculture is simply understanding the joke. \u201cI show it to my parents and they don\u2019t get it,\u201d Palmer explains. \u201cIt\u2019s the meme culture of Gen Z. There\u2019s so much background to memes. You need to have lived through them.\u201d</p> <p>As a TikTok old timer, Palmer is mortified by the platform\u2019s exploding popularity during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI\u2019m not looking forward to all of the adults discovering TikTok,\u201d he says with a sigh.</p> <p>There\u2019s a simple reason why people are flocking to TikTok: it\u2019s a superb time waster. And in lieu of freedom or gainful employment, right now the only thing the British public has in abundance is time to burn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Rachel Leary on TikTok\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tiktok-embed&quot; cite=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@rachleary/video/6807502301582871814&quot; data-video-id=&quot;6807502301582871814&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;&quot; &gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;@rachleary&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@rachleary&quot;&gt;@rachleary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Welcome to my stay-at-home-covid-19-update rave x &lt;a title=&quot;coronavirus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/coronavirus&quot;&gt;##coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;foryou&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryou&quot;&gt;##foryou&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;foryoupage&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foryoupage&quot;&gt;##foryoupage&lt;/a&gt; *contains flashing lights*&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;\u266c B.B.C.

There\u2019s nothing else to do.\u201d</p> <p>TikTok is designed to be addictive: you can scroll its dashboard for hours without ever running out of content. Its algorithm uses artificial intelligence to observe your interests and deliver videos that fit. Palmer tells me that since downloading TikTok on his phone, his screen time has gone up from seven hours a day to 12.</p> <p>And when you finally tire of scrolling through TikTok\u2019s neverending dashboard, you can start making videos. Palmer only started posting his own videos when the coronavirus lockdown started. \u201cI was locked in the house and had nothing else to do,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought making a video might be something to do for a day to occupy myself.\u201d He sounds surprised. \u201cBut then I continued with it.\u201d</p> <p>TikTok is a curative to boredom: there is always a new challenge to try or dance routine to learn. \u201cTikTok is a space for the familiar play we\u2019ve seen on the internet for decades now,\u201d says Ryan Milner of the College of Charleston. \u201cChallenges that went around on YouTube or Facebook, like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/30/als-after-the-ice-bucket-challenge\">ice-bucket challenge</a> or the Kylie Jenner challenge, are now on TikTok.\u201d</p> <p>And although many TikTok videos may appear inane on first viewing, making a successful TikTok video takes skill, care and creativity. \u201cWhen you\u2019re writing the caption on TikTok, it really has to flow well and have the right syntax,\u201d Palmer says, \u201cbecause if it\u2019s too confusing people don\u2019t like it or ignore it. It has to flow really well.\u201d</p> <p>Leary reshot her most popular TikTok video \u2013 in which she pretends to DJ to the BBC News theme tune using household cleaning products \u2013 to improve her comic timing. \u201cI didn\u2019t instantly look at it and think, that\u2019s so funny,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo I refilmed it and the second time I took a swig of wine. That\u2019s the part of the video that people have found the funniest and commented on.\u201d Her instinct was correct: the video has received 151,000 likes and was played on the BBC.</p> <p>Another characteristic of TikTok that makes it well suited to the coronavirus lockdown: it is primarily an indoor platform. \u201cTikTok has always been about being 15 and staying at home,\u201d explains David Nichols of the University of Melbourne. \u201cThat\u2019s the accepted backdrop. And now everyone has to stay at home! So TikTok was made for coronavirus. Not deliberately, but it was.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike Instagram, where influencers swagger in front of a rotating backdrop of cocktail bars and tropical beaches, TikTokkers have always filmed themselves at home, in their bedrooms. \u201cInstagram is more for like going out and getting drunk or going on holiday,\u201d Palmer says. \u201cInstagram is superficial. But TikTok is just people posting stupid things and it\u2019s addictive, so you can keep going and going.\u201d</p> <p>Many of the young people I speak to say a variant of the same thing: TikTok used to be uncool, until suddenly it wasn\u2019t. Palmer tells me that his peers would often write \u201cHere as a joke\u201d on their TikTok bios, because they were embarrassed to be on the app. \u201cIf TikTok came up in conversation, everyone would say, \u2018Urgh, no one goes on that,\u2019\u201d says 16-year-old <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nGjfv5/\">Libby Atkinson</a>, from Manchester.</p> <p>Coronavirus supercharged a process that was already taking place: the process of TikTok becoming cool. \u201cAll my friends are coming on it because they have nothing to do,\u201d says Atkinson. As a result, more young people are jumping ship, from Instagram to TikTok. \u201cEveryone is moving away from Instagram to TikTok,\u201d says Ali. \u201cIt\u2019s going to become the No 1 app that everyone is using.\u201d</p> <p>This exodus of Gen Z from Instagram to TikTok mirrors the way millennials dumped Facebook in the 2010s. \u201cApps are generational in a half-decade sense,\u201d says Milner. \u201cIt makes perfect sense that Gen Z would have their own platform and it would be TikTok. If you look at Instagram and everyone on it is aged 25 and older, you want to find your own place.\u201d</p> <p>Even as we abscond from Instagram in droves, TikTok would not exist without it. Milner says: \u201cSomething unique about TikTok is how much it is centred on the image of the creator and their physical body\u2026 That wouldn\u2019t have happened had Instagram not made us much more used to having our face and bodies being on camera.\u201d Instagram sandblasted away our self-consciousness: it made us comfortable with being on camera.</p> <p>Where 16-year-olds go, adults follow. Celebrities including <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nGFEbf/\">Lizzo</a>, <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nGBpRd/\">Britney Spears</a> and <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nGYrat/\">Justin Bieber</a> have posted TikTok videos during the lockdown. Non-celebrities are also flooding the app: Leary\u2019s mum has become hooked on the platform. \u201cShe keeps telling me that she can\u2019t stop scrolling,\u201d Leary laughs. \u201cTikTok has made it into the mainstream now,\u201d says Nichols. \u201cIt\u2019s part of popular culture. A year ago, I\u2019d have to explain what TikTok was to adults.\u201d</p> <p>As TikTok grows up, it loses its countercultural edge. \u201cI discovered it through my daughter,\u201d explains Wendy Paintain, a 54-year-old from Lichfield. \u201cShe was throwing herself around the living room, in front of her phone. I thought, <em>what on earth is this rubbish? </em>I downloaded it to have a look. And then I thought, actually, it\u2019s quite entertaining.\u201d She lets rip a loud laugh.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Grandad Joe on TikTok\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tiktok-embed&quot; cite=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@grandadjoe1933/video/6806714661153557765&quot; data-video-id=&quot;6806714661153557765&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;&quot; &gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;@grandadjoe1933&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@grandadjoe1933&quot;&gt;@grandadjoe1933&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;very sad, we need to do better \ud83d\ude14. video creds @goubtube \ud83d\ude4c. &lt;a title=&quot;staysafe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/staysafe&quot;&gt;##staysafe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;selfisolation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/selfisolation&quot;&gt;##selfisolation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;wishmeluck&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/wishmeluck&quot;&gt;##wishmeluck&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;supermarket&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/supermarket&quot;&gt;##supermarket&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;considerothers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/considerothers&quot;&gt;##considerothers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title=&quot;washyourhands&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/tag/washyourhands&quot;&gt;##washyourhands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;\u266c If The World Was Ending - JP Saxe ft.

The <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nGR6BN/\">Grandad Joe</a> account blew up after Paintain posted a video of Joe looking forlorn in a ransacked supermarket. It went viral, amassing 42.5m views.</p> <p>Since then, Joe has been accepted into the TikTok top creators programme, been invited for TV appearances and has even started to make money from brand partnerships. \u201cHe\u2019s grown really quickly,\u201d says Paintain of her father\u2019s TikTok account. \u201cHe got 1.6 million followers in nine weeks. He\u2019s even got a blue tick!\u201d (An indicator of a verified celebrity.) She takes me upstairs to speak to Joe, who is having a nap. \u201cI can\u2019t understand why it\u2019s so popular, really,\u201d Joe tells me. \u201cI\u2019m an old fossil. I guess I\u2019m having my 15 minutes of fame. Did you know that I might be going on the telly?\u201d</p> <p>Alongside these older content creators, official bodies have been using TikTok to publish public health information during the coronavirus pandemic. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has uploaded TikTok videos urging people to stay at home; the World Health Organization has 1.4 million followers on the app. During the Easter bank holiday weekend, when many feared people may break lockdown rules, due to the warm weather, the UK government ran ads on TikTok, asking people to stay at home.</p> <p>Coronavirus trends float through the app, like driftwood. There\u2019s the #iwillsurvivechallenge (where users wash their hands to the Gloria Gaynor anthem), and the #stayathomechallenge, where <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nsEtDt/\">NHS workers</a> and TikTok creators urge users to stay indoors, sharing exercise routines or cooking tips to pass the time. (The #stayathomechallenge has more than 2.6bn views.) Bored in the House, the song by Tyga and up-and-coming rapper Curtis Roach, has become <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/BORED-IN-THE-HOUSE-6800281264655026950?lang=en\">TikTok\u2019s unofficial coronavirus anthem</a>: more than 2m videos have been created using the song, with more than 923 million views globally.</p> <p>All coronavirus content on TikTok has a banner linking to reputable news sources. The app\u2019s UK general manager, Richard Waterworth, says: \u201cWe [have] introduced a range of in-app features, notifications and safety measures specifically designed to elevate credible and accurate information from trusted sources.\u201d But preventing the spread of fake news can be difficult to enforce in practice: conspiracy theories linking 5G to coronavirus are easy to find.</p> <p>Healthcare workers have also turned to the app. \u201cTraditional TikTok was a dance platform,\u201d says NHS doctor and former <em>Love Island</em> contestant <a href=\"https://vm.tiktok.com/nsvwyh/\">Alex George</a>. The 29-year-old has 104,000 followers on TikTok, where he posts videos explaining how coronavirus is transmitted or the correct way to wash your hands. \u201cBut that\u2019s not true any more. People are engaging with health content.\u201d</p> <p>Coronavirus has helped TikTok to grow up. What was once a platform for uninhibited free play, detached from the cares and concerns of the outside world, has become outward facing. Although this is not the first time that TikTokkers have been civic-minded \u2013 during the 2019 Australian bushfires, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/dec/23/australian-teens-turn-to-tiktok-to-mock-pm-over-hawaii-holiday-during-fire-crisis\">users ridiculed Australian prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s handling of the crisis</a> and raised money for affected communities \u2013 coronavirus has pushed TikTok into a new prominence. TikTok itself has pledged \u20ac62m to support European healthcare workers and communities affected by the pandemic.</p> <p>George is hopeful that his videos will communicate key public health messages to a younger audience. \u201cYoung people don\u2019t engage with traditional media forms,\u201d he says, \u201cbut they might watch my TikTok videos and educate their grandparents about how to wash their hands properly.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Alex George on TikTok\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tiktok-embed&quot; cite=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@lizzo/video/6816474944399101189&quot; data-video-id=&quot;6816474944399101189&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;&quot; &gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;@lizzo&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@lizzo&quot;&gt;@lizzo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Omg y\u2019all&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;\u266c original sound - jeanvictorm&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6812435361357171462&quot;&gt;\u266c original sound - jeanvictorm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@sorchamackenzie?lang=en\">Sorcha Mackenzie</a> joined TikTok long before coronavirus.

      "bodyText": "A person in a grass-covered suit lurks behind a wheelie bin before sprinting down a residential cul-de-sac. In a cramped bathroom, five housemates lip-sync in a limescale-stained bath. NHS staff dance on a deserted ward. A family of four performs a dance routine in a suburban garden. The father is out of time. These are the faces of the UK\u2019s TikTok obsession. Across the country, in teenage bedrooms and house shares, Brits stuck at home by the coronavirus lockdown are firing up TikTok, propping their phones against walls and hitting record. Founded in 2012 by Chinese entrepreneur Zhang Yiming, TikTok is one of the most popular video-sharing apps in the world, downloaded more than 2bn times globally. Users create 15-second clips set to music or soundbites, which they can overlay with digital special effects. Before the coronavirus pandemic, TikTok was predominantly favoured by British teenagers, who posted prank videos or the latest trending dance routine on it. But since the lockdown, TikTok has become a seething leviathan of user-generated content, chewing down our boredom, our fatigue and our fear and spitting them back at us in 15-second chunks, to be digested ad infinitum. According to mobile industry analysts Sensor Tower, one in three Brits \u2013 24 million people \u2013 has TikTok installed on their devices. The week before Boris Johnson announced the lockdown, 278,000 UK users downloaded TikTok on their phones, up 6% from the week previously. For the week of 23 March, when lockdown was enforced, UK installations surged by 34%. In lieu of going to bars, pubs or clubs, Britons would be staying in \u2013 and whiling away our time on TikTok. I keep asking 18-year-old Madeline Mai-Davies what it\u2019s like to be an overnight TikTok celebrity, but all she can do is rattle off numbers for me. \u201cSo the bush-man video went viral on 16.5m views,\u201d Mai-Davies says giddily, \u201cand the video where I pretended to surprise my boyfriend naked, now that\u2019s got 12.5m views.\u201d After joining TikTok just six days ago, the unemployed waitress from Stevenage \u2013 like almost everyone else in the hospitality sector, coronavirus cost Mai-Davies her job \u2013 has 210,000 followers. In less time than it takes for a banana to go brown, she has accrued an online following double the circulation of some national newspapers. How does she feel? \u201cTo be fair, it has been a headfuck,\u201d she responds, before reeling off more figures. Mai-Davies became a TikTok influencer after a video she posted of her boyfriend pretending to break the coronavirus lockdown \u2013 by creeping down their road in a grass-covered costume \u2013 went viral. (At the time of writing, it had 1.6m views.) Sudden fame has left Mai-Davies punch-drunk on her own celebrity. \u201cThis Morning got in contact with me,\u201d she says breathlessly. \u201cThey want me to FaceTime Holly and Phil. We\u2019ve been in hundreds of articles in 20 different counties.\u201d Becoming a TikTok influencer is now a viable career. \u201cI want to be a content creator and make people laugh,\u201d says 24-year-old Akafi Ali, from London. Ali quit his job as a Sainsbury\u2019s cashier to pursue his TikTok dream: his videos satirise Somali culture or feature Ali on caterwauling form. \u201cEveryone is going to the supermarket to grab toilet rolls!\u201d Ali says in one video. \u201cAre you serious? Just wash your ass!\u201d Ali says TikTok was already popular before coronavirus, but that the lockdown has supercharged it. \u201cThere are a lot more people jumping on,\u201d he says. With this influx of new influencers comes competition. \u201cBefore, if you uploaded a video, you could easily get 100,000 views in the first hour,\u201d says Ali. \u201cBut now you don\u2019t get on the For You page as easily as before.\u201d (For You is the landing page on TikTok, tailored to users\u2019 interests.) Mai-Davies also plans to give the TikTok influencer thing a go and is posting daily videos. \u201cWhen I go to bed, I think about ideas for tomorrow\u2019s video,\u201d she says. She tells me that some young girls have set up a fan page about her on Instagram. \u201cThey write, \u2018I love her so much, she\u2019s my Queen,\u2019\u201d she says. She sounds bemused. \u201cThis is so crazy. How have I got a fan page?\u201d The most important thing to understand about TikTok is that it is anarchic: it has no internal logic or guiding principle. Many TikTok videos are absurdist jokes. People surprise family members, impersonate celebrities or set up elaborate punchlines. The platform frequently has the surreal quality of a fever dream: videos riff on arcane internet ephemera or make nonsensical jokes. Non-sequiturs are common. Creativity is paramount. \u201cSurrealism is embedded into the DNA of the internet,\u201d says Kenneth Goldsmith, author of Wasting Time on the Internet. He sees TikTok\u2019s popularity as a natural reaction to the oppressive mania of a global lockdown \u2013 it is a pressure valve for people cooped up indoors. \u201cThe only response to an existential situation is absurdity and humour,\u201d Goldsmith says. \u201cIt brings us back to the darker side of surrealism.\u201d On Instagram, we are primped and preening, on Twitter, loudmouthed and strident, but on TikTok, we can just be weird. Which makes it the perfect platform to ride out a pandemic that has nearly one-third of the world\u2019s population trapped at home. \u201cIt\u2019s therapeutic,\u201d Goldsmith explains. \u201cIf we look at Freud\u2019s theorising of the joke, the joke is always about showing humour in the face of death.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sort of embarrassed by it,\u201d says John Palmer of his TikTok account. The 17-year-old, from County Durham, specialises in the sort of hyper-surreal videos you\u2019d expect to jump into through a chalk pavement drawing \u2013 if Mary Poppins used TikTok. Typically, Palmer\u2019s videos refer to popular memes or obscure internet jokes. In one video, Palmer rips a much-memed Michelle Obama soundbite to make a joke about Prince William using coronavirus to leapfrog Charles in the line of succession. In another, he pretends to talk to the squadron of imaginary friends he\u2019s made in self-isolation. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of about finding the template, but pushing the meme as far as it will go, making it weirder and weirder, until it gets to a point where it doesn\u2019t make sense unless you\u2019ve seen everything else before,\u201d Palmer says. \u201cIt spirals down into something else.\u201d This is TikTok as pure subculture: in order to participate at Palmer\u2019s level, you need to have swum through digital water since childhood, a graceful stroke through each platform \u2013 Facebook, Vine, Instagram \u2013 that is easy and assured. There is no need for gatekeepers: the price of admission to this subculture is simply understanding the joke. \u201cI show it to my parents and they don\u2019t get it,\u201d Palmer explains. \u201cIt\u2019s the meme culture of Gen Z. There\u2019s so much background to memes. You need to have lived through them.\u201d As a TikTok old timer, Palmer is mortified by the platform\u2019s exploding popularity during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI\u2019m not looking forward to all of the adults discovering TikTok,\u201d he says with a sigh. There\u2019s a simple reason why people are flocking to TikTok: it\u2019s a superb time waster. And in lieu of freedom or gainful employment, right now the only thing the British public has in abundance is time to burn. \u201cPeople are just looking for ways to keep themselves occupied,\u201d says TikTok creator Rachel Leary, 23, from Manchester. \u201cHaving TikTok on your phone is a really easy thing to do to pass the time. There\u2019s nothing else to do.\u201d TikTok is designed to be addictive: you can scroll its dashboard for hours without ever running out of content. Its algorithm uses artificial intelligence to observe your interests and deliver videos that fit. Palmer tells me that since downloading TikTok on his phone, his screen time has gone up from seven hours a day to 12. And when you finally tire of scrolling through TikTok\u2019s neverending dashboard, you can start making videos. Palmer only started posting his own videos when the coronavirus lockdown started. \u201cI was locked in the house and had nothing else to do,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought making a video might be something to do for a day to occupy myself.\u201d He sounds surprised. \u201cBut then I continued with it.\u201d TikTok is a curative to boredom: there is always a new challenge to try or dance routine to learn. \u201cTikTok is a space for the familiar play we\u2019ve seen on the internet for decades now,\u201d says Ryan Milner of the College of Charleston. \u201cChallenges that went around on YouTube or Facebook, like the ice-bucket challenge or the Kylie Jenner challenge, are now on TikTok.\u201d And although many TikTok videos may appear inane on first viewing, making a successful TikTok video takes skill, care and creativity. \u201cWhen you\u2019re writing the caption on TikTok, it really has to flow well and have the right syntax,\u201d Palmer says, \u201cbecause if it\u2019s too confusing people don\u2019t like it or ignore it. It has to flow really well.\u201d Leary reshot her most popular TikTok video \u2013 in which she pretends to DJ to the BBC News theme tune using household cleaning products \u2013 to improve her comic timing. \u201cI didn\u2019t instantly look at it and think, that\u2019s so funny,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo I refilmed it and the second time I took a swig of wine. That\u2019s the part of the video that people have found the funniest and commented on.\u201d Her instinct was correct: the video has received 151,000 likes and was played on the BBC. Another characteristic of TikTok that makes it well suited to the coronavirus lockdown: it is primarily an indoor platform. \u201cTikTok has always been about being 15 and staying at home,\u201d explains David Nichols of the University of Melbourne. \u201cThat\u2019s the accepted backdrop. And now everyone has to stay at home! So TikTok was made for coronavirus. Not deliberately, but it was.\u201d Unlike Instagram, where influencers swagger in front of a rotating backdrop of cocktail bars and tropical beaches, TikTokkers have always filmed themselves at home, in their bedrooms. \u201cInstagram is more for like going out and getting drunk or going on holiday,\u201d Palmer says. \u201cInstagram is superficial. But TikTok is just people posting stupid things and it\u2019s addictive, so you can keep going and going.\u201d Many of the young people I speak to say a variant of the same thing: TikTok used to be uncool, until suddenly it wasn\u2019t. Palmer tells me that his peers would often write \u201cHere as a joke\u201d on their TikTok bios, because they were embarrassed to be on the app. \u201cIf TikTok came up in conversation, everyone would say, \u2018Urgh, no one goes on that,\u2019\u201d says 16-year-old Libby Atkinson, from Manchester. Coronavirus supercharged a process that was already taking place: the process of TikTok becoming cool. \u201cAll my friends are coming on it because they have nothing to do,\u201d says Atkinson. As a result, more young people are jumping ship, from Instagram to TikTok. \u201cEveryone is moving away from Instagram to TikTok,\u201d says Ali. \u201cIt\u2019s going to become the No 1 app that everyone is using.\u201d This exodus of Gen Z from Instagram to TikTok mirrors the way millennials dumped Facebook in the 2010s. \u201cApps are generational in a half-decade sense,\u201d says Milner. \u201cIt makes perfect sense that Gen Z would have their own platform and it would be TikTok. If you look at Instagram and everyone on it is aged 25 and older, you want to find your own place.\u201d Even as we abscond from Instagram in droves, TikTok would not exist without it. Milner says: \u201cSomething unique about TikTok is how much it is centred on the image of the creator and their physical body\u2026 That wouldn\u2019t have happened had Instagram not made us much more used to having our face and bodies being on camera.\u201d Instagram sandblasted away our self-consciousness: it made us comfortable with being on camera. Where 16-year-olds go, adults follow. Celebrities including Lizzo, Britney Spears and Justin Bieber have posted TikTok videos during the lockdown. Non-celebrities are also flooding the app: Leary\u2019s mum has become hooked on the platform. \u201cShe keeps telling me that she can\u2019t stop scrolling,\u201d Leary laughs. \u201cTikTok has made it into the mainstream now,\u201d says Nichols. \u201cIt\u2019s part of popular culture. A year ago, I\u2019d have to explain what TikTok was to adults.\u201d As TikTok grows up, it loses its countercultural edge. \u201cI discovered it through my daughter,\u201d explains Wendy Paintain, a 54-year-old from Lichfield. \u201cShe was throwing herself around the living room, in front of her phone. I thought, what on earth is this rubbish? I downloaded it to have a look. And then I thought, actually, it\u2019s quite entertaining.\u201d She lets rip a loud laugh. Paintain is the creative brains behind the Grandad Joe TikTok account, which features lighthearted videos of her father, Joe, 87, who is self-isolating with her during the pandemic, dancing and making jokes. The Grandad Joe account blew up after Paintain posted a video of Joe looking forlorn in a ransacked supermarket. It went viral, amassing 42.5m views. Since then, Joe has been accepted into the TikTok top creators programme, been invited for TV appearances and has even started to make money from brand partnerships. \u201cHe\u2019s grown really quickly,\u201d says Paintain of her father\u2019s TikTok account. \u201cHe got 1.6 million followers in nine weeks. He\u2019s even got a blue tick!\u201d (An indicator of a verified celebrity.) She takes me upstairs to speak to Joe, who is having a nap. \u201cI can\u2019t understand why it\u2019s so popular, really,\u201d Joe tells me. \u201cI\u2019m an old fossil. I guess I\u2019m having my 15 minutes of fame. Did you know that I might be going on the telly?\u201d Alongside these older content creators, official bodies have been using TikTok to publish public health information during the coronavirus pandemic. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has uploaded TikTok videos urging people to stay at home; the World Health Organization has 1.4 million followers on the app. During the Easter bank holiday weekend, when many feared people may break lockdown rules, due to the warm weather, the UK government ran ads on TikTok, asking people to stay at home. Coronavirus trends float through the app, like driftwood. There\u2019s the #iwillsurvivechallenge (where users wash their hands to the Gloria Gaynor anthem), and the #stayathomechallenge, where NHS workers and TikTok creators urge users to stay indoors, sharing exercise routines or cooking tips to pass the time. (The #stayathomechallenge has more than 2.6bn views.) Bored in the House, the song by Tyga and up-and-coming rapper Curtis Roach, has become TikTok\u2019s unofficial coronavirus anthem: more than 2m videos have been created using the song, with more than 923 million views globally. All coronavirus content on TikTok has a banner linking to reputable news sources. The app\u2019s UK general manager, Richard Waterworth, says: \u201cWe [have] introduced a range of in-app features, notifications and safety measures specifically designed to elevate credible and accurate information from trusted sources.\u201d But preventing the spread of fake news can be difficult to enforce in practice: conspiracy theories linking 5G to coronavirus are easy to find. Healthcare workers have also turned to the app. \u201cTraditional TikTok was a dance platform,\u201d says NHS doctor and former Love Island contestant Alex George. The 29-year-old has 104,000 followers on TikTok, where he posts videos explaining how coronavirus is transmitted or the correct way to wash your hands. \u201cBut that\u2019s not true any more. People are engaging with health content.\u201d Coronavirus has helped TikTok to grow up. What was once a platform for uninhibited free play, detached from the cares and concerns of the outside world, has become outward facing. Although this is not the first time that TikTokkers have been civic-minded \u2013 during the 2019 Australian bushfires, users ridiculed Australian prime minister Scott Morrison\u2019s handling of the crisis and raised money for affected communities \u2013 coronavirus has pushed TikTok into a new prominence. TikTok itself has pledged \u20ac62m to support European healthcare workers and communities affected by the pandemic. George is hopeful that his videos will communicate key public health messages to a younger audience. \u201cYoung people don\u2019t engage with traditional media forms,\u201d he says, \u201cbut they might watch my TikTok videos and educate their grandparents about how to wash their hands properly.\u201d Sorcha Mackenzie joined TikTok long before coronavirus. She did so for the same reason many other people will be downloading it right now: because she was lonely. \u201cAt the time, I was pretty socially isolated,\u201d explains Mackenzie, a 28-year-old artist from Melbourne. \u201cI was running this gallery across town, in the docklands, and it\u2019s a pretty desolate area. Not many people come there. I would be there all day, until late at night, on my own every single day.\u201d She was rapidly hooked. \u201cIt made the world feel like a very big place,\u201d Mackenzie explains. \u201cYou feel interconnected.\u201d Mackenzie believes the new TikTok users are reaching out for the same thing she craved during her days in that abandoned Melbourne dockyard: a sense of community. \u201cIt makes perfect sense to me why TikTok has boomed and so many people have downloaded it at the moment,\u201d Mackenzie says. \u201cIt offers a salve to isolation.\u201d As the British public hunkers down at home, alone, in some cases literally returning to the bedrooms of its youth, TikTok connects us to an online community of people who are also muddling along as best as they can. \u201cIt feels like a safe place,\u201d says Atkinson. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re being judged.\u201d The sublime and the serious, the silly and the strange: TikTok is the perfect platform for these times. As the world changes, people who\u2019d never have dreamed of posting videos of themselves dancing in their pyjamas online or lip-syncing in their kitchen, think: why not? \u201cIt feels like such an uncomfortable, incredibly bizarre moment,\u201d says Mackenzie, \u201cand there\u2019s such a big shift in everything. People are forced to take stock of what is important. They lose that sense of ego or barrier of caring about what other people think about them.\u201d TikTok allows us to see others and be seen ourselves. It brings levity to otherwise dark and anxiety-filled days. It lets the air in. Layer by layer, the coronavirus pandemic has peeled away our braggadocio and our hubristic plans for the future and returned all of us to a childlike state. We sit at home, like children, and wait to be told what to do. And while we wait, we play online.",

      "body": "<p>Perhaps, the most surprising aspect of the British Covid-19 crisis is the extent to which the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments, and the English regions, have allowed strategy to be decided by Westminster.</p> <p>Health and social care are devolved, and this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/coronavirus-uk-how-many-confirmed-cases-are-there-in-my-area\">national epidemic </a>is not homogenous. It is made up of hundreds, if not thousands, of outbreaks around the country, each at a different stage . England had its first confirmed case on 30 January, Wales on 28 February and Scotland on 1 March. Some areas \u2013 such as Rutland, Hartlepool, Blackpool, Isle of Wight, Tyneside, Durham, Orkney, Western Isles \u2013 had no reported cases until late March, and some even now have relatively few cases.</p> <p>Contact tracing and testing, case finding, isolation and quarantine are classic public health measures for controlling communicable diseases. They require local teams on the ground, meticulously tracking cases and contacts to eliminate the reservoirs of infection. This approach is recommended by the WHO at all stages of the epidemic. It was painstakingly adopted in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/mass-testing-alerts-and-big-fines-the-strategies-used-in-asia-to-slow-coronavirus\">China, Singapore and Taiwan</a>, with a high percentage of close contacts identified and many housed in hotels. Germany has traced contacts throughout. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/leaked-cabinet-office-briefing-on-uk-pandemic-threat-the-key-points\">leaked UK national risk register</a> proposes it.</p> <p>Yet <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england\">Public Health England,</a> the agency responsible for communicable disease control in England, stopped contact tracing on 12 March, having reportedly only contacted 3,500 people, of whom about 105 were found to be positive. It\u2019s now about to resume. But why was it stopped, and how will it be resumed?</p> <p>We\u2019ve not seen an official explanation for its stopping. But lack of both resources and effectiveness are usually mentioned. Resources are essential, just as they have been for increasing acute care capacity, and the potential pool of contact tracers is vast. There are thousands of environmental health officers in local authorities and other sectors who have the necessary skills and experience. Singapore used its army. Teachers and barristers have volunteered in Ireland. Centralising control and management of the pandemic through NHS 111 has also left 7,500 GP practices underused, and the potential for real-time knowledge of new cases, results of swab tests and insight into the geography of spread has been lost. Yes, it\u2019s true that contact tracing is insufficient, but that\u2019s not the same as ineffective. It should have been supplemented, not replaced. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-under-control-in-germany-as-some-countries-plan-to-relax-lockdowns\">Look at Germany.</a></p> <p>We think there are more fundamental reasons.

      "bodyText": "Perhaps, the most surprising aspect of the British Covid-19 crisis is the extent to which the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments, and the English regions, have allowed strategy to be decided by Westminster. Health and social care are devolved, and this national epidemic is not homogenous. It is made up of hundreds, if not thousands, of outbreaks around the country, each at a different stage . England had its first confirmed case on 30 January, Wales on 28 February and Scotland on 1 March. Some areas \u2013 such as Rutland, Hartlepool, Blackpool, Isle of Wight, Tyneside, Durham, Orkney, Western Isles \u2013 had no reported cases until late March, and some even now have relatively few cases. Contact tracing and testing, case finding, isolation and quarantine are classic public health measures for controlling communicable diseases. They require local teams on the ground, meticulously tracking cases and contacts to eliminate the reservoirs of infection. This approach is recommended by the WHO at all stages of the epidemic. It was painstakingly adopted in China, Singapore and Taiwan, with a high percentage of close contacts identified and many housed in hotels. Germany has traced contacts throughout. The leaked UK national risk register proposes it. Yet Public Health England, the agency responsible for communicable disease control in England, stopped contact tracing on 12 March, having reportedly only contacted 3,500 people, of whom about 105 were found to be positive. It\u2019s now about to resume. But why was it stopped, and how will it be resumed? We\u2019ve not seen an official explanation for its stopping. But lack of both resources and effectiveness are usually mentioned. Resources are essential, just as they have been for increasing acute care capacity, and the potential pool of contact tracers is vast. There are thousands of environmental health officers in local authorities and other sectors who have the necessary skills and experience. Singapore used its army. Teachers and barristers have volunteered in Ireland. Centralising control and management of the pandemic through NHS 111 has also left 7,500 GP practices underused, and the potential for real-time knowledge of new cases, results of swab tests and insight into the geography of spread has been lost. Yes, it\u2019s true that contact tracing is insufficient, but that\u2019s not the same as ineffective. It should have been supplemented, not replaced. Look at Germany. We think there are more fundamental reasons. The system of local communicable disease control was established in the 19th century. After the NHS was set up in 1948, it was supported in England and Wales by national, regional and more than 40 local public health laboratories. But since local medical officers of health were abolished in 1974 \u2013 replaced by community physicians at different levels of the NHS \u2013 the system has been gradually but relentlessly eroded, fragmented and centralised. Communicable disease control was centralised in the Health Protection Agency in 2003, and local public health laboratories transferred to NHS hospitals. Public health was then carved out of the NHS in England in the 2012 Health and Social Care Act, which abolished local area health bodies, created Public Health England to fulfil the government\u2019s duty to protect the public from disease and charged local authorities with improving public health \u2013 but with limited proactive scope for infectious disease control and woefully inadequate resources. Then came austerity. Local authorities suffered a 49.1% real terms reduction in central government funding from 2010 to 2018. Numbers of community control teams and consultants in communicable disease control have decreased. PHE made \u201csavings\u201d of \u00a3500m over five years in the name of \u201cefficiency\u201d and now has nine regional \u201chubs\u201d serving 343 English local authority areas. With further waves of the epidemic likely, resumption of contact tracing is critical. Each of the four nations needs to institute scores of locally led, nationally coordinated and funded teams to trace, find and test contacts. Caernarfon isn\u2019t Cardiff, Gairloch isn\u2019t Glasgow, London isn\u2019t Lulworth. Teams in England and Northern Ireland would be based in local authorities; in Wales and Scotland they would be in local health boards. Their composition should be locally determined, drawing on a range of expertise, especially among directors of public health, field epidemiologists, environmental health officers, GPs, local NHS laboratories, NHS 111 and test centres, plus volunteers if required. Widely used apps with robust data protection could play a supportive, but not framing, role. In addition, the apparently strategy-free plans for 50 mass drive-in test centres need to be decisively directed to support local contact tracing, as well as strategically targeting the most at-risk groups. We would expect rigorous implementation of these measures now to make an overdue but significant contribution to controlling the epidemic.

      "bodyText": "There are Zooms for pub quizzes, Zooms for dinner parties, Zooms for work meetings and now there is a Zoom for sitting together and not talking at all. Behold, the silent Zoom! On paper, the practice of logging on to a video-conferencing site to sit with strangers for an hour without communicating may hold limited appeal. In practice, silent Zooms have become a lifeline in lockdown for users trying to focus on writing, reading, meditation and more. Author Anne Penketh has been retreating to \u201ca virtual monastic retreat\u201d for an hour every day to work on her novel. Initially, she struggled to understand the concept: what would be the point of Zoom without conversation? Finding silence to write in was not a problem for her, so Penketh was sceptical about what would make silence so productive in a potentially awkward group setting. She became a convert from the very first session. \u201c[My friend] Carola said: try to imagine it as working in a library, and now I\u2019m completely hooked,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThree of us continued our silent Zoom sessions over the weekend as they\u2019ve proved so productive for us all.\u201d Anecdotally, concentration seems more difficult to harness in corona times; research shows that, during periods of stress, we see significant decline in our ability to hold information and focus. But having accountability partners is a proven way to boost success, be it in weight loss or curbing an alcohol addiction. The difference with silent Zooms is that the accountability partners are often strangers, and always silent. Penketh says: \u201cAs soon as I call up my Word document, it masks the other Zoomers, but I can look at them at any time, with their heads bowed over their laptops. Mercifully, there\u2019s no sharing or reading aloud the results of our labour.\u201d Focusmate, which uses the same principle online and claims its virtual co-working method could \u201cboost productivity by 200-300%\u201d, has been targeting procrastinators since it launched in 2016.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump had been intending to run a re-election campaign based on a strong economy and a socialist opponent. Both have vanished in the past month. But the US president still has his ultimate weapon: xenophobia. Trump this week announced in a late-night tweet that he would \u201ctemporarily suspend immigration\u201d into America. Two days later, when he signed an executive order, it only applied to people seeking green cards to move to the country permanently, not to temporary workers, and there were plenty of loopholes. But by then the headlines had been written, the outrage expressed and the objective achieved: Trump was cracking down on immigration again because, he claimed, he was putting America and its workers first. The exercise was arguably less about policy than politics. A nativist, populist message helped him win the presidency in 2016. He tried it again in the 2018 midterm elections for Congress with mixed results. Now, with his handling of a deadly pandemic under scrutiny and the economy in freefall, critics say he is ready to bet the White House on his ability to stir nationalist and racist sentiment with little subtlety. \u201cThis is a president who doesn\u2019t use the dog whistle of Republicans in the past, and even Democrats in the past who used dog whistle politics to talk about race in code,\u201d said Juan Cartagena, president and general counsel of Latino Justice, a civil rights organisation. \u201cThis guy talks about it openly. Under normal circumstances he would have been a one-term president, but his base is pretty loyal and we\u2019re still talking about a country that barely comes out in large turnout numbers.\u201d Apart from antipathy towards globalised trade, Trump is said to be a man of few core political beliefs and little ideology. But when he descended an escalator at Trump Tower in New York in June 2015 to declare his long-shot candidacy for president, he started as he meant to go on. Mexico, he complained, was not sending its best people across the border. \u201cThey\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists.\u201d Trump also announced his signature issue: \u201cI would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I\u2019ll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.\u201d There followed an incendiary, taboo-busting election campaign in which \u201cBuild that wall!\u201d became a familiar chant at Trump rallies, where he railed against the presidency of Barack Obama and threw red meat to his base. He lashed out at a judge of Mexican ancestry and a Muslim whose son died fighting for the US in Iraq. He threatened to ban Muslims from the country. He promised \u201cAmerica first\u201d. And he won. Two years later, campaigning on behalf of senators and representatives, Trump used rallies to stoke fears that \u201ccaravans\u201d of undocumented immigrants from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were set to pour into the US from Mexico. To the frustration of Republicans who wanted him to focus on economic achievements, he used vivid language to demonise criminal gangs and human traffickers and put victims\u2019 families on public display. This time, the strategy was only partially successful: Republicans expanded their majority in the Senate but lost 40 seats in the House of Representatives, where the new Democratic majority went on to impeach Trump. Early in 2020, the Trump re-election campaign appeared to be built on firm foundations. There were economic talking points \u2013 unemployment at its lowest for half a century, the stock market at record highs \u2013 even if it did not always feel that way on the ground. Meanwhile, Senator Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist, was leading the Democratic presidential primary race, prompting Trump and allies to warn darkly of the radical left. These scripts have been torn up. The coronavirus pandemic has killed about 50,000 Americans and is likely to surpass US losses in the entire Vietnam war. Since the outbreak also put the economy into a coma: at least 26 million people have requested unemployment benefits, wiping out all the job gains since the great recession of 2008. Rick Wilson, a political strategist and author of Running Against the Devil, an analysis of how the 2020 election could play out, said: \u201cThe predicates of Donald Trump\u2019s campaign were fundamentally: \u2018The economy is great and I made the economy great and also, by the way, this is my great economy. Have you noticed my great economy?\u2019 That\u2019s gone. If you claim you have sole control and credit for something, then when it goes wrong, the shoe gets placed on the other foot rather quickly, and it has.\u201d In the Democratic primary, meanwhile, Sanders quickly fell away against former vice-president Joe Biden, a moderate who served under Obama and will be much harder to caricature as a socialist menace. Short of ammunition, his record in tatters, Trump can still fall back on the politics of division and made-for-TV partisan outrage.

His party made him leader because they thought he was a lucky mascot, he was their best communicator and they were desperate for someone to cheer them up after the mirthless agonies of the May years. I lost count of the Tory MPs who voted for him saying: \u201cBoris is a terrible man, but he will be great fun.\u201d The voters confirmed him as prime minister not because they thought he had the qualities necessary to handle a pandemic.

A raffish private life and a rascally public one magnified \u201cbrand Boris\u201d in the mind of both his colleagues and the public. He became one of those rare politicians who is referred to by their first names. Before he was struck down by the coronavirus, he had thought himself unusually robust. Getting to the top of the greasy pole despite his many career car crashes was taken as further evidence of his indestructibility. Friends report that he used to view illness in others not as a misfortune but as a sign of personal weakness.</p> <p>I dwell on these character traits because they have made a material difference to the government\u2019s response to the epidemic and are essential to understanding many of its mistakes. In the early period of the crisis, he was conscious that he needed to get more serious, but only patchily successful at being so. He oscillated between straining for a pseudo-Churchillian gravitas and sounding blithe with occasional lapses back into clowning. In early March, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/how-coronavirus-advice-from-boris-johnson-has-changed\">casually declared</a> that he had visited a hospital with coronavirus patients \u201cand I shook hands with everybody\u201d. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His party made him leader because they thought he was a lucky mascot</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He used the comedy phrase \u201csquashing the sombrero\u201d to describe the effort to flatten the peak of infection.

It is true that the crisis committee has not always been led by prime ministers in the past; it is equally true that a prime minister who was fully alert to the scale of the menace would have insisted on chairing those meetings.</p> <p>There is a gathering consensus that he ought to have been quicker to order a lockdown. It now seems incredible that, even after the government accepted that Britain faced \u201cthe worst public health crisis in a generation\u201d, pubs and gyms remained open while many thousands of people were permitted to mingle at football matches, racecourses and pop concerts. The personality of the prime minister was not the only factor in play, but it was a significant one. This is a man who doesn\u2019t like rules and much of his biography involves the breaking of them. Overestimating how many of his fellow Britons think as he does, all his basic instincts were repelled by the idea of a lockdown and he reckoned there would be a rebellion against it. Officials and colleagues also report that he was reluctant to accept that the triumphant story he had composed in his head about his premiership was going to be rewritten by a microbe. You will recall how he would ridicule opponents of Brexit as \u201cthe doomsters and the gloomsters\u201d. He couldn\u2019t resist a similar boosterism when it came to the disease. In mid-March, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/how-coronavirus-advice-from-boris-johnson-has-changed\">breezily proclaimed</a> that \u201cwe can send coronavirus packing\u201d before suggesting that \u201cwe can turn the tide within the next 12 weeks\u201d, an assertion that his scientific advisers conspicuously declined to agree with. </p> <p>Even when he did finally announce a lockdown, it was with obvious reluctance as he lamented \u201ctaking away the ancient and inalienable right of every freeborn Englishman to go to the pub\u201d.</p> <p>He did then get much crisper in his communications with the nation. One thing that can be said for Mr Johnson and the team around him at Number 10 is that they have a talent for crafting strong and simple messages, skills with the demotic that were honed during the Brexit referendum and the 2019 election. The frontman for \u201cTake Back Control\u201d and \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d now bashed into the public consciousness \u201cStay at Home\u201d, \u201cProtect the NHS\u201d and \u201cSave Lives\u201d.</p> <p>The video he released after his discharge from hospital was his most effective public performance of the crisis to date. There was dramatic revelation about his personal ordeal: \u201cIt could have gone either way\u201d. The thanks expressed to the NHS \u2013 \u201cthe best of us\u201d \u2013 gave every appearance of being heartfelt. And he used the opportunity to again drill home the government\u2019s essential messages on social distancing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a gathering consensus that he ought to have been quicker to order a lockdown</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This has worked. Public cooperation with the lockdown has been much more comprehensive than ministers anticipated. Fears that the NHS would be overwhelmed by coronavirus victims have not, so far, been realised.</p> <p>Much of the rest of the picture remains grim. The official fatality rate is now around 20,000 and the real one is higher. The toll on the economy becomes more savage by the day. Some Tories are hoping that their leader will return to Downing Street wearing his sunny face. \u201cWe need him back to cheer us all up,\u201d says one senior Conservative. That wish is way too premature. The next phase of this crisis will bring with it exceptionally hard decisions, ones that have been waiting on his reappearance because no one was properly empowered to substitute for him during his absence. These choices are too fiendish to be hidden behind a deceiving mask of bogus optimism.</p> <p>The arguments boiling up within the cabinet about rival versions of an \u201cexit strategy\u201d cannot be contained behind closed doors for any longer. The prime minister faces a host of complicated choices about when and how to ease the lockdown that all add up to one giant decision. Is the aim to maximise the repression of the disease at an ever-escalating cost to the economy and with rising deaths from other causes? Or does he choose to experiment with a more permissive relaxation of the restrictions at the risk of a resurgence in infection, leading to the much-dreaded second wave? To magnify the challenge, the scientists are candid that there is much that they still do not fully comprehend about the virus.</p> <p>There are no easy outcomes here, none that can be compressed into simple three-word slogans. All paths are perilous and the decision about which to take will have to be made without completely reliable information.</p> <p>Some leaders are trying to navigate their way through this hellish maze by treating their citizens like adults and levelling with them about the uncertainties and the competing risks. By doing so, they hope to garner public consent and understanding.</p> <p>Angela Merkel is the standout example of this type of leadership in Europe. True leadership is not about concealing the hard nature of the choices confronting the nation. True leadership requires honesty about them.</p> <p>One of the first things Boris Johnson has to decide when he returns to Number 10 is whether to start being frank with the country about the horribly difficult decisions that lie before us. His personal experience with the disease will guarantee him an audience, but the skills required for leading this conversation are not those of the entertainer.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

      "body": "<p>When eventually the coronavirus crisis begins to recede and we return to an approximation of normality \u2013 no matter how socially distanced or how much handwashing it involves \u2013 we can expect some kind of international initiative to prevent, or at least limit, the spread of future lethal viruses. As a species we are pretty good at learning from recent experience. It\u2019s what\u2019s known as the availability heuristic \u2013 the tendency to estimate the likelihood of an event based on our ability to recall examples.</p> <p>But as the moral philosopher <a href=\"http://www.tobyord.com/\">Toby Ord</a> argues in his new book, <em><a href=\"http://www.tobyord.com/book\">The Precipice</a></em>, we are much less adept at anticipating potential catastrophes that have no precedent in living memory. \u201cEven when experts estimate a significant probability for an unprecedented event,\u201d he writes, \u201cwe have great difficulty believing it until we see it.\u201d</p> <p>This was precisely the problem with the coronavirus. Many informed scientists predicted that a global epidemic was almost certain to break out at some point in the near future. Aside from the warnings of legions of virologists and epidemiologists, the Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, gave a widely disseminated Ted Talk in 2015 in which he detailed the threat of a killer virus. For a while now, a pandemic has been one of the two most prominent catastrophic threats in the government\u2019s risk register (the other is a massive cyberattack).</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_the_next_outbreak_we_re_not_ready\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"260\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://embed.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_the_next_outbreak_we_re_not_ready\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Bill Gates\u2019s 2015 Ted talk outlined the pandemic threat.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>But if something hasn\u2019t yet happened, there is a deep-seated temptation to act as if it\u2019s not going to happen. If that is true of an event, like this pandemic, that will kill only a tiny fraction of the world\u2019s population, it\u2019s even more the case for what are known as existential threats. There are two definitions of existential threat, though they often amount to the same thing. One is something that will bring a total end to humanity, remove us as a species from this planet or any other. The other, only slightly less troubling, is something that leads to an irrevocable collapse of civilisation, reducing surviving humanity to a prehistoric state of existence.</p> <p>An Australian based at Oxford\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\">Future of Humanity Institute</a>, Ord is one of a tiny number of academics working in the field of existential risk assessment. It\u2019s a discipline that takes in everything from stellar explosions right down to rogue microbes, from supervolcanoes to artificial superintelligence.</p> <p>Ord works through each potential threat and examines the likelihood of it occurring in the next century. For example, the probability of a supernova causing a catastrophe on Earth he estimates to be less than one in 50m. Even adding all the naturally occurring risks together (which includes naturally occurring viruses), Ord contends that they do not amount to the existential risk presented individually by nuclear war or global heating.</p> <p>Most of the time, the general public, governments and other academics are largely content to neglect most of these risks. Few of us, after all, enjoy contemplating the apocalypse.</p> <p>In any case, governments, as former Conservative minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/23/oliver-letwin-internet-of-things-tipping-point-apocalypse-how-interview\">Oliver Letwin</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/23/oliver-letwin-internet-of-things-tipping-point-apocalypse-how-interview\"> reminds us in his recent book </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/23/oliver-letwin-internet-of-things-tipping-point-apocalypse-how-interview\">Apocalypse </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/23/oliver-letwin-internet-of-things-tipping-point-apocalypse-how-interview\">How?</a></em>, are usually preoccupied with more pressing issues than humanity\u2019s demise. Everyday problems like trade agreements demand urgent attention, whereas hypothetical future ones such as being taken over by machines can always be left for tomorrow.</p> <p>But given that we\u2019re living through a global pandemic, now is perhaps an opportune moment to think about what can be done to avoid a future cataclysm. According to Ord, the period we inhabit is a critical moment in the history of humanity. Not only are there the potentially disastrous effects of global heating but in the nuclear age we also possess the power to destroy ourselves in a flash \u2013 or to at least leave the question of civilisation\u2019s survival in the balance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"66f2459dfa757a880f139e1002663ec1a75f02b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/66f2459dfa757a880f139e1002663ec1a75f02b9/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A health worker waits to accept an Ebola patient in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A health worker waits to accept an Ebola patient in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 2018.

If we make the wrong ones, he maintains that we could well go the way of the dodo and the dinosaurs, exiting the planet for good.</p> <p>When I speak to Ord over Skype I remind him of the unsettling odds he awards humanity in this life-and-death struggle between our power and our wisdom. \u201cGiven everything I know,\u201d he writes, \u201cI put the existential risk this century at around one in six.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, the 21st century is effectively one giant game of Russian roulette. Many people will recoil from such a grim prediction, while for others it will fuel the anxiety that is already rife in society.</p> <p>He agrees but says that he has tried to present his modelling in as calm and rational a fashion as possible, making sure to take into account all the evidence that suggests the risks are not large. One in six is his best estimate, factoring in that we make a \u201cdecent stab\u201d at dealing with the threat of our destruction.</p> <p>If we really put our minds to it and mount a response equal to the threat, the odds, he says, come down to something more like 100-1 for our extinction. But, equally, if we carry on ignoring the threat represented by advances in areas like biotech and artificial intelligence, then the risk, he says, \u201cwould be more like one in three\u201d.</p> <p>Martin Rees, the cosmologist and former president of the Royal Society, co-founded the <a href=\"https://www.cser.ac.uk/\">Centre for the Study of Existential Risk</a> in Cambridge.

These are ideal conditions for sabotage and global breakdown. As he writes, ominously: \u201cThe time has come to recognise that more and more parts of our lives \u2013 of society itself \u2013 depend on fewer and fewer, more integrated networks.\u201d</p> <p>Complex global networks certainly increase our vulnerability to viral pandemics and cyberattacks, but neither of those outcomes qualify as a serious existential risk in Ord\u2019s book. The pandemics he is concerned about are not of the kind that break out in the wet markets of Wuhan, but rather those engineered in biological laboratories.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13ee69bd2fffeb5afd1f2b1cc6d058e3597887bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13ee69bd2fffeb5afd1f2b1cc6d058e3597887bb/0_0_5378_3585/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tewkesbury Abbey in Gloucestershire surrounded by floodwater in February this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tewkesbury Abbey in Gloucestershire surrounded by floodwater in February this year. The increased frequency of floods is thought to be connected to global heating.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although Ord draws a distinction between natural and anthropogenic (human-made) risks, he argues that this line is rather blurry when it comes to pathogens, because their proliferation has been significantly increased by human activity such as farming, transport, complex trade links and our congregation in dense cities.</p> <p>Yet like so many aspects of existential threat, the idea of an engineered pathogen seems too sci-fi, too far-fetched, to grab our attention for long. The international body charged with policing bioweapons is the Biological Weapons Convention. Its annual budget is just \u20ac1.4m (\u00a31.2m). As Ord points out with due derision, that sum is less than the turnover of the average McDonald\u2019s restaurant.</p> <p>If that\u2019s food for thought, Ord has another gastronomic comparison that\u2019s even harder to swallow. While he\u2019s not sure exactly how much the world invests in measuring existential risk, he\u2019s confident, he writes, that we spend \u201cmore on ice-cream every year than on ensuring that the technologies we develop don\u2019t destroy us\u201d.</p> <p>Ord insists that he is not a pessimist. There are constructive measures to be taken. Humanity, he says, is in its adolescence, and like a teenager that has the physical strength of an adult but lacks foresight and patience, we are a danger to ourselves until we mature. He recommends that, in the meantime, we slow the pace of technological development so as to allow our understanding of its implications to catch up and to build a more advanced moral appreciation of our plight.</p> <p>He is, after all, a moral philosopher. This is why he argues that it\u2019s vital that, if humanity is to survive, we need a much larger frame of reference for what is right and good. At the moment we hugely undervalue the future, and have little moral grasp of how our actions may affect the thousands of generations that could \u2013 or alternatively, might not \u2013 come after us.</p> <p>Our descendants, he says, are in the position of colonised peoples: they\u2019re politically disenfranchised, with no say in the decisions being made that will directly affect them or stop them from existing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Given everything I know, I put the existential risk this century at around one in six</p> <footer> <cite>Toby Ord</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cJust because they can\u2019t vote,\u201d he says, \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t be represented.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, there are also concrete issues to address such as global heating and environmental depredation. Ord acknowledges that climate change may lead to \u201ca global calamity of unprecedented scale\u201d, but he\u2019s not convinced that it represents an actual existential risk to humanity (or civilisation). That\u2019s not to say that it isn\u2019t an urgent concern: only that our survival isn\u2019t yet on the line.</p> <p>Perhaps the biggest immediate threat is the continued abundance of nuclear weapons. Since the end of the cold war, the arms race has been reversed and the number of active warheads cut from more than 70,000 in the 1980s to about 3,750 today. Start (the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), which was instrumental in bringing about the decrease, is due to lapse next year. \u201cFrom what I hear at the moment,\u201d says Ord, \u201cthe Russians and Americans have no plan to renew it, which is insane.\u201d</p> <p>Sooner or later all questions of existential risk come down to a global understanding and agreements. That\u2019s problematic, because while our economic systems are international, our political systems remain almost entirely national or federal. Problems that affect everyone are consequently owned by no one in particular. If humanity is to step back from the precipice, it will have to learn how to recognise its common bonds as greater than its differences.</p> <p>There are many predictions currently being made about how the world might be changed by the coronavirus.

The pandemic may not engender deeper international cooperation and a keener appreciation of the fact that we are, so to speak, all in it together. Ultimately, though, we will have to arrive at that kind of unity if we\u2019re to avoid far greater afflictions in the future.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>The Precipice</em> by Toby Ord is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a325).

      "body": "<p>Philippe Sands, 59, is a professor of law at University College London and a barrister. He appears regularly before the international courts: last year he acted for the prosecution in the Rohingya genocide case at The Hague. His memoir, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/22/east-west-street-origin-genocide-crimes-against-humanity-philippe-sands-review\">East West Street</a></em>, won the 2016 Baillie Gifford prize. His new book, <em>The Ratline</em>, is about an Austrian Nazi, Otto von W\u00e4chter, and his wife, Charlotte, who helped him to evade justice when he went on the run in 1945.</p> <p><strong>How is</strong><strong> </strong><em><strong>The Ratline</strong></em><strong> connected to </strong><em><strong>East West Street</strong></em><strong>?<br></strong>In 2010 I went to Lviv, in Ukraine, to give a lecture. That led to <em>East West Street</em>. It was supposed to be about my grandfather, Leon, who grew up there, and Hersch Lauterpacht and Rafael Lemkin [also from Lviv], the jurists who put the terms \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d and \u201cgenocide\u201d into international law. But then Hans Frank came into it: the governor of German-occupied Poland, who was hanged at Nuremberg. Following a speech he gave in Lviv, the Jews of the region known as Galicia [Lviv was its capital] were exterminated. I came across a book by Frank\u2019s son, Niklas. We met and became friends, and he introduced me to Horst, the son of Otto von W\u00e4chter, who was the Nazi governor of Lviv from 1942-1944 and Frank\u2019s deputy. Niklas hates his father; Horst doesn\u2019t. I made a documentary about them, then<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06lh2b5\"> a podcast</a> about Otto, and now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2020/apr/18/i-was-a-nazi-boy-then-everything-was-gone-philippe-sands-the-ratline-audio-extract\">this book</a>.</p> <p><em><strong>The Ratline</strong></em><strong> is very different from </strong><em><strong>East West Street</strong></em><strong>, isn\u2019t it?

I\u2019m really fond of Horst, but he also upsets me [by defending Otto]. I would think: why am I putting myself through this? Then there\u2019s Charlotte. She fascinates me. She\u2019s a Nazi, but what she does for Otto is incredible; there\u2019s something almost beautiful about it.

I remember thinking it an interesting insight, but that these sorts of nudges were nowhere near as likely to transform the world as their enthusiastic proponent claimed.</p> <p>Lots of far more eminent people disagreed with me. Behavioural economics looks at how people make decisions in the real world \u2013 warts, irrational biases and all \u2013 and applies this to public policy. Its signature policy is set out in the 2008 book <em>Nudge</em>, by Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler. The central insight is that changing the way choices are presented to people can have a huge impact. Make saving for retirement or donating your organs an opt-out rather than opt-in and watch as people suddenly adopt more socially responsible behaviour. Coming just as the financial crisis hit, <em>Nudge</em> was perfectly timed to achieve maximum traction by offering politicians the chance to reap savings through low-cost policy. Sunstein was quickly appointed to a senior job in the Obama administration, while David Cameron set up the behavioural insights team, dubbed the \u201cnudge unit\u201d, led by psychologist turned policy wonk David Halpern.</p> <p>The nudge unit has since had a mixed track record: there have been some real successes on <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/867634/automatic-enrolment-evaluation-report-2019.pdf\">pensions</a> and <a href=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/voices/ongoing-impact-nudging-people-pay-their-taxes\">tax payments</a> but in other areas it\u2019s been a bit of a damp squib. So I was surprised when Halpern popped up to talk about the government\u2019s pandemic strategy in the press in early March. It was he who first publicly mentioned the idea of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/absolutely-wrong-how-uk-coronavirus-test-strategy-unravelled\">\u201cherd immunity\u201d</a> as part of an effective response to Covid-19 (the government has since denied this was ever the strategy). And it\u2019s clear from <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-11/keep-calm-and-wash-your-hands-britain-s-strategy-to-beat-virus\">the briefing</a> he gave journalists that he favoured delaying a lockdown because of the risk of \u201cbehavioural fatigue\u201d, the idea that people will stick with restrictions for only so long, making it better to save social distancing for when more people are infected. \u201cIf you go too early and tell people to take a week off work when they are very unlikely to have coronavirus, and then a couple of weeks later they have another cough, it\u2019s likely they\u2019ll say \u2018come on already\u2019,\u201d he told one reporter.</p> <p>Halpern is reportedly on Sage, the government\u2019s scientific advisory committee for emergencies, and he is also the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/dr-david-halpern-reappointed-as-the-what-works-national-adviser\">What Works national adviser</a>, responsible for helping it apply evidence to public policy. So one might expect there to be something substantial behind the idea of behavioural fatigue.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A report on applying behavioural insights to domestic abuse included not one survivor's voice</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But evidence presented to government by the Sage behavioural subcommittee on 4 March, representing the views of a wider group of experts, was non-committal on the behavioural impact of a lockdown, noting that <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/873726/04-spi-b-insights-on-combined-behavioural-and-social-interventions.pdf\">the empirical evidence</a> on behavioural interventions in a pandemic is limited. Shortly after Halpern\u2019s interviews, more than 600 behavioural economists wrote <a href=\"https://behavioralscientist.org/why-a-group-of-behavioural-scientists-penned-an-open-letter-to-the-uk-government-questioning-its-coronavirus-response-covid-19-social-distancing/\">a letter</a> questioning the evidence base for behavioural fatigue.</p> <p>Rightly so: a rapid <a href=\"https://www.esri.ie/publications/using-behavioral-science-to-help-fight-the-coronavirus\">evidence review</a> of behavioural science as it relates to pandemics only fleetingly refers to evidence that extending a lockdown might increase non-compliance, but this turns out to be a study about <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/335/7620/603\">extending deployment</a> in the armed forces. \u201cBehavioural fatigue is a nebulous concept,\u201d the review\u2019s authors <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/no-signs-of-lock-down-fatigue-in-ireland-yet-1.4218932\">later concluded</a> in the <em>Irish Times</em>.</p> <p>This is a <a href=\"https://jasoncollins.blog/2016/05/11/bad-behavioural-science-failures-bias-and-fairy-tales/\">common critique</a> of behavioural economics: some (not all) members of the discipline have a tendency to overclaim and overgeneralise, based on small studies carried out in a very different context, often on university students in academic settings. It\u2019s extraordinary that Halpern was briefing on what essentially looks like his opinion as if it were science. We won\u2019t know how influential it was in the government\u2019s decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/uk-government-coronavirus-science-who-advice\">delay lockdown</a> until a post-hoc inquiry, but there\u2019s no reason to suppose Boris Johnson wasn\u2019t listening to his \u201cwhat works\u201d adviser. \u201cThe behavioural psychologists say that if you don\u2019t shake somebody\u2019s hand, that sends an important message\u2026 [about] <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-11/keep-calm-and-wash-your-hands-britain-s-strategy-to-beat-virus\">washing your hands</a>,\u201d he said on 9 March.</p> <p>It\u2019s less extraordinary, though, when you understand that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/10/nudge-unit-pushed-way-private-sector-behavioural-insights-team\">Behavioural Insights Team</a> is a multimillion-pound profitable company, which pays Halpern, <a href=\"https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/08567792/filing-history/MzE1MjQwNjg4NWFkaXF6a2N4/document?format=pdf&amp;download=0\">who owns 7.5%</a> of its shares, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9d7ad4fa-3b82-11e5-8613-07d16aad2152\">a bigger salary than the prime minister</a>. Here lies the potential conflict of interest: someone who contributes to Sage also has a significant financial incentive to sell his wares.

And: \u201cWe make much of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/10/behavioural-economics-richard-thaler-nudge-nobel-prize-winner\">simplicity of our interventions</a>\u2026 but if properly implemented, they can have a powerful impact on even our biggest societal challenges.\u201d (It is worth noting that Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, says that one reason the composition of Sage has been kept private is to protect scientists from \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/revealed-dominic-cummings-on-secret-scientific-advisory-group-for-covid-19\">lobbying and other forms of unwanted influence</a> which may hinder their ability to give impartial advice\u201d.)</p> <p>This hubris has led some behavioural scientists to push their approach way beyond those realms such as consumer policy, where it has the potential to be most effective.

to make sure we can continue the success we have got.\u201d<br>The re-opening of schools remains a contentious issue between the federal and states and territory governments.</p> \n  <p>However, a

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ll leave things there for the night. Thanks for sticking with us. Stay safe. Let\u2019s take a look at the major developments today. The government sought to allay privacy fears as it released a new voluntary tracing app, Covidsafe, with the backing of the nation\u2019s major medical groups Queensland and WA both announced they will ease social distancing restrictions, allowing some outdoor recreational activities Another death was recorded in Tasmania, meaning the Apple Isle\u2019s death toll is now third behind NSW and Victoria Australia has now seen 6,711 cases and 83 deaths This lovely hashtag is trending this Sunday evening. The app is up and running. Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick has some thoughts about the app. For those with lingering questions about the Covidsafe app, my colleague Josh Taylor has updated his excellent explainer on the topic. At 6pm, you should be able to register your app, once you\u2019ve downloaded it from your app store of choice. The RACGP\u2019s president, Dr Harry Nespolon, has issued this statement urging people to download the app. The RACGP supports the Covid-19 tracing app and we urge all Australians to download it when it becomes available tonight. We understand that many Australians have perfectly valid privacy concerns and it\u2019s vital that government carefully manages how this app operates. The stakes are high and we need to get this right. In the interests of combating this pandemic it\u2019s essential that people take advantage of this app so that we can better track cases of Covid-19 and limit its spread in the community. We are all in this together, we all have a role to play in combating this once in a lifetime pandemic. Effective contact tracing is one of the most important steps in allowing us to eventually lift the restrictions currently being enforced in our communities. The Office of the Information Commissioner has issued this statement on the Covidsafe app. The Australian government today released the Covidsafe contact tracing app, a public health initiative to help combat the spread of Covid-19. Australian Information Commissioner and Privacy Commissioner Angelene Falk said that important safeguards have been put in place to protect personal information collected through the app so it can be used to help address this public health crisis. Commissioner Falk welcomed the public release of the Privacy Impact Assessment commissioned by the Department of Health, which considered the app\u2019s privacy impacts and made recommendations to improve privacy protections. \u2018The Privacy Impact Assessment has provided transparency and accountability for the use of personal information, and supports community confidence in the app,\u2019 Commissioner Falk said. \u2018It is positive that the government accepted the recommendations of the assessment and that important legal safeguards are in place, including the determination under the Biosecurity Act 2015 to further protect information collected by the app. \u2018This ensures that the app must be voluntary, and that personal information collected can only be used for purposes related to contact tracing. It also puts important deletion and time limitations in place.\u2019 Under the Australian Government Agencies Privacy Code, an agency must undertake a written Privacy Impact Assessment for projects involving new ways of handling personal information. \u2018My office has worked constructively to provide advice and guidance to Government as it considered the privacy issues through its Privacy Impact Assessment,\u2019 Commissioner Falk said. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) will have independent oversight of personal information handling by the app and the National Covidsafe Data Store. \u2018My office will watch the implementation of the contact tracing app closely. We can audit the system and investigate complaints from the public about privacy issues. \u2018We will also closely review the legislation that is intended to be introduced and monitor the implementation of the Privacy Impact Assessment recommendations.\u2019 A statement just in from Human Rights Law Centre, Digital Rights Watch and the Australia Institute. An alliance of digital rights groups has urged the Morrison government to fill in obvious gaps in the development of the tracing technology to give it its best chance of winning public trust. Today, the Morrison government released the Covidsafe tracing app, asking all Australians to download the technology which is designed to inform them of every person a user has been in contact with. The tracing app will only be effective if enough Australians feel confident downloading and using it, however the alliance believes that won\u2019t happen unless the Morrison government answers outstanding questions about the safety and privacy of Australians\u2019 information. Critical will be legally enforceable safeguards on the collection, storage, sharing and disposal of any personal information that is generated from the app, and a clear end date for when the tracing will stop and the data will be deleted. Ideally, the Morrison government would be looking at models that don\u2019t threaten Australians\u2019 freedom to go through life free from government surveillance. The government should have adopted a decentralised model for an app that keeps our information on our phones at all times. But given where we are: The government must publish the source code not only of the app, but for the entire system at the government\u2019s end (both state and federal); The government should provide for independent oversight and mandatory public reporting of all uses of the data; The government should, by legislation, eliminate the possibility of police and intelligence agencies using their anti-encryption powers, to use the app to access any information on a person\u2019s phone. Alice Drury, senior lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre, said: Designed properly, technology can see us innovate while protecting human rights. Our privacy does not need to be collateral damage. Australians deserve to have their privacy protected by laws passed by Parliament, that provide for independent oversight and mandatory public reporting of all uses of the data. Lizzie O\u2019Shea, Digital Rights Watch, said: The history of government take-up of technology is one of overreach and secrecy. The government needs to recognise that the only way of this app succeeding is to work with those organisations that care deeply about the rights of citizens. Peter Lewis, The Australia Institute\u2019s Centre for Responsible Technology, said: Australia\u2019s national response has succeeded because government has worked with all available experts to get the policy responses rights. These principles should also guide the deployment of technology to ensure that it has the very best chance of succeeding. Here is my colleague Amy Remeikis\u2019 news story about the launch of the Covidsafe app. There are already complaints from quite a few people that they can\u2019t register in the app. My understanding is that the government has said registrations will open at 6pm \u2013 however this certainly could have been more clearly emphasised. Here are some screenshots from the app. You can\u2019t register until 6pm. The Business Council of Australia says of the app: The more Australians who download the app, the safer we will all be and the more quickly we can begin to ease restrictions. I\u2019ll be downloading the app and I urge all Australians to do the same. Technology is such a big part of our everyday lives and Covidsafe will be an important way to help us safely get back to them. The app will help employers keep their staff, customers and suppliers safe and give us all confidence that it\u2019s safe to go back to work, go to the shops and get the country moving again. The press conference has now wrapped up. The government says the app will go live at 6pm, when people will be able to register. A few people have pointed out that the app is available only on the Australian versions of the Apple and Google Play stores. Meanwhile, see below. Greg Hunt is asked about reports the government is considering travel exemptions to allow the T-20 World Cup to continue. Hunt says he\u2019s not been involved in any discussion so can\u2019t comment. Murphy says the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee will later this week consider some proposals from major sporting codes to \u201cconsider what would be the parameters upon which the national cabinet may feel it is safe to let them recommence crowd three matches\u201d. \u201cThere is a long way to go. We have not seen the proposals yet.\u201d Murphy is asked about the Australian government\u2019s position on so-called \u201cimmunity passports\u201d. The WHO has warned against these, saying there is no conclusive evidence people cannot contract the virus more than once. He says: I would agree with the World Health Organisation \u2013 it is still too early to know whether antibodies detected by serology which is still in development do represent permanent lifelong immunity. We just do not know that. We know that some people have recovered and have continued to have detectable virus, we don\u2019t know what that means, nor if they are infectious. Hunt was also asked what would happen if people could be busted breaking social distancing laws through the app. Hunt is unequivocal on this: It cannot be used for any other purpose. It is prevented, by law, from being used for any other purpose and to use it for any other purpose is punishable with jail andI think that is a very important protection. May, in some ways, diminish what some might have wanted. But as a Cabinet we considered all of the possibilities and we said it was to have one job and one use, to protect Australians from the spread of coronavirus and it has no other purpose, nor is it legally able to be used for any other purpose. Hunt is asked about what reporter Samantha Maiden describes as some \u201cteething problems\u201d with the app. There have been suggestions, for example, that if you have too many apps open, or if your screen is locked, the strength of the Covidsafe app will be diminished. In relation to signal strength, essentially we encourage you to have it on, but if you have other items, if your phone is locked or if you have other apps running, unlike the original version which was put out in Singapore, because we had the benefit of seeing what happened there, Daniel and his colleagues have been able to work to ensure that that is not an issue in Australia. But where there are, like every app, additional strengthening which are developed to be able to improve the capacity with signal strength, we know that Apple, around the world, is working on that and we will provide those upgrades and updates as well. Hunt extolling the privacy safeguards, as he sees them: The safeguards that have been put in place are the strongest ever. Not even a court order can penetrate the law ... during the investigation of an alleged crime ... Brendan Murphy says he would define a \u201cgood uptake\u201d of the app as \u201cwell over half the people\u201d, and adds that he thinks \u201cAustralians will rise to the challenge\u201d. Greg Hunt is asked if it matters whether people use a fake name when they register on the app. He says: In terms of the first question, you can use a fake name. That is legally available. This is about making sure that anybody who has been in contact with somebody diagnosed can be notified to protect them. And we want to make sure that contact is there, so a name helps. Obviously it is better, I think, if it is exactly who you are, but above all else we want to be able to be in contact, for the state health officials to be in contact. While you\u2019re hearing (or reading) the government\u2019s line on the app, I might point you to this piece from my colleague Josh Taylor. Greg Hunt says the app is now available in the Google store and will be on the Apple store shortly. Annie Butler, of the nurses federation, concludes her prepared remarks with this pithy comment: The last thing I want to say is I am a registered nurse, not a technical expert, but my understanding is that this operates with a Bluetooth handshake and that is the only safe handshake we are allowed to have at the moment. Bartone on privacy issues: Privacy, technical and other practical issues need to be assured in the rollout and any challenges need to be anticipated and prevented. But the app is voluntary. The app can only be used for the purposes for which it was designed, for the Covid-19 contact tracing, to assist our contact traces in doing their diligent work. It can be deleted at any time by anyone who downloads the app and indeed the information will be deleted at the end of the Covid-19 period. That is an important part of the process. Alison McMillan, the Australian government\u2019s chief nursing and midwifery officer, Tony Bartone, who heads the Australian Medical Association, and Annie Butler, head of the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation, are also here to encourage people to download the app. Brendan Murphy on the app: The public health officials that I represent through AHPPC and broader advice have been very, very supportive of the app. that they have also been very, very keen to make sure that all of those protections that the minister has put in place means that no Australian should have any concerns about downloading this app. It is only for one purpose, to help contact tracing, if someone becomes positive, that is all it is for and all that will be used for, and it will be one of those things that if we have good uptake, really high uptake across the community, that will make me in a stronger position to convince the national cabinet that that is one of the elements of the elements about having the world\u2019s best public-health response system. Wrapping up his prepared remarks, he says: \u201cI will download and register tonight. I know that all my colleagues in the public health field will do that also.\u201d The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, says the app will contact the several thousand people in public health units who do contact tracing. That can be a very laborious, manual process. What the app does, it helps them with the process, automates that to some extent, and helps them get the numbers and helps people who may have forgotten who they have been in contact with. Hunt says they have gotten the agreement of the country\u2019s major medical groups for a statement encouraging people to download the Covidsafe app. He then plays a television commercial aimed at encouraging people to get the app. Hunt on the app and privacy: In terms of privacy, no person can access what is on the phone, no other person can access what is on your phone. It is also prohibited by law. I have already signed into law on behalf of the government a biosecurity act and determination which prevents access and ensures the data has to be kept on an Australian server. It cannot leave the country. It cannot be accessed by anybody other than a state public health official. It cannot be used for any purpose other than the provision of the data for the purposes of finding people with whom you have been in close contact with, and it is punishable by jail if there is a breach of that. There is no geolocation. There is no commonwealth access and it is stored in Australia and, importantly, it is deleted from your phone after 21 days. It is being assessed by the privacy commissioner and there are only four things required from the individual \u2013 your phone number, your name, your age range and your postcode. Greg Hunt in his own words explaining how the app works: Against that background, the Australian government, in partnership with the medical community, has established the Covidsafe app, and what it does is that it assists in the early alert and finding of people who may have been in contact with a person who is positive with a diagnosis. How does it work? Very simply. Download the app and subsequently register from 6pm today. You then have your app open and it provides a Bluetooth handshake and it sits on your phone in terms of the data, that is encrypted. No one has access to that, not even yourself, no commonwealth officials. If you are diagnosed then you already have voluntary consent for downloading the app but you are asked a second time. Only a state public health official can be given access to that data, and only after you have then consented for a second time. Your details of who you have been in contact with for more than 15 minutes, with less than 1.5m distance, will then be provided. Hunt says there have now been 5.4 million telehealth consultations. Turning to the cluster in north-west Tasmania, Hunt says: Secondly, our rapid response capability \u2013 in north-west Tasmania we have seen an example which is exactly what we would want of rapid response and containment: less than 1% increase per day over the last three days in Tasmania; 22 cases in Tasmania over the last seven days did it. They had an outbreak and they responded and they have contained. Hunt continues to discuss the figures: We have now had an average increase in case numbers of less than 1% for 15 consecutive days and an average increase in case numbers of less than half a per cent for seven consecutive days. All these things mean we are doing well as a nation, but we have not won yet. Hunt says: \u201cWhat we have seen is a sustained and consolidated and now extended flattening of the curve.\u201d He says there was 16 new cases to 6.30am today. That means there have been 6,711 cases and 83 deaths. In particular, however, I want to release this data. In the last seven days there have been 117 cases. This compares with the previous seven days, where there were 297 cases. Hunt gives an update on testing. Prior to coming to this room, the briefing from the National incidence centre is that there have been over 506,000 coronavirus tests completed in Australia \u2013 not just one of the highest rates in the world but, as the London School of hygiene and tropical medicine affirmed, their analysis is that it is the most accurate case ascertainment rate of the 83 countries they assessed across the world. Greg Hunt has started speaking in Canberra. He says the government is today launched the Covidsafe app. Hunt says the app is aimed at \u201cfinding those cases which may be undiagnosed in the community, helping people get early treatment, helping people have early diagnosis and to ensure that our doctors and nurses, our health workers, our families and friends are protected and that will save lives and protect lives\u201d. We\u2019re just waiting on a press conference with the health minister, Greg Hunt, and the chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, to launch the Covid-19 contact tracing app. We\u2019ll bring that to you live shortly. NSW Health today released a report showing there has been very limited transmission of Covid-19 within the state\u2019s schools. McGowan says the easing of restrictions brings WA in line with South Australia\u2019s current social distancing rules. He stresses that all public playgrounds, skate parks and outdoor gym equipment must remain closed. \u201cThe changes announced today are sensible and reasonable and are designed to provide some relief all Western Australians,\u201d McGowan says. \u201cThey are low-risk but there with a high social benefit.\u201d More from McGowan on the easing of social distancing rules. By increasing the gathering restriction to 10 people we have also attempted to trigger some economic activity in the housing sector. Currently home-opens can occur by appointment. From tomorrow, home-opens and display village openings will be permitted. This will be under strict controls, including appropriate record-keeping of everyone that enters the home, good hygiene practices, and in compliance with the 10-person rule. The WA premier Mark McGowan has announced the easing of social distancing restrictions, which will allow 10 people to gather indoors, as well as the resumption of non-contact recreational activities. \u201cEffective from tomorrow, that is Monday, April 27, based on health advice, indoor and outdoor non-work gatherings will be relaxed to allow up to 10 people maximum,\u201d he said. He said the resumption of non-contact recreational activities was for \u201cactivities like private picnics in the park, fishing, boating, hiking or camping\u201d. \u201cI stress this must only occur in compliance with travel restrictions and a 10 person rule.\u201d The Greens have issued a statement on the government\u2019s Covid-19 tracing app that will be introduced today. The government\u2019s shameful disregard for privacy continues with the release of its Covid-19 app. \u2018If the government wants people to use this app, they need to put protections in law beforehand,\u2019 Leader of the Australian Greens, Adam Bandt MP, said. \u2018People have very legitimate concerns about how the data will be used and where it will be stored. \u2018The reported storage of the data by a US company raises real concerns. When it comes to privacy, if there\u2019s one person I trust less than Peter Dutton, it\u2019s Donald Trump. \u2018We all want the lockdown to end, but something like this needs to be done properly because the stakes are too high. Once it\u2019s out, the genie can\u2019t be put back in the bottle.\u2019 Greens Digital Rights spokesperson Nick McKim said the government had a long and terrible track record of undermining privacy and IT blunders. \u2018This government has repeatedly failed to ensure the security of data it has collected, and has made an art form of deliberately releasing people\u2019s sensitive personal information to media outlets for political gain,\u2019 Senator McKim said. \u2018They should immediately release the source code and relevant legislation before rolling this out to the public. \u2018Peter Dutton has been dreaming of a surveillance state in Australia for years, and this app, without protections, takes him one step closer.\u2019 AAP has also filed this guide to Queensland new social distancing rules, which will be eased from Friday. WHEN: It starts 11.59pm Friday, so effectively people will be free to move around on Saturday onwards for recreational purposes. HOW FAR CAN I TRAVEL? Travel has been restricted to 50km from your place of residence to prevent mass movement of people between cities and towns. ARE SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES RELAXED? Definitely not. Social distancing of 1.5m and hygiene must be maintained and if it\u2019s not adhered to, stay-at-home restrictions could return. All other rules on gatherings, including limitations on the number of people who can visit a household, remain in place. CAN I CATCH UP WITH FRIENDS OR JUST FAMILY? Only members of the same household are permitted to gather in public, so it\u2019s not a chance to party in a park. If you\u2019re single, you may socialise with only one other person. WHAT CAN I DO? You\u2019re allowed to go for a drive for up to 50km for your home You\u2019re permitted to ride a motorbike, jetski or even spend time on a boat for pleasure Shopping for non-essential items is also allowed but it does not mean the business you are visiting will be allowed to open You can have a picnic with a family or visit a national park but be mindful toilet facilities and day use areas will NOT be open WHEN WILL THEY BE REVIEWED? The Queensland government will review Covid-19 restrictions again in a fortnight. AAP reports that another elderly man has died from coronavirus at the Mersey Community hospital in northern Tasmania, taking the state\u2019s toll to 11. Ten of these deaths have occurred in the state\u2019s north-west. Only NSW and Victoria have recorded more deaths from Covid-19 in Australia. The health minister, Sarah Courtney, announced the death of the man in his 90s on Sunday, following the death of another man at the hospital on Saturday. She also confirmed a health worker at the Mersey hospital in the Covid-19 positive ward as the latest confirmed case. A total of 208 cases have now been confirmed, while 123 have recovered. \u201cI\u2019d like to reassure other staff at that site that this gentleman has presented swiftly. He did only work within the Covid ward at that hospital,\u201d she told reporters. I\u2019m sure this comment wasn\u2019t aimed at anyone. Thanks to Ben Smee for his work today. I\u2019ll be with you into the evening. And yes, good call on the bleach. And this is where I leave you. Luke Henriques-Gomes is going to take the blog from here. Thanks very much for your time and, as always, please don\u2019t consume any bleach. Of course if you\u2019re Kerry Stokes, then you get to avoid hotel quarantine altogether. My colleague, Matilda Boseley, has an update on a man who became seriously ill while in hotel quarantine in Perth. From Matilda: The 71-year-old man who was placed in an induced coma after allegedly waiting up to nine hours for medical treatment in Perth hotel quarantine has begun the road to recovery. Ken Watson\u2019s wife Kathleen said he was taken out of his coma a week ago and no longer requires a ventilator to breathe. \u201cThey have got him off the oxygen, which is a really good step,\u201d Kathleen said. \u201cThe next step is to get him to a rehabilitation centre somewhere in Perth \u2026 we are originally from the NSW central coast so he needs to get well enough to get on a plane and get home.\u201d Kathleen was admitted to the hospital at the same time. She was released after a week and was returned to the hotel to complete her quarantine. Originally doctors suggested Ken may be in the coma for a number of months and were unsure if he would recover. You can read the Guardian\u2019s full report on the story here. Peter Dutton is the minister for home affairs, which means he looks after things like, say, whether big cruise ships (with potentially hundreds of coronavirus cases) are allowed to dock. He is not the minister for foreign affairs, which means he doesn\u2019t really have a role in the business of geopolitical posturing. And in completely unrelated news, here below is the latest yarn from AAP: Home affairs minister Peter Dutton is standing firm on the need for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus in China, even as the Asian giant accused Australia of playing \u201cpolitical games\u201d. Foreign minister Marise Payne raised the idea of an international inquiry a week ago, calling for greater transparency on how Covid-19 originated and how it was subsequently handled. \u201cWe want more transparency within the communist party of China in the way they have dealt with this virus issue,\u201d Mr Dutton told Sky News on Sunday. \u201cIf not just to understand how we can defeat this threat into the future when you have got these wildlife wet markets where the flu may have originated from.\u201d He said there needs to be reassurance globally this is not going to happen again in 12 months or two years time. \u201cWe need a level of reassurance that\u2019s not there at the moment,\u201d he said. But China has hit back, describing the independent review proposed by Australia as \u201cpolitical manoeuvring\u201d. \u201cAt such a critical juncture, it is highly irresponsible to resort to politically motivated suspicion and accusation,\u201d China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in a statement to various media outlets. \u201cWe advise the Australian side to put aside ideological bias and political games, focus on the welfare of the Australian people and global public health security, follow the international community\u2019s collective will for cooperation, and contribute to the global cooperation in fighting the virus, instead of doing things to the contrary.\u201d NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant says the new death in NSW is an 82-year-old male resident of the Newmarch House aged care facility. She also spoke about a worker at the Boddington aged care facility at Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains, who has been diagnosed with Covid-19. Chant said: In relation to the Boddington aged care facility, I would like to emphasise that the aged care worker did not work whilst she had any symptoms, but as a precaution, we go back a period of time in case there can be transmission before the onset of symptoms. Pleasingly, the 20 residents in the wing where this healthcare worker worked have all been screened, whether they had symptoms or not. And those test results have come back negative. And we\u2019re also undertaking extensive testing of all of the healthcare staff and should have those results available later today. And I\u2019d like to express my appreciation for the prompt response from Boddington and their extensive cooperation in this investigation. But as I wanted to indicate, there\u2019s no evidence of an outbreak at that facility at this time, but we\u2019ll certainly keep you updated on that. Brad Hazzard says a medical practitioner at Nepean hospital is among the new cases in NSW. There has been a medical practitioner at Nepean hospital who has also tested positive. Fortunately, she had not been [at work] in the relevant period, and most of you would now know that for vulnerable populations, we go back at least 48 hours from the time that symptoms arise. And that particular medical practitioner had no face-to-face patient work, no clinical work, in that preceding 48 hours. So she does have, or did have, two contacts that we know of at the hospital in the relevant period. I want to point out that that particular doctor also worked a shift at the Sydney Adventist hospital, but again in a non-clinical position. So wasn\u2019t working with patients, so that\u2019s also very good news. And that means that we\u2019ve had eight staff who have been in isolation in that at the Sydney Adventist hospital. So no patients but staff. And it was a mixture of medical and non-medical staff. They\u2019re all doing extremely well. There\u2019s no indication at this stage that they\u2019re ill, so that\u2019s a very positive outcome. And NSW health minister Brad Hazzard confirms there has been another death in NSW as well. AAP reports that Victoria has recorded one new death from coronavirus overnight. Health minister Jenny Mikakos says a man in his 90s died in hospital, bringing the state\u2019s total deaths to 17. The state\u2019s total coronavirus cases now stand at 1,349, an increase of three since Saturday, one of which is a patient at a private psychiatric facility that has had a cluster of infections. Currently in Victoria there are 21 people in hospital, including 10 patients in intensive care. A further 1,265 people have recovered and more than 101,000 tests have been completed. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, is up. He says there are eight new coronavirus cases in the state. The inimitable Amy Remeikis reports this morning on the upcoming launch of the federal government\u2019s coronavirus tracing app. Kim Jong-un watch: The whole \u201cwhere is Kim Jong-un?\u201d thing is getting quite a bit of online traction. In this report by Reuters, we learn that what is possibly the Korean supreme leader\u2019s train has maybe been spotted at a resort town. Remarkably, analysts looking at satellite photos think this because the train is parked at a \u201cleadership station\u201d, which is like the equivalent of an executive parking space, but for trains. Does this mean he is on death\u2019s door? The short version: we don\u2019t know. \u201cThe train\u2019s presence does not prove the whereabouts of the North Korean leader or indicate anything about his health but it does lend weight to reports that Kim is staying at an elite area on the country\u2019s eastern coast,\u201d the report by a North Korean monitoring project said. Has to be stressed, the Queensland announcement doesn\u2019t come into force until NEXT weekend. So to be clear, don\u2019t go shoe shopping until Saturday, May 2. After that, you can head to your local Julius Marlow stockist. Steven Miles, the Queensland health minister, says the changes will be monitored. When we were talking to you during March about the Covid-19 pandemic ... there was no way I thought that by the end of April we could be considering easing some of these strictest restrictions,. but this is where we find ourselves because Queenslanders have done such a fantastic job. This is a very minor easing and we will need to see how it goes. Queensland has announced \u201ca very minor easing\u201d of its restrictions. The premier, Annastacia Palaszuczk, says she \u201cwill not hesitate to clamp back down\u201d if people begin to hold mass gatherings or take advantage of the changes. Because we have done such a terrific job of flattening the curve, in discussions with the chief health officer from next Friday we will be able to lift some of the stay-at-home restrictions, and can I say, this is a small step and one that we really need the public to 100% cooperate with. So, from midnight on Friday, we will be able to leave our homes for some forms of recreation. You will be able to go for a drive. If you are over 65 or over 70, I know it is really difficult for people being at home for long extended periods of time. Families will be able to have picnics. Members of the same household can go and have a picnic or, if you are single, you can go with one other person. You will be able to go shopping for non-essential items like clothes and shoes. Also,you will be able to go to national parks. We will be reopening the national parks. I hope these are some small measure to say to the public that we are doing a great job in Queensland, but we\u2019re not through this yet and I hope that these measures will give some relief to families. But there are three key conditions. We have to keep up hygiene and social distancing. This social distancing is absolutely paramount. We have to stay within 50km of our homes. We have been saying to people stay in your suburbs, your village, but what we do not want to see is large-scale movements of people, like Cairns to Townsville [or] people from the Sunshine Coast going to the Gold Coast. The other condition is that outings are limited to members of your own household. What we do not want is groups of friends meeting up with other friends at this stage. I know these sound like strict rules everyone, but we are in different times and I\u2019m trying to be flexible and listen to what the public is saying. And on the advice of the chief health officer, we have taken these measures. Queensland will allow some forms of recreation, such as: Going for a drive (within 50km of home) Picnics (limited to groups of two, or people from the same household) Shopping for non-essential items like clothes and shoes Some national park areas will be reopened The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, is speaking now. She says three new cases reported in the state overnight. She says from next Friday Queensland will lift some of the stay at home restrictions. From the AAP newswire: The prime minister says Australia is on the road back from the impact of COVID-19, but Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton warns people not to be complacent. Scott Morrison believes Australia is on the \u201croad back\u201d from tackling the coronavirus with some restrictions starting to lift. The prime minister pointed to the reopening of elective surgery, schools starting to come back and says it won\u2019t be long before some businesses are opening again \u201cWe are definitely on the road back now,\u201d the prime minister told ABC radio on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019ll try and get back to some type of normal.\u201d However, he said until there is a vaccine for COVID-19, social distancing will remain in place and Australians need to make hand hygiene instinctive. \u201cThere has never been more effort in finding a vaccine for this virus and we are hopeful that might mean they get a break through than otherwise might be the case,\u201d he said. The number of coronavirus cases, at around 6700, is small by international standards and is rising at an extremely slow rate compared to a few weeks ago. However, the death toll rose to 81 after an 83-year-old man, who resided at Newmarch House in Caddens, NSW died on Saturday, operator Anglicare Sydney said. Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton again warned Australians not to become complacent in trying to contain the virus, but concedes there is a level of frustration among people who want to get out and enjoy the good weather before winter starts. \u201cBut we need to very careful here, we have seen what has happened in Singapore and other jurisdictions at the moment where the second wave has taken place,\u201d Mr Dutton told Sky News. \u201cWe want to make sure we can continue the success we have got.\u201d The re-opening of schools remains a contentious issue between the federal and states and territory governments. However, a study by the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance here has found no evidence students at NSW schools have infected staff with COVID-19. \u201cOur investigation found no evidence of children infecting teachers,\u201d the chief investigator Professor Kristine Macartney told The Sun-Herald. \u201cWe have seen an extraordinarily low rate of transmissions in schools,\u201d Prof Macartney said. The picture in this piece is utterly amazing. And in remarkable news, it seems Donald Trump is scaling back his incoherent, rambling, press-baiting daily briefings after suggesting that injections of disinfectant could be used to treat coronavirus. For absolute clarity, disinfectant should not be ingested, injected or put inside your body via any means. Please don\u2019t do that. The question about whether kids and teachers go back to school is looming as a brawl that will escalate in the coming week. Two Labor-led states in particular, Queensland and Victoria, are on a different page of the textbook to the federal government, which wants schools to be open. In Victoria, the state opposition has begun to grumble about the extended remote learning arrangements. The education minister, James Merlino, says it is following the advice of health experts and keeping schools closed. In Queensland, independent schools have written to the premier, Annastacia Palszczuk, saying they want to reopen for Year 11 and 12 students. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners is today launching a nationwide campaign to make sure people don\u2019t neglect health concerns while we\u2019re all in lockdown. The key message is that your GP is still available, and that you really, really need to still seek medical advice, even during the lockdown. Doctors are doing consultations by video-conferencing platforms, telephone and, in some cases, face-to-face. The RACGP president, Dr Harry Nespolon, said that in these difficult times, people still needed to take care of their health and wellbeing. It\u2019s very concerning that some people have potentially been neglecting their health during this pandemic \u2013 the last thing we want is a tsunami of serious health issues and worsening chronic conditions coming after this virus, simply because people have stopped taking care of themselves or consulting their GP. The reason why we are running our campaign Expert Advice Matters is to encourage people to keep taking care of their health. We also want to remind everyone that general practice remains open and expert medical advice matters most. This pandemic has spawned countless pseudo-scientific cures and treatments and myths which at best do nothing and at worse are dangerous to people\u2019s health. Now, more than ever, people need expert medical advice. Also, don\u2019t inject yourself with disinfectant. Please. Now that Insiders (and that bloody cringeworthy Tony Burke AC/DC segment) is finished, here\u2019s another Sunday morning read, this time from my colleague Melissa Davey, who has taken an in-depth look at the coronavirus outbreak in Tasmania\u2019s north-west. I\u2019m not crying, you\u2019re crying. Presented without comment. Actually, I will make a comment. Please, please don\u2019t drink bleach. AAP has filed on Peter Dutton, who spoke to Sky News shortly before to his opposite number addressed free-to-air viewers via Insiders. He says the border with NZ could open before others. The report says: Home affairs minister Peter Dutton believes Australia\u2019s success in containing the coronavirus is due to the swift action it took in closing its borders. But he says an arrangement with New Zealand is a logical first step in lifting restrictions, and then Australia could look at other nations within the region that are enjoying the same success \u201cYou could look at an arrangement with New Zealand, given they are at a comparable stage as we are in this fight against this virus,\u201d he told Sky News on Sunday. Prime minister Scott Morrison and his New Zealand counterpart, Jacinda Ardern, discussed the issue last week but Ms Ardern played down the idea \u201cOur current border restrictions and quarantine arrangements are the most important protections we have to stop the virus re-entering New Zealand and taking off again, so they will only be lifted when we are confident it is safe to do so,\u201d a spokesperson for Ms Ardern said \u201cSo while nothing is going to happen immediately, the idea has merit as something that might be possible down the track.\u201d Kristina Keneally, Labor\u2019s home affairs spokeswoman, also spoke about jobkeeper and Labor\u2019s desire to have \u201cas many workers as possible\u201d covered under the scheme, including casuals and those on temporary visas. David Speers questions the added cost, which he says could be $20bn to $30bn to extend jobkeeper to another 2 million people. Keneally said: We are already paying a cost. We are going to pay a longer-term cost if the tail of this economic crisis extends longer than it needs to. And I might just note that the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, was given, by the parliament, the power with the stroke of a pen to include other workers into jobkeeper. I note that late on Friday night, he did make changes to jobkeeper after the government said that they would make none. We welcome the fact that he has used those discretionary powers and we say to him: if there are employees that we can keep in an employment relationship with their employer through jobkeeper, he should consider that. The controversial coronavirus tracing app \u201ccould be a great tool\u201d, Keneally says, but Australians will only download it if they have confidence their privacy will be protected. Labor wants privacy protections legislation \u201cand that when this crisis is over that authorities ensure that that data is deleted\u201d. Should schools be open? Keneally: \u201cListen to your premier of chief minister.\u201d On what the economic rebuilt might look like post-coronavirus, Keneally says we should remember \u201cthat the Australian economy was not a great place for the Australian worker prior to Covid-19\u201d. There was rampant wage theft. There was stagnant wages. There was increasing casualisation and gig work. There were rising prices. The Australian government should not come into this reform process with old ideological, anti-worker, anti-union agendas. [The government] should see the unions, they should see working people as their partners, as they did with jobkeeper. We\u2019ve got that direct wage subsidy for many workers now because the government, rightly, did not view the unions as their enemy, but rather as their cooperator and their partner. Lots of back and forth between Kristina Keneally and Insiders host David Speers about commonwealth and state responsibility for allowing Ruby Princess passengers to disembark. Speers has tried hard to press the point that New South Wales Health had delegated authority to made decisions around the health of cruise ship passengers. KK is having none of that suggestion: The prime minister stood in front of the nation on March 15 and said that arriving cruise ships would be under bespoke arrangements under the direct command of the Australian Border Force. The prime minister, I don\u2019t believe, said that as a marketing line. I believe that he meant it. So the Commonwealth have a clear responsibility here for those arriving cruise ships under the announcement made by the prime minister. And later on : What Ruby Princess has exposed is that there are gaping holes in our border security. Kristina Keneally is speaking on Insiders about stopping (or not) the boats. Actually, one particular boat, the Ruby Princess. When it comes to Australia\u2019s border, the buck stops with the Commonwealth. On March 15, the prime minister announced that his government would stop, would ban foreign-flagged cruise ships from arriving in Australia. He also announced on March 15 that there would be some exceptions made for cruise ships already heading to Australia that had Australians on board. And the prime minister said on March 15 that those cruise ships, which include the Ruby Princess, would be, and I quote, \u201cunder bespoke arrangements under the direct command of the Australian Border Force\u201d. So four days later, the Ruby Princess arrives under the conditions the prime minister set out, under the direct command of the Australian Border Force. And I note that when it did arrive, frontline Australian Border Force officers did raise concerns about the passengers and the illness on the ship. For some reason, those seem to have not been listened to. The Ruby Princess\u2019s 2,700 passengers were allowed to disembark without a temperature test or quarantine arrangements. As you now say, we now see that one ship was responsible for 700 Covid cases, over 20 deaths and a significant outbreak of Covid-19 in north-west Tasmania. This one boat that Scott Morrison failed to stop has had tragic results right across the country. Expect the tracing app to be part of the Insiders discussion with Kristina Keneally this morning. Overnight my colleague Josh Taylor has written a good analysis of the data security debate. He says the government has an \u201cuphill battle\u201d to convince us they can trust us with their data. AAP reports this morning that the controversial coronavirus tracing app is likely to be launched today: The controversial app to help trace people who come into contact with someone with Covid-19 will be launched on Sunday. The Australian app is based on Singapore\u2019s Tracetogether software, which records the Bluetooth connections a phone makes with others so the user can give that data to state health authorities if they catch the virus. Home affairs minister Peter Dutton, who has recovered from a bout of Covid-19, said it was a more effective approach than checking your diary or trying to remember where you had been. \u201cThe beauty of the app is that it can have a handshake, if you like, with people that you\u2019ve been in close proximity with, find the phone,\u201d he told Sky Sunday Agenda. He said the privacy issues had been dealt with and that the app would help authorities stop the spread of the virus. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredibly important next step.\u201d A broader testing regime and a government contact-tracing app are seen as key stepping stones to a relaxation of the economic shutdown. The government wants at least 40 per cent of the population to sign up so officials can do \u201cindustrial-scale\u201d contact tracing. ICMYI yesterday, Victorian authorities are under fire after staff and patients at an inpatient psychiatric facility were not told about a coronavirus outbreak until a month after the first positive test Calla Wahlquist filed this piece yesterday afternoon ... ABC\u2019s Insiders coming up shortly, and the politician whose job is basically getting under Peter Dutton\u2019s skin, Kristina Keneally, is on the show. There is so much to read this morning, and I hope you\u2019re doing it with a strong coffee. Hopefully there are fewer hangovers out there than usual during these extraordinary Sunday mornings. Of course, pubs and nightclubs are closed and so is pretty much anywhere you might have otherwise played the pokies. This is definitely worth a look by the ABC \u2013 how the lives of poker machine addicts have changed during the lockdown. Spoiler alert: they improve. Reminder: don\u2019t drink bleach. My colleagues Paul Karp and Ben Butler have been drilling into some of the issues emerging with the federal government\u2019s jobkeeper payment, as employers and workers fight for their share ... And Ben has also done a ripping analysis of Scott Morrison\u2019s attempts to blame the banks for teething problems with jobkeeper. The \u201cfundamental flaw\u201d in the program appears to be the payment is made in arrears, meaning businesses are having to front the money to workers. He writes: For the Liberal party, which is supposed to be the champion of small business, a failure to understand the basics of cashflow seems mind-boggling. The Sun-Herald has reported this morning that the New South Wales police commissioner, Mick Foley, has personally cancelled 32 of more than 1000 fines issued to people for breaching public health orders. The magistrates courts are going to be swamped when the public health emergency is over as people challenge lots of these fines. There\u2019s a bit around this morning, but the starting point for any reading list has to be this piece by my colleague Luke Henriques-Gomes, who has taken a look at how the crisis is affecting vulnerable Australians On what some might call the margins, the coronavirus pandemic is not just an invisible source of health and economic destruction. It is the brutal compounding of an already bulging list of difficulties and challenges, fuelled by longstanding structural problems: low Centrelink payments, insecure housing and inadequate support for people with disabilities or mental ill-health. Australia\u2019s coronavirus death toll is at 81, as a plane-load of Australians and New Zealanders are due to arrive on a rescue flight out of Buenos Aires. The more than 150 Australians and 20 New Zealanders left the Argentinian capital at 2pm Saturday local time after being stranded in South America since the outbreak. Tasmania recorded its tenth Covid-19 fatality on Saturday after a 90-year-old man died at the Mersey Community Hospital in Latrobe. Nine of Tasmania\u2019s deaths have been in the north-west, where an outbreak has been responsible for the majority of the island\u2019s 208 cases. Twelve new cases confirmed in NSW include a worker at a Blue Mountains aged care home, prompting concerns of another outbreak. However, the Catholic Healthcare Bodington worker reportedly did not have symptoms when last at the home. Caddens\u2019 Anglicare Newmarch House has recorded 48 infections, making it NSW\u2019s largest ongoing coronavirus cluster. The nation\u2019s total confirmed cases now stands at 6,694, a relatively modest increase on 6,565 a week ago. At the peak of the crisis at the end of March, cases were rising by more than 200 a day. Authorities around the country have warned against complacency, urging people not to be lulled into a false sense of security just because daily confirmed case numbers are decreasing. The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, described the virus as \u201cenergetic\u201d and \u201csneaky\u201d, while Victoria\u2019s deputy health officer, Annaliese van Diemen, said: \u201cThis is not over.\u201d Victoria recorded just three new cases on Saturday for a total of 1,346. Fourteen of these have been connected to a private 80-bed psychiatric facility run by Ramsay Health Care. The clinic has effectively been shut down to contain the virus spread. In Queensland, cases total 1,026, while in Western Australian confirmed cases are at 549. In the ACT, cases rose by one to 106, while in South Australia there were no new positive results for a third day in a row, keeping the total at 438. As the nation marked Anzac Day without the usual mass gatherings or fanfare, the governor general, David Hurley, urged people to consider what former generations would expect of us as we face our greatest generational test. Good morning, Australia! No, it\u2019s not sadly Bert Newton here, this is Ben Smee and I\u2019ll be with you for most of today, as we settle in for another day on the coronavirus news rollercoaster. The aim is to give you everything you need here in one place. We\u2019ll tell you which despots have died (or not) and whatever else today has in store. Please, whatever you do, don\u2019t drink or inject disinfectant. Right, let\u2019s get into it.",

      "body": "<p>There are moments when your life changes over the length of a single word. For example, you might remember that particular time you heard the word \u201cpregnant\u201d. Or maybe \u201cdivorce\u201d or \u201ccongratulations\u201d or \u201cguilty\u201d. And maybe you remember the silence that followed and how it had a new weight to it. As if the silence were saying: \u201cLook, if I\u2019m expected to follow words like that, I\u2019m going to need a bit more respect around here.\u201d That\u2019s how it was for me last October. I didn\u2019t get to choose my life-changing word, of course. If I had, I doubt I would have gone with \u201cprolapse\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt looks like a prolapse.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, the valve is prolapsed and there\u2019s severe regurgitation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDue to the prolapse. All right, Mr Webb? Nearly done.\u201d</p> <p>An echocardiogram \u2013 an ultrasound of the heart \u2013 is in progress. The setting is a hospital and the time is that far-off era when we imagined hospitals to be places full of sick people having their own bespoke emergencies rather than sick people having one national emergency. More normal times, you might say \u2013 when we had the spare attention to be interested in all the deadly medical conditions that you can\u2019t get from a doorknob. It was certainly when I thought deadly medical conditions only happened to other people. Like I say, normal times.</p> <p>So in the hospital I\u2019m lying on my side, topless and facing the wall with my left arm crooked under my head. It\u2019s how I was asked to lie here, but the position now feels oddly louche, as if I\u2019m a life model and the portrait under construction is called Writer Is Quietly Relieved He Got the Novel Finished Because \u201cProlapse\u201d Doesn\u2019t Sound Like Something That\u2019s Meant to Happen Inside Hearts. Two days earlier, I\u2019d left the rehearsal room of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/12/back-review-mitchell-webb-finale-squirmingly-good-sitcom-thriller\">the sitcom </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/12/back-review-mitchell-webb-finale-squirmingly-good-sitcom-thriller\">Back</a></em> to go for a routine cast medical. A GP had put a stethoscope on my heart, pulled a face and referred me to the cardiologist.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s true to say I had sauntered into middle age while still treating my body like a skip</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The heart doctor has a distinctive handshake, offered palm up with the fingers splayed. It looks like an apology and as soon as I sit down it becomes clear why he\u2019s sorry. \u201cI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re going to have a heart attack in the next fortnight,\u201d he says slowly.</p> <p>OK, well that\u2019s\u2026 good.</p> <p>\u201cBut if the problem isn\u2019t addressed, then in the next two or four or six months\u2026 this heart will fail.\u201d</p> <p>There it is again, another word that warps the silence around it. \u201cFail\u201d. As in: \u201cepic heart fail\u201d. It turns out that my heart has a prolapsed mitral valve. With every heartbeat, more than half the blood that should be pushed out of the left ventricle to do its thing around my body is flowing backwards into the left atrium. It means that the heart has had to work much harder than it should, growing and remodelling to keep the show on the road. This seems to have been going on for years. And now \u2013 time\u2019s up.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, valve repair isn\u2019t something we can do with pills,\u201d he says and I feel like I\u2019ve gone very still. He puts it rather more gently than this but I gather there\u2019ll be none of this newfangled noninvasive keyhole nonsense either. That\u2019s for people who need to avoid a big old slash in the chest and their breastbone getting sawn in half and clamped open for hours. The snowflakes. No, it seems that if like me you\u2019re a 47-year-old cardiac surgery virgin then there\u2019s really no excuse not to do this the old-fashioned way: the method that maximises the chances of a good outcome because the surgeon can \u2013 as it was explained to me by another doctor \u2013 \u201csee what the hell he\u2019s doing\u201d. Right. That\u2019ll be lifesaving open-heart surgery for me then. Fine. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be interesting to see how I react to this,\u201d I think as I make my way urgently to the pub.</p> <p>Mitral valve failure arises from a birth defect, and I was glad this was not \u201cmy fault\u201d. And if it had been, I would surely have been advised not to think in terms of blame, and after a show of reluctance I would have agreed. But it\u2019s true to say that I had sauntered into middle age while still treating my body like a skip, and of all the people who might find a brush with mortality useful, I was higher up the list than you might think. Hijacked by addiction at some point in the late 00s, my addled brain was on permanent lookout for the right \u201cwatershed\u201d: no more cigarettes after <em>this</em> birthday, no more wine after <em>this</em> breakfast etc. Well, I\u2019d got my watershed all right. You can\u2019t operate on a beating heart \u2013 they were literally about to turn me off and on again.

      "bodyText": "There are moments when your life changes over the length of a single word. For example, you might remember that particular time you heard the word \u201cpregnant\u201d. Or maybe \u201cdivorce\u201d or \u201ccongratulations\u201d or \u201cguilty\u201d. And maybe you remember the silence that followed and how it had a new weight to it. As if the silence were saying: \u201cLook, if I\u2019m expected to follow words like that, I\u2019m going to need a bit more respect around here.\u201d That\u2019s how it was for me last October. I didn\u2019t get to choose my life-changing word, of course. If I had, I doubt I would have gone with \u201cprolapse\u201d. \u201cIt looks like a prolapse.\u201d \u201cYes, the valve is prolapsed and there\u2019s severe regurgitation.\u201d \u201cDue to the prolapse. All right, Mr Webb? Nearly done.\u201d An echocardiogram \u2013 an ultrasound of the heart \u2013 is in progress. The setting is a hospital and the time is that far-off era when we imagined hospitals to be places full of sick people having their own bespoke emergencies rather than sick people having one national emergency. More normal times, you might say \u2013 when we had the spare attention to be interested in all the deadly medical conditions that you can\u2019t get from a doorknob. It was certainly when I thought deadly medical conditions only happened to other people. Like I say, normal times. So in the hospital I\u2019m lying on my side, topless and facing the wall with my left arm crooked under my head. It\u2019s how I was asked to lie here, but the position now feels oddly louche, as if I\u2019m a life model and the portrait under construction is called Writer Is Quietly Relieved He Got the Novel Finished Because \u201cProlapse\u201d Doesn\u2019t Sound Like Something That\u2019s Meant to Happen Inside Hearts.

Some of the richest people in the US have been at the front of the queue as the government has handed out trillions of dollars to prop up an economy it shuttered amid the coronavirus pandemic. At the same time, the billionaire class has added $308bn to its wealth in four weeks - even as a record 26 million people lost their jobs. According to a new report from the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive thinktank, between 18 March and 22 April the wealth of America\u2019s plutocrats grew 10.5%. After the last recession, it took over two years for total billionaire wealth to get back to the levels they enjoyed in 2007. Eight of those billionaires have seen their net worth surge by over $1bn each, including the Amazon boss, Jeff Bezos, and his ex-wife MacKenzie Bezos; Eric Yuan, founder of Zoom; the former Microsoft chief Steve Ballmer; and Elon Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX technocrat. The billionaire bonanza comes as a flotilla of big businesses, millionaires and billionaires sail through loopholes in a $349bn bailout meant to save hard-hit small businesses. About 150 public companies managed to bag more than $600m in forgivable loans before the funds ran out. Among them was Shake Shack, a company with 6,000 employees valued at $2bn.

Collins said the pandemic had further exposed fault lines in the US body politic that have been widening the gap between the really rich and the rest over decades. \u201cThe rules of the economy have been tipped in favor of asset owners against everyone else,\u201d said Collins. By 2016 \u2013 seven years after the end of the last recession \u2013 the bottom 90% of households in the US had still not recovered from the last downturn while the top 10% had more wealth than they had in 2007.

For the app to be successful, just under half the population would need to carry it on their phones. From 6pm Sunday, users will be able to go to the Apple app store or Google Play store and install the app, and register their name, phone number, postcode, and age range. Scott Morrison, after saying it was not his \u201cpreferred option\u201d, confirmed downloading the app would not be mandatory, and instead has likened it to a civic duty, such as buying war bonds in the second world war. He also flagged it as a necessary step to relaxing restrictions. The app will store 21 days of data of people you have come into contact with, and the data will be held on your phone in that time. It is only uploaded to a government server, housed in Australia and run by Amazon, in the event that you test positive for coronavirus, and then consent for your log to be uploaded to the server. Health officials in each state and territory will then be able to access the list of contacts to then call those people and inform them they need to isolate and get tested.

But the effort has been overwhelmed by the needs. The $350bn set aside for SBA Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans was exhausted before many small businesses were even able to get overwhelmed bank systems to accept their applications. And at least some of the loans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/23/shake-shack-small-business-loan-economy\">went to businesses</a> most would not consider \u201csmall\u201d, including the restaurant chains Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House, Potbelly Sandwiches and Shake Shack; multimillion-dollar publicly traded biotech companies; coal producers and hedge funds.</p> <p>While elected officials and policymakers look to add as much as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/us-senate-may-pass-500bn-small-business-aid-package-second\">$500b</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/us-senate-may-pass-500bn-small-business-aid-package-second\">n</a> for additional loans, some small business owners say the program isn\u2019t just underfunded but fatally flawed. The PPP is only forgiven if at least 75% of the money is used to cover payroll costs \u2013 leaving little for business supplies, rent, or utilities. What was first announced as a forgivable $10,000 advance on an SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) was changed days later to $1,000 per employee a business previously had on staff.</p> <p>Small businesses on the west coast appear to have had a particularly hard time securing aid. According to <a href=\"https://www.revealnews.org/article/bailout-money-bypasses-hard-hit-new-york-california-for-north-dakota-nebraska/\">two</a> <a href=\"https://www.revealnews.org/article/bailout-money-bypasses-hard-hit-new-york-california-for-north-dakota-nebraska/\">analyses</a> of how SBA funds were allocated, California, Oregon and Washington received some of the smallest shares of aid compared with the eligible payroll in each state.</p> <p>Each of the country\u2019s over 30 million small businesses has unique needs and challenges in the face of a common disaster. Five owners on the west coast told the Guardian how they\u2019re working to stay afloat.</p> <h2>The hair studio: \u2018I won\u2019t lose everything again\u2019</h2> <p>To McKnight, government aid has so far proved elusive: \u201cI\u2019m living off my savings,\u201d she said.</p> <p>McKnight\u2019s small studio, which specializes in natural hair and extensions, opened in 2014 and is largely a one-woman operation. She works with a remote assistant and an agency that helps book her clients, but she has been forced to pause those relationships.</p> <p>In normal times, her total costs per month, including rent, are roughly $7,000, and she typically makes between $3,000 and $4,000 a week. Her online <a href=\"https://www.vulecarre.com/collection\">leather business</a> is on hold due to manufacturing shutdowns. That means her only continuing source of income is her <a href=\"https://www.slrawvirginhair.com/\">online hair products store</a>. She\u2019s on track to lose roughly $5,000 a month. </p> <p>McKnight applied to the PPP loan and the EIDL advance but hasn\u2019t yet had luck. She also applied for unemployment but has not been approved, and she hasn\u2019t yet received her stimulus check. Even if the loans came through, she would suffer thousands of dollars of losses each month the lockdown continues.</p> <p>For now, McKnight is staying optimistic, noting that her clients are desperate to get back into the salon. \u201cI promised myself I would not lose everything again,\u201d she said.</p> <p><strong>\u2013 SC &amp; SL</strong></p> <h2><strong>The </strong><strong>taco shop: \u2018We don\u2019t operate with hundreds of thousands in our bank account\u2019</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.guerrillatacos.com/etk\">Guerrilla Tacos</a>, too, overcame huge obstacles to open in 2018. Chef Wes Avila started Guerrilla as an unauthorized Los Angeles food cart that was repeatedly shut down by police.

      "bodyText": "LeAna McKnight survived Hurricane Katrina, and now she\u2019s fighting for her business to survive Covid-19. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve lost everything, including your home, nothing stresses you out too much,\u201d said McKnight. Like millions of small businesses across the US, McKnight\u2019s Stylist Lee Hair Studio in West Hollywood, California, had to close indefinitely in mid-March because of stay-at-home orders aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus. And like fellow entrepreneurs around the country, she is struggling to figure out how her salon will rebound from the crisis whenever she is able to reopen. The Small Business Administration loan programs established under the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act were meant to provide a lifeline for businesses like McKnight\u2019s. But the effort has been overwhelmed by the needs. The $350bn set aside for SBA Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans was exhausted before many small businesses were even able to get overwhelmed bank systems to accept their applications. And at least some of the loans went to businesses most would not consider \u201csmall\u201d, including the restaurant chains Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House, Potbelly Sandwiches and Shake Shack; multimillion-dollar publicly traded biotech companies; coal producers and hedge funds. While elected officials and policymakers look to add as much as $500bn for additional loans, some small business owners say the program isn\u2019t just underfunded but fatally flawed. The PPP is only forgiven if at least 75% of the money is used to cover payroll costs \u2013 leaving little for business supplies, rent, or utilities. What was first announced as a forgivable $10,000 advance on an SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) was changed days later to $1,000 per employee a business previously had on staff. Small businesses on the west coast appear to have had a particularly hard time securing aid. According to two analyses of how SBA funds were allocated, California, Oregon and Washington received some of the smallest shares of aid compared with the eligible payroll in each state. Each of the country\u2019s over 30 million small businesses has unique needs and challenges in the face of a common disaster. Five owners on the west coast told the Guardian how they\u2019re working to stay afloat. The hair studio: \u2018I won\u2019t lose everything again\u2019 To McKnight, government aid has so far proved elusive: \u201cI\u2019m living off my savings,\u201d she said. McKnight\u2019s small studio, which specializes in natural hair and extensions, opened in 2014 and is largely a one-woman operation. She works with a remote assistant and an agency that helps book her clients, but she has been forced to pause those relationships. In normal times, her total costs per month, including rent, are roughly $7,000, and she typically makes between $3,000 and $4,000 a week. Her online leather business is on hold due to manufacturing shutdowns. That means her only continuing source of income is her online hair products store. She\u2019s on track to lose roughly $5,000 a month. McKnight applied to the PPP loan and the EIDL advance but hasn\u2019t yet had luck. She also applied for unemployment but has not been approved, and she hasn\u2019t yet received her stimulus check. Even if the loans came through, she would suffer thousands of dollars of losses each month the lockdown continues. For now, McKnight is staying optimistic, noting that her clients are desperate to get back into the salon. \u201cI promised myself I would not lose everything again,\u201d she said. \u2013 SC &amp; SL The taco shop: \u2018We don\u2019t operate with hundreds of thousands in our bank account\u2019 Guerrilla Tacos, too, overcame huge obstacles to open in 2018. Chef Wes Avila started Guerrilla as an unauthorized Los Angeles food cart that was repeatedly shut down by police. After officers threatened to confiscate his supplies, he turned the business into a truck, eventually transitioning to a bricks-and-mortar location. It was a \u201cmiracle\u201d that Guerrilla had thrived even this long, said Brittney Valles, managing partner who opened the restaurant with Avila. Valles fundraised for the taco joint when she was only 23 years old, and she is the first in her family to graduate college. \u201cPeople took a chance on me.\u201d The shutdowns have sent the owners scrambling: \u201cWe don\u2019t operate with hundreds of thousands in our bank account. We don\u2019t have this crazy backing of capital and tech to maintain a business in a pandemic.\u201d Valles previously employed 58 people. Now, doing take-out and delivery only, the restaurant is down to seven employees (plus her boyfriend, who is working for free). She furloughed the rest of staff. Guerrilla\u2019s rent is $25,000 a month. In February, pre-Covid, the restaurant made $400,000 in sales. That dipped to $150,000 in March, and she estimated April would bring in $60,000 or less. She successfully secured the disaster loan and was told she was approved for PPP, though that money hasn\u2019t arrived yet. Ultimately, with an eviction moratorium in place, she held off paying rent to instead cover healthcare for her furloughed workers. While she may be in a better position than other taquerias, the long-term future is uncertain, especially if she has to operate with reduced tables or other restrictions. She did not plan for a pandemic when she negotiated rent, she said, and fears her landlord would quickly replace her with a more financially stable chain if she continues to be short. \u201cIt feels like my entire dream and all the people who work for me and alongside me are all just getting fucked. It\u2019s so exhausting,\u201d she said. For now, Guerrilla is offering \u201cemergency taco kits\u201d to go, which provide customers with ingredients to make their own tacos at home.

During coronavirus shutdowns, Carroll has actually seen the bookstore\u2019s sales go up, as she has shifted her business model to offer curbside pickups, books by mail, and very socially distanced browsing, with only one customer allowed inside the store at a time. (Anything a customer touches but does not buy must be put on a special table, to be disinfected later.) \u201cI\u2019ve gotten a ton of new customers,\u201d she said. \u201cThey walk in and they just say: you need to stay open.\u201d She\u2019s been given a $20 tip on one order, a $60 tip on another. \u201cSomebody mailed me a check for $100.\u201d Carroll is now working seven days a week. With the growing sales, her expenses, too, have shot through the roof since many customers are now ordering new books, which Carroll has to pay to order herself, rather than the used books that are already in her inventory. \u201cFor March, I was able to pay my rent [on time] but not my utilities,\u201d Carroll said. Her landlord has offered her some flexibility, she said, but he also has bills to pay. Carroll said she received an EIDL emergency grant from the federal government in her bank account a few days ago, but it hasn\u2019t helped much. After she applied for the grant on 31 March, she said, she was told the emergency fund would only offer $1,000 per employee. That meant, for her, exactly $1,000. \u201cI find it humorous,\u201d she said. \u201cYou said it was going to be $10,000 in three days, and it became $1,000 after three weeks.\u201d She was told she had been approved for a normal SBA business loan of $25,000, but she is still waiting on paperwork to complete the loan. While access to government assistance has been frustrating, she said, small businesses in downtown Beaverton have stepped up to help each other. From her bookstore, she is selling cookies for a local bakery and skincare products for a boutique. On the day the federal government announced it had run out of emergency funding to help small businesses and was not accepting any more applications, Carroll tried to offer some consolation to her banker across the street. \u201cI was like, here\u2019s some cupcakes, enjoy,\u201d she said. \u2013 LB",

And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s lost on Biden because he did have that chemistry with Barack Obama.\u201d In Biden\u2019s search for his own \u201cBiden\u201d, he has repeatedly cited his close relationship with Obama as a model. The governing partnership between Obama and Biden was a \u201cmarriage made in political heaven\u201d, said Jules Witcover, a historian who has written extensively about the vice-presidency and is the author of the biography Joe Biden: A Life of Trial and Redemption. \u201cInstead of creating a record for himself, Biden devoted himself to supporting the agenda of President Obama,\u201d he said. \u201cIn return, Obama made him as full a governing partner as possible.\u201d Witcover noted that Obama charged Biden with overseeing the administration\u2019s 2009 effort to rescue the country from what was then the largest economic collapse since the Great Depression. Biden believes the scale of the economic crisis he may inherit in January 2021 could rival what Franklin Roosevelt faced in 1933. As such, he has made clear that he is looking for a running mate whom he can trust to carry out major pieces of his presidential agenda. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be able to turn and say to your vice-president: \u2018This is your responsibility,\u2019\u201d Biden said last year. \u201cBecause the job is too big any more for any one man or woman.\u201d",

Ministers have repeatedly insisted throughout the crisis that they have \u201cfollowed the science\u201d \u2013 so the presence of Cummings and another political adviser, Ben Warner, at some committee meetings has raised questions about its independence. Davis said: \u201cWe should publish the membership of Sage, remove any non-scientist members, publish their advice in full, and publish dissenting opinions with the advice.\u201d Speaking to Sophy Ridge on Sky News, Raab underlined the risks of a \u201csecond spike\u201d in the coronavirus outbreak, and declined to set out details of when and how the lockdown could be lifted across the UK. The foreign secretary said ministers were beginning to examine what should happen in what he repeatedly called the \u201csecond phase\u201d of the lockdown: but he also stressed the importance of avoiding a resurgence in infections by lifting restrictions too soon. \u201cThere are certain things that if we jumped the gun, they would be irresponsible and precarious,\u201d Raab said. \u201cThe delicate stage we\u2019re at, is if we ease up too soon, we risk a second spike of the virus,\u201d he said, speaking to Sophy Ridge on Sky News.

Johnson will have to confront the challenge of deciding when, and how, to unravel the stringent lockdown measures imposed on 23 March, amid conflicting pressures. They are due to be reviewed by 7 May. Johnson held a three-hour meeting at his country retreat of Chequers on Friday with Raab, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and key aides including Dominic Cummings. Sunak is concerned about the devastating impact of the crisis on the economy, with the independent office for budget responsibility suggesting a three-month shutdown could lead to a 35% collapse in GDP and an increase of more than 2 million in unemployment. At the meeting, Johnson reportedly quoted, in Latin, the Roman statesman Cicero, saying, \u201cthe health of the people should be the supreme law\u201d. Raab confirmed that travellers entering the UK could face further restrictions \u2013 including potentially health checks on entry \u2013 during the next phase of managing the crisis. \u201cThat is something we will be looking at, and it could include the testing for people coming in; it could include social distancing measures,\u201d he said. He rejected the idea that ministers should have imposed such measures earlier. Arrivals into Britain from the worst-affected countries were quarantined or urged to self-isolate during the early stages of the outbreak: but the measures were then lifted once it was clear the virus was spreading within the UK. At the time, Raab said, ministers were advised that travel restrictions or quarantine measures would \u201cmake almost no impact on the spread of the virus because of the decrease in the number of people travelling, and the fact that the infection rate within the UK is high\u201d. The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, echoed Raab\u2019s caution about relaxing the rules, telling the BBC: \u201cIt\u2019s too early right now to have any confidence that we could see the virus potentially run out of control again.\u201d She added that when measures could be lifted, \u201cit\u2019s not a flick of the switch moment: there will be a real need for care and caution and a slow and gradual process\u201d. She said social distancing would have to be in place for \u201cquite some way to come,\u201d and the public would have to contemplate \u201cdifferent ways of operating\u201d. Whitehall officials have been examining what kinds of businesses should potentially open first, based on which could safely impose physical distancing \u2013 and which are most critical for the economy and society. \u2022 Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?",

      "body": "<p>Only about half of the sickest Covid-19 patients, admitted to intensive care struggling to breathe, are being put on mechanical ventilators, it has emerged, as evidence grows that many do better with non-invasive help.</p> \n<p>The rush to increase the number of ventilators in Britain from 8,000 to 18,000 was a response to early assumptions that intubation was the only way to save the lives of those who become severely ill. Industry was urged to switch production, and Dyson was among the companies volunteering to help, but it has now been told by the government its services are not needed.</p> \n<p>This may now look like an over-reaction, but one leading intensive care expert said the government had little choice. The Imperial College modelling prediction of 250,000 UK deaths was based partly on a shortfall in the number of ventilators in the NHS.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is easy in retrospect,\u201d said Mervyn Singer, a professor of intensive care medicine at University College London. \u201cGovernments had to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. The truth is usually somewhere in the middle.\u201d</p> \n<p>Singer talked to colleagues in China and in Italy about their experiences before the UK\u2019s intensive care units started to fill up. \u201cWe started off with a strategy to try to avoid intubation,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The alternatives to mechanical ventilation include continuous positive airway pressure (Cpap).

      "bodyText": "Only about half of the sickest Covid-19 patients, admitted to intensive care struggling to breathe, are being put on mechanical ventilators, it has emerged, as evidence grows that many do better with non-invasive help. The rush to increase the number of ventilators in Britain from 8,000 to 18,000 was a response to early assumptions that intubation was the only way to save the lives of those who become severely ill. Industry was urged to switch production, and Dyson was among the companies volunteering to help, but it has now been told by the government its services are not needed. This may now look like an over-reaction, but one leading intensive care expert said the government had little choice. The Imperial College modelling prediction of 250,000 UK deaths was based partly on a shortfall in the number of ventilators in the NHS. \u201cIt is easy in retrospect,\u201d said Mervyn Singer, a professor of intensive care medicine at University College London. \u201cGovernments had to prepare for the worst and hope for the best. The truth is usually somewhere in the middle.\u201d Singer talked to colleagues in China and in Italy about their experiences before the UK\u2019s intensive care units started to fill up. \u201cWe started off with a strategy to try to avoid intubation,\u201d he said. The alternatives to mechanical ventilation include continuous positive airway pressure (Cpap). Cpap machines are a type of ventilator that uses a mask but delivers air at mild pressure without taking over the function of the lungs. It is believed Boris Johnson was treated with Cpap. Early fears were that healthcare workers would be more likely to be infected by Cpap patients, but at University College hospital that turned out to be unfounded. Singer and his colleagues wrote an algorithm for deciding which patients needed intubation and which could be given other forms of breathing support. They launched their care pathway on 20 March, the day that London\u2019s Northwick Park hospital had to declare an emergency and send Covid-19 patients to other hospitals. \u201cThey were intubating everyone as per guidance and ended up with no ventilators left and had to declare a critical emergency,\u201d said Singer.

      "body": "<p>Christian Drosten, who directs the Institute of Virology at the Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Berlin, was one of those who identified the Sars virus in 2003. As the head of the German public health institute\u2019s reference lab on coronaviruses, he has become the government\u2019s go-to expert on the related virus causing the current pandemic.</p> \n<p>In an exclusive interview, Drosten admits he fears a second deadly wave of the virus. He explains why Angela Merkel has an advantage over other world leaders \u2013 and why the \u201cprevention paradox\u201d keeps him awake at night.</p> \n<p><strong>Q: Germany will start</strong><strong> to lift its lockdown gradually from Monday. What happens next?<br>A: </strong>At the moment, we are seeing half-empty ICUs in Germany. This is because we started diagnostics early and on a broad scale, and we stopped the epidemic \u2013 that is, we brought the reproduction number [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/apr/22/see-how-coronavirus-can-spread-through-a-population-and-how-countries-flatten-the-curve\">a key measure of the spread of the virus</a>] below 1. Now, what I call the \u201cprevention paradox\u201d has set in. People are claiming we over-reacted, there is political and economic pressure to return to normal. The federal plan is to lift lockdown slightly, but because the German states, or L\u00e4nder, set their own rules, I fear we\u2019re going to see a lot of creativity in the interpretation of that plan. I worry that the reproduction number will start to climb again, and we will have a second wave.</p> \n<p><strong>Q: If the lockdown were kept in place longer, could the disease be eradicated?<br>A:</strong> There is a group of modellers in Germany who suggest that by prolonging lockdown here for another few weeks, we could really suppress virus circulation to a considerable degree \u2013 bringing the reproduction number below 0.2. I tend to support them but I haven\u2019t completely made up my mind. The reproduction number is just an average, an indication. It doesn\u2019t tell you about pockets of high prevalence such as senior citizens\u2019 homes, where it will take longer to eradicate the disease, and from where we could see a rapid resurgence even if lockdown were extended.</p> \n<p><strong>Q: If there were such a resurgence, could it be contained?<br>A:</strong> Yes, but it can\u2019t happen based on human contact-tracing alone. We now have evidence that almost half of infection events happen before the person passing on the infection develops symptoms \u2013 and people are infectious starting two days prior to that. That means that human contact-tracers working with patients to identify those they\u2019ve been exposed to are in a race against time. They need help to catch all those potentially exposed as quickly as possible \u2013 and that will require electronic contact-tracing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Germany\" data-alt=\"Coronavirus in Germany\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2020-embeds/2020/03/country/embed/main.html?country=Germany\">Coronavirus in Germany</a> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Q: How close we are to achieving herd immunity?<br>A:</strong> To achieve herd immunity we need 60-70% of the population to carry antibodies to the virus. The results of antibody tests suggest that in Europe and the US, in general, we are in the low single digits, but the tests are not reliable \u2013 all of them have problems with false positives \u2013 and herd immunity is also not the whole story. It assumes complete mixing of the population, but there are reasons \u2013 in part to do with the social networks people form \u2013 why the whole population may not be available for infection at any given time. Networks shift, and new people are exposed to the virus. Such effects can drive waves of infection. Another factor that could impact herd immunity is whether other coronaviruses \u2013 those that cause the common cold, for example \u2013 offer protection to this one. We don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s possible.</p> \n<p><strong>Q: Should all countries be testing everybody?<br>A:</strong> I\u2019m not sure. Even in Germany, with our huge testing capacity, and most of it directed to people reporting symptoms, we have not had a positivity rate above 8%. So I think targeted testing might be best, for people who are really vulnerable \u2013 staff in hospitals and care homes, for example. This is not fully in place even in Germany, though we\u2019re moving towards it. The other target should be patients in the first week of symptoms, especially elderly patients who tend to come to hospital too late at the moment \u2013 when their lips are already blue and they need intubation.

There is an interesting piece of information from the old Sars literature. That virus was found in civet cats, but also in raccoon dogs \u2013 something the media overlooked.

Camels count as livestock in the Middle East, and they are the host of the Mers virus as well as human coronavirus 229E \u2013 which is one cause of the common cold \u2013 while cattle were the original hosts for coronavirus OC43, which is another.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/comparison\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Q: Flu has always been thought to pose the greatest pandemic risk.

      "bodyText": "Christian Drosten, who directs the Institute of Virology at the Charit\u00e9 Hospital in Berlin, was one of those who identified the Sars virus in 2003. As the head of the German public health institute\u2019s reference lab on coronaviruses, he has become the government\u2019s go-to expert on the related virus causing the current pandemic. In an exclusive interview, Drosten admits he fears a second deadly wave of the virus. He explains why Angela Merkel has an advantage over other world leaders \u2013 and why the \u201cprevention paradox\u201d keeps him awake at night. Q: Germany will start to lift its lockdown gradually from Monday. What happens next? A: At the moment, we are seeing half-empty ICUs in Germany. This is because we started diagnostics early and on a broad scale, and we stopped the epidemic \u2013 that is, we brought the reproduction number [a key measure of the spread of the virus] below 1. Now, what I call the \u201cprevention paradox\u201d has set in. People are claiming we over-reacted, there is political and economic pressure to return to normal. The federal plan is to lift lockdown slightly, but because the German states, or L\u00e4nder, set their own rules, I fear we\u2019re going to see a lot of creativity in the interpretation of that plan. I worry that the reproduction number will start to climb again, and we will have a second wave. Q: If the lockdown were kept in place longer, could the disease be eradicated? A: There is a group of modellers in Germany who suggest that by prolonging lockdown here for another few weeks, we could really suppress virus circulation to a considerable degree \u2013 bringing the reproduction number below 0.2. I tend to support them but I haven\u2019t completely made up my mind. The reproduction number is just an average, an indication. It doesn\u2019t tell you about pockets of high prevalence such as senior citizens\u2019 homes, where it will take longer to eradicate the disease, and from where we could see a rapid resurgence even if lockdown were extended. Q: If there were such a resurgence, could it be contained? A: Yes, but it can\u2019t happen based on human contact-tracing alone. We now have evidence that almost half of infection events happen before the person passing on the infection develops symptoms \u2013 and people are infectious starting two days prior to that. That means that human contact-tracers working with patients to identify those they\u2019ve been exposed to are in a race against time. They need help to catch all those potentially exposed as quickly as possible \u2013 and that will require electronic contact-tracing. Q: How close we are to achieving herd immunity? A: To achieve herd immunity we need 60-70% of the population to carry antibodies to the virus. The results of antibody tests suggest that in Europe and the US, in general, we are in the low single digits, but the tests are not reliable \u2013 all of them have problems with false positives \u2013 and herd immunity is also not the whole story. It assumes complete mixing of the population, but there are reasons \u2013 in part to do with the social networks people form \u2013 why the whole population may not be available for infection at any given time. Networks shift, and new people are exposed to the virus. Such effects can drive waves of infection. Another factor that could impact herd immunity is whether other coronaviruses \u2013 those that cause the common cold, for example \u2013 offer protection to this one. We don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s possible. Q: Should all countries be testing everybody? A: I\u2019m not sure. Even in Germany, with our huge testing capacity, and most of it directed to people reporting symptoms, we have not had a positivity rate above 8%. So I think targeted testing might be best, for people who are really vulnerable \u2013 staff in hospitals and care homes, for example. This is not fully in place even in Germany, though we\u2019re moving towards it. The other target should be patients in the first week of symptoms, especially elderly patients who tend to come to hospital too late at the moment \u2013 when their lips are already blue and they need intubation. And we need some kind of sentinel surveillance system, to sample the population regularly and follow the development of the reproduction number. Q: What is known about the seasonality of the virus? A: Not a lot. The Harvard modelling group led by Marc Lipsitch has suggested that transmission might slow over the summer, but that it will be a small effect. I don\u2019t have better data.

Such a condition would amount to coercion, Liberty claims.</p> <p>The academic developing the app has said that tens of millions of people would need to sign up to the app to make it effective.</p> <p>Clare Collier, the advocacy director at Liberty, said: \u201cBy presenting surveillance tools as a solution to lockdown, the government is drawing on the willingness we have all shown to make sacrifices in the face of this crisis while refusing to show it is taking seriously the enormous risks presented by invasive technology.\u201d</p> <p>She added: \u201cContact-tracing technology may require us to sacrifice deeply sensitive personal information and there can be no question of state bodies or private companies sharing our personal data other than what is absolutely necessary.

      "bodyText": "Civil liberties campaigners are concerned that the public could be \u201ccoerced\u201d into sharing data about their movements through a coronavirus contact-tracing app being developed by the UK government. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, says the app, which will be available within weeks, is \u201ccrucial for holding down the rate and the level of transmission\u201d of Covid-19. But the campaign group Liberty is worried that signing up to the app could become a compulsory condition for returning to work and being allowed out of lockdown when conditions are eased. Such a condition would amount to coercion, Liberty claims. The academic developing the app has said that tens of millions of people would need to sign up to the app to make it effective. Clare Collier, the advocacy director at Liberty, said: \u201cBy presenting surveillance tools as a solution to lockdown, the government is drawing on the willingness we have all shown to make sacrifices in the face of this crisis while refusing to show it is taking seriously the enormous risks presented by invasive technology.\u201d She added: \u201cContact-tracing technology may require us to sacrifice deeply sensitive personal information and there can be no question of state bodies or private companies sharing our personal data other than what is absolutely necessary. It is vital no one is coerced into having the app installed, and using it as a condition for returning to work or everyday life will inevitably lead to discrimination. \u201cThe opportunities presented by technology should be fully investigated, but seeking quick solutions in surveillance tools that rely on our personal data creates serious long-term threats to our rights and ways of life. \u201cContact-tracing technology will only work if 60% of people use it.

They have not stopped producing and it would be a crime as a society to not support them through this crisis as they are nourishing us.\u201d</p> <p>Wainwright added that Germany, which announced a federal aid package worth <a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/germanys-state-culture-ministers-aid-1844514\">\u20ac50b</a><a href=\"https://news.artnet.com/art-world/germanys-state-culture-ministers-aid-1844514\">n</a> (\u00a343 bn) for freelancers and small businesses with Berlin distributing <a href=\"https://www.artforum.com/news/uk-and-germany-launch-emergency-funds-for-the-arts-as-us-museums-call-for-aid-82557\">\u20ac5,000 payments to individual freelancers</a> (including artists), was a country that has effectively supported the arts and the creative industries.</p> <p>In March, the UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, unveiled plans to pay <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/uk-government-set-to-pay-self-employed-workers-80-of-earnings\">self-employed workers up to 80% of their recent earnings</a>, but was criticised when industry groups claimed many were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-support-loophole-uk-film-tv-staff-without-pay-mps\">ineligible for any financial support</a> under the scheme.</p> <p>Arts Council England also announced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/arts-council-england-promises-160m-to-buoy-public-during-lockdown\">\u00a3160m emergency response package</a> that gives artists access to cash grants of up to \u00a32,500, with \u00a350m available for organisations outside its national portfolio, and another \u00a390m going to national portfolio organisations.</p> <p>Caroline Norbury, CEO of CIF, said the creative sector was in \u201cdeep trouble\u201d despite the government funding meant to support workers who have been affected by Covid-19 lockdown measures.</p> <p>She said: \u201cWhile government support measures for businesses and the self-employed are welcome, we know that there are still thousands of creative organisations and freelancers who are falling through the gaps, and who simply will not get through this crisis without urgent cash support.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The letter also references CIF research that shows that one in seven creative organisations have reserves to last until the end of April, with half having money that will last beyond June.</p> <p>The letter is the latest appeal for support from the government by leading British cultural figures. Last week, the artistic director of the National Theatre, Rufus Norris, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/apr/23/national-theatre-boss-rufus-norris-covid-19\">told the Guardian</a> that some theatres had only days before they could go out of business and urged the government to offer more support to freelancers.</p> <p>\u201cIf the furlough scheme doesn\u2019t continue, yet we stay closed as an industry, then it\u2019s very hard to imagine how the sector will survive,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like the government to increase and broaden the support of freelance artists who are suffering very badly.\u201d</p> <p>Norris\u2019s comments followed those of the playwright James Graham who said an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52268447\">aggressive government bailout</a>\u201d was the way to ensure the sector survived Covid-19 and that \u201cworking-class actors and artists might be the ones who struggle to find themselves back on those platforms and in those spaces\u201d.</p> <p>The international curator Hans-Ulrich Obrist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/30/hans-ulrich-obrist-uk-public-art-project\">told the Guardian</a> a multimillion pound public arts programme, similar in scale to Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s Public Works of Art Project (PWAP) and Works Progress Administration (WPA), which was rolled out <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/1934-the-art-of-the-new-deal-132242698/\">during the Great Depression in the 1930s</a>, was needed to support artists during and after the Covid-19 outbreak.</p>",

Signatories of the letter also include Anish Kapoor, Jeremy Deller and Jonathan Pryce, who argue the government \u201ccannot allow the UK to lose half of its creative businesses and become a cultural wasteland\u201d. The singer Rufus Wainwright, who also signed, told the Guardian artists \u201cprotect the minds and souls of a nation\u201d, and it could be \u201ccriminal\u201d for the UK to not support them during the crisis. He said: \u201cArtists are creating so much content online that people can experience in their homes. They have not stopped producing and it would be a crime as a society to not support them through this crisis as they are nourishing us.\u201d Wainwright added that Germany, which announced a federal aid package worth \u20ac50bn (\u00a343 bn) for freelancers and small businesses with Berlin distributing \u20ac5,000 payments to individual freelancers (including artists), was a country that has effectively supported the arts and the creative industries. In March, the UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, unveiled plans to pay self-employed workers up to 80% of their recent earnings, but was criticised when industry groups claimed many were ineligible for any financial support under the scheme. Arts Council England also announced a \u00a3160m emergency response package that gives artists access to cash grants of up to \u00a32,500, with \u00a350m available for organisations outside its national portfolio, and another \u00a390m going to national portfolio organisations. Caroline Norbury, CEO of CIF, said the creative sector was in \u201cdeep trouble\u201d despite the government funding meant to support workers who have been affected by Covid-19 lockdown measures. She said: \u201cWhile government support measures for businesses and the self-employed are welcome, we know that there are still thousands of creative organisations and freelancers who are falling through the gaps, and who simply will not get through this crisis without urgent cash support.\u201d The letter also references CIF research that shows that one in seven creative organisations have reserves to last until the end of April, with half having money that will last beyond June. The letter is the latest appeal for support from the government by leading British cultural figures. Last week, the artistic director of the National Theatre, Rufus Norris, told the Guardian that some theatres had only days before they could go out of business and urged the government to offer more support to freelancers. \u201cIf the furlough scheme doesn\u2019t continue, yet we stay closed as an industry, then it\u2019s very hard to imagine how the sector will survive,\u201d he said. \u201cI would like the government to increase and broaden the support of freelance artists who are suffering very badly.\u201d Norris\u2019s comments followed those of the playwright James Graham who said an \u201caggressive government bailout\u201d was the way to ensure the sector survived Covid-19 and that \u201cworking-class actors and artists might be the ones who struggle to find themselves back on those platforms and in those spaces\u201d. The international curator Hans-Ulrich Obrist told the Guardian a multimillion pound public arts programme, similar in scale to Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s Public Works of Art Project (PWAP) and Works Progress Administration (WPA), which was rolled out during the Great Depression in the 1930s, was needed to support artists during and after the Covid-19 outbreak.",

It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics.</p>\n    <p>How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is being watched very carefully.

Independent scientific experts on the group are supposed to assess evidence impartially and pass their advice to Cobra, the civil contingencies committee convened in the Cabinet Office.</p> \n<p>The advisory group is chaired by the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, who also decides which experts take part. Asked whether Vallance had also given his approval to Cummings and Warner coming to his meetings, a government spokesperson said Vallance \u201cwould not have to sign off\u201d observers or representatives from government departments.<br><br>The chief medical officers and chief scientific advisers from the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are classified as observers on Sage. However, unlike Cummings and Warner, they are unable to ask questions unless they are submitted in writing in advance.</p> \n<p>George Eustice, the environment secretary, was asked about the makeup of Sage during Sunday\u2019s Downing Street press conference.</p> \n<p>He said it was \u201cconvened in response to specific emergencies, and the scientists that go on to that group will change, depending on the type of emergency.\u201d He said minutes of its deliberations would eventually be published.</p> \n<p>Stephen Powis, the national medical director for England, appearing alongside Eustice, said he would have \u201cno problem\u201d with the names of those who attend being made public, provided their personal permission had been sought.

We don\u2019t release, as a matter of practice, the names of all the members of Sage because the risk of them being subject to pressure, undue influence.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Covid-19%3A%20help%20us%20investigate&amp;description=The%20Guardian%20is%20investigating%20how%20the%20UK%20government%20prepared%20for%20%E2%80%93%20and%20is%20responding%20to%20%E2%80%93%20the%20coronavirus%20pandemic.%20We%20want%20to%20learn%20more%20about%20recent%20decisions%20taken%20at%20the%20heart%20of%20government.%20If%20you%E2%80%99re%20a%20whistleblower%20or%20source%20and%20with%20new%20information%2C%20you%20can%20email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Acovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Ecovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20Signal%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447584640566%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566.%20(The%20number%20does%20not%20take%20calls.)%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E.%20For%20general%20advice%20on%20confidentially%20contacting%20the%20Guardian%2C%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%20&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Guardian messsage to whistleblowers\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Covid-19%3A%20help%20us%20investigate&amp;description=The%20Guardian%20is%20investigating%20how%20the%20UK%20government%20prepared%20for%20%E2%80%93%20and%20is%20responding%20to%20%E2%80%93%20the%20coronavirus%20pandemic.%20We%20want%20to%20learn%20more%20about%20recent%20decisions%20taken%20at%20the%20heart%20of%20government.%20If%20you%E2%80%99re%20a%20whistleblower%20or%20source%20and%20with%20new%20information%2C%20you%20can%20email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Acovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Ecovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20Signal%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447584640566%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566.%20(The%20number%20does%20not%20take%20calls.)%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E.%20For%20general%20advice%20on%20confidentially%20contacting%20the%20Guardian%2C%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%20&amp;link=false\">Guardian messsage to whistleblowers</a> \n</figure>",

The advisory group is chaired by the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, who also decides which experts take part. Asked whether Vallance had also given his approval to Cummings and Warner coming to his meetings, a government spokesperson said Vallance \u201cwould not have to sign off\u201d observers or representatives from government departments. The chief medical officers and chief scientific advisers from the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are classified as observers on Sage. However, unlike Cummings and Warner, they are unable to ask questions unless they are submitted in writing in advance. George Eustice, the environment secretary, was asked about the makeup of Sage during Sunday\u2019s Downing Street press conference. He said it was \u201cconvened in response to specific emergencies, and the scientists that go on to that group will change, depending on the type of emergency.\u201d He said minutes of its deliberations would eventually be published. Stephen Powis, the national medical director for England, appearing alongside Eustice, said he would have \u201cno problem\u201d with the names of those who attend being made public, provided their personal permission had been sought. Chief medical officer Chris Whitty has previously said the same thing. On Saturday, Labour urged the government to ban political advisers from attending Sage. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said there were significant questions for the government to answer over the credibility of its decision-making and how non-scientists have influenced policy. He said Cummings was \u201ca political adviser, not a medical or scientific expert. If the public are to have confidence in Sage, the government must make clear Dominic Cummings can no longer participate or attend.\u201d The Conservative former Brexit secretary, David Davis, also criticised the attendance of Cummings and Warner at the Sage meetings. \u201cThe whole point of having Sage is you\u2019re getting scientific advice based on the data, based on the best theories, and the best models we have at the time,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cYou don\u2019t want any outside influences, either direct or indirect, either deliberate or accidental.\u201d However the former Conservative chancellor, Sajid Javid, argued it would be \u201cworrying\u201d if Cummings was not present at the Sage\u2019s Covid-19 meetings, and criticised the Guardian\u2019s reporting. \u201cMedia have a hugely important role in holding government to account, but some are courting public mistrust with non-stories,\u201d Javid tweeted. \u201cTime to act more responsibly.\u201d The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said the government does not release the membership of the Sage committee because of the risk of pressure on members: \u201cSage do release their advice subsequently, normally a couple of weeks down the track, so it is properly tested carefully before being put out. We don\u2019t release, as a matter of practice, the names of all the members of Sage because the risk of them being subject to pressure, undue influence.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>1) Who </strong><strong>decided Dominic Cummings and Ben Warner should attend Sage meetings and why?</strong></h2> <p>The government has not disputed that this is the first time Downing Street political advisers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/revealed-dominic-cummings-on-secret-scientific-advisory-group-for-covid-19\">have attended Sage meetings</a> and asked questions at them. No 10 argues that the unprecedented scale of the coronavirus pandemic made it necessary. However, the government\u2019s policies say scientific committees such as Sage should be politically neutral. Sage meetings are chaired by the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. However, a government spokesperson said Vallance \u201cwould not have to sign off\u201d on observers or representatives from government departments. So who decided they should attend, and why and when was the decision made?</p> <h2><strong>2) Which Sage meetings did Cummings and Warner attend, and what did they say?</strong></h2> <p>In <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5801/cmselect/cmsctech/correspondence/Patrick-Vallance-to-Greg-Clark-re-SAGE-composition.pdf\">a letter to parliament</a>, Vallance said Sage was meeting about twice a week to provide scientific advice to the Cabinet Office about Covid-19. It met twice in January, nine times in February and 10 times in March. The dates of more recent meetings have not been disclosed. Downing Street has said Cummings and Warner attended \u201csome\u201d meetings, but has not specified which. It has also played down their contributions, saying they \u201coccasionally\u201d ask questions or \u201coffer help when scientists mention problems in Whitehall\u201d. That contrasts with the accounts of Sage committee members, who told the Guardian they were active participants in meetings as far back as February. So what, exactly, were their contributions?</p> <h2>3) <strong>Why was Ben Warner attending meetings?</strong></h2> <p>While much attention has focused on the attendance of Cummings, there have been fewer questions about Warner, a data scientist who was reportedly recruited to Downing Street late last year after running the Conservative party\u2019s general election campaign model. Warner previously worked with Cummings on the Vote Leave campaign for Brexit.

      "bodyText": "1) Who decided Dominic Cummings and Ben Warner should attend Sage meetings and why? The government has not disputed that this is the first time Downing Street political advisers have attended Sage meetings and asked questions at them. No 10 argues that the unprecedented scale of the coronavirus pandemic made it necessary. However, the government\u2019s policies say scientific committees such as Sage should be politically neutral. Sage meetings are chaired by the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. However, a government spokesperson said Vallance \u201cwould not have to sign off\u201d on observers or representatives from government departments. So who decided they should attend, and why and when was the decision made? 2) Which Sage meetings did Cummings and Warner attend, and what did they say? In a letter to parliament, Vallance said Sage was meeting about twice a week to provide scientific advice to the Cabinet Office about Covid-19. It met twice in January, nine times in February and 10 times in March. The dates of more recent meetings have not been disclosed. Downing Street has said Cummings and Warner attended \u201csome\u201d meetings, but has not specified which. It has also played down their contributions, saying they \u201coccasionally\u201d ask questions or \u201coffer help when scientists mention problems in Whitehall\u201d. That contrasts with the accounts of Sage committee members, who told the Guardian they were active participants in meetings as far back as February. So what, exactly, were their contributions? 3) Why was Ben Warner attending meetings? While much attention has focused on the attendance of Cummings, there have been fewer questions about Warner, a data scientist who was reportedly recruited to Downing Street late last year after running the Conservative party\u2019s general election campaign model. Warner previously worked with Cummings on the Vote Leave campaign for Brexit. Warner\u2019s brother, Marc Warner, runs Faculty, an artificial intelligence company involved in an \u201cunprecedented\u201d data-mining operation as part of the government\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak. Ben Warner also used to work at his brother\u2019s AI company. 4) If political advisers can attend and ask questions, why not chief scientists and chief medical officers from the devolved governments? If this emergency is so severe it requires political appointees from Downing Street to attend and ask questions, why does it appear that chief scientists and chief medical officers \u2013 or their equivalents from the devolved governments in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Stormont \u2013 were not given the same influence? The Guardian understands that these officials had observer status at Sage meetings and, unlike Cummings and Warner, could only ask questions in advance, in writing. 5) Will the government now publish a full list of attendees at all Sage meetings? Critics of the secret decision to allow Cummings and Warner to take part argue this has greatly undermined public confidence in the role and independence of Sage. Many scientists, including past and present members of Sage, already believed the names of those who take part in Sage should be published. Vallance has said the \u201cdecision not to disclose\u201d membership of the committee was based on advice from the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure. \u201cThis contributes towards safeguarding individual members\u2019 personal security and protects them from lobbying and other forms of unwanted influence, which may hinder their ability to give impartial advice,\u201d he said. Dominic Raab has said the government has no plans to publish the list of participants. 6) Did any participants in Sage feel swayed by questions from Cummings or Warner? One of the main concerns about the attendance of someone as influential as Cummings is that his presence and questions may have swayed scientific advisers. As the prime minister\u2019s famously influential chief adviser, a contribution from Cummings, even in the form of a question, is likely to have carried significant weight in Sage meetings. As the former Brexit secretary David Davis told Sky News: \u201cThere\u2019s a thing called the Heisenberg principle, which says you can\u2019t observe something without influencing it.\u201d 7) What did Cummings tell the prime minister after each Sage meeting?

      "bodyText": "Downing Street\u2019s political advisers have never before attended meetings of the UK government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), according to a review of all publicly available minutes of meetings over the last decade. The Guardian revealed on Friday that the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, and another No 10 aide who worked with him on the Vote Leave campaign have been attending Sage meetings. Downing Street has insisted it is \u201centirely right\u201d for its political advisers to attend meetings of the group, which is supposed to provide the Cabinet Office with independent scientific advice on emergencies. Sage, which is chaired by the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, was first convened to provide scientific advice on swine flu in 2009. Since then, almost 50 Sage meetings have been held, including those convened to respond to the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull, the Fukushima nuclear disaster, 2013 winter flooding, the ebola outbreak, an earthquake in Nepal, the Zika outbreak and the near-collapse of a dam at the Toddbrook Reservoir last year. There is no evidence in the publicly available minutes of those meetings of any Downing Street officials or political advisers attending. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy did not dispute that Covid-19 Sage meetings marked the first time political advisers had attended. \u201cThe nature and scale of this emergency, which is impacting the UK in a more direct manner, differs from those that Sage has been mobilised for in the past and, as such, the rotating expert attendance and list of government officials involves a broader set of representatives,\u201d the spokesperson said. Downing Street did not dispute the minutes. The government has been adopting an unusually combative approach to journalists in recent weeks after a slew of articles by investigative reporters raised questions about how ministers are responding to the Covid-19 pandemic. On Friday, when the Guardian revealed Cummings had attended Sage, Downing Street released a statement saying: \u201cPublic confidence in the media has collapsed during this emergency partly because of ludicrous stories such as this.\u201d Last week, after the Sunday Times investigative report criticised Boris Johnson for failing take the pandemic seriously, the Department of Health published a blogpost saying the article contained \u201ca series of falsehoods\u201d and \u201cactively misrepresents\u201d the government\u2019s response. The Sunday Times flatly denied the \u201ckremlinesque\u201d accusations from the government. After the Financial Times last week exposed the \u201cmuddled thinking\u201d behind the government\u2019s ventilator procurement plan, the Cabinet Office reacted with an almost 3,000-word retaliation, which also took aim at the personal tweets by the newspaper\u2019s journalist Peter Foster. Reacting to Downing Street\u2019s trenchant criticism of the Guardian\u2019s reporting on Cummings and Sage over the weekend, Foster tweeted it was reminiscent of techniques used by Donald Trump\u2019s White House to \u201cmuddy waters, create world of equal and alternative \u2018facts\u2019 and traduce media\u201d.",

The boat drifted for five days, during which time five people died of thirst, according to survivors, and another seven people went missing, presumed drowned.</p> <p>Malta\u2019s prime minister, Robert Abela, is now<a href=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/malta-prime-minister-migrant-deaths-5078016-Apr2020/\"> under police investigation</a> for the incident but remains defiant: \u201cMy conscience is clear because we have done everything in our power to protect our people and all those who live in this country,\u201d he said, explaining that Malta\u2019s ports were closed during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cIn a health emergency, this country is not a safe port for migrants.\u201d</p> <p>To many people, this logic \u2013 we must look after our own \u2013 will seem unassailable, despite the costs.

Earlier this month, nearly 400 Rohingya refugees were found starving on a boat near Malaysia, which had reportedly <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-52305931\">cited the pandemic</a> as a reason not to take them in.</p> <p>Temporary limits on movement \u2013 within countries and cities, as well as internationally \u2013 are regarded by most public health experts as an essential part of the fight against the coronavirus.

In much of the world, people are desperate for the government to show up and rise to the challenge of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Reagan\u2019s attitude to government solidified into orthodoxy for more than three decades, spreading abroad \u2013 particularly in the UK with the help of Margaret Thatcher \u2013 and captured the centre ground of politics in both countries.</p> <p>The antipathy to the state was selective: Reagan, like Donald Trump today, racked up huge deficits, spent heavily on defence and built up a system of corporate welfare through subsidies and tax breaks. But on both sides of the Atlantic, the prevailing wisdom was the state should wherever possible get out of the business of trying to control inequality and provide services to the less fortunate.</p> <p>There are already some signs that the Covid-19 shock may challenge those attitudes.

      "bodyText": "Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1986 wisecrack \u2013 \u201cThe nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I\u2019m from the government and I\u2019m here to help\u201d \u2013 would not get a lot of laughs today. In much of the world, people are desperate for the government to show up and rise to the challenge of the coronavirus pandemic. Reagan\u2019s attitude to government solidified into orthodoxy for more than three decades, spreading abroad \u2013 particularly in the UK with the help of Margaret Thatcher \u2013 and captured the centre ground of politics in both countries. The antipathy to the state was selective: Reagan, like Donald Trump today, racked up huge deficits, spent heavily on defence and built up a system of corporate welfare through subsidies and tax breaks. But on both sides of the Atlantic, the prevailing wisdom was the state should wherever possible get out of the business of trying to control inequality and provide services to the less fortunate. There are already some signs that the Covid-19 shock may challenge those attitudes. Disease and mass unemployment have always been far better recruiting sergeants for the cause of big government than any party manifesto \u2013 and this crisis is unlikely to be an exception. Some social scientists and historians argue that this pandemic could become a turning point in social history \u2013 on a par with the New Deal in the US or the post-war Labour government in the UK. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on this kind of trajectory for last 30-odd years where the individual was taking priority over the collective. And now we\u2019re actually back into the kind of spirit that our parents and grandparents lived through in which communities have to pull together,\u201d Fiona Hill, a British-born historian who served on Trump\u2019s national security council. Hill pointed to the UK, where 750,000 people signed up as volunteers for the National Health Service (NHS) and a wave of climate activism on both sides of the Atlantic. \u201cI do think there is a huge appetite among younger people, trying to get more government action. I really do think we could start to see the tide turning here.\u201d Some of the biggest swings in public opinion have been in countries where the state\u2019s role in social welfare has been in most rapid retreat. The US and the UK stand out because the pandemic struck as their governments were seeking to roll back longstanding social welfare systems and are now scrambling to reassemble temporary versions of them on the run. What is not clear yet is whether these stopgap measures will evaporate as soon as Covid-19 is sufficiently contained for people to go back to work \u2013 or whether some of them will stick. The coronavirus pandemic could also boost statism of another kind \u2013 more Big Brother than Great Society \u2013 by providing cover for governments to restrict civil liberties and entrench themselves in power, as Viktor Orb\u00e1n has done in Hungary. There are few signs yet that China\u2019s leaders will be held accountable for their failure to contain the outbreak at its source, and their response to criticism has been further suppression of dissent and science. The outbreak has created a surge in digital monitoring of populations that many civil libertarians fear will harden afterwards into a permanently raised level of surveillance. The accretion of state power could accompany wider provision of public services, or take precedence over them. The less a government does for its people, the more it has to control them. In the US, the Trump administration is likely to face resistance if it seeks to withdraw forms of social support that have long been standard in most western democracies. \u201cThe whole pandemic, I think, has laid bare all of the inadequacies of the US social safety net,\u201d John Schmitt, the vice-president of the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, said. \u201cA very basic thing every other advanced economy in the world guarantees workers is at least a minimum amount of paid sick days. The US does not have at the national level any laws like that. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to imagine that there won\u2019t be significant support when the dust settles for state, local and federal legislation to address that incredibly longstanding policy failure,\u201d he said. There are two other areas where Schmitt predicted there would be strong demand for lasting change. One is unemployment insurance, currently a meagre patchwork of different state systems subject to minimum national standards. The other is the healthcare system. As a far broader cross-section of Americans face medical bankruptcy because they have partial or no health insurance, it will be harder for Trump to pursue his effort to obliterate the Obama administration\u2019s Affordable Care Act, which extended the scope of health insurance coverage, and could provide support for a more ambitious expansion of government-funded healthcare. For parallel reasons, it will be even harder politically for Boris Johnson to bargain away the fundamentals of the NHS at trade talks with Washington, after it saved his life. It is too early to predict how the coronavirus shock will affect the outcome of this year\u2019s US elections. All other things being equal, greater popularity for a government-funded social safety net should translate into more votes for Democrats, who have traditionally championed such policies. But Trump will seek to take that ground, insisting, for example, that his name is on the $600 cheques the federal government is sending out each week to supplement unemployment benefit. And the elections could be as much about cultural and political loyalties as social policy. Arlie Hochschild, a sociologist who has written extensively about the American right, said she had been watching responses to the crisis in Kentucky. \u201cTrump supporters are generally older people in poor health, and if they\u2019re blue-collar, they\u2019re actually less likely to have work that they can do from home,\u201d Hochschild said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened in this short period of time has challenged so much of what they believe in.\u201d Despite that, she said, the crisis seemed to have had little effect on political identification and affiliation. \u201cThere is no immediate turnaround in attitude.

An analysis of the financial returns compiled by 44 of England\u2019s largest councils shows that by the end of this financial year they will be in the red by \u00a32.2bn. If spending and losses at all councils continue to mount at predicted rates, the aggregated total for all English local authorities would be more than \u00a38bn for the year, or \u00a35bn after the first wave of government bailouts. Local government spending in England is about \u00a350bn a year. Councils have spent hundreds of millions more than expected during the lockdown on providing social care, personal protective equipment for staff, housing rough sleepers, and supplying emergency food packages, while losing even larger amounts in lost revenues from council tax, parking charges and leisure fees. Although ministers have provided \u00a33.2bn in two crisis bailouts in recent weeks, councils are warning much of this has already been spent \u2013 and some are understood to be drawing up fresh provisional cuts to balance their books, which would lead to services being drastically reduced, from waste disposal to arts, libraries and leisure. The unprecedented financial pressure has already forced a handful of councils to invoke controversial emergency powers under the Coronavirus Act, which allow them to suspend legal duties to provide aspects of social care \u2013 cost-saving measures that charities and human rights groups have warned will put older and disabled people at risk. The study of returns by councils in the Special Interest Group of Municipal Authorities (Sigoma), which includes authorities in Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle, Leicester and Nottingham, suggests this group of 47 authorities alone anticipate extra Covid-19 spending pressures totalling \u00a3720m over the year.

Extrapolated across the entire English local government landscape, this would leave councils with a funding shortfall of about \u00a35bn after the recent cash bailouts.

She was doing handstands by four years old, she was an Olympic gold medallist by 15 and this year at 23 she was finishing an exceptional college gymnastics career at UCLA. This was supposed to be the season that tied all the loose ends as she achieved her final goals and then departed into the night.

There is also concerns the public will not understand how to use a mask properly, and may get infected if they come into contact with the virus when they take it off and then touch their faces.</p>\n    <p>Also underlying the WHO\u2019s concerns is the shortage of high-quality protective masks for frontline healthcare workers.</p>\n    <p>Nevertheless, masks do have a role when used by people who are already infected. It is accepted that they can block transmission to other people. Given that many people with Covid-19 do not show any symptoms for the first days after they are infected, masks clearly have a potential role to play, especially on crowded public transport as people return to work..</p>\n    <p><b>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\">Sarah Boseley</a></b>&nbsp;<i>Health editor</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The reports come after the National Police Chiefs Council and the National College of Policing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/driving-for-exercise-allowed-under-lockdown-rules-police-advised-coronavirus\">issued new advice earlier in the month clarifying that driving to the countryside for walks</a> \u2013 where more time is spent walking than travelling \u2013 is among a list of reasonable excuses for people leaving their home during the coronavirus lockdown.

      "bodyText": "Some rural dwellers in England have turned to vigilantism by attempting to block roads, confront cyclists and erect signs in an effort to deter people from travelling to the countryside for exercise during the lockdown, the Guardian has been told. The National Rural Crime Network has received reports of \u201csmall-scale vigilantism\u201d by some residents growing angry at people driving long distances to the countryside, including beauty spots, for walks or cycle rides. In a worrying development, the organisation\u2019s chair said people had even been \u201caggressively driving at cyclists\u201d. Their behaviour has caused concern with those who point out people enjoying the countryside to exercise are not necessarily breaking government rules if they maintain physical distancing, with one police leader warning vigilantes not to take the law into their own hands. The Guardian has learned of a case in the Lake District where an abusive note was left on the windscreen of a family\u2019s car by a man who also threatened to damage their vehicle after they drove four miles from their home to go for a walk. The reports come after the National Police Chiefs Council and the National College of Policing issued new advice earlier in the month clarifying that driving to the countryside for walks \u2013 where more time is spent walking than travelling \u2013 is among a list of reasonable excuses for people leaving their home during the coronavirus lockdown. It followed criticism of perceived heavy-handed examples of policing during the lockdown, including Derbyshire police using drone footage to shame people going to the countryside to walk. Forces have powers to impose \u00a360 fines to people who break lockdown measures. The National Rural Crime Network, along with the National Farmers\u2019 Union, Countryside Alliance and Country Land and Business Association wrote to the justice secretary on 20 April, calling for an urgent review of the guidance as they highlighted concerns the guidance would \u201cencourage even more people to carry out unnecessarily long journeys to exercise in rural areas, which will in turn put increased pressures on rural police forces and communities\u201d.

But the right to jury trial was left out of the Human Rights Act, which merely adopted the European convention. Juries, as we know them, are not available in most continental countries, where first instance judges do an acceptable job of detailing rational reasons for findings of guilt that can then be scrutinised on appeal. There are cases in the UK where justice would be better served, and defendants would be better off, if they could choose trial by judge alone.</p> <p>Trial by judge alone operates in all international criminal courts and was introduced in Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles by the judge-only Diplock courts. There were civil liberty concerns at first but the Northern Ireland judges were generally astute and rejected some high profile RUC prosecutions. There is a rarely used power for prosecutors to apply for trial by judge alone, but only if they can show that the defendant is bent on jury tampering.</p> <p>Cases where defendants may prefer trial by judge alone are those where the prosecution does not have the evidence to exclude a reasonable doubt, and trial by judge would predictably produce a speedy acquittal. This could also be preferable in cases involving defendants demonised either in person or because of their racial or religious group. When I defended Irish terrorist suspects and black activists in earlier days, juror prejudice was inevitable due to oppressive police security arrangements in court precincts and sensational media coverage, and it resulted in some notoriously wrongful convictions. In such cases, a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial would have been more secure had they been entitled to opt for trial by judge alone.</p> <p>The most powerful argument against this was encapsulated by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/nov/13/lord-hutchinson-of-lullington-obituary\">Lord Hutchinson</a>\u2019s response to my proposal: \u201cIt sounds fine in principle, but it will be the thin end of the wedge.\u201d He was afraid, like many great criminal lawyers, that it would be the first step to abolishing a trial system that they knew instinctively was worth keeping. They thought it vulnerable to politicians\u2019 attraction to cheaper, speedier and more rational justice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/19/uk-courts-told-not-to-overreact-during-coronavirus-crisis\">UK courts told not to 'overreact' during coronavirus crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But provision of a jury waiver option will not lead to the demise of a form of trial that has so much public acceptance, in particular because it involves the public in the delivery of justice. None of the Australian states that allow defendants (but not prosecutors) to waive jury trials have moved on to abolish jurors. One state that does not allow waiver \u2013 Victoria \u2013 was recently faced with the trial of a cardinal (George Pell) accused of child sexual abuse. It had to be held in secret \u2013 the worst of all alternatives \u2013 because of fear that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/15/andrew-bolt-and-the-abc-did-the-reporting-on-george-pell-step-over-a-line\">publicity</a> could prejudice a follow-on trial (although in the event prosecutors withdrew those charges).

Had he been entitled to a trial by judge alone, this objectionable secrecy would never have been necessary.</p> <p>Jury waiver would help the justice system to handle some problems caused by Covid-19. But it should not be regarded either as a short-term expedient or as harbinger of the demise of jury trial. It should rather be accepted as the right of any person facing a substantial prison sentence to opt for trial by judge alone \u2013 or by three judges \u2013 in order to know the reasons why he or she is losing their liberty.</p> <p>\u2022 Geoffrey Robertson is a human rights barrister and founder of Doughty Street Chambers.

There are cases in the UK where justice would be better served, and defendants would be better off, if they could choose trial by judge alone. Trial by judge alone operates in all international criminal courts and was introduced in Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles by the judge-only Diplock courts. There were civil liberty concerns at first but the Northern Ireland judges were generally astute and rejected some high profile RUC prosecutions. There is a rarely used power for prosecutors to apply for trial by judge alone, but only if they can show that the defendant is bent on jury tampering. Cases where defendants may prefer trial by judge alone are those where the prosecution does not have the evidence to exclude a reasonable doubt, and trial by judge would predictably produce a speedy acquittal. This could also be preferable in cases involving defendants demonised either in person or because of their racial or religious group. When I defended Irish terrorist suspects and black activists in earlier days, juror prejudice was inevitable due to oppressive police security arrangements in court precincts and sensational media coverage, and it resulted in some notoriously wrongful convictions. In such cases, a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial would have been more secure had they been entitled to opt for trial by judge alone. The most powerful argument against this was encapsulated by Lord Hutchinson\u2019s response to my proposal: \u201cIt sounds fine in principle, but it will be the thin end of the wedge.\u201d He was afraid, like many great criminal lawyers, that it would be the first step to abolishing a trial system that they knew instinctively was worth keeping. They thought it vulnerable to politicians\u2019 attraction to cheaper, speedier and more rational justice. But provision of a jury waiver option will not lead to the demise of a form of trial that has so much public acceptance, in particular because it involves the public in the delivery of justice. None of the Australian states that allow defendants (but not prosecutors) to waive jury trials have moved on to abolish jurors. One state that does not allow waiver \u2013 Victoria \u2013 was recently faced with the trial of a cardinal (George Pell) accused of child sexual abuse. It had to be held in secret \u2013 the worst of all alternatives \u2013 because of fear that publicity could prejudice a follow-on trial (although in the event prosecutors withdrew those charges). His conviction has just been overturned by the high court because the jury failed to recognise a reasonable doubt. Had he been entitled to a trial by judge alone, this objectionable secrecy would never have been necessary. Jury waiver would help the justice system to handle some problems caused by Covid-19. But it should not be regarded either as a short-term expedient or as harbinger of the demise of jury trial. It should rather be accepted as the right of any person facing a substantial prison sentence to opt for trial by judge alone \u2013 or by three judges \u2013 in order to know the reasons why he or she is losing their liberty. \u2022 Geoffrey Robertson is a human rights barrister and founder of Doughty Street Chambers.

      "body": "<p>Senior doctors fear that thousands of routine vaccination appointments may be missed or delayed because of the coronavirus lockdown, raising the risk of sudden and potentially fatal outbreaks of other diseases when restrictions on movement are finally eased.</p> <p>GPs and accident and emergency departments have witnessed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/27/fears-seriously-ill-a-and-e-numbers-drop-coronavirus-nhs\">unprecedented falls</a> in the numbers of people seeking medical care in recent weeks, prompting concerns that vital routine immunisations for infections such as measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus and whooping cough are falling by the wayside.</p> <p>\u201cWe are very concerned. There are no data yet because we have only been in lockdown for a month, but there are plenty of anecdotes from practice nurses and others saying they have noticed a decline in vaccine uptake,\u201d said Helen Bedford, a professor of children\u2019s health at the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health and member of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health\u2019s health promotion committee.</p> <p>Similar worries have been borne out in the US, where health records released this week showed MMR (mumps, measles and rubella) shots were down 50% in the week of 5 April, with diphtheria and whooping cough immunisations down 42%.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re concerned this is going to have a major impact on immunisations here and also on the routine health checks that new babies have, because people are afraid to go to their general practice or fear general practice isn\u2019t open for business, and it very clearly is,\u201d Bedford said.</p> <p>Ministers and their expert advisers have repeatedly stressed the need for people to stay at home and save lives, but doctors are worried that those who need vaccinations are missing or deferring appointments for fear of either contracting the virus when they go out or adding to the burden on healthcare workers.</p> <p>In mid-March, many GP practices closed their doors and switched to telephone consultations with only a small number of patients receiving face-to-face examinations. Doctors have since reported fewer people coming forward with routine health issues and even potentially serious problems, such as cancer symptoms and poorly controlled diabetes and heart disease.</p> <p>\u201cChildhood immunisations and immunisations for vulnerable older people and people with multiple health problems are an absolute priority for us,\u201d said Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners.</p> <p>\u201cChildren can become very ill and die from the complications of common illnesses like measles that haven\u2019t gone away. And immunisation is a fundamentally important part of preventing that from happening. We cannot allow delays in immunisations to go on for a long time, otherwise we really will see a crisis,\u201d he added.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/26/as-we-wait-for-a-covid-19-jab-dont-forget-other-essential-vaccines\">a letter to the Guardian</a>, Marshall warned that it was \u201cessential\u201d for parents to get their children immunised during the Covid-19 epidemic and that a slump in vaccinations risked outbreaks of whooping cough, measles, mumps and rubella in the future.</p> <p>Doctors are particularly worried about children skipping the measles vaccination. Measles is roughly six times more infectious that Covid-19 and can be fatal in some cases. Last year, the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/19/mmr-vaccine-one-in-seven-five-year-olds-in-england-may-not-be-immunised\">lost its measles-free status</a> because of a fall in MMR immunisation, meaning that some parts of the country, such as London, are already at high risk of outbreaks.</p> <p>\u201cMeasles is massively more infectious than Covid-19 and because it\u2019s so infectious, you only need a small decline in vaccine uptake to start seeing outbreaks,\u201d Bedford said. \u201cThe pandemic doesn\u2019t make all the normal diseases go away. They are still circulating, but while we are all in our homes we are protected to a certain extent.

      "bodyText": "Senior doctors fear that thousands of routine vaccination appointments may be missed or delayed because of the coronavirus lockdown, raising the risk of sudden and potentially fatal outbreaks of other diseases when restrictions on movement are finally eased. GPs and accident and emergency departments have witnessed unprecedented falls in the numbers of people seeking medical care in recent weeks, prompting concerns that vital routine immunisations for infections such as measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus and whooping cough are falling by the wayside. \u201cWe are very concerned. There are no data yet because we have only been in lockdown for a month, but there are plenty of anecdotes from practice nurses and others saying they have noticed a decline in vaccine uptake,\u201d said Helen Bedford, a professor of children\u2019s health at the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health and member of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health\u2019s health promotion committee. Similar worries have been borne out in the US, where health records released this week showed MMR (mumps, measles and rubella) shots were down 50% in the week of 5 April, with diphtheria and whooping cough immunisations down 42%. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned this is going to have a major impact on immunisations here and also on the routine health checks that new babies have, because people are afraid to go to their general practice or fear general practice isn\u2019t open for business, and it very clearly is,\u201d Bedford said. Ministers and their expert advisers have repeatedly stressed the need for people to stay at home and save lives, but doctors are worried that those who need vaccinations are missing or deferring appointments for fear of either contracting the virus when they go out or adding to the burden on healthcare workers. In mid-March, many GP practices closed their doors and switched to telephone consultations with only a small number of patients receiving face-to-face examinations. Doctors have since reported fewer people coming forward with routine health issues and even potentially serious problems, such as cancer symptoms and poorly controlled diabetes and heart disease. \u201cChildhood immunisations and immunisations for vulnerable older people and people with multiple health problems are an absolute priority for us,\u201d said Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners. \u201cChildren can become very ill and die from the complications of common illnesses like measles that haven\u2019t gone away. And immunisation is a fundamentally important part of preventing that from happening. We cannot allow delays in immunisations to go on for a long time, otherwise we really will see a crisis,\u201d he added. In a letter to the Guardian, Marshall warned that it was \u201cessential\u201d for parents to get their children immunised during the Covid-19 epidemic and that a slump in vaccinations risked outbreaks of whooping cough, measles, mumps and rubella in the future. Doctors are particularly worried about children skipping the measles vaccination. Measles is roughly six times more infectious that Covid-19 and can be fatal in some cases. Last year, the UK lost its measles-free status because of a fall in MMR immunisation, meaning that some parts of the country, such as London, are already at high risk of outbreaks. \u201cMeasles is massively more infectious than Covid-19 and because it\u2019s so infectious, you only need a small decline in vaccine uptake to start seeing outbreaks,\u201d Bedford said. \u201cThe pandemic doesn\u2019t make all the normal diseases go away. They are still circulating, but while we are all in our homes we are protected to a certain extent. It\u2019s when we re-emerge that there is the potential for problems.\u201d She urged new parents to ask their GPs to combine immunisation appointments with routine checks on the mother and baby so that they only need to visit the doctor\u2019s surgery once. The lockdown is having a disproportionate impact on the ability of poorer people to get to appointments, while populations that already have low vaccination rates are expected to become even more vulnerable as their uptake drops further. \u201cThe important thing will be finding ways for children to catch up. There will have to be a catch-up process and that might be quite complicated,\u201d Bedford added. Dr Mary Ramsay, the head of immunisations at Public Health England, said: \u201cThe national immunisation programme is highly successful in preventing serious and sometimes life-threatening diseases, such as pneumonia, meningitis, whooping cough, diphtheria and measles. During this time, it is important to maintain the best possible vaccine uptake to prevent a resurgence of these infections.\u201d \u201cA vaccine will hopefully conquer Covid-19 and ultimately save lives,\u201d Marshall added. \u201cIt would be tragic if a consequence of this pandemic is that we see outbreaks of other deadly diseases for which vaccines already exist.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s energy suppliers are continuing to use debt collectors to chase unpaid bills after promising to help households during the coronavirus pandemic by offering payment plans to struggling customers. Under an agreement with the government, energy suppliers are expected to identify customers who might be in financial distress and offer to reassess, reduce or pause bill payments to help \u201creassure\u201d homes during the coronavirus lockdown. But many households and small businesses with outstanding balances on their energy accounts may still be targeted by debt collectors with warnings that action may be taken against them if they don\u2019t pay their bills. A letter sent by a debt collector on behalf of Shell Energy, seen by the Guardian, warns one customer that arrangements may be made for a doorstep collector to visit their home in order to chase an outstanding balance of \u00a378.51. It warned that Shell Energy would share the account holder\u2019s details with credit reference agencies which could hurt their ability to switch energy supplier, apply for a mortgage or borrow money. The letter was sent weeks after energy suppliers agreed to support customers who are financially impacted either directly or indirectly by the coronavirus lockdown. Alok Sharma, the business secretary, brought in the measures to help households which \u201cneed additional support and reassurance\u201d during the Covid-19 pandemic. They include an agreement that no customers should be cut off during the lockdown. Natalie Hitchins, from the consumer group, Which?, said: \u201cMany customers will have been financially impacted by the coronavirus, so it is concerning to hear that any energy supplier is using debt collectors to place pressure on customers who could be struggling during this difficult time, despite agreeing with the government to support customers in financial distress.\u201d The UK\u2019s largest energy suppliers, British Gas and Ovo Energy, said they were continuing to use debt collectors to engage with their customers. Both companies said they had instructed their debt collectors to offer financial help on their behalf. E.on UK, which merged with npower last year, said it was not handing any new customer details to third-party debt collection agencies but that its debt collectors would continue to pursue long-standing debts built up before the outbreak. A spokesman for Shell Energy said a letter from a debt collection company \u201cis a last-resort attempt to engage with a customer and only after we\u2019ve repeatedly asked them to get in contact to see how we can help\u201d. According to a government spokesman, some suppliers had offered to defer payment deadlines by up to three months and had also suspended following up on debts as part of a package of measures to help households weather the Covid-19 crisis. \u201cThis is a worrying time for people across the country and we would expect energy companies to take the current circumstances into account as they carry out their business,\u201d the spokesman said. There are also growing concerns over debt collectors who are targeting the UK\u2019s microbusinesses, which are often family-run and may have been hard-hit by the lockdown measures put in place to stop the spread of the virus. Ed Dodman, a director at the Energy Ombudsman, said: \u201cWhat we have noticed in the early days of the lockdown is that the proportion of financially vulnerable microbusinesses coming to us for assistance is higher than it was before the outbreak, indicating that small businesses, in particular, may be struggling with these issues. \u201cThe guidance is quite clear that energy suppliers must consider whether their customers are in financial difficulty and whether they can offer assistance.

      "bodyText": "John Lewis is reopening its textiles factory in Lancashire, which usually makes curtains, pillows and duvets, to make 8,000 clinical gowns for the NHS to help medical staff caring for coronavirus patients. The department store\u2019s Herbert Parkinson factory is bringing back 15 expert sewers from furlough, who will use medical-grade fabric to make washable protective gowns for staff at the Northumbria NHS foundation trust which runs at least nine hospitals and other clinical centres in the north-east. The move comes amid a shortage of protective equipment for NHS workers, and particularly protective gowns made with the non-woven, spun bond, laminate called SMMS, which John Lewis will use. Hospitals have turned to local businesses to help out as supplies of protective wear have been depleted. British textile firms have said they are desperate to contribute by making protective gear for the NHS, but central government has been slow to take up their offers of help. Sir James Mackey, the chief executive of Northumbria Healthcare NHS foundation trust, said: \u201cWe will be forever grateful for this support from John Lewis which will directly, and positively, impact on our frontline workers and patients \u2013 helping to keep them safe. \u201cIt is clear, we can only tackle the challenges faced through utilising local channels and relationships to do so. It is this spirit of pulling together that has helped us to achieve so many things over recent weeks at pace and without any outside influence. We need to embrace with open arms all offers of help and turn these into actions that support our staff and patients.\u201d Stuart McDonald, the head of Herbert Parkinson, said the factory expected to produce 2,000 gowns a week. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re all looking forward to reopening our factory and threading our sewing machines again to play our part in helping the NHS.\u201d John Lewis, which has been forced to close all its department stores under the government\u2019s measures to control the spread of coronavirus, is also donating more than 20,000 metres of cotton fabric from its haberdashery departments and warehouses to voluntary groups making scrubs, which are worn under protective gear, for the NHS. For the Love of Scrubs and Scrubs Glorious Scrubs, which have thousands of volunteers sewing at home, are expected to make about 6,000 scrubs with the material. John Lewis said it had already donated more than 400 metres of fabric to similar groups making face masks and scrubs for their local hospitals, pharmacies, care homes and communities. John Lewis is the latest textile maker to turn its hands to making protective equipment. British brand Barbour, best known for its waxed jackets, has made disposable gowns and medical scrubs from its South Shields factory for the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne, while Mulberry has switched its handbag factory in Somerset to making 8,000 gowns for NHS workers in Bristol. Burberry, best known for its coats, last week confirmed it has transformed its factory in Castleford to manufacture non-surgical gowns for the NHS. Scottish fabric specialist Don &amp; Low has developed a spunbond laminate fabric that would meet the same international standard as SMMS.",

      "body": "<p>France, Italy and Spain are preparing to loosen coronavirus restrictions, with other countries watching closely to see how some of the first and hardest-hit countries in Europe might safely emerge from their crippling lockdowns.</p> \n<p>After the US, where the number of infections is heading towards the 1m mark, with more than 53,000 deaths, the three countries have the highest numbers of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the world, according to <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">Johns Hopkins University</a>.</p> \n<p>The global death toll from the coronavirus pandemic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/coronavirus-nearly-60-new-cases-found-on-cruise-ship-in-japan\">passed 200,000</a> on Saturday, with more than 2.9m confirmed cases, rising rapidly in many countries but slowing in others because of lockdowns.</p> \n<p>Decisions on how and when to reopen will be vital to how people and businesses can cope with the pandemic, balancing the need for economies to restart with the risks of new outbreaks and further shutdowns.</p> \n<p>In Italy, which was the first European country to impose a lockdown in March, and where there have so far been close to 200,000 infections and at least 26,384 deaths, Giuseppe Conte <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-live-news-trump-steps-back-as-deaths-worldwide-pass-200000?page=with:block-5ea53c658f08e05690dc4b9f#block-5ea53c658f08e05690dc4b9f\">said manufacturing could restart</a> as soon as 4 May.</p> \n<p>The Italian prime minister said schools, however, would not reopen until September. Measures would be announced early this week, he told Italian daily La Repubblica.</p> \n<p>Tight lockdowns have been seen as a blunt but effective tool to halt infections until a vaccine is developed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/european_lockdown_easing/giv-3902cjoLZI15b9sE/\" data-alt=\"lockdown\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/european_lockdown_easing/giv-3902cjoLZI15b9sE/\">lockdown</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Some countries have imposed less restrictive measures, for example Sweden, where shops, restaurants and junior schools have stayed open. Possibly as a result, Sweden\u2019s death rate from Covid-19 is nearly 200 per million people, compared with 31 per million in neighbouring Finland and 36 per million in Norway.</p> \n<p>The country\u2019s chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/sweden-queries-basis-of-lockdowns-as-germany-keeps-its-guard-up\">has argued</a> that the effectiveness of lockdowns and border closures has not yet been properly analysed and that Sweden\u2019s high infection rate <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/22/no-lockdown-in-sweden-but-stockholm-could-see-herd-immunity-in-weeks.html\">might help it</a> in the future as more people will become immune.</p> \n<p>However, Sweden\u2019s deputy prime minister, Isabella L\u00f6vin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-live-news-trump-steps-back-as-deaths-worldwide-pass-200000\">told the BBC</a> it was not yet fully clear if people who had been infected would be immune. She also said the country had a \u201cbig problem\u201d with its main strategy after outbreaks in elderly care homes.</p> \n<p>There was debate at the weekend on the topic of immunity after the World Health Organization (WHO) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/who-warns-against-coronavirus-immunity-passports\">said</a> there was no evidence that people who had recovered were immune. After criticism from scientists, the agency rowed back, clarifying that it expected people to develop some level of protection but that it was not clear how much and how long it would last.</p> \n<p>Unlike Sweden, France has imposed a mandatory tight lockdown for weeks. The country\u2019s prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-french-pm-to-set-out-road-to-normality-restrictions-ease-in-australia\">said he would present a national exit strategy</a> to parliament on Tuesday, which would then debate and vote on the recommendations.</p> \n<p>The pandemic has killed at least 22,614 people in France, with officials on Saturday reporting 369 new deaths in the previous 24 hours.</p> \n<p>Seventeen priorities have been identified for bringing France out of lockdown. These include reopening schools, companies returning to work, getting public transport back to normal, the supply of masks and sanitiser, testing policy and support for elderly people.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"80b87cf5-2e64-4762-bcbd-8492cef33963\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zqgJFGn66pY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In Spain, health authorities have also begun to outline plans for a move towards \u201ca new normality\u201d as the number of overnight coronavirus deaths in the country dropped below 300 for the first time in weeks. As of Sunday, children under 14 were allowed out to exercise for the first time since mid-March, and the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, announced that adults could also be allowed to exercise outside from next weekend.</p> \n<p>Speaking on Sunday, Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies, said recent figures showed a \u201cclear descending trend\u201d. The government\u2019s decision to allow some non-essential workers to return to their jobs a fortnight ago had not had any negative impact so far, he said.</p> \n<p>Spain has confirmed a total of 207,634 cases and recorded 23,190 deaths, its health ministry reported.

      "bodyText": "France, Italy and Spain are preparing to loosen coronavirus restrictions, with other countries watching closely to see how some of the first and hardest-hit countries in Europe might safely emerge from their crippling lockdowns. After the US, where the number of infections is heading towards the 1m mark, with more than 53,000 deaths, the three countries have the highest numbers of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University. The global death toll from the coronavirus pandemic passed 200,000 on Saturday, with more than 2.9m confirmed cases, rising rapidly in many countries but slowing in others because of lockdowns. Decisions on how and when to reopen will be vital to how people and businesses can cope with the pandemic, balancing the need for economies to restart with the risks of new outbreaks and further shutdowns. In Italy, which was the first European country to impose a lockdown in March, and where there have so far been close to 200,000 infections and at least 26,384 deaths, Giuseppe Conte said manufacturing could restart as soon as 4 May. The Italian prime minister said schools, however, would not reopen until September. Measures would be announced early this week, he told Italian daily La Repubblica. Tight lockdowns have been seen as a blunt but effective tool to halt infections until a vaccine is developed. Some countries have imposed less restrictive measures, for example Sweden, where shops, restaurants and junior schools have stayed open. Possibly as a result, Sweden\u2019s death rate from Covid-19 is nearly 200 per million people, compared with 31 per million in neighbouring Finland and 36 per million in Norway. The country\u2019s chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, has argued that the effectiveness of lockdowns and border closures has not yet been properly analysed and that Sweden\u2019s high infection rate might help it in the future as more people will become immune. However, Sweden\u2019s deputy prime minister, Isabella L\u00f6vin, told the BBC it was not yet fully clear if people who had been infected would be immune. She also said the country had a \u201cbig problem\u201d with its main strategy after outbreaks in elderly care homes. There was debate at the weekend on the topic of immunity after the World Health Organization (WHO) said there was no evidence that people who had recovered were immune. After criticism from scientists, the agency rowed back, clarifying that it expected people to develop some level of protection but that it was not clear how much and how long it would last. Unlike Sweden, France has imposed a mandatory tight lockdown for weeks. The country\u2019s prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, said he would present a national exit strategy to parliament on Tuesday, which would then debate and vote on the recommendations. The pandemic has killed at least 22,614 people in France, with officials on Saturday reporting 369 new deaths in the previous 24 hours. Seventeen priorities have been identified for bringing France out of lockdown. These include reopening schools, companies returning to work, getting public transport back to normal, the supply of masks and sanitiser, testing policy and support for elderly people. In Spain, health authorities have also begun to outline plans for a move towards \u201ca new normality\u201d as the number of overnight coronavirus deaths in the country dropped below 300 for the first time in weeks. As of Sunday, children under 14 were allowed out to exercise for the first time since mid-March, and the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, announced that adults could also be allowed to exercise outside from next weekend. Speaking on Sunday, Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies, said recent figures showed a \u201cclear descending trend\u201d. The government\u2019s decision to allow some non-essential workers to return to their jobs a fortnight ago had not had any negative impact so far, he said. Spain has confirmed a total of 207,634 cases and recorded 23,190 deaths, its health ministry reported. The growth rate of new cases stands at 0.8% \u2013 down from 3% in recent weeks and 38% when the state of emergency was declared on 14 March. Several other European countries, including Belgium, Greece and Malta, have already announced a tentative easing of restrictions. Elsewhere, there has been pressure to lift the lockdown. In Jerusalem, Israeli police clashed with merchants at a fruit and vegetable market that was prevented from reopening on Sunday while other highstreets shops were. In Berlin, dozens of protesters were arrested on Saturday for a demonstration against the lockdown. However, Hong Kong\u2019s top epidemiologist has warned against easing lockdowns in Europe too soon, saying \u201cyou need a sledgehammer\u201d to bring down the rate of infections first. Worldwide, a lack of testing and discrepancies in reporting from country to country make it impossible to fully track where and how the virus is spreading. In Africa, the crisis appeared to be just beginning. A sudden rise of more than 40% in the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases during the last 10 days across the continent \u2013 to 30,300 \u2013 and a similar increase in the number of deaths \u2013 to 1,374 \u2013 has worried specialists. The WHO has warned of 10 million cases in Africa within three to six months, though experts say that the death toll could be lower if authorities can move swiftly to contain outbreaks of the disease. \u201cWe are at the beginning in Africa,\u201d Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO\u2019s health emergencies programme, said last week. South and Central America, by contrast, are already deep in crisis, with Brazil emerging as a significant epidemic hotspot. Cases of Covid-19 are overwhelming hospitals, morgues and cemeteries, even as President Jair Bolsonaro insists it is a relatively minor disease. Other developments around the world include: Russia reported 6,361 new cases of coronavirus on Sunday, pushing its national tally above 80,000. The daily death toll in Iran, the worst-hit country in the Middle East, has fallen to its lowest level in weeks. Officials said there were 60 deaths from coronavirus in the past 24 hours, down from an average of about 90 over the past 10 days. In the UK, the death toll at hospitals also appeared to show a slowdown, with an increase of 413 in the last 24 hours, the lowest daily rise since the end of March. State media in Saudi Arabia are reporting that the curfew there will be partially lifted for all regions starting on Sunday, but that a 24-hour curfew will be maintained in Mecca. Certain economic and commercial activities, including retail stores, will reopen during Ramadan, from 29 April to 13 May. India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, urged the country\u2019s 1.3 billion citizens to strictly comply to a nationwide lockdown as the number of confirmed cases increased steadily despite the month-long curfew.",

A bit like being on holiday in Spain except, instead of that chilled feeling of waiting for an enormous seafood lunch and another cold bottle, there\u2019s a very different chilled feeling, like the dread of waiting day after day for test results.</p> <p>Meanwhile, normal chit-chat with Harry Next Door about mice and meds has hit full cosmic implosion. Some of the morning tablets he laid out last thing at night have been eaten by a mouse. Apparently, it found the Gabapentin capsules delicious.

      "bodyText": "Trump rambling like Tony Soprano\u2019s mum Oh, thank God that\u2019s over. Feels so good to be out and about again, meeting people, hugging the grandchildren. And wow! We\u2019re on a giant waterslide in the jungle too! Wait, there\u2019s Iain Duncan-Smith in a smoking jacket, giving me notes on my 100-stanza poem about a magic breakfast. Luckily, I can shoot him dead and \u2013 oh, I see brain, thanks a lot. Just another dream, shattered before I could even pull the trigger. Cheers. Now I\u2019m awake, pursued by news. I abseil quickly past the mass graves, past Trump\u2019s latest mad ramblings in the style of Tony Soprano\u2019s mum, past The Collapse of Everything. I reach the bottom of the Guardian homepage and stay there for a while, staring gratefully at the image of a harmless toasted cheese sandwich. It\u2019s just an article about making the perfect sandwich. I want to burst into song, or tears. Remember happier times, when there was only full-spectrum eco-cide to fear? Update: once you\u2019ve pushed through the novel-virus-sphere, all the Old Testament bangers are still there. War. Famine. Noah-level maxi-floods. Forests of pure fire. Religious poison sprayed into the air from the Midwest to the Middle East. ALSO, melting Arctic ice is about to release a whole new toxic anthology of ancient pandem classics: rare Mesolithic deep cuts, some real body-slamming hard-plague ward-fillers. Kindness is everywhere. This will pass Perhaps as a nod to this larger narrative, the weather here in Lancaster has been full-on sarcastic. Really sunny, but with crazy gusting wind. A bit like being on holiday in Spain except, instead of that chilled feeling of waiting for an enormous seafood lunch and another cold bottle, there\u2019s a very different chilled feeling, like the dread of waiting day after day for test results. Meanwhile, normal chit-chat with Harry Next Door about mice and meds has hit full cosmic implosion. Some of the morning tablets he laid out last thing at night have been eaten by a mouse. Apparently, it found the Gabapentin capsules delicious. I like to think it had a fearless life, and a neuropathically painless death. We must seek the light in the gloom, the toasted cheese sandwich in the newsfeed. Kindness is everywhere. People, demonstrably, are mostly brilliant. This will pass. My grandsons, who live in Seoul, went back to nursery school last week \u2013 in masks, but still. Our little pond\u2019s alive with tadpoles.

It advised having hand gel in all school lavatories, classrooms and entrances, with classrooms, canteens and common areas, particularly staircases and door handles, disinfected several times a day. The academy also advised that pupils should have their temperature taken before entering the school. Those living in cities who use public transport to reach work and schools are also worried about how social distancing measures will be maintained if they are expected back at their jobs. It has been suggested the government will make wearing masks on public transport obligatory, but it has failed to explain where the masks will come from or how they will be distributed. France\u2019s Sunday newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche (JDD) reported an internal note from the junior economy minister Agn\u00e8s Pannier-Runacher, which stated: \u201cThe national weekly production and imports [of masks] is still not enough at this stage to fully cover the need\u201d. The note suggested there may be enough masks by 18 May, one week after the end of lockdown begins. An Ifop opinion poll for the JDD showed confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the health crisis, that reached a high of 55% in March, had dropped to 39%. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dabi, Ifop\u2019s director, said Macron\u2019s national address on 13 April had brought a boost in popularity but since then \u201cconcern about the return to school and the summer holidays have worsened\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Last week, I spoke to a man called Richard Kempner about the recent death of his mother, Sheila. It was a difficult and impossibly moving conversation, made all the more affecting by the fact that the previous night he had forwarded me photographs and videos of her that went back nearly 30 years.</p> \n<p>On Easter Saturday, she died, aged 86, in the care home where she had lived since late last year. For 20 years she had suffered from an increasingly debilitating immune condition \u2013 but after she moved in, her health had taken a noticeable upswing. Then, for the three weeks prior to her death, lockdown meant that she could not see any visitors and remained confined to her room. Despite these precautions, her family were then told that a case of Covid-19 had possibly \u201cimpacted\u201d the care home. </p> \n<p>Not much more than a week later, Sheila\u2019s apparent infection with Covid-19 was confirmed by a \u201cvirtual\u201d diagnosis from the home\u2019s GP; she spent her dying moments deprived of the love and attention of her closest relatives. As her son understood it, what her story seemed to come down to was the lack of both testing for care workers and personal protective equipment. \u201cCovid walked into her room,\u201d he told me. \u201cBecause she couldn\u2019t, and didn\u2019t, walk out of it.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Earlier this month, Robert Peston called people who live in some care homes 'inmates', which is quite a Freudian slip</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>What he told me highlighted something that has now become a central part of the UK\u2019s experience of the virus, and a growing sense of collective shame: the neglect of the <a href=\"https://www.ageuk.org.uk/globalassets/age-uk/documents/policy-positions/care-and-support/ppp_care_homes.pdf\">400,000 older people</a> who live in British care homes and the people who devote themselves to their wellbeing, something made even clearer by the fact that the level of deaths in these settings \u2013 estimated to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/uk-care-home-covid-19-deaths-may-be-five-times-government-estimate\">at least 7,500</a> \u2013 seems to have been woefully underrepresented in official statistics. Along with the fact that the pored-over daily figure for Covid-19 deaths omits care homes, this compounds a sense that such fatalities do not quite count.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe truth about what\u2019s really happening to older people in care homes needs to be shouted about, not hidden,\u201d said Richard. \u201cI can only assume that they [the government] are doing that because they\u2019re embarrassed about how they\u2019ve handled this whole situation.\u201d</p> \n<p>This aspect of the UK\u2019s Covid-19 story blurs into things that long predate this crisis. Some of them highlight the fact that care for older people is still based around an archipelago of homes and so-called \u201cproviders\u201d, and the continuing absence of any solution to the issues collectively grouped under the heading of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/21/its-time-to-declare-a-social-care-emergency\">social </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/aug/21/its-time-to-declare-a-social-care-emergency\">care</a>. But there is something else at the heart of how badly many older people have been treated \u2013 and, indeed, the discomfiting sense that some see the deaths from Covid-19 of people over 70 and those with \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/19/underlying-conditions-coronavirus-health\">underlying health conditions</a>\u201d as the natural order of things. Perhaps the latter is part of our collective coping mechanism. But it also highlights a set of prejudices about older people that have sat in the culture for far too long.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8ae9cd5d-78b0-452a-95c3-d7c7e7d2ca18\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BoLft-buwJ0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Up until a month ago, residential settings for older people rarely figured in the national conversation, and too few of us thought about the vital work so many dedicated people do in them. By way of grim symbolism, the archetypal care home existed in our shared imagination as somewhere distant from everyday life, and somehow still and silent. People in power seemed content for such places to remain a byword for low-paid work. Earlier this month, the TV journalist Robert Peston called people who live in some care homes \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Peston/status/1246860610626871296\">inmates</a>\u201d, which is quite a Freudian slip.</p> \n<p>Not much more than a month ago, a charity called the Centre for Ageing Better published a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/19/older-people-widely-demonised-uk-ageism-report\">report called Doddery But Dear?</a>, full of grimly familiar cultural observations. \u201cMetaphors such as \u2018grey tsunami\u2019, \u2018demographic cliff\u2019 and \u2018demographic timebomb\u2019 present old age in terms of crisis,\u201d it said, \u201creflecting a perception of old age and the \u2018baby boomer\u2019 generation as a societal burden.\u201d Two years ago, research published by the Royal Society for Public Health found that a quarter of people aged 18-34 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jun/08/ageism-widespread-in-uk-study-finds\">believed it was normal</a> for older people to be unhappy and depressed \u2013 and across all age groups, nearly a third of people surveyed agreed with the statement \u201cbeing lonely is just something that happens when people get old\u201d. Strikingly, two-thirds of the respondents said they had no friends with an age gap of 30 years or more.</p> \n<p>There are plenty of other manifestations of these generational estrangements and the prejudices they incubate. Whatever the substance of the debate about assisted dying, its most unthinking supporters sometimes risk reducing frailty to a pretext for euthanasia, as if the future will make care for people approaching the end of their lives unthinkable. And what of Brexit? Far too many people have fallen into the habit of using the generational split in views about the EU as an excuse for thinking of older people as impossibly reactionary and therefore worthy of sneering contempt. To make things even worse, the insecure realities of 21st-century life for younger people have fostered the idea that if older people have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/aug/04/homeownership-the-generation-that-had-it-so-good\">lucky enough to buy their home</a> and receive a half-decent pension, that somehow characterises them as the recipients of unjust luxury. These things have fed into a dysfunctional mess of stuff that resonates with where we have ended up: the key issue right now may be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/20/uk-coronavirus-response-nhs-local-government-care-homes-british-politicians\">rank incompetence</a> of people in government, but our attitudes to older people are relevant, at least.</p> \n<p>We should worry about age-based divisions getting worse. It seems that sooner or later, as the terms of the current lockdown are changed, millions of people will be encouraged to tentatively go back into the world. But there is also talk of those aged over 70 \u2013 millions of whom are fit, active and as involved in their communities as anyone else \u2013 being instructed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/older-people-could-face-extended-coronavirus-lockdown-lords-hears\">carry on living under lockdown</a>. The result will be the strange spectacle of a society seemingly devoid of older people, with their friends and relatives still instructed to keep them at a distance: the reverse, in fact, of what an age-segregated society like ours demands.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/23/uk-key-workers-ppe-ministers-clapping-protect-nhs\">While the UK's key workers lack PPE, ministers clapping for them is an insult | Owen Jones</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>That is yet another example of the cruelties of this virus, and how much it cuts across some of the most basic aspects of our common humanity.

He pointed out that only a third of the usual workforce was available to farmers. <br></li> \n   <li><strong>Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, said he would have no problem with the government publishing the membership of Sage.</strong> But Eustice defended keeping the composition of the group secret, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s important scientists can have discussions free of external influence.\u201d He also said it was important to protect their security. </li> \n   <li><strong>Eustice claimed there had been a \u201cdramatic improvement\u201d in food supplies.</strong> He said grocery supplies were back to normal levels and panic-buying had subsided. </li> \n   <li><strong>Powis said he was encouraged by the decline in hospital admissions and deaths</strong>. \u201cAll our efforts, hard though they might be, have begun to pay off,\u201d he said.

There was a straightforward system already in place, he said. But there are thousands of independently run care homes, which makes it more difficult.

You\u2019ll be hearing from the PM over the next week, he said.</p> \n  <p>Powis said the information that was needed to lift the lockdown was not available.

The warning came as the academic developing the app admitted that 60% of population would need to sign up to the app to make it effective. </p> \n  <p>Clare Collier, advocacy director at Liberty, said: \u201cBy presenting surveillance tools as a solution to lockdown, the government is drawing on the willingness we have all shown to make sacrifices in the face of this crisis while refusing to show it is taking seriously the enormous risks presented by invasive technology.</p> \n  <p>She added: \u201cContact-tracing technology may require us to sacrifice deeply sensitive personal information and there can be no question of state bodies or private companies sharing our personal data other than what is absolutely necessary. It is vital no-one is coerced into having the app installed, and using it as a condition for returning to work or everyday life will inevitably lead to discrimination.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe opportunities presented by technology should be fully investigated, but seeking quick solutions in surveillance tools that rely on our personal data creates serious long-term threats to our rights and ways of life. The government needs to focus on providing a public health response that ensures we come through this crisis with our rights intact.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Prof Christophe Fraser of the University of Oxford, who is leading a team developing the app, said that it would a require a very high take-up to be effective. </p> \n  <p>\u201cFor this intervention alone to stop a resurgence of the epidemic, about 60% of the population would have to use the app,\u201d he told the BBC. </p> \n  <p>He added: \u201cThe app is going to be one of the building blocks of how to get out of the epidemic. For every one to two users who download the app, and who adhere to the instructions, you will prevent one infection.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He explained if you become infected the app will send warning messages to anyone you have who has come within Bluetooth range of your phone. He said: \u201cYou\u2019ll either get a message which says you\u2019ve been in contact with a suspect case of Covid-19.

      "bodyText": "Here are the key points from the Downing Street briefing: The increase in daily hospital deaths from coronavirus is at it lowest level since the end of March. George Eustice, the environment secretary, said 413 people had died in hospital, taking the total to 20,732. This is the lowest level since 3o March but it is expected to increase during the working week. Eustice said furloughed workers would be encouraged to take on second jobs as fruit pickers to help farmers struggling with labour supplies. He pointed out that only a third of the usual workforce was available to farmers. Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, said he would have no problem with the government publishing the membership of Sage. But Eustice defended keeping the composition of the group secret, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s important scientists can have discussions free of external influence.\u201d He also said it was important to protect their security. Eustice claimed there had been a \u201cdramatic improvement\u201d in food supplies. He said grocery supplies were back to normal levels and panic-buying had subsided. Powis said he was encouraged by the decline in hospital admissions and deaths. \u201cAll our efforts, hard though they might be, have begun to pay off,\u201d he said. But he added: \u201cThis is not the time to say: \u2018We\u2019ve done a good job, we need to stop complying with social distancing.\u2019\u201d That\u2019s it for today. They\u2019ll be more from about 7.30am on Monday. You can follow the latest on our coronavirus outbreak section, and also on our global liveblog Q: What extra help can the government give to local councils on social care? What evidence is there that deaths in care home reducing? And was it an oversight not to include care home deaths in the daily figure? Eustice said the government recognised there were new burdens on councils, which is why they had been given extra cash. Powis said it was easier to count daily deaths in NHS hospitals. There was a straightforward system already in place, he said. But there are thousands of independently run care homes, which makes it more difficult. There is a longer time for deaths in the community to be reported and recorded, he pointed out. Q: How will the government enforce quarantine measures for those going on holiday? And are we beyond the peak of the epidemic? Eustice said international travel could become more of a significant risk that needs to be managed. No decisions have been taken in this space yet, he said. Powis said over the last few weeks that previously upward curves in infections and deaths had started to decline. That change has happened because people have been following the guidance. He said he feared the curves could go in an upward direction again. This was exactly the time to keep up the effort, he said, and the slight uptick in transport needed to be watched. Q: Are we going to have to get used to food shortages? Eustice said there was not a serious interruption to international food supplies. There was a problem with stacking shelves, he said, but there had been a \u201cdramatic improvement\u201d in supermarket supplies. He said he was acutely aware that the British season of soft fruit was about to start, with only a third of the usual workforce available. Furloughed staff could help with picking in June, he said. Q: When will the PM set out a lockdown exit strategy? What evidence is there for care home deaths coming down? Eustice said the lockdown would be reviewed in two weeks. It\u2019s important that we don\u2019t risk a second peak, he said. You\u2019ll be hearing from the PM over the next week, he said. Powis said the information that was needed to lift the lockdown was not available. He cited research about immunity to the virus. He said this was not going to be binary but was going to be a continually evolving approach. Q: How can the public get an idea of the balance of Sage without confirmation of the membership? And when will contact tracing resume? Eustice said it was important that scientists could have discussions free of influence. The composition of the committee also changes, he said. Powis says he has no problem with the names of the members of Sage being published. On contact tracing, he said it takes a lot of resources. A digital app will help, he said. It is easier to do when there are fewer people, he said. Q: Could schools open and when will care home patients be tested? Eustice said social distancing would need to take place when schools opened, but he gave no commitment to opening schools. Powis said the R reproduction number needs to be below 1 before schools could be open. It is highly likely that there will be a \u201ccombination of measures\u201d to try to keep that number below 1. He said testing was expanding at the moment and that it was important that it continued to expand. Powis showed encouraging data suggesting that hospitals admissions were down. \u201cWe now have a very definite trend in the reduced number of people in hospitals with Covid-19,\u201d he said. Eustice repeated that it was too early to talk about easing the lockdown. He stressed that the government would need to see progress on its five tests before the lockdown could be eased. Eustice said 413 people were reported to have died with coronavirus in UK hospitals in the last 24 hours, taking the UK\u2019s total of hospital deaths to 20,732. This is the lowest daily rise since the end of March. Eustice said 29,058 tests were completed on Saturday - still way behind the target of 100,000. He said the number of hospital admissions had fallen to 15,953. The environment secretary, George Eustice, is about to lead today\u2019s Downing Street briefing. He will be joined by Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England. Some rural dwellers in England have turned to vigilantism by attempting to block roads, confront cyclists and erect signs in an effort to deter people from travelling to the countryside for exercise during the lockdown, the Guardian has been told. The National Rural Crime Network has received reports of \u201csmall-scale vigilantism\u201d by certain residents growing angry at people driving long distances to the countryside and other beauty spots, for walks or cycle rides. The organisation\u2019s chair said people had even been \u201caggressively driving at cyclists\u201d. Their behaviour has caused concern with those who point out people enjoying the countryside to exercise are not necessarily breaking government rules if they maintain physical distancing, with one police leader telling vigilantes not to take the law into their own hands. Senior doctors fear that thousands of routine vaccination appointments may be missed or delayed because of the coronavirus lockdown, raising the risk of sudden and potentially fatal outbreaks of other diseases when restrictions on movement are finally eased. GPs and A&amp;E departments have witnessed unprecedented falls in the numbers of people seeking medical care in recent weeks, prompting concerns that vital routine immunisations for infections such as measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus and whooping cough are falling by the wayside. Helen Bedford, a professor of children\u2019s health at the UCL Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, said: \u201cWe are very concerned. There are no data yet because we have only been in lockdown for a month, but there are plenty of anecdotes from practice nurses and others saying they have noticed a decline in vaccine uptake.\u201d Bedford is also a member of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health\u2019s health promotion committee. Second home owners in Wales could be ordered to leave their properties under \u201cdraconian\u201d measures adopted by the Welsh government, the first minister has said, according to PA. Mark Drakeford said there were discussions with the police and local authorities about enforcing such a ban. On Friday revised lockdown regulations were published, which made it clear people cannot remain away from the place they live. This was seen in some quarters as a way of clamping down on the use of second homes as there had been calls for a ban on travelling to the properties. Drakeford told the BBC\u2019s Politics Wales programme: If you are going to say to people who are in their own homes that they can be forcibly removed and sent away there are human rights and legal issues and we have to be sure we have thought through. We have been talking to the police about the enforcement issues they would face and they in turn believe the local authorities have to be involved because it is the local authorities who know which homes are occupied on a second-home basis. We are going to work on that further. It is a very draconian step indeed to say to people who are occupying a place they themselves own, of which a couple of months ago you would have been astonished to hear a government say, that you could forcibly remove them. If we are going to get to that position we have got to do it and be confident that the law is secure under our feet, that it is a proportionate thing to do and we can enforce it if we do decide to do it. Last week a group of doctors from across Wales called for second homes to be made illegal during the pandemic and said non-essential travel to them was highly likely to increase the presence of Covid-19 in rural areas. John Lewis is reopening its textiles factory in Lancashire, which usually makes curtains, pillows and duvets, to make 8,000 clinical gowns for the NHS to help medical staff caring for coronavirus patients. The department store\u2019s Herbert Parkinson factory is bringing back 15 sowing experts from furlough, who will use medical-grade fabric to make washable protective gowns for staff at the Northumbria NHS foundation trust, which runs at least nine hospitals and other clinical centres in the north-east. The move comes amid a shortage of protective equipment for NHS workers, and particularly protective gowns made with the non-woven, spun-bond laminate called SMMS, which John Lewis will use. The eminent barrister and writer Philippe Sands, suggests that the attorney general, Suella Braverman, should intervene to stop Dominic Cummings from attending Sage meetings. Braverman is best known for her enthusiasm for Brexit and loyalty to the government, so this seems highly unlikely, but it\u2019s an interesting suggestion. Testing for coronavirus remains a particular problem in Wales. A reader, who did not want to be named, emailed a photo of an empty testing centre at Cardiff Stadium at 1.45pm on Sunday. The reader said: In general, I think we in Wales are being really let down as there is no worthwhile scrutiny \u2013 the UK press are ignoring devolution differences. The Welsh government has scraped a target for 5,000 tests per day blaming problems with obtaining supplies. And health minister Vaughan Gething claimed the lockdown had been so effective that 5,000 tests per day were no longer needed. Despite daily testing capacity increasing to 1,800, the numbers of completed tests fell from 1,301 on Friday to 775 on Saturday, Public Health Wales said. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, has defended the delay in launching an online system for key workers to book coronavirus tests in Wales. Speaking to the BBC he said he wanted to ensure the online booking system worked before it was launched. We have been testing the system over this week and we have been using it already with some workers to make sure it will withstand the pressure it is bound to come under, and we hope to be able to use it more extensively next week. In England, where you have seen they have used it for the last two days, the system has fallen over within a couple of hours of it being released. That is because of the demand that system came under. We want to try and make sure our system will be robust from the first day. Public Health Wales has announced that deaths in Wales have risen by 14 to 778. It also said that infections had increased by 178 to 9,078. NHS England has announced that 336 people have died in hospital from coronavirus, taking England\u2019s total hospital deaths to 18,420. This is the lowest daily rise announced by the NHS England since the end of March. Lower figures tend to be announced on Sundays when there are fewer staff to verify the numbers. The victims were aged between 28 and 100 years old. Only 22 of the victims had no known underlying health condition. At the start of the outbreak, deaths were concentrated in London. Now the deaths are more evenly spread across England. The NHS gave this breakdown: East of England: 49 London: 64 Midlands: 57 North-east and Yorkshire: 66 North-west: 46 South-east: 43 South-west: 11 There have been 18 more coronavirus deaths in Scotland, takings its death toll to 1,249. The Scottish government also announced that 10,324 people had tested positive for the virus. The director of Sense About Science and former chief executive of the Science Council has called on the government to be more open about its scientific advisory group after the Guardian revealed that Dominic Cummings had attended some of its meetings. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s World At One programme, Tracey Brown said \u201copacity is the problem\u201d. She said: I think the composition of that committee is something for government to justify and explain and would only make sense if government did start explaining its thinking in how it\u2019s using the output of that committee, what weight it is giving to different advice in looking at the trade-offs that we\u2019ve got to make to work our way through this crisis. The focusing on Sage and particular members of Sage \u2013 we\u2019re going to see more of this circus, sort of outing of people, the differences in decisions, the differences in advice, differences in views and that kind of thing unless government works out how to get into a better conversation with the nation. While former Vote Leave campaigner Ben Warner has been sitting in on Sage meetings alongside Dominic Cummings, his brother, Marc Warner, has been given a role in developing the contact tracing app. Marc, the founder of Faculty AI, has been recruited to advice the government on the data science, Carole Caldwalladr reminds us. Marc Warner previously co-authored a paper by Oxford\u2019s Big Data Institute backing the concept. We should point out that the Scott Trust, the ultimate owner of the Guardian, is the sole investor in GMG Ventures, which is a minority shareholder in Faculty. People around the UK have come up with inventive ways to take part in the 2.6 Challenge, which involves any activity based around the numbers 2.6 or 26, to fundraise or donate to their chosen charity via twopointsixchallenge.co. The World Health Organization (WHO) has sought to clarify the advice it published on Saturday about so-called \u201cimmunity passports\u201d, which could be issued to people who have recovered from Covid-19 on the assumption that they would be immune to reinfection. The WHO alarmed some in the scientific community when it said, in a briefing note published on Saturday, that \u201cthere is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection\u201d. Late last night, the Geneva-based body walked back its statement, saying: \u201cWe expect that most people who are infected with #COVID19 will develop an antibody response that will provide some level of protection.\u201d Our global coronavirus blog has more: The involvement of the prime minister\u2019s chief political adviser, Dominic Cummings, in meetings of the scientific group advising the UK government\u2019s response to the coronavirus has left other attendees shocked, concerned and worried for the impartiality of advice, the Guardian can reveal. One attendee of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said they felt Cummings\u2019s interventions had sometimes inappropriately influenced what is supposed to be an impartial scientific process. A second Sage attendee said they were shocked when Cummings first began participating in Sage discussions, in February, because they believed the group should be providing \u201cunadulterated scientific data\u201d without any political input. The environment secretary, George Eustice, has been lined up to lead today\u2019s Downing Street briefing. He is expected to be joined by Steven Powis, the medical director of the NHS. Key advisers on the on the government\u2019s scientific advisory group have cautioned against too much focus on antibody tests, amid reports that ministers have ordered up to 50m of them. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust and a member, said such test would be very useful, but a \u201cdistraction\u201d until reliable tests can be found. And a new paper by Imperial College London, co-authored by Sage member Prof Neil Ferguson warns that these tests are only 90% reliable or less on rapid diagnostic tests. It cautions against using antibody tests as the basis for immunity passports. It says: Poor specificity will result in non-immune individuals receiving an immunity passport and potentially put at risk. Conversely, poor sensitivity compromises the effectiveness of such a scheme and would result in individuals with acquired immunity ineligible for an immunity passport and uncertain of their infection risk. More than 1,250 British travellers in Bangladesh are to be brought back to the UK after the government chartered a further five repatriation flights amid the coronavirus pandemic, PA Media reports. Flights from Dhaka to London will take place between 29 April and 7 May and bring the total number of flights from Bangladesh organised by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) to nine. One of the outbound planes will carry United Nations staff and medical professionals deploying to support the Covid-19 response in Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh. Once completed, the government will have brought back more than 2,100 British travellers from the country in total. Due to the number of people already registered for a flight via the CTM website, the majority of seats are likely to be allocated to people who are on waiting lists, the FCO added. Foreign Office minister of state Lord Tariq Ahmad of Wimbledon said: This weekend, a total of 850 British travellers are due to return to the UK from Bangladesh on the first phase of our special chartered flights. I\u2019m pleased we have now announced five additional flights which will enable over 1,000 more Brits to come back home. Our teams in Bangladesh and the UK continue to work around the clock to support British nationals during this difficult time and get them home safely. More than 13,200 people have returned to the UK on FCO-chartered flights from 18 different countries or territories. On Thursday, the FCO said more than 3,600 Britons stranded in India would be brought home on 14 flights starting on Tuesday, bringing the total number of repatriation flights from India up to 52. More than 1,700 Britons have returned from South Africa and over 1,200 people have been flown back from Peru. Liverpool has a significantly higher death rate from Covid-19 than the rest of the UK, according to an investigation by the Liverpool Echo. At the time of writing, more than 700 people have died in Merseyside\u2019s hospitals \u2013 with many more sadly passing in the community. The death rate of Covid-19 patients at Liverpool\u2019s main hospital trust is 22%, compared with the UK average of 13%. Liverpool is in the top three core cities in terms of its Covid-19 death rate \u2013 higher than even Birmingham which has of course been hit very badly by tragedy in this crisis. Essentially more people getting coronavirus and going into Liverpool\u2019s hospitals with serious coronavirus are sadly not coming out. Here\u2019s a round up of the latest on coronavirus in the UK: Government resists pressure to publish Sage membership Dominic Raab has said the government has no plans to publish the list of participants in the Sage committee of scientific experts, after the Guardian revealed that key meetings have been attended by Dominic Cummings. \u201cWe don\u2019t release as a matter of practice the names of all the members of Sage because the risk of them being subject to pressure, undue influence,\u201d Raab said. Concerns that the public will be coerced into installing a new contact tracing app The campaign group Liberty is worried that signing up to a contact tracing app could become a compulsory condition for returning to work and being allowed out of lockdown when conditions are eased. The warning came as the academic developing the app admitted that 60% of population would need to sign up to the app to make it effective. Boris Johnson says protecting public health is the priority Ahead of his return to work the prime minister has signalled that he against lifting the lockdown. Citing Cicero, Johnson told cabinet colleagues: \u201c\u2018The health of the people should be the supreme law\u2019.\u201d Raab said the Johnson was \u201craring to go\u201d back to work. Raab rejects setting out a timetable for easing the lockdown The foreign secretary has rejected calls for setting out the options for easing the lockdown saying this risked confusing the public. Raab said: \u201cUntil we can be confident, based on the scientific advice, that we\u2019ll make sure-footed steps forward which will protect life but also preserve our way of life, frankly, it\u2019s not responsible to start speculating about the individual measures.\u201d He said it would be \u201cunimaginable\u201d to open schools without social distancing measures and said the resumption of amateur sport this summer would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d. But professional sport \u201ccould be different,\u201d he said. Raab warns against counting on an early vaccine Raab said a vaccine is \u201cnot likely to come to fruition this year\u201d. He confirmed the government is considering ordering millions of antibody tests to gauge how many people have had the virus, but he cautioned that there was still doubt about the reliability of the tests. Labour calls for investigation into National Shielding Helpline Labour has called for an investigation into reports that call handlers at the privately run National Shielding Helpline have mocked and fobbed off callers during the coronavirus crisis. The shadow communities secretary, Steve Reed, said: \u201cThese reports are extremely distressing. A full investigation must be launched immediately. If vulnerable people who call the helpline are not getting the support they need, the programme must be overhauled.\u201d Dominic Raab has said the government has no plans to publish the list of participants in the Sage committee of scientific experts, after the Guardian revealed that key meetings have been attended by Dominic Cummings. \u201cWe don\u2019t release as a matter of practice the names of all the members of Sage because the risk of them being subject to pressure, undue influence,\u201d the first minister and foreign secretary said on Sunday. He rejected the idea there had been a \u201clack of transparency\u201d from the government over the group\u2019s work. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, along with politicians like me standing up on a daily basis answering the questions, setting out their advice and making sure that we communicate as clearly as possible to the public what that advice is,\u201d he said. Some senior Conservatives, including the former cabinet minister David Davis, have joined calls for more information to be published about the committee\u2019s deliberations. Civil liberty campaigners are concerned that the public could be \u201ccoerced\u201d into sharing data about their movements through a new coronavirus contact tracing app being developed by the government. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, says the app, which will be available within weeks, is \u201ccrucial for holding down the rate and the level of transmission\u201d of Covid-19. But the campaign group Liberty is worried that signing up to the phone app could become a compulsory condition for returning to work and being allowed out of lockdown when conditions are eased. Such a condition would amount to coercion, Liberty claims. The warning came as the academic developing the app admitted that 60% of population would need to sign up to the app to make it effective. Clare Collier, advocacy director at Liberty, said: \u201cBy presenting surveillance tools as a solution to lockdown, the government is drawing on the willingness we have all shown to make sacrifices in the face of this crisis while refusing to show it is taking seriously the enormous risks presented by invasive technology. She added: \u201cContact-tracing technology may require us to sacrifice deeply sensitive personal information and there can be no question of state bodies or private companies sharing our personal data other than what is absolutely necessary. It is vital no-one is coerced into having the app installed, and using it as a condition for returning to work or everyday life will inevitably lead to discrimination. \u201cThe opportunities presented by technology should be fully investigated, but seeking quick solutions in surveillance tools that rely on our personal data creates serious long-term threats to our rights and ways of life. The government needs to focus on providing a public health response that ensures we come through this crisis with our rights intact.\u201d Prof Christophe Fraser of the University of Oxford, who is leading a team developing the app, said that it would a require a very high take-up to be effective. \u201cFor this intervention alone to stop a resurgence of the epidemic, about 60% of the population would have to use the app,\u201d he told the BBC. He added: \u201cThe app is going to be one of the building blocks of how to get out of the epidemic. For every one to two users who download the app, and who adhere to the instructions, you will prevent one infection.\u201d He explained if you become infected the app will send warning messages to anyone you have who has come within Bluetooth range of your phone. He said: \u201cYou\u2019ll either get a message which says you\u2019ve been in contact with a suspect case of Covid-19. Or you may later get a message and you\u2019ve been a contact of a confirmed case. At that point, we would recommend quarantine of 14 days after the contact has taken place.\u201d He added: \u201cWhen you install the app, this is an opt in system so it will work in the background. Your phone builds up a memory of the sort of anonymous IDs of the other phones you come into contact with. It needs to be a contact long enough that there\u2019s a risk of transmission.\u201d Asked about privacy concerns he said: \u201cThe NHS records patient data already and we trust the NHS to look after private data. This is being developed with a minimal amount of data \u2013 enough to make it work. It\u2019s a public health intervention with data collected within a health system.\u201d For the third day running since becoming available online, coronavirus home testing kits for key workers have been booked up within hours. More than 10 million key workers and their households are now eligible for Covid-19 tests as officials race to hit their 100,000-a-day testing target by next Thursday. By 10am home testing kits for England were listed as \u201cunavailable\u201d on the government\u2019s website - two hours after booking slots reopened. But it is still possible to book tests at drive-through centres in England and Scotland. UK universities are incapable of shifting their degrees online by the new academic year in response to the coronavirus pandemic, leading online education experts have warned. Simon Nelson, the chief executive of FutureLearn, the Open University\u2019s profit-making online learning platform, said there was insufficient time for UK universities to redesign and deliver undergraduate degrees online by September. His comments came as the former vice-chancellor of Edinburgh University, Sir Prof Tim O\u2019Shea, warned that the UK higher education sector would need to spend hundreds of millions of pounds to provide just a handful of online courses next year, with most universities unprepared to deliver this. Nelson advised most universities to focus on creating a few key modules by September and build up from there, rather than rushing to launch whole degrees at once. He added: Everyone is building the train tracks as the train is running. We mustn\u2019t attempt to boil the ocean by trying to migrate whole degrees online in a matter of months. Neil Mosley, digital learning designer at Cardiff University, warned that very few universities already run undergraduate courses online because they are so complex, with students able to choose from many different modules. He added: Even the most prepared universities will be offering some form of online undergraduate experience for the very first time. Not only that, they\u2019ll be offering it to students who are likely to see this as second best and who haven\u2019t previously been considered as having a strong appetite for online learning. When you combine all this with the lack of time, experience and support needed to create high-quality online learning, then you can see the scale of the challenge facing universities to offer high-quality online courses by September. Stress from coping with Covid-19 pandemic could lead to a generation of \u201cburnt-out\u201d nurses who will leave the profession when the crisis is over, according to healthcare experts, PA Media reports. Researchers from the universities of Southampton and Surrey have developed guidance to help support the psychological and mental health needs of nursing staff in a bid to help them deal with the emotional and physical intensity of their work. Jill Maben, professor of health services research and nursing at the University of Surrey, said: Nurses are on the frontline of care delivery, experiencing intense emotional, social and ethical difficulties as they rise to the challenge of caring for patients in such unprecedented times. If we are to avoid a generation of burnt-out nurses, their physiological, psychological and safety needs must be prioritised. Nurses injured by stress may be the last to recognise it; they are \u2018wired\u2019 to look after others and not self and they therefore need colleagues, friends and managers to remind them to think of themselves. If nursing staff are not supported during this time, there is the danger that once this is all over they will leave the profession, which will put enormous strain on an already overstretched health service. The research, published in the Journal of Clinical Nursing, highlights that prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, nurses were already under \u201cconsiderable stress\u201d because of understaffing, with 44,000 registered nurse vacancies in the UK. The guidance identifies physiological and safety needs for nurses from the importance of ensuring they have enough food, drink, rest and recovery as well as protection from infection through to managers ensuring they are \u201chighly visible and approachable\u201d. Jackie Bridges, professor of older people\u2019s care at the University of Southampton, said: When we\u2019re caught up in trying to manage a crisis like Covid-19, it can be easy to be distracted from the price that is paid by nurses providing patient care. By making sure staff wellbeing is a priority and putting active measures in place to support nursing staff, employers in all relevant health and social care settings can reduce staff stress and distress and help ward off the development of longer-term mental health problems. Asked about high deaths rates in Gloucestershire following the Cheltenham racing festival, Raab insisted that the government followed the science on when it introduced the lockdown. Asked about that Mail on Sunday report that millions of antibody tests had been ordered, Raab said he was not sure if they had been ordered, but he confirmed again that the government is looking at this. He cautioned that it was unclear if antibody tests were reliable. On the lockdown, Raab warned that it would not be a binary choice about lifting the restrictions. He said the public will have to adjust to a \u201cnew normal\u201d, and that social distancing measures \u201care going to be with us for some time\u201d to prevent a second spike in infections. Raab added: \u201cWe do need to make sure that the are next step is a sure-footed one.\u201d Raab would not be drawn on when schools could open again. But he said it would be \u201cinconceivable\u201d that schools will go back without some form of social distancing. Asked if sporting activity would resume this summer, Raab warned it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d. But he said professional sport \u201cmay be different\u201d amid reports that the government has been in discussion with the Premier League about playing football matches behind closed doors. Dominic Raab has described passing the milestone of 20,000 coronavirus deaths in the UK as \u201cheartbreaking\u201d. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, the foreign secretary said the figure would have been higher if the government had not introduced the lockdown. On frontline NHS workers reusing protective equipment, Raab said guidance to the NHS was responsible. But he admitted the supply of PPE has been a \u201cchallenge\u201d. He repeated that the government is \u201cdoing everything we can on that front\u201d. Asked about companies who say their offers of medical equipment had been declined, Raab said the government had to ensure that PPE was safe. But he admitted: \u201cWe are not in a place we want to be on PPE.\u201d Shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said if lockdown measures are relaxed, mass testing will be needed at a community level that people can easily access. Asked on the Andrew Marr Show whether 100,000 tests a day is enough, Reeves said: If we are to come out of the lockdown in the weeks and the months ahead that level of testing needs to be ramped up further. The prime minister spoke previously about 250,000 tests a day and certainly if we\u2019re going to come out of the lockdown we know that we\u2019re going to need mass testing at a community level, that people can access those tests locally without having to travel many miles. If we are to come out of the lockdown it is essential that we know who has the virus so we can isolate them, that we can trace who they\u2019ve been in contact with so potentially they isolate as well and that we have support for shielding people, the most vulnerable, and making sure they get access to the basic essentials like food and medicine. She also urged the government \u201cto count the number of deaths in care homes in the same way that they are counted in hospitals on a daily basis\u201d and to ensure that those on the front line are properly protected. Scotland should \u201clook seriously at social and economic reform\u201d in its planning for recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, Nicola Sturgeon has said, PA Media reports. The first minister said the virus has fundamentally changed everyday life but has given an opportunity to shape a different kind of future. Stressing that lockdown measures are vital to suppress the spread of coronavirus, and could continue in their current form beyond this three-week period, she called on people to work together to develop ways Scotland can emerge stronger from the crisis. Writing in the Herald on Sunday, she said: When things come apart \u2013 when the kaleidoscope of our lives is shaken \u2013 there is an opportunity to see them put back together differently, and see a new way of doing things. And we can start to think together, and work together, to decide the kind of Scotland we want to emerge from this crisis. We still all face major challenges. Challenges in navigating the uncertainties that the virus has created, as well as rebuilding our economy and public services. But we can go further than rebuilding, and look seriously at social and economic reform. I am confident we can start to begin considering our futures with optimism because this crisis has taught us how we can achieve rapid results under the most demanding circumstances. Earlier this week, as the Scottish government published a paper setting out a framework for how lockdown measures could be eased in the future, Sturgeon warned people must adapt to a new reality and said some restrictions to prevent spread could be in place until the end of the year or beyond. Raab confirmed that Boris Johnson will start work full-time on Monday. He is \u201craring to go\u201d and in \u201cgood spirits\u201d, Raab said of the prime minister. The foreign secretary, who has been deputising for the PM, said the last week three-weeks had been a \u201cchallenge\u201d but it has been a team effort. He also warned that a coronavirus vaccine is unlikely to become available this year. Raab confirmed the government was \u201clooking at\u201d ordering millions of antibody tests. But he stopped short of confirming a report in the Mail on Sunday that the order had been placed. On antigen tests, Raab claimed the government was \u201con track\u201d to meet its target of 100,000 tests for Covid-19 by Thursday. He predicted there would be a \u201csurge\u201d of tests in the coming days. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has insisted it would not be responsible to \u201cspeculate\u201d on how to ease the lockdown. Until we have evidence from scientists it would not be responsible, and it it would confuse the public, Raab told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday. He said setting out possibilities for how restrictions could be eased would send out \u201cmixed messages\u201d to the public. Until we can be confident, based on the scientific advice, that we\u2019ll make sure-footed steps forward which will protect life but also preserve our way of life, frankly, it\u2019s not responsible to start speculating about the individual measures. He pointed out that those pushing for an exit plan have not come forward with any \u201cspecific\u201d measures. Asked about publishing the advise and membership of Sage, Raab said some of its guidance was released. He also said that membership was kept secret to stop those on the committee being subjected to undue pressure and outside influence. He also defended scientific and and medical advisers who said keeping the UK death toll below 20,000 would be a good outcome. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can blame the chief medical officers who were pressed repeatedly to try to put an estimate on how long it would take, how many people would pass away,\u201d he said. Labour has called for an investigation into reports that call handlers at the privately run National Shielding Helpline have mocked and fobbed off callers during the coronavirus crisis. The shadow communities secretary, Steve Reed MP, said: These reports are extremely distressing. A full investigation must be launched immediately. If vulnerable people who call the helpline are not getting the support they need, the programme must be overhauled. The government rushed to set up the shielding programme as a national scheme instead of integrating it with existing call centres and local support run by councils and charities that know their neighbourhoods better. We need a scheme that\u2019s better integrated with local support to avoid the mistakes the government is making. Dominic Cummings observed, but did not get involved in decision-making on the government\u2019s scientific group, Sage, according to Prof Neil Ferguson, a leading member of the panel. He said: There are a number of observers at these meetings who, I have to say, have not interfered with the business of those meetings at all. We have given insight into how different causes of action would lead to certain consequences but we have not made politicians\u2019 decisions for them. Politicians have made the decisions. Ferguson made the comments in an interview with Unherd\u2019s Lockdown TV. His comments were followed up in the Sunday Times. Downing Street admitted to the Guardian that Cummings and the former Vote Leave data specialist Ben Warner attended some Sage meetings. A spokesman said: \u201cOccasionally they ask questions or offer help when scientists mention problems in Whitehall.\u201d The shadow mental health minister, Dr Rosena Allin-Khan, who is working as a doctor during the crisis, criticised the government for entering the lockdown \u201ctoo late\u201d. Speaking on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, she said deaths could have been avoided if ministers had acted earlier. When it was pointed out that many countries in Europe had struggled with the pandemic, Allin-Khan said the UK should aspire to be the best. She cited the example of Germany\u2019s testing and tracing programme. Alllin-Khan pointed out that the deadline for 100,000 tests per day in the UK was set for three months after the start of the outbreak. Allin-Khan also warned of the mental health impact of the crisis. Welcome to a Sunday edition of our coronavirus live blog. In a sign that Boris Johnson is on the mend, he has started flexing his classical education again. As the prime minister prepares to return to work on Monday, he is reported to have cited a saying by the Roman philosopher Cicero as a guiding approach to tackling the coronavirus crisis. \u201c\u2018The health of the people should be the supreme law\u2019,\u201d Johnson told cabinet members during a three-hour meeting at Chequers, but he probably said it in Latin. It is also sign that Johnson appears to be in no hurry to ease the lockdown restrictions or set out a timetable for doing so, as opposition politicians and some in his own party are calling for. Johnson is also facing cross-party calls to stop his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, from attending meetings of the secret scientific group advising him on the pandemic, as demands grow for the committee\u2019s deliberations to be made public.",

      "bodyText": "1. Leaving lockdown? Pressure has been mounting from backbench Conservative MPs \u2013 and some cabinet ministers \u2013 for elements of the stringent distancing rules imposed on 23 March to be lifted. Whitehall has been working on options \u2013 \u201cdoing the homework\u201d, as Johnson\u2019s deputy, Dominic Raab, put it on Sunday \u2013 but ministers have been reluctant to make any decisions without the prime minister. The health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, is determined that the transmission rate of the virus \u2013 the R0, as it is known \u2013 be suppressed well below 1 before the lockdown is eased. He is also racing to get a track-and-trace system up and running to help control the virus when restrictions are eased. Meanwhile, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who unlike Hancock was present at a three-hour meeting in Chequers on Friday, is known to be keen to allow some businesses to reopen, given the catastrophic impact of a total shutdown on the economy. There are also growing anxieties over the impact of an extended lockdown on mental and physical health, domestic abuse and the welfare of vulnerable children. Johnson will have to make the ultimate decision about how to balance these and other concerns, with a formal review of the measures due by 7 May. 2. Test, test, test Matt Hancock\u2019s self-imposed deadline of completing 100,000 tests a day by the end of April expires this week. Capacity has ramped up significantly in recent days, with all key workers now able to apply for a test \u2013 but self-administered testing kits have been running out within minutes on the government\u2019s website, and workers have complained that they cannot book a test slot anywhere locally. The government announced at the weekend that the army will now be involved in setting up mobile testing units. Hancock has insisted his goal remains achievable \u2013 but it looks a stretch, and some colleagues feel it was always a hostage to fortune. Johnson will have to choose whether to maintain No 10\u2019s staunch backing of Hancock, or to distance himself from the pledge (though the prime minister himself suggested 250,000 tests a day would be achievable). He will also have to decide how much of the government\u2019s effort should be focused on the tracking-and-testing approach Hancock now regards as crucial. 3. Deciding who makes decisions, and how Johnson will have to decide whether the decision-making structure in place through the peak of the crisis remains the right one for managing its next phase. In his absence, key decisions have been made by a \u201cquad\u201d of ministers: Sunak, Hancock, Raab and the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, each of whom chair one of the four powerful Covid-19 committees that have been managing the government\u2019s day-to-day response. At key turning points, decisions have also been rubber-stamped by the Cobra emergency committee, which includes representatives of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London, as well as ministers and experts. In turn, Cobra receives advice from the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage). The government has repeatedly insisted its approach has been \u201cled by the science\u201d, but the independence of Sage has been thrown into doubt by the revelation that Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, has been attending its meetings, to the disquiet of some members. The prime minister will have to decide whether Cummings should continue to attend and more broadly, which stakeholders should be included in decision-making from now on. Some Tory MPs would like to see the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, bound in to deliberations about lifting lockdown, for example \u2013 and as parts of the economy reopen, the TUC have called for the formation of a national council for reconstruction and recovery, including unions and employers as well as government. 4. Addressing his own handling of the crisis Keir Starmer confronted Raab at his first prime minister\u2019s questions as Labour leader in a largely empty House of Commons chamber last Wednesday. This week, it will be Johnson who has to face an interrogation, without the usual supportive roar from Tory backbenchers. It comes amid mounting questions about whether the prime minister was slow to react to the crisis at the start of the year: including whether he was right to allow Hancock to lead five early Cobra meetings on the virus. A series of early decisions have been challenged, including halting the tracing of cases, allowing mass events such as the Cheltenham Festival to go ahead, and failing to act quickly enough to secure supplies of PPE. Starmer made clear in a letter to the prime minister this weekend he will try to make some of this criticism stick \u2013 and will continue to press for more details on the government\u2019s planned exit strategy. \u201cI fear we are falling behind the rest of the world,\u201d the Labour leader wrote, urging Johnson to promise that no one will have to travel more than 20 minutes to have themselves tested for the virus. 5. The Brexit impasse The latest round of the (physically distanced) Brexit talks ended on Friday, with both sides blaming the other for the lack of progress. The government is accusing the EU of treating the UK more harshly than other counterparts in recent trade deals, while the EU fears ministers are backsliding on aspects of the Brexit deal struck last October. Boris Johnson is expected to ask the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, and EU leaders to intervene in the negotiations in the hope of breaking the deadlock. The government must decide in June whether to seek an extension to the status quo transition period, something ministers have repeatedly insisted they are determined not to do. Only two more rounds of videoconference negotiations are currently scheduled, but Johnson may hope that his personal involvement could help, as it did last autumn. Gove is likely to reveal more about the government\u2019s thinking when he appears before the House of Commons EU future relationship committee on Monday. 6. The Priti Patel bullying inquiry The Whitehall ethics adviser Alex Allan has reportedly completed his investigation into events surrounding the resignation of the former Home Office permanent secretary Sir Philip Rutnam, who accused Priti Patel of bullying \u2013 but it was set aside in the prime minister\u2019s absence. Rutnam resigned on 29 February, claiming he had been \u201cthe target of a vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign\u201d . He has already announced that he is taking legal action against Patel under whistleblowing laws, with the case expected to focus on her treatment of civil servants. The prime minister tasked Allan with examining Patel\u2019s alleged conduct, and whether it contravened the ministerial code. Johnson has previously backed Patel, saying he is \u201csticking by her\u201d, but that could change if Allan finds she has broken the rules.",

In today\u2019s roundup, a near centenarian is expected to receive an honour for raising millions of pounds for the NHS, while a postman goes out of his way to deliver a vaguely labelled parcel. Baby recovers from coronavirus A six-month old baby who was born with a heart condition has beaten coronavirus after spending two weeks on a high dependency unit. Nurses and doctors at Alder Hey children\u2019s hospital in Liverpool formed a guard of honour for Erin Bates as she was moved from isolation to another ward to continue her recovery on Friday. Erin, from Bury, underwent open heart surgery shortly after birth. She will continue to receive treatment for ongoing conditions at the hospital. Her mother, Emma Bates, thanked the NHS workers who looked after Erin, describing them as \u201ctruly amazing\u201d. Captain Tom Moore reportedly makes honours shortlist The 99-year-old who has raised nearly \u00a329m for the NHS by walking 100 lengths of his garden has reportedly made it on to the honours shortlist. Captain Tom Moore, who has also topped the UK singles charts with his cover of You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone, could receive a CBE after thousands of people nominated him. The war veteran from Bedfordshire completed the laps of his garden before his 100th birthday on Thursday. The money he has raised will go to NHS Charities Together to support staff and volunteers working on the frontline during the coronavirus pandemic. Postman delivers parcel addressed to \u2018somewhere in Sheffield\u2019 A postman managed to track down the person a parcel was intended for, even though it was addressed only to \u201csomewhere in Sheffield\u201d. Darrell Gilmour, 56, turned to social media to find David Easson\u2019s whereabouts after being handed the parcel with a description of him written next to the vague address. He found Easson, a sports radio presenter, on Facebook and was able to deliver the package containing a gift of Scandinavian chocolate from a fan in Sweden. Marten Wedebrand, who sent the parcel, told the Yorkshire Post he had written down all the details he knew about Easson, including that he had \u201ca child, a dog, or both.\u201d Tour buses used as NHS accommodation Tour buses that would usually ferry music stars to venues across the country have been handed over for use as \u201chotels on wheels\u201d for NHS workers. Tarrant Anderson, who runs the touring company Vans For Bands, told the BBC that the industry was \u201con its knees\u201d during the lockdown, but he had moved to help after seeing pictures of exhausted doctors and nurses on social media. After being checked over to make sure the buses met lockdown guidelines and NHS health and safety standards, they were stationed in hospital car parks to offer respite to staff.",

Virgin Atlantic is 51% owned by Branson\u2019s Virgin Group and 49% owned by Delta Air Lines.</p> <p>Branson\u2019s attempt to secure taxpayer money has been met with criticism from the public and politicians, who have said the billionaire should fund the airline himself. It has been pointed out that Branson has paid the exchequer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/12/richard-branson-facing-backlash-over-plea-for-uk-bailout-of-virgin\">no personal income tax in 14 years</a>, since he moved to his private island in the tax-free British Virgin Islands. Branson is the UK\u2019s seventh richest person, with <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/richard-c-branson/\">an estimated \u00a34.7bn fortune</a>.</p> <p>Branson has said previously: \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots of comments about my net worth, but that is calculated on the value of Virgin businesses around the world before this crisis, not sitting as cash in a bank account ready to withdraw.\u201d</p> <p>Branson\u2019s spokesman said on Sunday: \u201cVirgin Group is providing liquidity to help support its companies and save jobs. Richard and the Virgin Group are committed to the airline and are not looking to sell Virgin Atlantic. They recognise that further investment will be necessary to make up for the total loss of revenue due to Covid-19 and are working with Houlihan Lokey to approach private investors about the investment opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier reports on Sunday said Branson had set a deadline of May to sell the airline, which he founded in 1984 and has often referred to as \u201cone of my children\u201d.</p> <p>Delta has ruled out pumping fresh funds into the airline as it faces its own cash crisis.</p> <p>Virgin Australia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/21/virgin-australia-expected-to-go-into-voluntary-administration-as-government-rules-out-saving-airline\">called in administrators last week</a> after it failed to secure a A$1.4bn (\u00a3715m) bailout from the Australian government. That airline is 10% owned by Virgin Group.</p> <p>Branson has pledged to inject $250m (\u00a3197m) into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/virgin-group\">Virgin Group</a>, his empire which stretches from planes and trains to health clubs and spaceships, and which employs about 70,000 people. The pledge \u2013 of which $100m is thought to be earmarked for the airline \u2013 represents 5% of his fortune.</p> <p>A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: \u201cBecause of significant costs to our business caused by unprecedented market conditions which the Covid-19 crisis has brought with it, we are exploring all available options to obtain additional external funding. Houlihan Lokey has been appointed to assist the process, focusing on private sector funding. Meanwhile, we continue to take decisive action to reduce our costs, preserve cash and protect jobs.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Britain\u2019s airline industry has urged the government to extend the coronavirus job retention scheme as people are expected to delay all flight for months to come.</p> <p>Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, asked the Treasury to provide certainty about the scheme, according to Sky News.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe that the scheme will need to be extended beyond June, and that consideration should be given to measures \u2013 including a \u2018tapering\u2019 of the scheme or a review on a sectoral basis \u2013 to avoid aviation facing a cliff-edge post-June whilst services are scaled up,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 April 2020 because Virgin Atlantic has not grounded all of its planes, as an earlier version said.

      "bodyText": "Sir Richard Branson\u2019s Virgin Atlantic has hired the investment bank Houlihan Lokey to try to find investors willing to inject emergency funding into the transatlantic airline to avert its collapse into administration. It is understood more than 100 potential investors have been contacted. The UK government rejected Virgin Atlantic\u2019s first attempt to secure a \u00a3500m loan to keep the airline afloat while most of its planes are grounded. Virgin Atlantic is 51% owned by Branson\u2019s Virgin Group and 49% owned by Delta Air Lines. Branson\u2019s attempt to secure taxpayer money has been met with criticism from the public and politicians, who have said the billionaire should fund the airline himself. It has been pointed out that Branson has paid the exchequer no personal income tax in 14 years, since he moved to his private island in the tax-free British Virgin Islands. Branson is the UK\u2019s seventh richest person, with an estimated \u00a34.7bn fortune. Branson has said previously: \u201cI\u2019ve seen lots of comments about my net worth, but that is calculated on the value of Virgin businesses around the world before this crisis, not sitting as cash in a bank account ready to withdraw.\u201d Branson\u2019s spokesman said on Sunday: \u201cVirgin Group is providing liquidity to help support its companies and save jobs. Richard and the Virgin Group are committed to the airline and are not looking to sell Virgin Atlantic. They recognise that further investment will be necessary to make up for the total loss of revenue due to Covid-19 and are working with Houlihan Lokey to approach private investors about the investment opportunity.\u201d Earlier reports on Sunday said Branson had set a deadline of May to sell the airline, which he founded in 1984 and has often referred to as \u201cone of my children\u201d. Delta has ruled out pumping fresh funds into the airline as it faces its own cash crisis. Virgin Australia called in administrators last week after it failed to secure a A$1.4bn (\u00a3715m) bailout from the Australian government. That airline is 10% owned by Virgin Group. Branson has pledged to inject $250m (\u00a3197m) into Virgin Group, his empire which stretches from planes and trains to health clubs and spaceships, and which employs about 70,000 people. The pledge \u2013 of which $100m is thought to be earmarked for the airline \u2013 represents 5% of his fortune. A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson said: \u201cBecause of significant costs to our business caused by unprecedented market conditions which the Covid-19 crisis has brought with it, we are exploring all available options to obtain additional external funding. Houlihan Lokey has been appointed to assist the process, focusing on private sector funding. Meanwhile, we continue to take decisive action to reduce our costs, preserve cash and protect jobs.\u201d Britain\u2019s airline industry has urged the government to extend the coronavirus job retention scheme as people are expected to delay all flight for months to come. Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, asked the Treasury to provide certainty about the scheme, according to Sky News. \u201cWe believe that the scheme will need to be extended beyond June, and that consideration should be given to measures \u2013 including a \u2018tapering\u2019 of the scheme or a review on a sectoral basis \u2013 to avoid aviation facing a cliff-edge post-June whilst services are scaled up,\u201d he said. \u2022 This article was amended on 27 April 2020 because Virgin Atlantic has not grounded all of its planes, as an earlier version said. It is operating some cargo-only and repatriation flights.",

One of Brazil\u2019s top newspapers, the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo, claimed an investigation by Brazil\u2019s equivalent to the FBI had homed in on Carlos Bolsonaro, the president\u2019s social-media-savvy son. Carlos Bolsonaro, 37, rejected the claims as \u201cgarbage\u201d and \u201ca joke\u201d on Twitter, where he has 1.7 million followers. But the allegations will deepen the crisis consuming Bolsonaro\u2019s 16-month-old government and further distract from the country\u2019s efforts to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 4,000 Brazilians. Bolsonaro\u2019s administration was already floundering before the recent resignation of his powerful justice minister, Sergio Moro, with another of the president\u2019s sons, Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro, facing police scrutiny for suspected corruption and ties to Rio de Janeiro\u2019s mafia. Bolsonaro\u2019s dismissive reaction to the coronavirus crisis has sparked outrage across the political spectrum and pot-banging protests. The latest political melodrama exploded on Friday when Moro resigned and publicly accused the president of attempting to improperly meddle in the operations of the federal police by sacking the federal police director, Maur\u00edcio Valeixo, that morning. Moro alleged that Bolsonaro, for reasons that remain unclear, hoped to replace Valeixo with someone more amenable to discussing federal police business and sharing intelligence reports with the president. The man widely touted as Valeixo\u2019s successor is Alexandre Ramagem, the head of Brazil\u2019s intelligence agency, who is reportedly a friend of Carlos Bolsonaro\u2019s. A photograph of Ramagem and Carlos Bolsonaro fraternising at a New Year\u2019s Eve party was published by Brazilian media on Saturday. The Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo claimed federal police officials were convinced Bolsonaro had fired Valeixo \u201cbecause he was aware the corporation was closing in on his son\u201d. An editorial in another leading broadsheet, O Globo, said Bolsonaro seemed to want \u201cto turn the federal police into a personal police force, as if he were some kind of third world dictator\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The family court has been hit with so many urgent applications during Australia\u2019s lockdown that it has been forced to establish a dedicated list to deal exclusively with parenting and safety issues which have arisen from the Covid-19 restrictions. The family court of Australia and the federal circuit court announced they would begin hearing lockdown-related cases from Monday, in response to an increase in urgent applications for hearings. Women\u2019s safety advocates said the measure would save lives and commended the chief justice for taking action. \u201cWhere there is a domestic violence incident, and children are at risk, police can simply make a provisional order for their protection and an application can be made for the matter to be triaged in the family court or federal circuit court for consideration of interim living and care arrangements that are safe for that family,\u201d said the Women\u2019s Safety New South Wales chief executive, Hayley Foster. The courts have reported an increase in risk due to family violence resulting from the physical distance restrictions, which have left many vulnerable people locked away at home with violent partners. Border restrictions and the temporary closure of supervised contact centres have led to an increase in parenting applications, with many parents unable to come to a new arrangement within the lockdown rules, while in some cases a positive Covid-19 test and necessary two-week quarantine has left a parent without support. The courts reported a 39% increase in urgent applications of the family court and a 23% increase to the federal circuit court. Together, the courts cover all jurisdictions, except Western Australia, which operates under a different system. Women\u2019s legal and domestic and family violence services have warned that the restrictions put in place to address the health pandemic have exacerbated existing issues within vulnerable families. A spokeswoman for the courts said it had been advised of an increase of inquiries to those services since the restrictions were put in place last month, in relation to Covid-19 and parenting matters. The chief justice the courts, Will Alstergren, said the new list had been created to better identify those urgent cases. \u201cApplications that are eligible to be dealt with through the Covid-19 List, especially those involving issues of risk and family violence, will receive immediate attention and will be triaged by a dedicated registrar who will assess the needs of the case and allocate it to be heard by a judge within 72 hours of being assessed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is important that these urgent Covid-19 applications are closely managed on a national basis so that they can be heard as swiftly as possible given the unprecedented circumstances we are facing. \u201cI would also like the public to know that if they need to file an urgent application because they have been directly impacted by Covid-19, it will be heard electronically as quickly as possible by a judge from any registry of the courts.\u201d The jurist said court staff had been working to have applications heard as quickly as possible, simplifying the process to deal with cases via electronic means, which means parties can file their applications through email and attend the hearing through a teleconference. The new arrangements will remain in place for at least three months. \u2022 If you or someone you know is impacted by sexual assault, domestic or family violence, call 1800RESPECT on 1800 737 732 or visit 1800RESPECT.org.au.",

One member of the Cheeky Chicks Facebook group chat won herself piles of virtual applause by filming her naked torso slowly getting covered in Ice Magic.</p> <p>Business manager Rosy,* 47, is part of the chat. She describes the group as \u201clike-minded women friends who are generally more open to exploring their sexual and sensual natures\u201d.</p> <p>Before the pandemic, Rosy explains, the group \u201cused to catch up regularly face to face socially to chat and flirt and just be us\u201d. Now, in lockdown, they\u2019re using the group to explore their \u201cnaughty sides\u201d but \u201cin a safe environment\u201d. They \u201cset cheeky challenges to each other, like taking pictures in some sort of theme \u2013 such as with water, kissing or chocolate\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/16/self-love-in-isolation-i-hope-people-are-using-this-time-to-explore-their-sexuality\">Self-love in isolation: 'I hope people are using this time to explore their sexuality'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cHaving said that, we also discuss parenting and current life struggles as well as successes and maybe the yummy food we have been making. It\u2019s a space to be real,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Rosy isn\u2019t alone in exploring her sexual side through naked photographs and erotic texts during the Covid-19 lockdown. On 22 April, actor Ansel Elgort teased his followers on Instagram by<a href=\"https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/ansel-elgort-nude-photo-instagram.html\"> posting a nude photograph</a> and suggesting he had set up an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/06/can-one-site-change-what-a-porn-star-is-supposed-to-look-like\">Only Fans</a> account. Although the post was for charity, he deleted it a few hours later. Meanwhile, social media influencer<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/sep/12/who-is-caroline-calloway-and-why-cant-the-internet-stop-talking-about-her\"> Caroline Calloway</a> really did launch a profile on the subscription-based pornography service, and <a href=\"https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/whos-actually-horny-on-main-when-everyones-horny-on-main\">claims she will make US$80,000 </a>from the account by the end of the year.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s a way of being intimate in a time where we actually can\u2019t touch each other</p> <footer> <cite>Tanya Koens</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Clinical and somatic sexologist Tanya Koens reflects that the current crisis is impacting people\u2019s intimate online behaviour. Yet it\u2019s not just that people are bored and horny \u2013 there\u2019s more to it.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are feeling very vulnerable and they are feeling scared. They don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. When we\u2019re facing death, we tend to become much more vibrant in wanting to be alive,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Koens believes people are turning to sexting and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/sep/01/nude-selfies-what-if-they-are-just-an-ordinary-part-of-teenage-life\"> nudes</a> because it\u2019s \u201chooking into our desires. It\u2019s hooking into our desirability. It\u2019s hooking into our body. It\u2019s special because this isn\u2019t something that we do with everybody [and] it\u2019s a way of being intimate in a time where we actually can\u2019t touch each other\u201d.</p> <p>Sexting \u2013 in case you aren\u2019t familiar \u2013 is using text, images, photos, video and audio to get saucy with someone online. Right now the practice is having a heyday. What\u2019s more, people are using their creativity to sext in varied and unexpected ways. Koens notes that some groups of friends \u2013 such as the Cheeky Chicks \u2013 are sending nude images to each other too \u201cfor shits and giggles\u201d.</p> <p>However, others, such as 41-year-old public servant Mia*, are sexting their crushes one to one. And not just a bit. But a lot. Mia says: \u201cI\u2019ve been enjoying sharing a long fantasy of: \u2018What I\u2019d do if we were locked in the steamy spa room at my gym together\u2019 texts with my bloke.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like the end of the world, so all the basic urges like cooking, sleeping and fucking are really important again,\u201d Mia says. \u201cThe isolation is ramping up the desire to connect. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/16/self-love-in-isolation-i-hope-people-are-using-this-time-to-explore-their-sexuality\">Vibrators and self-love</a> don\u2019t cut it right now. It needs to be more.\u201d</p> <p>Our feelings of isolation and fear are causing us to reach out and connect in a far more vulnerable way. Take 51-year-old legal professional, Jennifer*, as another example. She thinks back a few weeks: \u201cAt the start of the crisis, anxiety was peaking, and I was standing in the supermarket crying.\u201d</p> <p>This prompted Jennifer to send her best friend of 25 years, who lives interstate, a message along the lines of: \u201cI would give anything to see him just so he could hug me.\u201d</p> <p>A phone call followed, and the relationship quickly evolved into regular sexting between the pair. \u201cIt\u2019s like a sexy story just for me where I am beautiful and desirable. That\u2019s an intoxicating feeling,\u201d she says.</p> <p>While exploring new forms of intimacy can be a thrill, Rosy wants to underscore something crucial: \u201cNo one is forced to put something up and you engage at the level you feel comfortable at.\u201d</p> <p>Koens says people sext for all kinds of reasons. \u201cWhen we flirt with somebody we get a little bit of an extra spring in our step \u2026 It can be very validating to have somebody responding positively to messages that you\u2019re writing or imagery or voicemails that you are sending.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/21/single-people-living-with-couples-coronavirus-lockdown\">'I\u2019m so starved for human touch': a hell of its own for single people living with couples</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just like with face-to-face sexual interactions, consent is king when it comes to sexting. \u201cIf you\u2019re having sexy banter and you want to up the ante and send a recording or an image, you need to check first,\u201d says Koens. \u201c\u2018Would you be open to receiving some images of me? Would you be open to receiving naked images of me? Would you be open to seeing pictures of my genitals?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cPeople say that\u2019s not sexy [to ask] and I\u2019m telling you that\u2019s incorrect \u2026 Once you\u2019ve got permission, you have zero risk of offending somebody.\u201d</p> <p>When wanting to turn the chat to sexy talk, Koens has noticed that men can often \u201cpressure\u201d women into sending images. Anecdotally, more of this fishing <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_CnGYThidx/\">seems to be happening</a> at the moment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B_CnGYThidx/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "The Easter photo challenge had to involve chocolate. Apart from that, all bets were off. One member of the Cheeky Chicks Facebook group chat won herself piles of virtual applause by filming her naked torso slowly getting covered in Ice Magic. Business manager Rosy,* 47, is part of the chat. She describes the group as \u201clike-minded women friends who are generally more open to exploring their sexual and sensual natures\u201d. Before the pandemic, Rosy explains, the group \u201cused to catch up regularly face to face socially to chat and flirt and just be us\u201d. Now, in lockdown, they\u2019re using the group to explore their \u201cnaughty sides\u201d but \u201cin a safe environment\u201d. They \u201cset cheeky challenges to each other, like taking pictures in some sort of theme \u2013 such as with water, kissing or chocolate\u201d. \u201cHaving said that, we also discuss parenting and current life struggles as well as successes and maybe the yummy food we have been making. It\u2019s a space to be real,\u201d she says. Rosy isn\u2019t alone in exploring her sexual side through naked photographs and erotic texts during the Covid-19 lockdown. On 22 April, actor Ansel Elgort teased his followers on Instagram by posting a nude photograph and suggesting he had set up an Only Fans account. Although the post was for charity, he deleted it a few hours later. Meanwhile, social media influencer Caroline Calloway really did launch a profile on the subscription-based pornography service, and claims she will make US$80,000 from the account by the end of the year. Clinical and somatic sexologist Tanya Koens reflects that the current crisis is impacting people\u2019s intimate online behaviour. Yet it\u2019s not just that people are bored and horny \u2013 there\u2019s more to it. \u201cPeople are feeling very vulnerable and they are feeling scared. They don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. When we\u2019re facing death, we tend to become much more vibrant in wanting to be alive,\u201d she says. Koens believes people are turning to sexting and nudes because it\u2019s \u201chooking into our desires. It\u2019s hooking into our desirability. It\u2019s hooking into our body. It\u2019s special because this isn\u2019t something that we do with everybody [and] it\u2019s a way of being intimate in a time where we actually can\u2019t touch each other\u201d. Sexting \u2013 in case you aren\u2019t familiar \u2013 is using text, images, photos, video and audio to get saucy with someone online. Right now the practice is having a heyday. What\u2019s more, people are using their creativity to sext in varied and unexpected ways. Koens notes that some groups of friends \u2013 such as the Cheeky Chicks \u2013 are sending nude images to each other too \u201cfor shits and giggles\u201d. However, others, such as 41-year-old public servant Mia*, are sexting their crushes one to one. And not just a bit. But a lot. Mia says: \u201cI\u2019ve been enjoying sharing a long fantasy of: \u2018What I\u2019d do if we were locked in the steamy spa room at my gym together\u2019 texts with my bloke. \u201cIt feels like the end of the world, so all the basic urges like cooking, sleeping and fucking are really important again,\u201d Mia says. \u201cThe isolation is ramping up the desire to connect. Vibrators and self-love don\u2019t cut it right now. It needs to be more.\u201d Our feelings of isolation and fear are causing us to reach out and connect in a far more vulnerable way. Take 51-year-old legal professional, Jennifer*, as another example. She thinks back a few weeks: \u201cAt the start of the crisis, anxiety was peaking, and I was standing in the supermarket crying.\u201d This prompted Jennifer to send her best friend of 25 years, who lives interstate, a message along the lines of: \u201cI would give anything to see him just so he could hug me.\u201d A phone call followed, and the relationship quickly evolved into regular sexting between the pair. \u201cIt\u2019s like a sexy story just for me where I am beautiful and desirable. That\u2019s an intoxicating feeling,\u201d she says. While exploring new forms of intimacy can be a thrill, Rosy wants to underscore something crucial: \u201cNo one is forced to put something up and you engage at the level you feel comfortable at.\u201d Koens says people sext for all kinds of reasons. \u201cWhen we flirt with somebody we get a little bit of an extra spring in our step \u2026 It can be very validating to have somebody responding positively to messages that you\u2019re writing or imagery or voicemails that you are sending.\u201d Just like with face-to-face sexual interactions, consent is king when it comes to sexting. \u201cIf you\u2019re having sexy banter and you want to up the ante and send a recording or an image, you need to check first,\u201d says Koens. \u201c\u2018Would you be open to receiving some images of me? Would you be open to receiving naked images of me? Would you be open to seeing pictures of my genitals?\u2019 \u201cPeople say that\u2019s not sexy [to ask] and I\u2019m telling you that\u2019s incorrect \u2026 Once you\u2019ve got permission, you have zero risk of offending somebody.\u201d When wanting to turn the chat to sexy talk, Koens has noticed that men can often \u201cpressure\u201d women into sending images. Anecdotally, more of this fishing seems to be happening at the moment. Koens explains: \u201cThey don\u2019t ask in a way that \u2018no\u2019 is an option. They start insisting that they \u2018need\u2019 to see nudes or sexy images. They say they are turned on and they want more.\u201d Speaking directly to men who make these requests, she continues: \u201cIf you don\u2019t receive a picture or the person says \u2018no\u2019, don\u2019t continue asking. You can go find your own images \u2013 there is a plethora of porn out there. Women don\u2019t owe you anything.\u201d *Names have been changed",

During one week in April, spending on online wagering increased by 67% while expenditure on alcohol and tobacco increased by 33%, <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/alarming-rise-in-online-gambling-has-experts-worried-20200408-p54ics.html\">according to a consumer spending database collated by analytics consultancy AlphaBeta and credit firm Illion</a>.</p> <p>The link between stress and substance abuse or damaging behaviours is well established.

Despite a significant drop in tourism and an exodus of some 10,000 residents from the city, revenue from gambling rose by almost $4m against a downward national trend.</p> <p>Amanda Curran, vice-president of the Australian Association of Psychologists and a registered psychologist, says factors such as lack of stimulation, increased stress particularly around finances and potential illness are all driving increased rates of substance use.</p> <p>\u201cOn top of that, the disconnect from social support systems such as friends, neighbours, therapists, church and family can contribute significantly to mental strain,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cFor those in recovery, the lack of access to support services is a major concern. Those who were traditionally involved in support groups such as AA or NA may not have computer access to attend online meetings, and they are particularly at risk here.\u201d</p> <p>Treatment centres such as The Buttery are already seeing the effects of the virus. Crayden tells the Guardian that since lockdown rules came into place the centre has seen a significant increase in calls from people worried about drug and alcohol consumption.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re getting more calls to our intake line from people saying, \u2018look, my partner had a lot of control around their drinking or substance use previously because they worked and had their routines, but that\u2019s not happening any more, so the 6pm beer is turning into the 12pm beer\u2019,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have their own harm reduction minimisation strategies \u2013 eating well, sleeping well, keeping busy, exercising and just having a purpose. Well a lot of people have been stood down, they\u2019re not working and so they don\u2019t have that purpose. We\u2019re all anxious about contracting coronavirus, about our families. We\u2019re seeing a lot of calls from young mums who are overwhelmed with home schooling. So there\u2019s a lot of anxiety and fear around and we know people self-medicate to deal with that.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, Crayden says, The Buttery has been unable to accept any new residential rehabilitation clients since the virus hit. While it is finding innovative ways to continue client outreach \u2013 including buying phones and laptops for those without access to technology \u2013 she fears the 90 people already on their waitlist face additional challenges while they work on a strategy to allow them to take new clients.</p> <p>Anecdotal reports of increased substance use coupled with hobbled treatment options has prompted Suzanne Nielsen, the deputy director of the Monash Addiction Research Centre, to warn of a potential for a syndemic \u2013 two endemics operating at the same time.</p> <p>Australia was already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/may/13/he-was-gone-fentanyl-and-the-opioid-deaths-destroying-australian-families\">grappling with an escalating crisis with opioid-related disease and death rates</a> before Covid-19, and Nielsen fears that unless authorities begin considering the risk of a rise in addiction rates the problem could get worse. While she says easing access to methadone was a good step, governments could do things like expanding the number of medically supervised injecting centres and increasing free access to naloxone.</p> <p>\u201cObviously when people inject drugs it\u2019s often multiple times a day, so if you\u2019re really going to reduce the risks associated with that the injecting room really needs to be in your local area so you are able to attend without travelling long distances,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cIn cities as large and geographically diverse as Melbourne and Sydney it really doesn\u2019t make sense to have one place. Kings Cross is no longer the epicentre of injecting in Sydney and we absolutely need more of these services so we can have more equitable access to them.\u201d</p> <p>Jauncey agrees, pointing to a 2019 recommendation by the NSW deputy coroner Harriet Grahame for a feasibility study into a new injecting centre in Sydney\u2019s south-west after <a href=\"http://www.coroners.justice.nsw.gov.au/Documents/7.%20FINAL%20Bugden%20and%20Bestrin%20findings%20-%20redacted.pdf\">25-year-old Amaru Bestrin died of a heroin overdose in a publicly accessible toilet at Liverpool hospital</a>.</p> <p>\u201cPeople take drugs where they get drugs,\u201d Jauncey said. \u201cWe know injecting centres are not a honeypot, so you need to put these services where the market is.\u201d</p> <p>All of the experts the Guardian has spoken to are also concerned about a changing market profile in illicit drugs. In the same way that the shutdown of major sporting codes has seen online sports betting websites simply shift to offering odds on obscure leagues such as Russian table tennis and Nicaraguan football, experts warn a potential heroin shortage caused by border closures could lead to unintended consequences.</p> <p>When Australia experienced a significant heroin drought in early 2001, the country saw a 67% reduction in fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses. But there is also evidence that many long-term users simply <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1524737/\">switched to other substances such as prescription benzodiazepines</a>.</p> <p>Nielsen says evidence from overseas, and in particular the US, suggests that \u201csupply shocks\u201d in the heroin market could lead users to more dangerous drugs such as the prescription opioid fentanyl.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen in other countries that when there have been supply shocks it can be a time when more potent drugs are introduced,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cFentanyl is an obvious candidate because it\u2019s easier to ship and because of its potency. It\u2019s one of those things where we just don\u2019t know which way it will go because we don\u2019t have the data yet.\u201d</p> <p>Jauncey says the potential for users to shift to fentanyl analogues and crystal methamphetamine is a significant concern for those in the industry.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a vexed issue. We are all expecting to see a change in availability and when you see that there\u2019s a change in access, supply and strength,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t make heroin in Australia, all of it is imported from south-east Asia and China, where we have very established trade routes which have now been interrupted.</p> <p>\u201cAt some level it\u2019s crystal ball gazing. But we know when there is a market shock you do see increased treatment seeking. What I hope happens is the treatments are there and available and we\u2019re ready for them. One of the not-so-good outcomes is people can potentially start using other substances, which can be more harmful.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the risk of fentanyl and high-potency analogous. The other thing the sector is concerned about is an increase of local methamphetamine. We don\u2019t make our own heroin but we do make our own methamphetamine.\u201d</p> <p>*not his real name.</p>",

Those who were traditionally involved in support groups such as AA or NA may not have computer access to attend online meetings, and they are particularly at risk here.\u201d Treatment centres such as The Buttery are already seeing the effects of the virus. Crayden tells the Guardian that since lockdown rules came into place the centre has seen a significant increase in calls from people worried about drug and alcohol consumption. \u201cWe\u2019re getting more calls to our intake line from people saying, \u2018look, my partner had a lot of control around their drinking or substance use previously because they worked and had their routines, but that\u2019s not happening any more, so the 6pm beer is turning into the 12pm beer\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople have their own harm reduction minimisation strategies \u2013 eating well, sleeping well, keeping busy, exercising and just having a purpose. Well a lot of people have been stood down, they\u2019re not working and so they don\u2019t have that purpose. We\u2019re all anxious about contracting coronavirus, about our families. We\u2019re seeing a lot of calls from young mums who are overwhelmed with home schooling. So there\u2019s a lot of anxiety and fear around and we know people self-medicate to deal with that.\u201d At the same time, Crayden says, The Buttery has been unable to accept any new residential rehabilitation clients since the virus hit. While it is finding innovative ways to continue client outreach \u2013 including buying phones and laptops for those without access to technology \u2013 she fears the 90 people already on their waitlist face additional challenges while they work on a strategy to allow them to take new clients. Anecdotal reports of increased substance use coupled with hobbled treatment options has prompted Suzanne Nielsen, the deputy director of the Monash Addiction Research Centre, to warn of a potential for a syndemic \u2013 two endemics operating at the same time. Australia was already grappling with an escalating crisis with opioid-related disease and death rates before Covid-19, and Nielsen fears that unless authorities begin considering the risk of a rise in addiction rates the problem could get worse. While she says easing access to methadone was a good step, governments could do things like expanding the number of medically supervised injecting centres and increasing free access to naloxone. \u201cObviously when people inject drugs it\u2019s often multiple times a day, so if you\u2019re really going to reduce the risks associated with that the injecting room really needs to be in your local area so you are able to attend without travelling long distances,\u201d she says. \u201cIn cities as large and geographically diverse as Melbourne and Sydney it really doesn\u2019t make sense to have one place. Kings Cross is no longer the epicentre of injecting in Sydney and we absolutely need more of these services so we can have more equitable access to them.\u201d Jauncey agrees, pointing to a 2019 recommendation by the NSW deputy coroner Harriet Grahame for a feasibility study into a new injecting centre in Sydney\u2019s south-west after 25-year-old Amaru Bestrin died of a heroin overdose in a publicly accessible toilet at Liverpool hospital. \u201cPeople take drugs where they get drugs,\u201d Jauncey said. \u201cWe know injecting centres are not a honeypot, so you need to put these services where the market is.\u201d All of the experts the Guardian has spoken to are also concerned about a changing market profile in illicit drugs. In the same way that the shutdown of major sporting codes has seen online sports betting websites simply shift to offering odds on obscure leagues such as Russian table tennis and Nicaraguan football, experts warn a potential heroin shortage caused by border closures could lead to unintended consequences. When Australia experienced a significant heroin drought in early 2001, the country saw a 67% reduction in fatal and nonfatal opioid overdoses. But there is also evidence that many long-term users simply switched to other substances such as prescription benzodiazepines. Nielsen says evidence from overseas, and in particular the US, suggests that \u201csupply shocks\u201d in the heroin market could lead users to more dangerous drugs such as the prescription opioid fentanyl. \u201cWe have seen in other countries that when there have been supply shocks it can be a time when more potent drugs are introduced,\u201d she says. \u201cFentanyl is an obvious candidate because it\u2019s easier to ship and because of its potency. It\u2019s one of those things where we just don\u2019t know which way it will go because we don\u2019t have the data yet.\u201d Jauncey says the potential for users to shift to fentanyl analogues and crystal methamphetamine is a significant concern for those in the industry. \u201cIt\u2019s a vexed issue. We are all expecting to see a change in availability and when you see that there\u2019s a change in access, supply and strength,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t make heroin in Australia, all of it is imported from south-east Asia and China, where we have very established trade routes which have now been interrupted. \u201cAt some level it\u2019s crystal ball gazing. But we know when there is a market shock you do see increased treatment seeking. What I hope happens is the treatments are there and available and we\u2019re ready for them. One of the not-so-good outcomes is people can potentially start using other substances, which can be more harmful. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the risk of fentanyl and high-potency analogous. The other thing the sector is concerned about is an increase of local methamphetamine. We don\u2019t make our own heroin but we do make our own methamphetamine.\u201d *not his real name.",

Announced in late 2018 after the government abandoned Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s proposed national energy guarantee, the underwriting new generation investment (Ungi) scheme promises public support for new dispatchable power generation projects to increase competition in the electricity grid.

Over the past week he has taken joy in the things that, for an Ivorian footballer living on the opposite side of the world, would usually serve as basic punctuation points in the day. Sleeping in his own bed, cooking his own food, watching his own television; the happiness in recovering these simple freedoms has been profound, even if he cannot stop his mind drifting to an experience that will never leave him. \u201cThis is a year I\u2019ll never forget,\u201d he tells the Guardian. \u201cA very, very strange moment. Many things have happened to me that I will never forget in my life.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/22/david-moyes-delivering-veg-boxes-lockdown-coronavirus-west-ham-football\">\u2018Keep the change, son\u2019: David Moyes delivering veg boxes not team talks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is hard to know where to start given that, until 18 April, Kouassi and his teammates had spent 104 days away from Wuhan. The end of their involuntary exile was facilitated after the city\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown was lifted on 8 April, and they eventually returned to a rapturous welcome from several hundred supporters at the local railway station. \u201cAt this moment, I felt as if I was in the stadium again,\u201d says Kouassi. Flickers of light appeared behind the eyes of a squad whose morale had long since hollowed.</p> <p>Wuhan Zall had been in pre\u2011season training 520 miles away in Guangzhou when their home city, by then established as the origin of the Covid-19 outbreak, was put under quarantine on 23 January. It meant none of their players could return to visit family or friends before flying to M\u00e1laga and beginning a pre-season camp in the Costa del Sol six days later.

      "bodyText": "Jean Evrard Kouassi exhales and struggles for words to describe the journey he and his Wuhan Zall teammates have completed. Over the past week he has taken joy in the things that, for an Ivorian footballer living on the opposite side of the world, would usually serve as basic punctuation points in the day. Sleeping in his own bed, cooking his own food, watching his own television; the happiness in recovering these simple freedoms has been profound, even if he cannot stop his mind drifting to an experience that will never leave him. \u201cThis is a year I\u2019ll never forget,\u201d he tells the Guardian. \u201cA very, very strange moment. Many things have happened to me that I will never forget in my life.\u201d It is hard to know where to start given that, until 18 April, Kouassi and his teammates had spent 104 days away from Wuhan. The end of their involuntary exile was facilitated after the city\u2019s Covid-19 lockdown was lifted on 8 April, and they eventually returned to a rapturous welcome from several hundred supporters at the local railway station. \u201cAt this moment, I felt as if I was in the stadium again,\u201d says Kouassi. Flickers of light appeared behind the eyes of a squad whose morale had long since hollowed. Wuhan Zall had been in pre\u2011season training 520 miles away in Guangzhou when their home city, by then established as the origin of the Covid-19 outbreak, was put under quarantine on 23 January. It meant none of their players could return to visit family or friends before flying to M\u00e1laga and beginning a pre-season camp in the Costa del Sol six days later. They had been expected to travel back from Spain in mid-February \u2013 in time for the new Chinese Super League campaign \u2013 but that was postponed and, with nowhere to go, their stay was extended by a month. The problem was that, as fears took hold in Europe, the name of Wuhan carried an inescapable stigma upon arrival. Their original hotel booking was cancelled and interaction with those outside the complex into which they eventually settled was, on a personal or professional level, sometimes impossible. \u201cIt was difficult in Spain, very difficult,\u201d Kouassi says. \u201cWe had to wear club uniform when we went out, so it was obvious who we were and people looked at us very differently.

      "body": "<p>Famine is riding alongside pestilence, on the tail of war. Though coronavirus leaves no part of the world untouched, its impact will be harshest in places that were already suffering. Yet the problems it brings with it may prove more deadly than Covid-19 itself. Even in the richest countries, coronavirus has left families in hunger; for the poorest, it could mean starvation.</p> <p>The head of the World Food Programme warns that we are now on the brink of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/21/coronavirus-pandemic-will-cause-famine-of-biblical-proportions\" title=\"\">a hunger pandemic</a>, with the prospect of multiple famines \u201cof biblical proportions\u201d within a few months, across three dozen countries. Households already struggling to survive have lost the work that fed them. Remittances sent home by family members abroad are predicted to <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/04/22/world-bank-predicts-sharpest-decline-of-remittances-in-recent-history\" title=\"\">fall by around a fifth</a> due to Covid-19. Tourism has vanished. Children are missing the nutritious school meals they depend upon. Quarantine regulations and transport issues are disrupting food supply chains.</p> <p>Covid-19 alone has not created this crisis. Rather, it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/21/millions-hang-by-a-thread-extreme-global-hunger-compounded-by-covid-19-coronavirus\" title=\"\">one more devastating blow</a>, complicating and deepening the troubles of countries already struggling with the impact of war, global heating, other health crises, and specific threats such as the locust infestations plaguing east Africa. It could almost double the number of those facing acute hunger, pushing an additional 130 million people to the brink of starvation by the end of the year. In all, shortages are likely to affect a fifth of the world\u2019s population. Many of them live in overcrowded conditions, with poor sanitation, and a considerable number have pre-existing health problems such as HIV or TB; malnutrition will make them more vulnerable to Covid-19 and other threats.</p> <p>Yet the worst is not inevitable. The food crisis is currently one of distribution and affordability, though in the longer term agriculture is likely to suffer, particularly in places where it is labour intensive.</p> <p>Developing countries cannot afford the support packages adopted elsewhere, and no single nation can solve supply issues. International solutions are required; UN organisations are uniquely placed to handle border closures, restrictions and transport disruption given their regional presences, contacts and diplomacy. In the long run, warn economists and global health experts, developing countries will need <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/27/back-poor-countries-fighting-covid-19-with-trillions-or-face-disaster-g20-told\" title=\"\">trillions of dollars</a> to recover. The UN is seeking just $2bn for its emergency appeal; yet as of last week, wealthier countries had pledged only a quarter of that. They must deliver on those promises now, and give more.</p> <p>Particularly essential within that is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/20/un-heads-warn-of-coronavirus-risk-in-weakest-countries\" title=\"\">$350m logistics plan</a>, which would allow goods and relief workers to reach crisis-hit areas. Persuading governments to allow essential agricultural and food workers to move within and between countries will be crucial. The UN <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-measures-could-cause-global-food-shortage-un-warns\" title=\"\">has warned</a> that trying to protect domestic supplies through tariffs and export bans will create extreme volatility. Finally, the G20 and International Monetary Fund agreements to suspend debt are a step forward, but insufficient; private creditors too must act.</p> <p>All this is a matter of common decency, but also of self-interest. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/16/race-against-time-to-prevent-famines-during-coronavirus-crisis\" title=\"\">2007-08</a> we saw how rising food prices can destabilise societies, producing repercussions felt much more widely. In several countries, the spectre of unrest is already emerging. Coronavirus is the latest and perhaps most immediate demonstration of what the climate crisis and wars in Syria and elsewhere should already have told us: that other people\u2019s suffering will not be contained. It is our business, too.</p>",

Yet the problems it brings with it may prove more deadly than Covid-19 itself. Even in the richest countries, coronavirus has left families in hunger; for the poorest, it could mean starvation. The head of the World Food Programme warns that we are now on the brink of a hunger pandemic, with the prospect of multiple famines \u201cof biblical proportions\u201d within a few months, across three dozen countries. Households already struggling to survive have lost the work that fed them. Remittances sent home by family members abroad are predicted to fall by around a fifth due to Covid-19. Tourism has vanished. Children are missing the nutritious school meals they depend upon. Quarantine regulations and transport issues are disrupting food supply chains. Covid-19 alone has not created this crisis. Rather, it is one more devastating blow, complicating and deepening the troubles of countries already struggling with the impact of war, global heating, other health crises, and specific threats such as the locust infestations plaguing east Africa. It could almost double the number of those facing acute hunger, pushing an additional 130 million people to the brink of starvation by the end of the year. In all, shortages are likely to affect a fifth of the world\u2019s population. Many of them live in overcrowded conditions, with poor sanitation, and a considerable number have pre-existing health problems such as HIV or TB; malnutrition will make them more vulnerable to Covid-19 and other threats. Yet the worst is not inevitable. The food crisis is currently one of distribution and affordability, though in the longer term agriculture is likely to suffer, particularly in places where it is labour intensive. Developing countries cannot afford the support packages adopted elsewhere, and no single nation can solve supply issues. International solutions are required; UN organisations are uniquely placed to handle border closures, restrictions and transport disruption given their regional presences, contacts and diplomacy. In the long run, warn economists and global health experts, developing countries will need trillions of dollars to recover. The UN is seeking just $2bn for its emergency appeal; yet as of last week, wealthier countries had pledged only a quarter of that. They must deliver on those promises now, and give more. Particularly essential within that is the $350m logistics plan, which would allow goods and relief workers to reach crisis-hit areas. Persuading governments to allow essential agricultural and food workers to move within and between countries will be crucial. The UN has warned that trying to protect domestic supplies through tariffs and export bans will create extreme volatility. Finally, the G20 and International Monetary Fund agreements to suspend debt are a step forward, but insufficient; private creditors too must act. All this is a matter of common decency, but also of self-interest. In 2007-08 we saw how rising food prices can destabilise societies, producing repercussions felt much more widely. In several countries, the spectre of unrest is already emerging. Coronavirus is the latest and perhaps most immediate demonstration of what the climate crisis and wars in Syria and elsewhere should already have told us: that other people\u2019s suffering will not be contained. It is our business, too.",

Who can be relied upon for giving advice in a time of crisis is a matter of national importance. It is obvious that it is best to involve those who are expert in the area. Mr Cummings is not one of them.",

The 47-year-old truck driver, from Cranbourne, was in hospital until last night.

During the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, wealthy nations negotiated large advance orders of the vaccine, effectively crowding out poorer ones. Finding a vaccine to counter the Ebola virus was complicated by the fact that pharmaceutical companies couldn\u2019t see a way to make a profit for a virus that mainly affected some of the world\u2019s poorest nations. <strong>Christopher Knaus </strong>talks to a global coalition of experts worried about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/covid-19-vaccines-pressure-is-on-to-ensure-they-go-to-the-most-needy-not-the-highest-bidder\">what they describe as \u201cvaccine nationalism\u201d</a>.</p> \n<h2>Listen</h2> \n<p><strong>In today\u2019s episode of Full Story, the M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res coordinator Luis Encinas talks to the Guardian\u2019s Spain correspondent, Sam Jones, about how the coronavirus has transformed the country. </strong>In a varied career Encinas has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/apr/27/how-has-the-coronavirus-transformed-spain\">treated patients in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, in Sierra Leone as Ebola took hold, and now in Spain, battling Covid-19.</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"51d1869b-840b-437c-b2a9-c547fe0a96dc\" data-atom-type=\"audio\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Audio\"></div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><em>Full Story is Guardian Australia\u2019s news podcast.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Monday 27 April. Top stories A truck driver has been charged with four counts of culpable driving over the Melbourne freeway crash that killed four police officers last week. Senior Constable Lynette Taylor, Senior Constable Kevin King, Constable Glen Humphris and Constable Josh Prestney died when a truck hit them while they were dealing with a Porsche driver in an emergency lane on the Eastern Freeway at Kew. The 47-year-old truck driver, from Cranbourne, was in hospital until last night. He is due to appear in the Melbourne magistrates court today. More than 1 million Australians are reported to have downloaded the Covidsafe tracking app to help identify, trace and isolate the contacts of infected people. Based on source code from Singapore\u2019s Tracetogether software, the app logs the bluetooth connections a person\u2019s phone makes with the phones of those they have come into contact with. For the app to be successful, just under half the population would need to use it. The family court has decided to fast-track Covid-19-related cases after reporting an increase in urgent applications for hearings during lockdown. Australians with drug problems have also found life harder under lockdown. Rising substance abuse during the pandemic and restrictions on treatments available are pushing an already over-burdened rehab system to breaking point. And Queensland and Western Australia are due to relax some physical distancing measures. WA\u2019s premier, Mark McGowan, said up to 10 people would be allowed to gather outdoors and indoors, and non-contact recreational activities will also be allowed to resume. Donald Trump has declared his controversial media briefings are not worth the effort after he faced widespread ridicule for saying disinfectant and heat and light therapy were potential cures for Covid-19. \u201cWhat is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions, &amp; then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately,\u201d he tweeted. In the UK, a vaccine trial volunteer has had to quash rumours she had died after a fake article circulated on social media. The NHS is feeling the strain of the virus, with more than 2m operations cancelled and only half the sickest patients going on a ventilator, as the death toll from coronavirus in hospitals topped 20,000. Meanwhile, France, Spain and Italy are preparing to loosen restrictions as the rest of Europe looks on to see how some of the first and hardest-hit countries might safely emerge from crippling lockdowns. The independent MP Zali Steggall has asked the auditor general to investigate a government scheme to underwrite gas, hydro and coal power. The underwriting new generation investment scheme promises public support for new dispatchable power generation projects to increase competition in the electricity grid. Steggall, who entered parliament last year on a climate action platform, said the scheme\u2019s focus on fossil fuels was questionable. The government is pushing for greater investment in \u201cfast-start\u201d gas power to assist with the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Australia A study by NSW Health\u2019s Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance says children are unlikely to transmit Covid-19 between each other or to adults. The government has used the findings as it seeks a return to classrooms across Australia despite warnings from teachers\u2019 unions. The opposition has warned that the pandemic is not a time to introduce ideological policy changes such as tax cuts for companies. The Labor senator Kristina Keneally said there was no evidence a lower tax rate for big business would lead to economic growth. The world Trump\u2019s coronavirus response coordinator, Dr Deborah Birx, has downplayed the president\u2019s suggestion that disinfectant and ultraviolet could be cures for Covid-19. Dr Birx said she had \u201cmade it clear\u201d to the president that injected disinfectant \u201cwas not a treatment\u201d but added: \u201cThat kind of dialogue will happen.\u201d Jair Bolsonaro has become engulfed in a new political crisis after federal police accused his son of being a key member of a \u201ccriminal fake news racket\u201d. The Brazilian president\u2019s government is already reeling due to his dismissive reaction to coronavirus. Kim Jong-un\u2019s train has possibly been spotted at an elite North Korean resort. The news comes amid conflicting reports about the leader\u2019s health and whereabouts. Recommended reads Quarantine has meant less sex for anyone who is single or doesn\u2019t live with their partner \u2013 but that hasn\u2019t stopped people from getting risque online. Ginger Gorman writes of a group of women who use their Facebook group chat to discuss things like parenting and food, as well as sharing videos of themselves exploring more sexual themes. One member won herself piles of virtual applause for filming her naked torso slowly getting covered in Ice Magic. The search for a coronavirus vaccine is very much under way, with labs all over the world competing to find a solution to the pandemic. But how will it be distributed once it is found? There are fears it may end up going to the highest bidder rather than the people who need it most. During the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, wealthy nations negotiated large advance orders of the vaccine, effectively crowding out poorer ones. Finding a vaccine to counter the Ebola virus was complicated by the fact that pharmaceutical companies couldn\u2019t see a way to make a profit for a virus that mainly affected some of the world\u2019s poorest nations. Christopher Knaus talks to a global coalition of experts worried about what they describe as \u201cvaccine nationalism\u201d. Listen In today\u2019s episode of Full Story, the M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res coordinator Luis Encinas talks to the Guardian\u2019s Spain correspondent, Sam Jones, about how the coronavirus has transformed the country. In a varied career Encinas has treated patients in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, in Sierra Leone as Ebola took hold, and now in Spain, battling Covid-19.

Donald Trump\u2019s coronavirus response coordinator cautioned that social distancing measures are likely to stay in place throughout the summer. Coronavirus deaths fell below 400 in New York state for the first time this month. Governor Andrew Cuomo said the 367 deaths from the coronavirus that he reported Sunday were \u201chorrific\u201d, but the number was less than half the nearly 800 deaths that occurred in a single day during the pandemic\u2019s peak. Maryland governor says state hotline received \u2018hundreds of calls\u2019. Larry Hogan told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation that his state\u2019s Covid-19 hotline had received \u201chundreds of calls\u201d following Trump\u2019s suggestion that injecting disinfectant could be used as a treatment. Donald Trump attacks \u2018Noble [sic] Prizes\u2019. After saying on Saturday that his coronavirus press briefings are \u201cnot worth the time &amp; effort\u201d due to \u201chostile questions\u201d from journalists, the president said that the \u201cNoble\u201d [sic] Committee should demand its prizes back from journalists who worked on \u201cRussia, Russia, Russia\u201d. In an update of Oliver Laughland\u2019s earlier story, Dr Deborah Birx has cautioned that social distancing measures are likely to stay in place throughout the summer: In a later appearance on NBC News, Birx also responded to a suggestion from the vice-president, Mike Pence, in which he claimed that the US would \u201clargely have this coronavirus epidemic behind us\u201d by Memorial Day, on 25 May. Birx said that while downward trends in infections and deaths in certain locations such as Houston and Detroit \u201cgives us great hope\u201d, she said \u201csocial distancing will be with us through the summer\u201d. She added that the US required a \u201cbreakthrough innovation in testing\u201d to speed up the reopening, by testing for those who have already had coronavirus but displayed little to no symptoms, in order to track the virus\u2019s spread. You can read the full story here: According to public health data collected by the independent Covid Tracking Project, coronavirus deaths nationwide have fallen to 1,184 over the last 24-hour span, the lowest level in nearly three weeks. A church in suburban Indianapolis, which remains under a statewide stay-at-home order until at least 1 May, has resumed in-person services while adhering to a state order barring gatherings of more than 10 people. According to the Indianapolis Star: Services at iTown were slated for every hour between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. Sunday, and parishioners had to reserve tickets online. Tickets for the first round of in-person services were claimed within a day, and the website is already reporting that tickets for May 2-3 services will be made available on May 1. In addition to being limited to 10 people, attendees will have access to face masks and hand sanitizer and are expected to practice social distancing. Attendees both with and without masks entered the church Sunday. What Sumrall called a \u201cprofessional hospital cleaning company\u201d will clean between each service. People who are considered high risk or who are ill are asked to not attend. In a Facebook video posted on Thursday, iTown pastor Dave Sumrall said the church consulted with \u201clocal government leaders and our lawyers\u201d before making the decision. \u201cWe are officially in a situation where your religious freedoms have been removed in the interest of public health,\u201d Sumrall said. \u201cNow listen: I agree that we need to follow the data, we need to listen to our doctors, we need to protect those in our community who are the most vulnerable. But I do not agree with our fundamental rights to worship being revoked. So on one hand the church has been deemed essential, but on the other we\u2019re not allowed to gather. I personally believe this is a fundamental attack on the definition of what the church is.\u201d With no coronavirus task force briefing on the White House schedule for a second straight day, President Trump broke from his mid-afternoon tweetstorm to take a call with French president Emmanuel Macron. White House aide Judd Deere passes along this readout from their conversation: Today, President Donald J. Trump spoke with President Emmanuel Macron of France. President Trump and President Macron discussed positive developments in combating the coronavirus pandemic and progress toward reopening world economies. The two leaders expressed hope to convene the P5 soon and discuss the UN response to the pandemic. President Trump and President Macron agreed on the need to reform the World Health Organization. The two leaders also discussed critical regional and bilateral issues. Florida governor Ron DeSantis is holding a press briefing and has said he has no firm date for when the state will reopen. \u201cWe are going to do everything in a smart way,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cI am less concerned about the date and more concerned about getting it right.\u201d He added that he thinks cases from Covid-19 are on a downward trend in Florida. \u201cOur data shows that the cases peaked at the beginning of April, and we think the hospitalizations peaked a few days after that,\u201d he said. As of Sunday morning, 1,075 people have died from the virus in Florida. Donald Trump is on his customary Sunday Twitter tear. After saying on Saturday that his coronavirus press briefings are \u201cnot worth the time &amp; effort\u201d due to \u201chostile questions\u201d from journalists, the president said that the \u201cNoble\u201d [sic] Committee should demand its prizes back from journalists who worked on \u201cRussia, Russia, Russia\u201d. \u201cWhen will all of the \u201creporters\u201d who have received Noble [sic] Prizes for their work on Russia, Russia, Russia, only to have been proven totally wrong (and, in fact, it was the other side who committed the crimes), be turning back their cherished \u201cNobles\u201d so that they can be given ....to the REAL REPORTERS &amp; JOURNALISTS who got it right. I can give the Committee a very comprehensive list. When will the Noble Committee DEMAND the Prizes back, especially since they were gotten under fraud,\u201d wrote the president. As is often the case, it\u2019s unclear who the president is talking about. The Nobel Prizes were awarded for Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, Literature, Peace and Economics in 2019. The 2019 prize for literature went to Austria\u2019s Peter Handke \u201cfor an influential work that with linguistic ingenuity has explored the periphery and the specificity of human experience.\u201d It is unclear what views Handke holds on disinfectant. Trump may well have meant to criticize the Pulitzer Prizes for journalism. Several winners in 2019 have investigated Trump\u2019s regime. Trump also took time out to wish Melania happy birthday. The White House\u2019s economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, says unemployment levels could approach those seen during the Great Depression. In a sobering interview with ABC\u2019s This Week, Hassett said: \u201cthe next couple of months are going to be terrible\u201d for the economy. He added that unemployment could hit 16%. \u201cWe see an unemployment rate that approaches rates we saw during the Great Depression,\u201d Hassett told ABC. \u201cDuring the Great Recession we lost 8.7m jobs in the whole thing. Now we\u2019re losing that many every 10 days, so the lift for economic policy makers is an extraordinary one.\u201d Elsewhere, despite the fact that GDP is forecast to shrink by 5.6% this year, the Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin, told Fox News that he believes the economy will bounce back when the US starts to reopen this summer. \u201cI think as we begin to reopen the economy in May and June you\u2019re going to see the economy really bounce back in July, August, September ... You\u2019re seeing trillions of dollars that\u2019s making its way into the economy and I think this is going to have a significant impact,\u201d Mnuchin said. Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that injecting disinfectant could be used as a treatment for Covid-19 were so outlandish that they\u2019re easy to dismiss as the ramblings of a leader unable to handle the demands of a pandemic. However, on Sunday Maryland\u2019s Republican governor, Larry Hogan, told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation that his state\u2019s Covid-19 hotline had received \u201chundreds of calls\u201d following Trump\u2019s comments. \u201c[It\u2019s] hard to imagine that people thought that [Trump\u2019s comment] was serious,\u201d Hogan said. \u201c\u201dBut what people actually were thinking about this was this something you could do to protect yourself?\u201d The president has since said that he was being \u201csarcastic\u201d, although TV footage does not bear that out. The president has repeatedly given false or misleading information about the coronavirus during his press briefings, and has often found himself at odds with advice given by his own medical experts. Hogan said that he had raised concerns about \u201cmixed messaging\u201d coming from the White House during the pandemic, and said that the president needed to stick to facts during his briefings. \u201cIt\u2019s critical that the president of the United States, when people are really scared and in the middle of this worldwide pandemic, in these press conferences that we really get the facts out there, and unfortunately some of the messaging has not been great, the mixed messaging,\u201d said Hogan. Hogan is far from the only person with concerns about Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic. His own advisers are reported to be worried that his press briefings were harming his presidential campaign. He made only a short appearance at Friday\u2019s briefing and did not take any any questions from reporters. On Saturday, there was no briefing at all and Trump instead wrote on Twitter that they are \u201cnot worth the time &amp; effort\u201d. \u201cWhat is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions, &amp; then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey get record ratings, &amp; the American people get nothing but Fake News. Not worth the time &amp; effort!\u201d A Louisiana pastor held services at his church today in defiance of house arrest orders following an assault charge stemming from his decision to hold mass gatherings that flouted public health orders. The Associated Press reports: A livestream from Life Tabernacle Church on Sunday showed Tony Spell walking among more than 100 congregants, often repeating the phrase, \u201cI\u2019ve just got to get to Jesus. ... Come on America, let\u2019s get back to Jesus.\u201d Nearly all parishioners were not wearing face masks, and social distancing was not being practiced. The police department in Central, a suburb Baton Rouge, says on their Facebook page that Spell turned himself into the department last week on charges of aggravated assault and improper backing. Trey Bennett has kept up a one-man demonstration in front of the church since Easter Sunday, when he noticed hundreds of parishioners still attending services in defiance of the state\u2019s stay-at-home mandate, which bans gatherings of more than 10 people. Houses of worship across Louisiana have turned to online services instead. Last Sunday, Spell drove a church bus in reverse in the direction of the sign-holding protester. Spell already faces misdemeanor charges for holding in-person church services despite the ban on gatherings. Dozens of Spell\u2019s parishioners met him at the East Baton Rouge Parish prison, dressed in their Sunday best, arrived in church buses to show support. In a livestream from the church, images including photos from Spell\u2019s arrest, as well as information for a GoFundMe account to help with his legal costs, played over music being performed at the church. Cuomo says he is in favor of bringing sports back in some form provided it can generate revenue without ticket sales. \u201cWe want to bring sports back, so there\u2019s an activity that people can watch on TV,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat sports can you do without an audience? What sports can you make work economically where you don\u2019t have to sell a seat in the stadium or in the arena?\u201d He adds: \u201cThey have to be creative and they have to think about it.\u201d When pressed on this, Cuomo says he\u2019s spoken with a number of sports owners and companies and encouraged them to \u201cthink outside the box, because there is no box\u201d. \u201cIf you could make the economics work without the seat sales and you could have teams play without the seat sales but you had televised and you had the television revenue and whatever else went with that?\u201d he says. \u201cYou know we\u2019re in a different place. Be creative and try to figure it out. But if players could get paid more than staying home and owners will get some revenue versus total shutdown, why not? I\u2019d love to watch.\u201d He continues: \u201cIt would have to be up to them, that they an economic analysis that says some revenue is better than no revenue and my players are willing to negotiate a contract reduction. And if they can do it? Everybody has to think outside the box, because there is no box.\u201d Cuomo says he wants to reimagine rather than just reopen the state. \u201cI don\u2019t want to just reopen,\u201d Cuomo says. \u201cWe learned a lot of lessons here. Painfully, but we learned a lot of lessons. And that\u2019s what reimagine means to me. How do we take the lessons we learned, take this pause in life and say, \u2018When we reopen we\u2019re going to be better for it, and we\u2019re going to reimagine what our life is, and we\u2019re going to improve for this pause.\u2019 Even on an individual level. You had time to decompress a little bit. I think everybody when through a period where they analyzed their life and when somebody all of sudden pulls the rug out from under you and you wind up in a different place, you just see life differently. And I think that\u2019s true for most people. \u201cAfter that reflection ... what have we learned, how do we improve and how do we build back better? Because it\u2019s not about return to yesterday. There is no return to yesterday in life. It\u2019s about moving forward. It\u2019s about taking your experience and what you learned and bringing it to a positive effect.\u201d Cuomo begins to outline his vision for reopening the state. Phase one will focus on \u201clow-risk\u201d construction and manufacturing, while phase two will be more essential businesses that are considered low risk. He says businesses must present a plan to demonstrate how they can reopen safely: \u201cWe need them to be creative and think outside the box,\u201d he says. There will be two weeks between phases to carefully monitor the effects. Cuomo adds a major caveat: \u201cYou can\u2019t do anything in any region that would increase the number of visitors to that region. You have a whole multi-state region in lockdown here. It\u2019s possible that you open something in Syracuse or you open something in the North Country where you now see license plates coming in from Connecticut, New Jersey, people from downstate, all coming to that area because they\u2019ve been locked down and they\u2019re looking for an activity.\u201d New York governor Andrew Cuomo starts with \u201crelatively good\u201d news: total hospitalizations in New York are down to levels seen on 31 March, nearly a month ago. There have been 367 deaths statewide in the last day, down from 437 in the previous 24-hour period, Cuomo says. The governor says there have been 16,966 deaths from Covid-19 in New York state overall \u2013 a figure that does not include the roughly 5,000 probable deaths in New York state. Cuomo says he agrees with the CDC\u2019s guidance that hospitalization rate must be in decline for 14 days before considering reopening. Dr Birx also appeared on NBC\u2019s Meet The Press this morning and continued her stance of declining to criticize the president for his dangerous remarks on the use of disinfectant to combat Covid-19 inside the human body. Asked if the president\u2019s remarks undermined the credibility of the administration\u2019s scientific response to the pandemic, Birx replied: I think all of us are very clear and very clear in our discussions with the American people how we\u2019re looking and utilizing data to drive decision making within the task force. Every day, about 2:30 in the morning, I get every single piece of data coming in from every county, where we triangulate where is the virus moving, how are people responding to the virus, are we considering absolutely everything to protect American people? And triangulating that data to come up with that day\u2019s work. Where should PPE go? Where should we be really talking with governors about a recent outbreak? How do we protect individuals that are in essential services? This is the discussion of the task force. Over the weekend Politico published details of a 57 page Republican party attack memo, which advised GOP candidates to aggressively target China in their public remarks on the coronavirus pandemic. From the report: The memo includes advice on everything from how to tie Democratic candidates to the Chinese government to how to deal with accusations of racism. It stresses three main lines of assault: That China caused the virus \u201cby covering it up,\u201d that Democrats are \u201csoft on China,\u201d and that Republicans will \u201cpush for sanctions on China for its role in spreading this pandemic.\u201d The reporting adds to the increasingly clear picture that Republicans will target China throughout election season. A pro-Trump super Pac has already released advertising attacking Joe Biden for his comments on Trump\u2019s decision to ban some travel from the country at the start of the outbreak. More from the report: The document urges candidates to stay relentlessly on message against the country when responding to any questions about the virus. When asked whether the spread of the coronavirus is Trump\u2019s fault, candidates are advised to respond by pivoting to China. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic from the US. We\u2019ll start with comments just made by Donald Trump\u2019s Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr Deborah Birx, who appeared on CNN this morning. Dr Birx declined to criticize the president for dangerous comments he made earlier in the week floating the idea of using sunlight and the injection of disinfectant to the human body to treat Covid-19. Asked if she was bothered by the need to keep ruling out the use of disinfectant, which can be fatal if ingested, Birx said: \u201cIt bothers me that this is still in the news cycle. I worry that we don\u2019t get the information to the American people that they need when we continue to bring up something that was from Thursday night.\u201d Earlier in the interview Birx made clear she had told the President that such treatments were not medically viable, but described Trump\u2019s remarks made during a globally televised press conference, as \u201ca dialogue\u201d between the president and scientists at the department of homeland security about a new study. You can see the full exchange here: And here\u2019s the CDC\u2019s full guidance on the consequences of consumption of disinfectant.",

If you think that those are the measures that we\u2019ve taken for essential businesses that haven\u2019t shut down, you can see how in various different ways they could be expanded to non-essential businesses currently closed,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe won\u2019t just have this binary easing up of measures. We will end up moving to a new normal.\u201d</p> \n<p>Johnson, who has been easing his way back into work with video conference calls, and a three-hour meeting with key ministers at Chequers on Friday, will be back at his desk in No 10, amid growing pressure from some in his own party to lift restrictions.</p> \n<p>Raab said Johnson would be \u201cback at work full-time, properly, at the helm\u201d and is \u201craring to go\u201d. The lockdown measures, imposed on 23 March, are due to be formally reviewed by 7 May.</p> \n<p>The prime minister\u2019s personal role in the earlier stage of managing the outbreak has come under criticism in his absence, while the government has been under relentless pressure over the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/coronavirus-ppe-shortage-doctors-face-hard-decisions-on-whether-to-treat-patients\">lack of PPE for frontline health workers</a>, and the shortfall in testing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c88979fd-0882-4bbe-a6f6-81e7cd60d2b1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/g7BIQl3uobY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, finally announced last week that he will seek 18,000 volunteers to track and trace Covid-19 cases.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson returned to Downing Street on Sunday night with his government under pressure over its handling of coronavirus, as ministers warned that physical distancing must become the \u201cnew normal\u201d \u2013 even when the lockdown is eased. With the prime minister pressed to explain how schools and businesses can reopen without putting lives at risk, the government has given the clearest signal yet of how it hopes to manage the next phase of the pandemic, including imposing quarantine restrictions on all arrivals at UK airports. Hospital deaths from the virus announced on Sunday were 413, taking the total to 20,732. That was the lowest daily total since the end of March, though is expected to increase again during the week. Dominic Raab, who has been deputising since Johnson was taken into hospital with Covid-19 at the start of the month, said on Sunday it was inconceivable that children could return to school, without \u201cfurther measures\u201d to check the spread of the virus. He also suggested businesses hoping to return to work in what he called the \u201csecond phase\u201d of the crisis would have to learn from the essential shops and other workplaces that have remained open, giving the example of distanced queues outside supermarkets. \u201cThere are all sorts of precautions that businesses have taken. If you think that those are the measures that we\u2019ve taken for essential businesses that haven\u2019t shut down, you can see how in various different ways they could be expanded to non-essential businesses currently closed,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr. \u201cWe won\u2019t just have this binary easing up of measures. We will end up moving to a new normal.\u201d Johnson, who has been easing his way back into work with video conference calls, and a three-hour meeting with key ministers at Chequers on Friday, will be back at his desk in No 10, amid growing pressure from some in his own party to lift restrictions. Raab said Johnson would be \u201cback at work full-time, properly, at the helm\u201d and is \u201craring to go\u201d. The lockdown measures, imposed on 23 March, are due to be formally reviewed by 7 May. The prime minister\u2019s personal role in the earlier stage of managing the outbreak has come under criticism in his absence, while the government has been under relentless pressure over the lack of PPE for frontline health workers, and the shortfall in testing. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, finally announced last week that he will seek 18,000 volunteers to track and trace Covid-19 cases. Labour has been calling for contact-tracing for weeks, as have public health experts and Hancock\u2019s predecessor Jeremy Hunt. Health checks and quarantine restrictions for passengers arriving at airports have also been implemented by many other countries. Confirming the government is now considering such measures, Raab insisted that medical advice had previously suggested this would not be effective while the virus was freely circulating within the UK. In a letter to Johnson at the weekend, the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, said: \u201cI fear we are falling behind the rest of the world.\u201d The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will underline the costs of shuttering the economy to tackle the crisis on Monday, as he makes a statement to the House of Commons on the Treasury\u2019s response to the crisis. He will point to forecasts by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility that suggested a three-month lockdown could lead to a catastrophic 35% decline in GDP in the second quarter of the year. Sunak is among those cabinet ministers who have been keen to see some businesses reopen, and officials have been working on proposals for deciding which should come first \u2013 based on how easy it would be for them to work safely, and how critical they are to the economy. Raab is cautious about lifting restrictions too soon, however, and during several interviews on Sunday, repeatedly stressed the risks of avoiding a second peak in infections, which he said would damage the economy, as well as public health. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure of two things: first of all we don\u2019t risk a second spike, for all the reasons we\u2019ve discussed. Secondly, that overall this package doesn\u2019t allow the coronavirus to get back hold, to spread more widely and to undo all the progress we\u2019ve made, or the sacrifices so many people have made,\u201d he said. He also echoed the warning of Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, that a vaccine is unlikely to be widely available this year. The TUC is calling for businesses to be obliged to make a comprehensive risk assessment before they can reopen. \u201cWe need tough new measures from government to reassure working people that their health and safety is a priority\u201d said its general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady. \u201cToo many workers have already been forced to put their health on the line during this pandemic. \u201cWe all want everyone to get back to work and start rebuilding Britain. But workers need confidence that they won\u2019t have to put themselves or their families at unnecessary risk.\u201d Polling carried out for the TUC showed 40% of workers are concerned about the health risks of returning to their workplace. O\u2019Grady called for bosses who put the health of their staff at risk to be prosecuted. Raab declined to say what physical distancing in schools might mean in practice \u2013 though Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, suggested that in Scotland it could involve staggered attendance by different year groups. \u201cIt would not be right or safe to open schools right now and that may continue to be the case for some time to come, but the point I think everybody is trying to get their heads round right now is that as we come out of these very restrictive measures we\u2019re not going to be going back to normality as we knew it,\u201d Sturgeon told Marr. \u201cIt\u2019s what I described \u2013 and many others have used this phrase \u2013 a new normal that we\u2019re looking for where social distancing will be a fact of life for quite some time to come and different ways of operating will have to be contemplated.\u201d The shadow education secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, called the government to consult with the teaching unions about how best to manage children\u2019s return to school when it is safe to do so. \u201cSchool leaders, teachers and support staff have been working tirelessly to keep children\u2019s education going during this crisis and to minimise disruption and the inevitable impact on social inequality. Any decision to lift restrictions cannot be sprung upon schools at short notice,\u201d she said. In another sign of the scale of disruption to normal life, the environment secretary, George Eustice, repeated his call for furloughed workers to go to the aid of Britain\u2019s farmers, by picking fruit and vegetables during the harvest season this summer.",

      "body": "<p>As the prime minister, Boris Johnson, heads back to Downing Street, he faces calls from Labour to be clearer about how Britain might start lifting the coronavirus lockdown, now entering its fifth week. On Sunday, the foreign secretary and first secretary of state, Dominic Raab, warned the outbreak remained at a \u201cdelicate and dangerous\u201d stage and said it was irresponsible to speculate about steps to modify the rules underpinning government\u2019s \u201cstay home, protect the NHS, save lives\u201d strategy.</p> <p>More than 20,000 people have died from Covid-19 in NHS hospitals and thousands more in care homes. But there are growing concerns about the economic impact of lockdown. Gerard Lyons, Johnson\u2019s economics adviser when he was London mayor, warned on Sunday the UK could be the hardest-hit western economy if it does not unlock soon. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, also called on ministers to start talking to teachers, businesses, trade unions and town hall leaders and open \u201chonest conversations with the public about what new arrangements might look like\u201d. Unions insist worker safety must not be compromised by any changes and questions remain about public appetite for risking a new peak of contagion, but plans to modify restrictions are starting to emerge.</p> <h2><strong>Shopping</strong></h2> <p>One-way systems and plastic till barriers are among strategies to be used by retailers to reopen non-food stores. The DIY retailer Homebase tested the waters by reopening 20 of its stores on Saturday while the electronics retailer Dixons Carphone said it will launch \u201czero-contact\u201d stores. Its Norwegian shops have remained open using contactless ordering and payment, prepaid pickups and increased cleaning and hygiene. This could be replicated in the UK, the firm said.</p> <p>Clothes shops could reopen, but with changing rooms off limits, according to guidelines published on Sunday by the British Retail Consortium. It has recommended store managers designate different entrances and exits and send shoppers through aisles in a one-way system to limit contact. Shopper numbers should also be restricted, promotional displays pared back to give customers more space and product demonstrations avoided to deter clustering. Tills will be shielded with plastic screens, as seen in some supermarkets, and floor markings in payment queues will keep customers two metres apart.</p> <h2><strong>International travel</strong></h2> <p>Raab confirmed on Sunday that people arriving at ports and airports could be quarantined for 14 days as part of emerging plans to lift Britain out of its lockdown. Officials at the Home Office, which is responsible for border security, and the Department for Transport are reported to have drafted plans for 14-day \u201cstay at home\u201d notices, similar to those currently issued to Singaporean citizens returning from abroad. Such a rule would apply to foreign arrivals as well as UK citizens, with fines for failure to remain at the address given for isolation. Raab told the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: \u201cWhether it is a quarantine period, or testing or other measures that might be taken, it is possible.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Building</strong></h2> <p>Ibstock, one of Britain\u2019s biggest brick-makers, will restart production on Monday, and ministers appear keen for builders to catch up on time lost during the lockdown. Construction sites have been kept open since the 23 March lockdown, with physical distancing rules in place. Due to sickness and self-isolation, however, many contracts are well behind. Two of the UK\u2019s biggest housebuilders, Persimmon and Vistry (formerly Bovid) are due to reopen sites on Monday, with Persimmon\u2019s chief executive, David Jenkinson, saying the firm has \u201cnew site protocols that incorporate the necessary social distancing and protective measures\u201d.</p> <p>Builders could be allowed to work through evenings and weekends, in temporary lifting of noise abatement rules, it was reported at the weekend. Planning conditions currently limit how late builders can work and tend to prohibit Sunday working.</p> <h2><strong>Workers</strong></h2> <p>After the deaths of taxi drivers, care workers, nurses and doctors from Covid-19 picked up at work, trade unions are demanding that all employers produce risk assessments before lockdown is eased. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) said that two in five workers are concerned about not being able to phyiscally distance from colleagues, and more than a quarter are concerned about not being able to physically distance from customers or clients. Building workers organised by Unite said that because workers on housebuilding sites are mostly self-employed, enforcing health and safety guidelines will be difficult.</p> <p>\u201cWe need tough new measures from government to reassure working people that their health and safety is a priority,\u201d said Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC. \u201cToo many workers have already been forced to put their health on the line during this pandemic. We all want everyone to get back to work and start rebuilding Britain. But workers need confidence that they won\u2019t have to put themselves or their families at unnecessary risk.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>Schools</strong></h2> <p>The headteachers union ASCL has said it does not think schools could reopen until 1 June at the earliest. The home secretary, Priti Patel, said at the weekend the government would not put a date on it because it would be \u201cirresponsible and get hopes up\u201d. Raab, said it would be \u201cinconceivable\u201d to send children back to school without physical distancing. This all points to schools being one of the later steps in any lockdown lifting.</p> <p>Labour is applying pressure though, with shadow cabinet member Rachel Reeves warning \u201cyoung people are missing out on vital days and weeks and months of their education\u201d. The Sutton Trust has found that two-thirds of pupils have not taken part in any online learning while at home, with independent school pupils more likely to be keeping up remotely. Social workers are concerned that the most vulnerable children will suffer most as the schools remain closed.</p>",

The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, also called on ministers to start talking to teachers, businesses, trade unions and town hall leaders and open \u201chonest conversations with the public about what new arrangements might look like\u201d. Unions insist worker safety must not be compromised by any changes and questions remain about public appetite for risking a new peak of contagion, but plans to modify restrictions are starting to emerge. Shopping One-way systems and plastic till barriers are among strategies to be used by retailers to reopen non-food stores. The DIY retailer Homebase tested the waters by reopening 20 of its stores on Saturday while the electronics retailer Dixons Carphone said it will launch \u201czero-contact\u201d stores. Its Norwegian shops have remained open using contactless ordering and payment, prepaid pickups and increased cleaning and hygiene. This could be replicated in the UK, the firm said. Clothes shops could reopen, but with changing rooms off limits, according to guidelines published on Sunday by the British Retail Consortium. It has recommended store managers designate different entrances and exits and send shoppers through aisles in a one-way system to limit contact. Shopper numbers should also be restricted, promotional displays pared back to give customers more space and product demonstrations avoided to deter clustering. Tills will be shielded with plastic screens, as seen in some supermarkets, and floor markings in payment queues will keep customers two metres apart. International travel Raab confirmed on Sunday that people arriving at ports and airports could be quarantined for 14 days as part of emerging plans to lift Britain out of its lockdown. Officials at the Home Office, which is responsible for border security, and the Department for Transport are reported to have drafted plans for 14-day \u201cstay at home\u201d notices, similar to those currently issued to Singaporean citizens returning from abroad. Such a rule would apply to foreign arrivals as well as UK citizens, with fines for failure to remain at the address given for isolation. Raab told the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: \u201cWhether it is a quarantine period, or testing or other measures that might be taken, it is possible.\u201d Building Ibstock, one of Britain\u2019s biggest brick-makers, will restart production on Monday, and ministers appear keen for builders to catch up on time lost during the lockdown. Construction sites have been kept open since the 23 March lockdown, with physical distancing rules in place. Due to sickness and self-isolation, however, many contracts are well behind. Two of the UK\u2019s biggest housebuilders, Persimmon and Vistry (formerly Bovid) are due to reopen sites on Monday, with Persimmon\u2019s chief executive, David Jenkinson, saying the firm has \u201cnew site protocols that incorporate the necessary social distancing and protective measures\u201d. Builders could be allowed to work through evenings and weekends, in temporary lifting of noise abatement rules, it was reported at the weekend. Planning conditions currently limit how late builders can work and tend to prohibit Sunday working. Workers After the deaths of taxi drivers, care workers, nurses and doctors from Covid-19 picked up at work, trade unions are demanding that all employers produce risk assessments before lockdown is eased. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) said that two in five workers are concerned about not being able to phyiscally distance from colleagues, and more than a quarter are concerned about not being able to physically distance from customers or clients. Building workers organised by Unite said that because workers on housebuilding sites are mostly self-employed, enforcing health and safety guidelines will be difficult. \u201cWe need tough new measures from government to reassure working people that their health and safety is a priority,\u201d said Frances O\u2019Grady, general secretary of the TUC. \u201cToo many workers have already been forced to put their health on the line during this pandemic. We all want everyone to get back to work and start rebuilding Britain. But workers need confidence that they won\u2019t have to put themselves or their families at unnecessary risk.\u201d Schools The headteachers union ASCL has said it does not think schools could reopen until 1 June at the earliest. The home secretary, Priti Patel, said at the weekend the government would not put a date on it because it would be \u201cirresponsible and get hopes up\u201d. Raab, said it would be \u201cinconceivable\u201d to send children back to school without physical distancing. This all points to schools being one of the later steps in any lockdown lifting. Labour is applying pressure though, with shadow cabinet member Rachel Reeves warning \u201cyoung people are missing out on vital days and weeks and months of their education\u201d. The Sutton Trust has found that two-thirds of pupils have not taken part in any online learning while at home, with independent school pupils more likely to be keeping up remotely. Social workers are concerned that the most vulnerable children will suffer most as the schools remain closed.",

In a report published on Monday, the home affairs select committee calls for a raft of measures from the government, including an emergency package of funding for support services for domestic abuse victims and vulnerable children. The cross-party committee recommends that the government legislates to remove a time limit on prosecuting certain offences to ensure perpetrators of domestic abuse during the lockdown do not get away with their crimes. The government should sponsor the broadening of a \u201csafe spaces\u201d model to allow victims to access support via supermarkets and other retailers, it adds. Multiple support services have reported a surge in calls to helplines, while the Metropolitan police said they had made 4,093 arrests for domestic abuse offences \u2013 an average of about 100 a day \u2013 since 9 March, when people with coronavirus symptoms were asked to self-isolate. The domestic abuse bill returns to the Commons for its second reading on Tuesday. The committee\u2019s chair, Yvette Cooper, said: \u201cStaying at home is an important part of the strategy to prevent coronavirus from spreading and save lives, but for some people home isn\u2019t safe. Urgent action is needed to protect victims and prevent perpetrators from exploiting the lockdown to increase abuse. \u201cThere are already alarming signs of the rise in domestic abuse.

The emotional, physical and social scars from domestic abuse can last a lifetime. If we don\u2019t act to tackle it now, we will feel the consequences of rising abuse during the coronavirus crisis for many years to come.\u201d A pioneering project called Counting Dead Women has recorded at least 16 domestic abuse killings of women and children between 23 March, when the lockdown began, and 12 April. While the committee welcomed a public information campaign launched by the government this month, the report says ministers need to go further with a full action plan led and coordinated by the home secretary, Priti Patel. A cross-government strategy would need to cover support services, housing and the criminal justice system, the report says, and should extend to the period immediately after the lockdown is lifted when the need for assistance is likely to be acute. \u201cWithout strong action to tackle domestic abuse and support victims during the Covid-19 pandemic, society will be dealing with the devastating consequences for a generation,\u201d the report says. It says the plan should include access to information and support, prevention and outreach, housing support and refuge accommodation, as well as a \u201cstrong criminal justice response\u201d. In particular, it says support services for domestic abuse and vulnerable children need urgent and direct funding, otherwise victims will be put at much greater risk of harm. It urges ministers to set up an emergency funding package, ringfenced within the \u00a3750m fund that the government has promised for charities dealing with the coronavirus crisis. The home secretary previously announced \u00a32m of funding for domestic abuse helplines and online support, while \u00a3600,000 of funding will go to six charities that specialise in supporting victims of domestic and sexual abuse. The safeguarding minister, Victoria Atkins, said: \u201cThe government has prioritised those at risk of domestic abuse in this national health emergency.

Jon Geldart, its director general, said it was in everyone\u2019s interests to kickstart the economy again once it is safe to do so.</p> <p>\u201cDirectors from all parts of the UK need to make plans for riding out this tempest, but they can\u2019t get very far if they have no idea what will be happening in a few weeks\u2019 time,\u201d Geldart said.</p> <p>\u201cBusiness leaders know [the end of restrictions] will not happen all in one go, but that\u2019s why it\u2019s even more important to tell them what they need to prepare for.\u201d</p> <p>A poll of the IoD\u2019s members showed they were more fearful about their company\u2019s future than at any point since the Brexit vote, with business leaders pessimistic about the fortunes of their firms well beyond the current lockdown. Their investment intentions were also at a record low, with revenue and employment for the next 12 months expected to fall dramatically.</p> <p>The bleak business outlook came amid tentative signs of economic life as companies, including builders, retailers and fast-food restaurants, prepare to reopen after devising new safety regimes.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Housebuilders</strong> Berkeley Group, Bellway and Barratt have signalled plans to get back to work. Berkeley will restart work at 80% of its sites this week, while Bellway will return to about 100 \u2013 roughly a third \u2013 of its sites on 4 May. Barratt intends to be up and running in a fortnight\u2019s time.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Retail </strong>Timpsons, the family-owned cobblers, will this week reopen 40 shops that are located inside supermarkets. The move follows Homebase\u2019s reopening of 20 stores this weekend and last week\u2019s move by B&amp;Q to resume trading at 155 outlets. Builders\u2019 merchants Travis Perkins and Wickes are also expected to begin store trials.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Fast</strong><strong> food</strong> Leon, the restaurant chain, is to reopen another six London sites as takeaways, adding to the 16 already trading. Pret a Manger and Burger King are also planning to reopen more branches.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Travel </strong>Wizz Air has become one of the first airlines to resume flights.

      "bodyText": "The government must set out its lockdown exit plans to restore confidence among British businesses that have become increasingly bleak about the economy\u2019s future, a leading employers\u2019 group has warned. The Institute of Directors said its 28,000 members were \u201cclamouring\u201d for information so they could start drawing up return-to-work plans. Jon Geldart, its director general, said it was in everyone\u2019s interests to kickstart the economy again once it is safe to do so. \u201cDirectors from all parts of the UK need to make plans for riding out this tempest, but they can\u2019t get very far if they have no idea what will be happening in a few weeks\u2019 time,\u201d Geldart said. \u201cBusiness leaders know [the end of restrictions] will not happen all in one go, but that\u2019s why it\u2019s even more important to tell them what they need to prepare for.\u201d A poll of the IoD\u2019s members showed they were more fearful about their company\u2019s future than at any point since the Brexit vote, with business leaders pessimistic about the fortunes of their firms well beyond the current lockdown. Their investment intentions were also at a record low, with revenue and employment for the next 12 months expected to fall dramatically. The bleak business outlook came amid tentative signs of economic life as companies, including builders, retailers and fast-food restaurants, prepare to reopen after devising new safety regimes. Housebuilders Berkeley Group, Bellway and Barratt have signalled plans to get back to work. Berkeley will restart work at 80% of its sites this week, while Bellway will return to about 100 \u2013 roughly a third \u2013 of its sites on 4 May. Barratt intends to be up and running in a fortnight\u2019s time. Retail Timpsons, the family-owned cobblers, will this week reopen 40 shops that are located inside supermarkets. The move follows Homebase\u2019s reopening of 20 stores this weekend and last week\u2019s move by B&amp;Q to resume trading at 155 outlets. Builders\u2019 merchants Travis Perkins and Wickes are also expected to begin store trials. Fast food Leon, the restaurant chain, is to reopen another six London sites as takeaways, adding to the 16 already trading. Pret a Manger and Burger King are also planning to reopen more branches. Travel Wizz Air has become one of the first airlines to resume flights. On 1 May the budget carrier is reopening its Luton airport base for flights to European destinations including Portugal and Spain. With the lion\u2019s share of UK businesses forced to close in order to comply with lockdown, parts of the economy have come to a virtual standstill. The manufacturing and services industries suffered a record collapse in trade in April, while the picture from the high street is also grim, with predictions that sales could be down as much as 30% as Britons stay away from the shops. With the gloomy data piling up Gertjan Vlieghe, a member of the Bank of England\u2019s interest-rate setting committee, said last week that early indicators pointed to an economic contraction \u201cfaster and deeper than anything we have seen in the past century, or possibly several centuries\u201d.

Still, their scope is modest compared with some countries. <br></p> \n  <p>Early in the pandemic, Lopez Obrador came under fire for flouting government advice by continuing to hold large public events.

A number of London branches of sandwich chain Pret a Manger have reopened in the past couple of weeks, with Perspex screens separating staff and customers, and only 15% of the usual menu, so there could be fewer people in the kitchen.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ve launched a new blog at the link below \u2013 head there for the latest: Here a few key developments of the past few hours at a glance: More US states to end lockdown as the US economy crumbles. The US states Colorado, Mississippi, Minnesota, Montana and Tennessee will join four other states in the lifting of lockdown restrictions, as economists predict an unemployment rate of 16% or higher for the month of April. The Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told the nation in a televised address \u201cif you love Italy, maintain distance\u201d as he revealed details of a plan that will see the country slowly ease lockdown measures from 4 May. British prime minister Boris Johnson returned to work in Downing Street on Sunday evening, where the government is headquartered, for the first time since he was admitted to hospital with Covid-19 on 6 April. Two British newspapers reported that Johnson could be announcing a relaxation of lockdown measures soon. Egypt has asked the International Monitory Fund (IMF) for financial assistance to deal with the economic fallout caused by the coronavirus. With tourism and aviation at a standstill, the partial lockdown threatens the livelihoods of many of Egypt\u2019s 100 million people.. Russia could experience a new spike in cases if people flout lockdown measures during public holidays scheduled for early May, a top health official said on Sunday, after total reported infections in Russia topped 80,000. Chile is to push ahead with immunity passports and is planning to issue previously announced \u201crelease certificates\u201d for recovered Covid-19 patients \u2018\u201csoon\u201d, despite a World Health Organization warning that it is not clear whether people have immunity after becoming infected. New York governor outlines lifting of restrictions for parts of the state. Andrew Cuomo said some regions of the state might qualify to open sooner, \u201cwith certain precautions\u201d, such as upstate New York, as the daily death toll was markedly lower on Sunday than it was on Saturday. France\u2019s daily death toll slowed as recorded Covid-19 fatalities in France rose by 242 to 22,856 on Sunday, down from 369 new deaths the previous day. The country\u2019s prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, said he would present a national exit strategy to parliament on Tuesday, which would then debate and vote on the recommendations. Germany could introduce right to work from home in future. The country\u2019s labour minister Hubertus Heil is working on legislation that would give employees the right to work from home, even after the current crisis when social distancing will be no longer needed, he said on Sunday. Israel\u2019s health minister announced his resignation. Yaakov Litzman declared that he would step down, following a public uproar over his handling of the coronavirus crisis, such as his initial decision to exclude the ultra-Orthodox community from social distancing regulations. This is all from me, I\u2019m now handing over to my colleagues in Australia. Thanks for reading and writing in! I\u2019m off to bed. Iran plans to reopen mosques in parts of the country that have been consistently free of the coronavirus outbreak as restrictions on Iranians gradually ease, president Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday. Iran, one of the Middle Eastern countries hardest hit by the pandemic, will be divided up into white, yellow and red regions based on the number of infections and deaths, Rouhani said, according to the presidency\u2019s website. Activities in each region will be restricted accordingly, so an area that has been consistently free of infections or deaths will be labelled white and mosques could be reopened and Friday prayers resumed, Reuters reports. Iranians have returned to shops, bazaars and parks over the past week as the country eases coronavirus restrictions, with the daily increase in the death toll below 100 since April 14. The toll rose by 60 over the past 24 hours to 5,710, with 90,481 confirmed cases, Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur told state TV on Sunday. A large majority of Mexicans support the work done by president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to contain the coronavirus outbreak and agree with a decision to extend quarantine measures until the end of May, an opinion poll showed on Sunday. A telephone survey of 549 Mexicans between 17 and 21 April showed 73% gave a positive appraisal of Lopez Obrador\u2019s efforts, with only 17% of the opposite view. The remainder gave no assessment, Reuters reports. 82% of respondents said the government had done well in reducing the spread of coronavirus, which as of Saturday evening had led to nearly 14,000 confirmed cases of infection and over 1,300 deaths in Mexico. Deaths have doubled in the past week and Mexico\u2019s government on Tuesday said it was entering the most serious phase of the pandemic. Earlier, it extended quarantining until May 30, a decision that some 72% of survey respondents supported. Mexico\u2019s government has ordered schools and non-essential businesses to close but it has not imposed a strict curfew, unlike some countries in Latin America. Mexicans were less sure about Lopez Obrador\u2019s economic management of the crisis, but the balance of opinion was still favorable. Some 62% said the government had made good decisions to reactivate the economy, with 32% disagreeing. The government is issuing millions of loans to businesses to help them through the pandemic, and has gradually stepped up relief measures. Still, their scope is modest compared with some countries. Early in the pandemic, Lopez Obrador came under fire for flouting government advice by continuing to hold large public events. However, since suspending those gatherings he has been insistent on the need to pursue social distancing. The survey showed the government had to strike a balance in satisfying public opinion. From Monday 27 April, people living in of Germany\u2019s Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state in the southwest of the country will have to cover mouth and nose when they enter shops or use public transport. Exemptions apply to people with disabilities, particularly the deaf and their companions, and cashiers sitting behind a plexiglass partitioning wall, as well as to children under six. The coronavirus crisis is causing a rise in substance abuse in Australia, and treatment restrictions are pushing an already over-burdened rehab system to breaking point, my colleague Michael McGowan reports. Read the full story here: While coronavirus has wreaked havoc in many countries, particularly in the West, Vietnam has practically managed to dodge Covid-19. Although the country is neighbouring China, which was the first epicentre of the outbreak, Vietnam has reported zero deaths from the virus. After the first two cases were confirmed in Vietnam in late January, the Communist Party-led government cracked down on the problem immediately, and practically sealed the country off from the rest of the world, banning nearly all flights, both domestic and international, and started a surveillance programme to monitor people\u2019s homes and whether they were buying flu medication. Mass quarantines were imposed on people who were sent to camps and hotels with the help of the military. To date, Vietnam has reported only 270 infections, and after no new cases had been reported for a week, Vietnamese prime minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc decided to lift the country\u2019s social distancing restrictions on 23 April. The British prime minister Boris Johnson could ease current lockdown restrictions as early as next week, the Daily Telegraph newspaper reports. \u201cBoris Johnson is expected to announce plans for easing the lockdown as early as this week after he returned to Downing Street on Sunday night,\u201d the paper wrote in an article published on Sunday evening. Johnson, who used to work for the Daily Telegraph, is expected to chair his first meeting of the Covid-19 \u201cwar cabinet\u201d on Monday since he was hospitalised in early April. The paper added that allies of Johnson had hinted that he could decide to \u201cmodify\u201d elements of the lockdown before it is scheduled to be reviewed on May 7, \u201cas he is increasingly bullish about the possibility of altering restrictions if scientific advice allows for it.\u201d The Times newspaper reported on its frontpage for Monday that the government had stepped up planning to ease the lockdown in the coming weeks \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d, and that advisers had been appointed to draw up plans that would put Britain \u201cback in business\u201d. Giuseppe Conte, the Italian prime minister, has not yet made a decision on restarting Serie A football, but gave the green light for players in the country\u2019s top league to resume training in a week\u2019s time. As Conte unveiled the first details of how the country will emerge from its lockdown, he said individual athletes would be allowed to resume training on 4 May, while teams could start to train together again on 18 May, AFP reports. But Conte did not say when Serie A might resume the current season, which was interrupted on 9 March with Juventus leading Lazio by a point. \u201cThe championship will start again only when it is safe,\u201d Conte told the nation in a televised address. Italian football chiefs agreed on Thursday to push back the end of the Serie A season from June 30 to August 2. Companies in the European Union hit by coronavirus will be able to ask for a government loan of up to 5% of their 2019 turnover under a new measure proposed by the European Commission, a person familiar with the matter said on Sunday. The move comes after several EU countries asked for it, other sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Saturday, declining to provide details. The size of the loan could also be up to 40% of the beneficiary\u2019s annual wage bill, the person said. The EU executive has in recent weeks relaxed its state aid rules and nodded through trillions of euros via guaranteed loans, grants, subsidised interest rates and short-term export credit insurance offered to virus-hit companies across the bloc. Dubai said on Sunday it had lifted its full lockdown on two commercial districts with large populations of low-income migrant workers, after the United Arab Emirates eased nationwide coronavirus curfews over the weekend. On Friday, Dubai cut its emirate-wide 24-hour lockdown back to a 10pm to 6am curfew, and allowed dine-in cafes and restaurants to resume business with a maximum capacity of 30% and shopping malls to be reopened partially. It has now taken the same step in the Al Ras and Naif districts, which had been sealed off as part of efforts to contain the spread of the virus, Reuters reports. The UAE has reported more than 10,300 cases and 76 deaths resulting from the virus, the second-highest count among the six Gulf Arab countries after Saudi Arabia. The Gulf states, where expatriates make up the bulk of the labour force, have seen infections spread among low-wage foreign workers living in cramped quarters despite measures to combat the disease including the suspension of passenger flights, curfews and the closure of public spaces. Mosques, cinemas and playgrounds in Dubai remain closed. People from all over the world are writing in every day with new developments and comments for our live coverage on the pandemic, which is hugely appreciated by Guardian reporters trying to provide timely updates from around the globe. One thing that has stood out in my inbox over the past two weeks is the amount of emails I receive from Swedish readers. Many have expressed frustration about the international coverage of Sweden\u2019s approach to the coronavirus crisis, pointing out for instance that care home deaths are high in many countries that have imposed strict lockdowns, and insisting that things are not at all \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d in the country. To quote one reader from Stockholm who wrote in tonight: \u201cWe do not recognise ourselves here at all in your reporting of a totally laissez-faire strategy. We have clear guidelines - which most people follow with common sense. We will have to wait some months to really be able to compare [Sweden\u2019s approach with that of other countries] on even grounds.\u201d Egypt declared on Sunday that it had asked the International Monitory Fund (IMF) for financial assistance to deal with the economic fallout caused by the coronavirus. Neither Egypt nor the IMF specified the size of the one-year bailout loan, which prime minister Mustafa Madbouly said would include a financial package alongside technical support, according to the Associated Press. Egypt has been under a partial lockdown since mid-March, with a curfew in place from 9pm to 6am. Schools, mosques, churches and archaeological sites are closed, although many businesses remain open during the day. With tourism and aviation at a standstill, the partial lockdown threatens the livelihoods of many of Egypts 100 million people. One in three Egyptians were already living in poverty before the outbreak, according to government figures. Egypt secured a $12bn (\u00a39.8bn) bailout package from the IMF in 2016, and introduced new reforms which saw the government float the currency, slash subsidies on fuel, services and utilities, and impose a value-added tax. A British national has been deported from Singapore and barred from re-entering the country after falsely declaring his travel history, according to Channel News Asia. The 60-year-old man, who is married to a Singapore permanent resident, was also issued a stern warning for the offence of providing false information to a public servant. \u201cOn 26 March, the police were alerted that the man had made a false declaration of his travel history at the Family Justice Courts,\u201d said a joint statement from the Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) on Sunday. As part of precautionary measures amid the pandemic, the Family Justice Courts requires all visitors to declare their travel history for the last 14 days. The man declared that he had not been abroad in the last 14 days, and was hence allowed to enter Family Justice Courts. However, he had arrived in Singapore from Hong Kong on 13 March, which was still within the 14-day travel history period at the time of his visit. The man was deported to Hong Kong on 26 April, and barred from re-entering Singapore. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, told the nation \u201cif you love Italy, maintain distance\u201d as he announced a plan that will see the country slowly ease lockdown measures from 4 May. \u201cYou must always respect the safe distance of at least one metre,\u201d he said. \u201cEven within the family setting. Experts tell us that one out of four cases of infection occur in the family context.\u201d Italy has been under full lockdown since 11 March and the move out of it will be gradual. Manufacturing and construction activity will resume from 4 May while people can travel within their regions so long as visits are \u201ctargeted\u201d, such as visiting family, and face masks are worn. Travel between regions is only permitted for a valid reason, such as for work or medical purposes. Museums and libraries will reopen on 18 May and bars and restaurants from 1 June, although they can offer takeout services from 4 May. Schools will open from September. Parks and public gardens will reopen from 4 May and people can exercise outside so long as they maintain a two-metre distance from others. Deaths from coronavirus in Italy rose by 260 on Sunday, the lowest day-to-to increase since 14 March, while the contagion rate has been falling. \u201cWe all want the country to restart,\u201d Conte said. \u201cHowever, the only way to live with the virus in this phase is to not fall ill \u2014 and social distancing.\u201d Germany\u2019s labour minister Hubertus Heil is working on legislation that would give employees the right to work from home, even after the current crisis when social distancing will be no longer needed. \u201cEveryone who wants to and whose workplace allows it should be able to work in a home office, even when the coronavirus pandemic is over,\u201d Heil told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. About 25% of Germans are now estimated to be working from home, up from about 12% normally. Heil said he would table legislation later in the year to enshrine the right to work from home in law, even full-time if that is what employees want. Finance minister Olaf Scholz, like Heil a Social Democrat, expressed approval for the idea. \u201cThe past weeks have shown how much is possible in the home office, this is a real achievement that we should not just abandon,\u201d he told the paper. The political storm engulfing Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, will further distract from the country\u2019s efforts to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 4,000 Brazilians, my colleague Tom Phillips reports from Rio de Janeiro. Bolsonaro\u2019s dismissive reaction to the coronavirus crisis has sparked outrage across the political spectrum, but now reports that his son is an alleged key member of a \u201ccriminal fake news racket\u201d is dominating the headlines. Read the full report here: Russia could experience a new spike in Covid-19 cases if people flout lockdown measures during public holidays scheduled for early May, a top health official said on Sunday, Reuters reports. The number of coronavirus cases in Russia began rising sharply this month, reaching more than 80,000 on Sunday after a record 6,361 new cases were registered over the past day. Anna Popova, head of Russia\u2019s consumer health watchdog, said the country had so far avoided a spike in cases and could continue to do so \u201cif only we do not give up during the holidays\u201d. \u201cThat is the biggest risk today,\u201d Popova said in an interview on state television. Russia, which has so far recorded 747 coronavirus-related deaths, has declared lockdowns across the country, including in the capital Moscow, the area worst-affected by the virus. Muscovites are only allowed to go out to buy food or medicines at their nearest shop, get urgent medical treatment, walk their dog, or take out the trash. They must apply for a digital permit for any other movement across the city. A group of 25 Dutch high school students with very little sailing experience were reunited with their relieved families on Sunday after completing a trans-Atlantic voyage that was forced on them by coronavirus restrictions, the Associated Press reports. The children, aged 14 to 17, watched over by 12 experienced crew members and three teachers, were on an educational cruise of the Caribbean when the pandemic forced them to radically change their plans for returning home in March. Instead of flying back from Cuba as originally planned, the crew and students stocked up on supplies and warm clothes and set sail for the northern Dutch port of Harlingen, a five-week voyage of nearly 7,000 kilometers (4,350 miles), on board the 60-metre (200-foot) top sail schooner Wylde Swan. As they arrived home, the students hung up a self-made banner saying Bucket List with ticks in boxes for Atlantic Ocean crossing, mid-ocean swim and surviving the Bermuda triangle. The teens hugged and chanted each others names as they walked off the ship and into the arms of their families, who drove their cars alongside the yacht one by one to adhere to social distancing rules imposed to rein in the spread of the virus that forced the students into their long trip home. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, has returned to Downing Street, where the government is headquartered, tonight, for the first time since he was admitted to hospital with Covid-19 on 6 April. Johnson, 55, spent three nights on an intensive care ward, and was released from hospital on 12 April. He has been recuperating in Chequers since, his country house in Buckinghamshire, and is expected to return to work on Monday. The PM\u2019s official Twitter account just released a video clip of George Eustice from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, who reiterated the government\u2019s commitment to the current social distancing measures earlier at today\u2019s coronavirus press conference. Israel\u2019s embattled health minister Yaakov Litzman has announced that he would step down, following a public uproar over his handling of the coronavirus crisis and his own Covid-19 infection. Litzman informed the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that he would step aside as the country forms a new government. He made no mention of his much-criticised performance at the health ministry, which he has led for most of the past decade, and instead said he would take over the construction ministry, the Associated Press reports. Part of Litzman\u2019s early response to the pandemic was to exclude the ultra-Orthodox community from social distancing regulations, allowing public bath houses and synagogues to remain open, and even promising that the messiah would come and put an end to the epidemic, the Haaretz newspaper reports. 15,443 people in Israel have so far tested positive for the coronavirus, and 201 people have died. In the West Bank, 480 cases have been diagnosed so far, and two people have died. In Gaza, 17 cases have been confirmed, eight of which have recovered. The Palestinian health ministry has reopened restaurants in Gaza after a six-week lockdown. Germany changed course on Sunday over which type of smartphone technology it wants to use to trace coronavirus infections, backing an approach supported by Apple and Google along with a growing number of other European nations, Reuters reports. Countries are rushing to develop apps that can help track the chain of infection, which is proving hard to break because people can spread the virus before they have any symptoms. Chancellery minister Helge Braun and health minister Jens Spahn said in a joint statement that Berlin would adopt a \u201cdecentralised\u201d approach to digital contact tracing, and abandon a home-grown alternative that would have given health authorities central control over tracing data. A centralised collection of people\u2019s data had attracted sharp criticism from data protection experts. The data would now only be saved on people\u2019s phones, and users of the app could opt to share their phone number or details of their symptoms so health authorities to get in touch and give advice on the best course of action in the event they are found to be at risk. This consent would be given in the app, however, and not be part of the system\u2019s central architecture. In Europe, most countries have chosen short-range Bluetooth \u201chandshakes\u201d between mobile devices as the best way of registering a potential contact, even though it does not provide location data. But they have disagreed about whether to log such contacts on individual devices or on a central server - which would be more directly useful to existing contact tracing teams that work phones and knock on doors to warn those who may be at risk. Sri Lanka reversed plans to end its virus lockdown on Monday and extended it for another week, after a spike in coronavirus infections led to a recall of military personnel on leave. Within hours of announcing on Saturday that the nationwide restrictions, in place since 20 March, would be lifted, the government revoked the order and extended them to 4 May, AFP reports. Army chief Shavendra Silva said that the leave of all military personnel was cancelled, and ordered them to report back to work immediately. The move came as the number of sailors infected with new coronavirus from a single naval base near the capital Colombo jumped to 95, out of a nationwide total of 477 reported cases. The entire base - home to 4,000 sailors and their families - was placed under quarantine after the first cases emerged. Health officials said infections were also increasing elsewhere, including in a densely populated area of the capital Colombo where 81 people tested positive. The island nation has reported a total of seven deaths. Chile is not abandoning plans to issue previously announced \u201crelease certificates\u201d for recovered Covid-19 patients in the near future, despite a World Health Organization warning that it is not clear whether people have immunity after becoming infected. Paula Daza of Chile\u2019s ministry of health said on Sunday that while many uncertainties remain about the global pandemic, evidence points to a reduced risk after a first bout of coronavirus. \u201cOne of the things we know is that a person who has [...] lived through the disease is less likely to become ill again,\u201d Daza said, according to Reuters. She said certifying this status was the \u201cgoal of the Covid-19 card that is being prepared and will soon be delivered\u201d to patients. The World Health Organization on Saturday warned governments against issuing \u201cimmunity passports\u201d to people who have been infected as their accuracy could not be guaranteed. Chile has confirmed 13,331 cases of coronavirus since the country\u2019s first infections were recorded in early March, and 189 deaths. The death toll in France from Covid-19 has risen by 242 to 22,856, the health ministry said on Sunday, down from 369 new deaths the previous day. The country\u2019s prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, said he would present a national exit strategy to parliament on Tuesday, which would then debate and vote on the recommendations. France\u2019s strict mandatory lockdown has been in place since mid-March. Here is a compilation of this week\u2019s most uplifting clips, chronicling life in this strange new world we are all in now, courtesy of the Guardian video team. The US states Colorado, Mississippi, Minnesota, Montana and Tennessee will join other states in the lifting of lockdown restrictions, as economists predict an unemployment rate of 16% or higher for the month of April. Health experts warn that increased human interaction in the reopened state economies could spark a new wave of infections with the virus that has already killed more than 54,300 Americans, Reuters reports. The states are preparing to go back to business without the testing and contact-tracing infrastructure health experts say is needed to prevent a resurgence of infections. Georgia, Oklahoma, Alaska and South Carolina have already taken steps to restart their economies following a month of government-ordered lockdowns. A record 26.5 million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits since mid-March. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicted on Friday that the economy would contract at nearly a 40% annual rate in the second quarter. Turkey\u2019s coronavirus death toll has risen by 99 to 2,805, as 2,357 new infections are confirmed, Reuters reports. President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan has imposed a four-day lockdown between 23 April and 27 April in 31 provinces to stem the spread of the virus. Katharina Willinger, Turkey correspondent for the German TV channel ARD, just tweeted this video showing the deserted streets of Istanbul. The daily Covid-19 death toll in New York State is markedly lower on Sunday than it was on Saturday, with officials having recorded a daily increase of 367 fatalities, compared to 437 a day earlier. Governor Andrew Cuomo is holding a live press conference, amid intensifying calls for a lifting of the lockdown, which is in place until 15 May. He says some regions in the state might qualify to open sooner, \u201cwith certain precautions\u201d, such as upstate New York, but emphasises that this won\u2019t be possible everywhere in the immediate future. Asked about schools, Cuomo says it might be possible that \u201csummer schools\u201d might operate to make up for lost tuition. Deaths from coronavirus in Italy rose by 260 on Sunday, 155 less than on Saturday, and the lowest day-to-to increase since 14 March. The death toll now stands at 26,644, while the number of people who have recovered has risen to 64,928. However, the number of people currently infected with the virus rose by 256 to 106,103 after falling for six days in a row. Italy has recorded 197,675 coronavirus cases to date, including the victims and survivors. Hello, I\u2019m taking over from my colleague Josh Halliday. Please feel free to get in touch with interesting updates, either via email or via Twitter. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest developments around the world on Sunday 26 April: More than 200,000 people have lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic. The number of confirmed deaths in the coronavirus pandemic increased to 203,670 on Sunday, according to Johns Hopkins University, with 2,920,660 confirmed cases. French PM to present strategy for emerging from lockdown. The prime minister of France, Edouard Philippe, will on Tuesday present a national strategy for emerging from the coronavirus lockdown to the national assembly, his office told AFP. Spain\u2019s daily death toll dropped below 300 for the first time in weeks as it partially relaxed the lockdown. On Sunday, children under 14 were allowed out to exercise for the first time since mid-March, and the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has announced that adults could also be allowed to exercise outside from next weekend if efforts to contain the spread of the virus continue to pay off. The UK reported its lowest daily rise in the death toll since the end of March. The number of deaths in UK hospitals from the coronavirus has risen to 20,732 \u2013 an increase of 413 in the last 24 hours World Health Organisation clarifies statement about immunity following concern among scientists. The global health body was criticised for saying there was \u201ccurrently no evidence\u201d that people who recover from Covid-19 will have some immunity from reinfection. Scientists said this was clumsily-worded and that there was in fact some evidence of immunity among those who have recovered. India\u2019s PM urges citizens to abide by the lockdown amid \u201cwar\u201d on the coronavirus as new cases continue to rise. Narendra Modi gave a radio address to urge its 1.3 billion citizens to strictly comply with the nationwide lockdown as the number of confirmed cases increased steadily despite the month-long curfew. He said the country was in the midst of a \u201cwar\u201d and said Indians must maintain the \u201cpeople-driven\u201d fight and not be misled into believing the spread of the virus has been brought fully under control. Beijing cracks down on \u2018uncivilised\u2019 behaviour. Beijing\u2019s city government has banned \u201cuncivilised\u201d behaviour, such as not covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, in a new set of regulations to improve public hygiene and combat the coronavirus. Daily death toll in Iran falls to lowest level in weeks. Officials in Iran, the worst-hit country in the Middle East, said there were 60 deaths from the coronavirus in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 5,710 \u2013 but down from an average of about 90 over the past 10 days, WHO warns against \u2018immunity passports\u2019. The World Health Organization has warned against \u201cimmunity passports\u201d for recovered patients, seen as a possible tool for countries preparing to reopen their economies. White House considers replacing health and human services chief. Reports have emerged that Donald Trump\u2019s administration is considering replacing its secretary of health and human services, Alex Azar, because of early missteps in the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Kim Jong-un\u2019s train possibly spotted in resort. As rumours about the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un continue to circulate, including reports that he is sheltering from Covid-19, a US-based monitoring group released satellite images of what may have been his train parked at an exclusive resort town in the country\u2019s east. France, Italy and Spain are preparing to loosen coronavirus restrictions, with other countries watching closely to see how some of the first and hardest-hit countries in Europe might safely emerge from their crippling lockdowns. Read the full report by my colleagues in Madrid and Johannesburg here. They write: Decisions on how and when to reopen will be vital to how people and businesses can cope with the pandemic, balancing the need for economies to restart with the risks of new outbreaks and further shutdowns. In Italy, which was the first European country to impose a lockdown in March, and where there have so far been close to 200,000 infections and at least 26,384 deaths, Giuseppe Conte said manufacturing could restart as soon as 4 May. The Italian prime minister said schools, however, would not reopen until September. Measures would be announced early this week, he told Italian daily La Repubblica. Tight lockdowns have been seen as a blunt but effective tool to halt infections until a vaccine is developed. The death toll in Canada has risen to 2,350 following a further 139 fatalities reported in the past 24 hours, the country\u2019s public health agency has said. It is the lowest day-on-day rise in the past week. The figure for those diagnosed with the coronavirus had climbed to 45,791, according to a statement. The number of deaths in UK hospitals from the coronavirus has risen to 20,732 \u2013 an increase of 413 in the last 24 hours. This is the lowest daily rise since the end of March. In a televised briefing, Stephen Powis, the medical director of NHS England, said the death toll was falling \u201cabsolutely because we as a British public have paid attention to the social distancing guidance\u201d. A woman who was the first known Covid-19 fatality in the US died from a heart attack caused by the coronavirus infection, according to an autopsy report obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle. The newspaper reports on the case of Patricia Dowd, 57, who it says had reported flu-like symptoms in the days before her death on 6 February. An autopsy, performed by medical examiner Susan Parson, \u201cfound Covid-19 viral infection in her heart, trachea, lungs and intestines\u201d. The forensic pathologist Judy Melinek, who was asked by the Chronicle to review the autopsy report, was quoted as saying: \u201cThere\u2019s something abnormal about the fact that a perfectly normal heart has burst open \u2026 The heart has ruptured. Normal hearts don\u2019t rupture.\u201d Drena Grayson, an infectious disease expert and viral pandemic doctor, tweeted that there was \u201cnow ample evidence\u201d that the virus can infect the heart itself, causing heart inflammation\u201d. Dozens of protesters were arrested in Berlin on Saturday for flouting lockdown rules and staging a demonstration against lockdown measures. We have video of the protest below. About 200 people were involved in the protest, which was shut down by German police. Demonstrators said lockdown measures are an infringement of their constitutional rights The French prime minister, Edouard Philippe, will present the national strategy for lifting the country\u2019s lockdown on Tuesday. The pandemic has killed 22,614 people in France since the start of March, with officials on Saturday reporting 369 new deaths in the previous 24 hours. The French government plan to relax certain restrictions from 11 May, giving priority to reopening schools, companies returning to work, getting public transport back to normal, the supply of masks and sanitiser, testing policy and support for the elderly. Malta is the latest European country to announce the lifting of some anti-coronavirus measures, after recording no new cases of the disease in the past 24 hours for the first time since the crisis began. On Sunday, the health minister Chris Fearne told a news conference that \u201cdecisions on lifting measures will be taken on the basis of science and numbers\u201d. The island, which has a population of about half a million people, detected its first coronavirus case on 7 March and has since reported almost 450 cases and four deaths. Schools, airports and non-essential shops were closed, while gatherings of more than three people had been banned, although factories, beaches and building sites were allowed to remain open. The World Health Organization has previously praised the island for its thorough testing and contact-tracing network. A woman was allegedly gang-raped in a school in India where she had been quarantined for a night by the police. The incident was said to have happened in the desert state of Rajasthan last week after the woman sought shelter at a police station. She became lost on her way home to her village from work and had walked alone for miles before being housed in a school building for the night by police. Local men are believed to have then raped the victim, who is in her 40s. Parth Sharma, a deputy superintendent in the Sawai Mahopur district, told Reuters: \u201cThree local men who raped the woman inside the school on 23 April have been arrested and sent to jail.\u201d Sharma said the woman had been sent to a local quarantine facility to be tested for Covid-19, but her test results were not yet known. A nationwide lockdown was put in place by prime minister Narendra Modi last month to contain the spread of the virus, prompting thousands of workers who lost their jobs in cities to walk for days to reach their homes in rural India. Many are now in overcrowded quarantine centres as new cases of the virus continue to surge in the country. I\u2019m Amy Walker, taking over from my colleague Josh Halliday for the next hour. Rumours about the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un have been circulating now for days. The latest development came from a US-based monitoring group which released satellite images of what may have been his train parked at an exclusive resort town in the country\u2019s east. On Sunday, the political analyst ProfRobert Kelly, of Pusan University in South Korea, said the official silence from North Korea suggested that \u201cthere\u2019s probably something wrong with him, whether he\u2019s dead or incapacitated or in a coma \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of stuff out there in the rumour mill\u201d. Speaking to Sky News in the UK, Kelly said: \u201cGiven how quiet North Korea and China have been, my guess is that there\u2019s probably something wrong with his health, which wouldn\u2019t necessarily be surprising. He\u2019s morbidly obese, he smokes, he\u2019s had gout in the past. But I think if he was dead, I don\u2019t know if they would come forward to tell us yet. There would be some shuffling behind the scenes to figure out who was in charge. I imagine in the next couple of weeks we will hear something formally about this. Kelly said \u201cthe only final definitive proof\u201d that Kim Jong-un is alive would be if he appeared in public. \u201cNorth Korea is just not the sort of state that people are going to trust if they say he\u2019s alive but we don\u2019t actually get to see him. Of course, if they admit he\u2019s dead \u2013 he almost certainly is because that would be a huge admission by the state,\u201d he added. Staying on the immunity issue for a moment, the World Health Organisation statement caused such alarm because it was open to the interpretation that people who have recovered from the virus were not immune from reinfection. In fact, while the evidence is still being evaluated, most scientists believe quite the opposite. Prof Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said everyone or almost everyone who recovers from Covid-19 \u201cwill have developed immunity otherwise they would not have recovered\u201d. \u201cWhat we do not know is how long that immunity will last. It almost certainly will not last for life,\u201d he said. Prof Babak Javid, the principal investigator at Tsinghua University School of Medicine in Beijing, said the WHO\u2019s statement was \u201cvery confusing\u201d. Given that the majority of people that have had Covid-19 develop neutralising antibody responses, he said, it is \u201creasonable to assume that they will develop at least short-term immunity from re-infection \u2013 the critical questions are how robust that immunity would be, and for how long it would last.\u201d Dr Simon Clarke, an associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, added: At this stage nobody knows for sure whether this is indeed the case or for how long it will protect someone, it could be weeks, months or years and it would be unwise to make predictions that are not based on any evidence. It\u2019s worth remembering that we\u2019ve only known about this disease for about four months, so cannot at this stage have any knowledge about whether immunity lasts beyond this rather limited time frame. The World Health Organization (WHO) has sought to clarify the advice it published on Saturday about so-called \u201cimmunity passports\u201d, which could be issued to people who have recovered from Covid-19 on the assumption that they would be immune to reinfection. The WHO alarmed some in the scientific community when it said, in a briefing note published on Saturday, that \u201cthere is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection\u201d. Experts said the WHO should have said there was \u201ccurrently insufficient evidence\u201d instead of \u201cno evidence\u201d. Late last night, the Geneva-based body walked back its statement, saying: \u201cWe expect that most people who are infected with #COVID19 will develop an antibody response that will provide some level of protection.\u201d See the WHO\u2019s tweets below: Hundreds of textile workers have taken to the streets of Bangladesh\u2019s capital Dhaka to demand wages lost during the coronavirus crisis. Reuters reports that Bangladesh, which is the second-largest apparel producer after China, is set to lose export revenue of about $6bn this fiscal year as the sector has been hit by cancellations from some of the world\u2019s largest brands and retailers, two industry bodies have said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got wages since last two months. We have no food, no money. We are left to starve,\u201d said Mohammad Ujjal, a worker at a garment factory in capital city, Dhaka, who participated in the protest. Garment workers have held smaller protests in recent weeks to demand wages lost during the crisis. Last month Bangladesh\u2019s government announced $588m package aid for crucial exports-oriented sector to pay its workers, but garment manufacturers say funds were not enough to mitigate the crisis. Health officials confirmed five more deaths and reported 418 new cases on Sunday, taking the official total number of positive cases to 5,416, including 145 deaths. We have pictures coming in of children playing out for the first time in six weeks in Spain after the curfew was partially relaxed for under-14s on Sunday. (See update from our correspondent Sam Jones here). The images show children playing in otherwise-deserted cities from Bilbao to Madrid and Seville. It\u2019s not quite a return to life as normal in Spain, where more than 23,000 people have died from Covid-19, but it is a start. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest developments around the world on Sunday 26 April: More than 200,000 people have lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic. The number of confirmed deaths in the coronavirus pandemic increased to 203,332 on Sunday, according to Johns Hopkins University, with 2,908,527 confirmed cases. French PM to present strategy for emerging from lockdown. The prime minister of France, Edouard Philippe, will on Tuesday present a national strategy for emerging from the coronavirus lockdown to the national assembly, his office told AFP. Spain\u2019s daily death toll dropped below 300 for the first time in weeks as it partially relaxed the lockdown. On Sunday, children under 14 were allowed out to exercise for the first time since mid-March, and the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has announced that adults could also be allowed to exercise outside from next weekend if efforts to contain the spread of the virus continue to pay off. India\u2019s PM urges citizens to abide by the lockdown amid \u201cwar\u201d on the coronavirus as new cases continue to rise. Narendra Modi gave a radio address to urge its 1.3 billion citizens to strictly comply with the nationwide lockdown as the number of confirmed cases increased steadily despite the month-long curfew. He said the country was in the midst of a \u201cwar\u201d and said Indians must maintain the \u201cpeople-driven\u201d fight and not be misled into believing the spread of the virus has been brought fully under control. Beijing cracks down on \u2018uncivilised\u2019 behaviour. Beijing\u2019s city government has banned \u201cuncivilised\u201d behaviour, such as not covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, in a new set of regulations to improve public hygiene and combat the coronavirus. Daily death toll in Iran falls to lowest level in weeks. Officials in Iran, the worst-hit country in the Middle East, said there were 60 deaths from the coronavirus in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 5,710 \u2013 but down from an average of about 90 over the past 10 days, WHO warns against \u2018immunity passports\u2019. The World Health Organization has warned against \u201cimmunity passports\u201d for recovered patients, seen as a possible tool for countries preparing to reopen their economies. White House considers replacing health and human services chief. Reports have emerged that Donald Trump\u2019s administration is considering replacing its secretary of health and human services, Alex Azar, because of early missteps in the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Kim Jong-un\u2019s train possibly spotted in resort. As rumours about the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un continue to circulate, including reports that he is sheltering from Covid-19, a US-based monitoring group released satellite images of what may have been his train parked at an exclusive resort town in the country\u2019s east. Australian study finds little transmission between children. A preliminary report, cited by Australia\u2019s chief medical officer as the government advocates the reopening of the country\u2019s schools, says children are unlikely to transmit Covid-19 between each other or to adults. Saudi Arabia partially lifts curfews, reopens some commercial activity. State media in Saudi Arabia are reporting that the curfew will be partially lifted for all regions starting Sunday, but that a 24-hour curfew will be maintained in Mecca, according to Reuters. Some economic and commercial activities, including retail stores, will be reopened during Ramadan, from 29 April to 13 May. UK prime minister to return to work on Monday. Boris Johnson will return to work on Monday and is \u201craring to go\u201d, a Downing Street spokeswoman has confirmed. He returns to face a dilemma over whether to ease the coronavirus lockdown, as leading scientists warn that the number of new cases remains much too high. The daily Covid-19 death toll in Iran, the worst-hit nation in the Middle East, has fallen to its lowest level in weeks, according to an analysis of figures collated by Our World in Data. Iran\u2019s health ministry said on Sunday that there were 60 deaths from the coronavirus in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 5,710. The number of confirmed cases has risen to 90,481, the department said. If correct, the data suggests that the pandemic in Iran is on a consistent downward path. It has reported about 90 almost every day for the past 11 days, so the drop to 60 would be seen as welcome news. The graph below, courtesy of Our World in Data, shows the country\u2019s death toll trajectory. Note: it has reported a couple of anomalies, as shown by the huge drop and spike between 4 and 5 April. Spanish health authorities have begun to outline plans to move towards \u201ca new normality\u201d as the number of overnight coronavirus deaths in the country dropped below 300 for the first time in weeks, writes Sam Jones. On Sunday, children under 14 were allowed out to exercise for the first time since mid-March, and the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has announced that adults could also be allowed to exercise outside from next weekend if efforts to contain the spread of the virus continue to pay off. Speaking on Sunday, Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies, said recent figures showed a \u201cclear descending trend\u201d, adding that the government\u2019s decision to allow some non-essential workers to return to their jobs a fortnight ago had not had any negative impact so far. Sim\u00f3n said that the time had come to talk of a transition \u201cto normality - within the limits of the coronavirus: It won\u2019t be the normality we knew a year ago. It will be a new normality in which, over the coming months, we\u2019ll need to ensure that we can reduce the risks of transmission and new outbreaks enough so that their effects are not as negative as they have been this time. He said that a panel of experts had given the government a set of recommendations for the next steps in the country\u2019s \u201ctransition\u201d. They say the health system must be ready - and have the right resources - to respond to another outbreak, and stress there must be effective monitoring of the disease even as cases fall. They also urge swift and aggressive quarantining and testing protocols, and strict compliance with social distancing rules. \u201cIf all parts of the health system can show that they can meet these criteria, we\u2019ll be in a position - epidemiological considerations permitting - to begin the transition towards new phases of this new normality,\u201d added Sim\u00f3n. Over the past 24 hours, 1,729 new cases have been detected, 3,024 people have been pronounced cured, and 288 people have died - down from 378 on Saturday. Spain has now confirmed a total of 207,634 cases using PCR tests and recorded 23,190 deaths. The growth rate of new cases currently stands at 0.8% - down from 3% in recent weeks and 38% when the state of emergency was declared on 14 March. The number of confirmed Covid-19 cases has reached 1,531 in Afghanistan as the number of transmission continued to surge in Kandahar amid an intensified war across the country, my colleague Akhtar Mohammad Makoli reports. Despite the lockdown in several provinces, streets are still crowded and experts warn that contain spread of Coronavirus may be challenging. The Taliban have rejected pleas from Nato and Afghan president Ashraf Ghani to declare a ceasefire to help contain spread of Coronavirus. In a statement, Nato has asked for an immediate ceasefire in the country saying that it encourages both sides \u201cto demonstrate goodwill by accelerating the release of prisoners\u201d and as a confidence-building measure and to embrace the international community\u2019s call \u201cfor an immediate humanitarian ceasefire\u201d. But the Taliban\u2019s spokesman, Suhail Shaheen, tweeted late on Thursday to reject the offer, citing ongoing disagreements over a potential peace process and a delayed prisoner exchange as reasons to keep fighting. \u201cAsking for ceasefire is not rational and convincing,\u201d wrote Shaheen as he accused the government of putting prisoners\u2019 lives at risk during the outbreak. The militant group have intensified their attacks in recent days. About 100 security forces and 34 civilians were killed in their attacks over the last week. Wahidullah Mayar, a health ministry spokesman, said on Saturday the country is in a \u201cvery sensitive\u201d time and once again called on the Taliban to declare ceasefire. \u201cNo one is secure against the the virus, we are all vulnerable. We need an immediate ceasefires, instead of fighting with ourselves, let\u2019s get united and fight with one enemy,\u201d he said Russia reported 6,361 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Sunday, pushing its national tally to 80,949, Reuters reports. Sixty-six people succumbed to the virus in the past day, bringing the death toll to 747, Russia\u2019s official crisis response centre said. Sweden\u2019s deputy prime minister, Isabella L\u00f6vin, just gave a very interesting interview to the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show in the UK. She was asked whether Sweden\u2019s less-restrictive social distancing measures \u2013 bars, borders and restaurants remain open, as do schools for the under-16s \u2013 had led to a higher death toll in the country. Sweden\u2019s death rate from Covid-19 is nearly 200 per million people, compared with 31 in neighbouring Finland and 36 in Norway. L\u00f6vin admitted Sweden had a \u201cbig problem\u201d with its strategy to protect the elderly and that this was \u201csomething we\u2019re learning from\u201d. She said: We have really a big problem with our main strategy that was to protect the elderly and the most vulnerable. We had Covid-19 contagion in the elderly homes and this is something we\u2019re learning from . This is mainly in the Stockholm area. but we see that we are always prepared to take new measures but we have confined the gathering of people to a maximum of 50 people. There\u2019s also a ban on visiting the elderly at elderly care homes. but it\u2019s a mixture of legally bound measures and very strong recommendations. L\u00f6vin said there was a fear that imposing strict restrictions might backfire, creating lockdown fatigue and causing people to flout measures that \u201cwe need to be in place for a very long time \u2013 until we have a vaccine or until we know how this pandemic is going to end\u201d. She said it was \u201ccrucial\u201d and \u201cabsolutely fundamental\u201d that governments be \u201cas transparent as possible\u201d with their citizens and \u201ctreat people like adults: \u201cWith that comes responsibility and individual responsibility that you need to listen to what the experts are saying.\u201d Asked whether Sweden was pursuing a \u201cherd immunity\u201d strategy \u2013 allowing a population to build immunity to the virus by letting it spread \u2013 L\u00f6vin said that was not the aim: That is not the strategy \u2026 The strategy is to try to confine the spread of the virus and limit the deaths and the disease in the population. The experts tells us they don\u2019t even know 100% when immunity is reached in one individual person. The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, has taken to the airwaves today to urge its 1.3 billion citizens to strictly comply with the nationwide lockdown as the number of confirmed cases increased steadily despite the month-long curfew. In a radio address, Modi said the country was in the midst of a \u201cwar\u201d and said Indians must maintain the \u201cpeople-driven\u201d fight and not be misled into believing the spread of the virus has been brought fully under control. He was quoted by Reuters: I will urge you that we should not be trapped into over-confidence and nurse the belief that in our city, in our village, in our streets, in our office, coronavirus has not reached and that is why it will not reach. There are concerns that the spread of the virus has been hastened by India\u2019s high population density, poor sanitation infrastructure, and high rates of internal migration. As the graph by World in Data shows, the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in India has risen steeply over the past month \u2013 from 562 when the lockdown was announced on 25 March, to 26,496 today. The pandemic has claimed 824 deaths in the country. Hello. This is Josh Halliday picking up our live global coverage of the coronavirus outbreak from Manchester, UK. I\u2019ve looked under the hood and can see we have readers from all over the world with us right now - from the UK to Vietnam, Austria, Italy, India, New Zealand and beyond. Welcome! Please do get in touch about the situation where you are, and send any news tips or ideas for articles to met at: Twitter: @JoshHalliday Email: josh.halliday@theguardian.com \u2018We\u2019d go bust in months\u2019: British restaurants at a loss over social distancing dilemma The UK\u2019s \u00a372bn hospitality sector, which employs 3.2 million people, has been struggling with what a socially distanced restaurant business might look like. A number of London branches of sandwich chain Pret a Manger have reopened in the past couple of weeks, with Perspex screens separating staff and customers, and only 15% of the usual menu, so there could be fewer people in the kitchen. However, it is takeaway-only. Traditional waiter-service restaurants say they are finding it hard to see how they could function at all with social distancing. Restaurateur Russell Norman spent a day measuring the floor space in one branch of his normally bustling small-plates Polpo group. \u201cKeeping everyone two metres apart would require taking out two-thirds of the seats and that simply wouldn\u2019t be economically viable,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for a party of four, you would need a table which was 2.5 metres square, which is huge. It would also leave the restaurant with nothing approaching atmosphere.\u201d Italy will start reopening its manufacturing industry on 4 May as part of plans to ease its coronavirus lockdown and schools will reopen in September, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said in a newspaper interview on Sunday picked up by Reuters. \u201cWe are working in these hours to allow the reopening of a good part of businesses from manufacturing to construction for 4 May,\u201d Conte told Italian daily La Repubblica. He said the measures would be presented by the beginning of next week at the latest. Italy was the first European country to be hard-hit by the novel coronavirus, and the first to impose a lockdown in March. Its path to reopening its economy is being closely watched around the world as other countries where severe outbreaks arrived in the following week contemplate similar moves. Conte said companies would have to introduce strict health safety measures before being allowed to open their gates. But he said some businesses considered \u201cstrategic\u201d, including activity that was mainly export-oriented, could reopen next week providing they got the go-ahead from local prefects. Conte said schools would reopen in September but added studies showed the risk of contagion was very high. Teaching remotely was working well, he said. The public\u2019s confidence in the government\u2019s ability to handle the coronavirus crisis has fallen sharply in the past fortnight, with less than half of voters now having faith in decisions made by ministers, according to the latest Opinium poll for the Observer. A particularly low proportion of people (15%) believe the government is handling the key issue of testing well (down from 22% two weeks ago). Some 57% disapprove of the way testing has been handled, up from 48% on 7 April. How coronavirus helped TikTok find its voice Across the country, in teenage bedrooms and house shares, Brits stuck at home by the coronavirus lockdown are firing up TikTok, propping their phones against walls and hitting record. Founded in 2012 by Chinese entrepreneur Zhang Yiming, TikTok is one of the most popular video-sharing apps in the world, downloaded more than 2bn times globally. Users create 15-second clips set to music or soundbites, which they can overlay with digital special effects. Before the coronavirus pandemic, TikTok was predominantly favoured by British teenagers, who posted prank videos or the latest trending dance routine on it. But since the lockdown, TikTok has become a seething leviathan of user-generated content, chewing down our boredom, our fatigue and our fear and spitting them back at us in 15-second chunks, to be digested ad infinitum. African nations are banking on aggressive screening and testing strategies as their best \u2013 and possibly only \u2013 defence against the Covid-19 virus. After a slow start, a sudden rise of more than 40% in the number of Covid-19 cases on the continent in the last 10 days \u2013 to 28,000 \u2013 and a similar increase in the number of deaths \u2013 to 1,300 \u2013 has worried specialists. The World Health Organization has warned of 10m cases on the continent within three to six months, though experts say that the death toll could be lower if authorities are able to move swiftly to contain outbreaks of the disease. \u201cWe are at the beginning in Africa,\u201d Dr Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO\u2019s health emergencies programme, said last week. Though some of the worst effects of infection may be mitigated by the relative youth of many people on the continent, others may be made more vulnerable by malnutrition or existing conditions, such as HIV. Under-resourced health systems are unlikely to cope with a significant surge of those infected by the disease. Provision of intensive care facilities on the continent is grossly inadequate. Many countries with populations numbering tens of millions have only a handful of ventilators. So far it has been difficult to fully grasp the extent of the spread of the disease in Africa, as testing has been patchy. That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. Thanks for following along. I\u2019m off to \u2026 precisely nowhere: More than 200,000 people have lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic. The number of confirmed deaths in the coronavirus pandemic increased to 202,846 on Saturday, according to Johns Hopkins University, with 2,896,746 confirmed cases.

White House considers replacing health and human services chief. Reports have emerged that Donald Trump\u2019s administration is considering replacing its secretary of health and human services, Alex Azar, because of early missteps in the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Cases grow by nearly 1,000 in Mexico. Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Saturday reported 970 new cases of coronavirus infection and 84 additional fatalities, bringing the total in the country to 13,842 cases and 1,305 deaths. The government has said the real number of infected people is likely considerably higher than the confirmed cases. Kim Jong-un\u2019s train possibly spotted in resort. As rumours about the health of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un continue to circulate, including reports that he is sheltering from Covid-19, a US-based monitoring group released satellite images of what may have been his train parked at an exclusive resort town in the country\u2019s east.

He returns to face a dilemma over whether to ease the coronavirus lockdown, as leading scientists warn that the number of new cases remains much too high. Cut off by telecoms company, pensioner missed call as partner died of Covid-19 A pensioner missed the chance to say goodbye to her partner who was dying from the coronavirus when blunders by her telecoms provider resulted in her phone line being cut off. The 79-year-old woman was left without a landline for three weeks after switching to Now TV, part of the Sky Group. As her family pleaded with the company to reconnect her, her partner contracted coronavirus. He died in hospital four days later, after trying in vain to make a final call. The news of his death was broken by a relative, because the hospital could not get through on her cancelled number. Telecoms companies are struggling with a depleted workforce and unprecedented demand as customers rely on phones and broadband during lockdown. New figures released by O2 show phone calls have increased by 25% in the past month. I think that last post calls for a few pictures of mask-wearers from around the world, don\u2019t you? Coronavirus face masks: why covering up is becoming the new normal The Guardian\u2019s Emma Graham-Harrison and Philip Oltermann report from Berlin, with Sam Jones in Madrid: When coronavirus emerged in China, people across much of the region were quick to start wearing some form of face mask when they went out in public. Memories of the Sars epidemic were still strong, and there is a cultural tradition of wearing masks to protect oneself and others. In the west, however, even though masks sold out as fast as hand-sanitiser in chemists and online as people stockpiled supplies, initially there was widespread reluctance to wearing face coverings in public. The divide was so strong that, as racism against people of east Asian heritage rose sharply, some stopped wearing masks because face protection had become a focus for abuse, discrimination and stigma. A few weeks later, masks and improvised substitutes are rapidly becoming the new normal in cities from New York to Berlin, and those who go out without their nose and mouth covered risk censure or stronger penalties.

If UK ministers fail to reveal 2016 flu study they \u2018will face court\u2019 The government faces being taken to court if it refuses to disclose the findings of an exercise confirming the UK could not cope with a flu pandemic. Dr Moosa Qureshi, an NHS doctor, is demanding the government publish its report into Exercise Cygnus, a three-day simulation involving government and public health bodies conducted in 2016. Qureshi, who is a campaigner with the group 54000doctors.org, represented by Leigh Day solicitors, has sent a pre-action protocol letter to the secretary of state for health requesting a response by 4pm . If the government fails to disclose the findings of Exercise Cygnus without adequate reason, Qureshi\u2019s lawyers will seek an urgent judicial review challenging the decision and seeking publication. A crowdfunding page to support the challenge was due to go live on Saturday night. The row threatens to become a major embarrassment for the government. The Telegraph has reported that Cygnus\u2019s findings were deemed \u201ctoo terrifying\u201d to be made public. Beijing has banned \u201cuncivilised\u201d behaviour such as not covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, the city government said Sunday, in a new set of regulations to improve public hygiene amid the coronavirus outbreak, AFP reports. The laws aim to promote \u201ccivilised behaviour\u201d and relate to combating the pandemic which has infected more than 82,000 in China alone. Rule-breakers will be slapped with fines for offences including not wearing a mask in public when ill, the municipal government said on its website. The laws require public places to set up one metre distance markers. Citizens must \u201cdress neatly\u201d in public and not go shirtless \u2013 an apparent reference to the so-called \u201cBeijing bikini\u201d practice where men roll T-shirts up to expose their stomachs in hot weather. Beijing already discourages a range of \u201cuncivilised\u201d behaviours including public spitting, littering, walking dogs unleashed, throwing things from high buildings, public defecation and smoking in places where it is prohibited. The laws also encourage police to report serious offences, which may affect a person\u2019s social credit score - a fledgling system which aims to assess individual actions across society - though it did not provide more specifics. French PM to set out road to normality, restrictions ease in Australia The French prime minister, Edouard Philippe, will present the national strategy for emerging from the coronavirus lockdown to the French parliament on Tuesday, his office has announced. The pandemic has killed 22,614 people in France since the start of March, with officials on Saturday reporting 369 new deaths in the previous 24 hours. The global death toll from the novel coronavirus pandemic passed 200,000 on Sunday. France\u2019s move comes as the World Health Organization has warned against \u201cimmunity passports\u201d for recovered patients, seen as a possible tool for countries preparing to reopen their economies. \u201cThere is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from \u001dCovid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection,\u201d said a WHO statement. In Australia, some state governments have announced relaxation of social distancing. Western Australia said that from Monday, 10 people would be allowed to gather indoors, and resume \u201cnon-contact recreational activities\u201d such as private picnics, fishing, boating, hiking and camping. The Queensland government said family picnics, non-essential shopping and trips of up to 50km from home would be allowed from next Saturday. Singapore is rapidly building bed space for coronavirus patients in cavernous exhibition halls and other temporary facilities as it faces a surge in cases, mainly among its large community of low-paid migrant workers. The tiny city-state of 5.7 million people has over 12,000 confirmed infections of the virus that causes CovidD-19, one of the highest counts in Asia, Reuters reports. Despite the high total of cases, Singapore has reported 12 deaths and 24 people are in intensive care. At the new Changi isolation centre, each room has blood-pressure monitors and other medical equipment for patients to conduct their own health checks three times daily, while remote-controlled robots provide meals and teleconferencing services to reduce contact. Authorities are also trialling a four-legged robot dog built by Boston Dynamics at the facility, which they said could be used to deliver medicines to patients or take their temperature. Thailand on Sunday reported 15 new coronavirus cases and no new deaths, bringing the total number of cases since its outbreak in January to 2,922 cases and 51 deaths. Of the new cases, four were linked to previous cases, another four had no known links, while five new patients are arrivals from overseas who have been under state quarantine. Two other new cases were reported from the southern province of Yala, where the authorities are aggressively testing the population because of high infection rates there, said Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman for the government\u2019s Centre for Covid-19 Situation Administration. Since the outbreak in Thailand, 2,594 patients have recovered and gone home.

Four new classes are emerging. The Remotes: These are professional, managerial, and technical workers \u2013 an estimated 35% of the workforce \u2013 who are putting in long hours at their laptops, Zooming into conferences, scanning electronic documents, and collecting about the same pay as before the crisis. The Essentials: They\u2019re about 30% of workers, including nurses, homecare and childcare workers, farm workers, food processors, truck drivers, warehouse and transit workers, drugstore employees, sanitation workers, police officers, firefighters, and the military. The Unpaid: They\u2019re an even larger group than the unemployed \u2013 whose ranks could soon reach 25%, the same as in the Great Depression. Some of the unpaid are furloughed or have used up their paid leave. So far in this crisis, 43% of adults report they or someone in their household has lost jobs or pay, according to the Pew Research Center. The Forgotten: This group includes everyone for whom social distancing is nearly impossible because they\u2019re packed tightly into places most Americans don\u2019t see: prisons, jails for undocumented immigrants, camps for migrant farmworkers, Native American reservations, homeless shelters, and nursing homes. The global death toll has surpassed 200,000. The number of confirmed deaths in the coronavirus pandemic increased to 202,846 on Saturday, according to Johns Hopkins University. There are 2,896,746 confirmed cases. French PM to present the national strategy for emerging from lockdown on Tuesday.

Kim Jong-un\u2019s train possibly spotted at North Korean resort. A special train possibly belonging to the North Korean ruler, Kim Jong-un, has been spotted at a resort town, according to satellite images reviewed by a Washington-based North Korea monitoring project, amid conflicting reports about Kim\u2019s health and whereabouts, Reuters reports. White House considering replacing Health and Human Services chief. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is considering replacing its secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, because of early missteps in the handling of the coronavirus pandemic, the Wall Street Journal and Politico reported. A White House spokesperson denied the claim. Saudi Arabia partially lifts curfews, reopens some commercial activity. State media in Saudi Arabia are reporting that the curfew will be partially lifted for all regions starting Sunday, but that a 24-hour curfew will be maintained in Mecca. Some economic and commercial activities, including retail stores, will reopen during Ramadan, from 29 April to 13 May. Boris Johnson will return to work on Monday and is \u201craring to go\u201d, a Downing street spokeswoman has confirmed. He returns facing a dilemma over whether to ease the coronavirus lockdown, as leading scientists warn that the number of new cases remains much too high. German police arrested dozens of protesters in Berlin on Saturday, for flouting the coronavirus lockdown measures they were demonstrating against. About 1,000 people turned out for the rally, which has become a weekly event. It attracted mainly far-left activists but rightwing supporters and members of other fringe groups also participated. Spain could lift more lockdown restrictions and allow adults out to exercise from 2 May if efforts to contain the spread of the virus continue to pay off, the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has said. Iraq\u2019s nationwide lockdown since mid-March has led to a spike in domestic violence, AFP reports. The head of Iraq\u2019s community police, Brigadier General Ghalib Atiyah, told AFP that its log of domestic violence cases has increased by an average of 30% since the curfew came into force, with some areas seeing as high as a 50% spike. In a single week, the United Nations in Iraq (UNAMI) reported: \u201cThe rape of a woman with special needs, spousal abuse, immolation and self-immolation as well as self-inflicted injuries due to spousal abuse, sexual harassment of minors, and suicide due to domestic abuse among other crimes.\u201d Poland\u2019s farmers have already been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, which has deprived them of seasonal workers from Ukraine. Now, an unprecedented drought is making things even worse. \u201cEveryone\u2019s panicking. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to us,\u201d Adrianna Bukowska-Lazarska, whose farm usually produces more than 300 tonnes of strawberries per year near the central village of Czerwinsk nad Wisla, told AFP. Agriculture Minister Jan Krzysztof Ardanowski has warned that the drought could hurt food production, implying that while there is no risk of a shortage, prices may very well go up. President Andrzej Duda has also expressed concern, calling on residents on Wednesday to be reasonable with their water use. The drought has also aggravated huge fires ravaging Poland\u2019s largest nature reserve, the Biebrza National Park in the country\u2019s northeast. Children unlikely to transmit coronavirus, says study cited in Australian PM\u2019s push to reopen schools A new report, cited by Australia\u2019s chief medical officer as the federal government advocates the reopening of schools, says children are unlikely to transmit Covid-19 between each other or to adults. The study by NSW Health\u2019s Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance (NCIRS), released on Sunday, examined transmission of the virus in NSW schools and childcare centres between March and mid-April. Examining the spread 18 of coronavirus cases (nine students and nine staff) from 15 schools, the report\u2019s preliminary findings were that only one primary school student and one high school student \u201cmay have contracted Covid-19 from the initial cases at their schools\u201d. Cuba dispatched more than 216 healthcare workers to South Africa on Saturday, the latest of more than 20 medical brigades it has sent worldwide to combat the coronavirus pandemic, in what some call socialist solidarity and others medical diplomacy. Reuters reports that Cuba has sent around 1,200 healthcare workers largely to vulnerable African and Caribbean nations but also to rich European countries such as Italy that have been particularly hard hit by the novel coronavirus. The US administration has urged nations not to accept Cuba\u2019s medical missions on charges it exploits its workers, which Havana denies. But the calls have largely gone unheeded as overwhelmed healthcare systems have welcomed the help. Cuba, which has confirmed ,1337 cases of the virus at home and 51 deaths, has one of the world\u2019s highest number of doctors per capita and is renowned for its focus on prevention, community-oriented primary health care and preparedness to fight epidemics. \u201cThe advantage of Cuba is that they are a community health model, one that we would like to use,\u201d South African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize told a news briefing earlier this month. South Africa has recorded 4,361 cases, including 86 deaths, with 161,004 people tested for the virus as of Saturday. Health Canada has joined those cautioning against the use of malaria drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to prevent or treat Covid-19. The drugs have been advocated as a cure for the disease by Donald Trump, among others, but the Canadian health authority warned on Saturday that they may cause serious side effects. It advised use of the two drugs only if prescribed by a doctor. The US Food and Drug Administration also cautioned against the use of malaria drugs in Covid-19 patients on Friday. China\u2019s smog-prone northern province of Hebei, close to Beijing, met its air quality targets by a big margin over the winter after concerted efforts to tackle emissions, a local official said on Sunday, without mentioning coronavirus-related factory shutdowns, Reuters reports. Average PM2.5 concentrations over the October-March period dropped 15% from a year earlier to 61 micrograms per cubic metre, while sulphur dioxide also fell by a third, said He Litao, vice-head of the provincial environmental bureau. Most experts have attributed the significant decline in air pollution throughout China in the first quarter to the coronavirus outbreak and tough containment measures, which saw cities and entire provinces locked down and sharply reduced traffic and industrial activity throughout the country. With millions staying at home, concentrations of lung-damaging PM2.5 particles fell by nearly 15% in more than 300 Chinese cities in the first three months of 2020. Shanghai saw emissions fall by nearly 20% in the first quarter, while in Wuhan, where the pandemic originated, monthly averages dropped more than a third compared to last year. As the number of people who have lost their lives in this pandemic reaches 202,846, here are the ten worst-affected countries in terms of number of confirmed cases, according to Johns Hopkins University data: US: 938,154 Spain: 223,759 Italy: 195,351 France: 161,644 Germany: 156,513 United Kingdom: 149,569 Turkey: 107,773 Iran: 89,328 China: 83,909 Russia: 74,588 French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe will on Tuesday present the national strategy for emerging from the coronavirus lockdown, his office told AFP. His announcement at the National Assembly will be followed by a debate and a vote. An app for tracing contacts of confirmed cases is also due to be unveiled Tuesday. Seventeen priorities have been identified for gradually bringing the country out of lockdown from 11 May. These include reopening schools, companies returning to work, getting public transport back to normal, the supply of masks and sanitiser, testing policy and support for the elderly. A dozen ministers will on Monday consult with representatives of local authorities to discuss various options. France has been under coronavirus restrictions since March 17 and the government faces a delicate balancing act to revive the economy without triggering a resurgence in the epidemic. Only 39% of the French public have confidence in the government\u2019s ability to deal effectively with the virus, seven points lower than last week, according to an Ifop poll for the Journal du Dimanche. The pandemic has killed 22,614 people in France since the start of March, with 369 new deaths recorded in the previous 24 hours, according to official figures released late Saturday, which saw a significant drop in hospital deaths. Everton have labelled Moise Kean\u2019s actions \u201cunacceptable\u201d after he flouted coronavirus lockdown restrictions, PA media reports. The striker filmed himself partying at home with guests in a breach of social distancing regulations during the coronavirus pandemic. Kean, who joined from Juventus for a reported \u00a324m last summer, is likely to face disciplinary action. Kean is the latest Premier League player to flout the rules after Jack Grealish and Kyle Walker were forced to apologise for breaching the restrictions, while Serge Aurier and Moussa Sissoko said sorry after training together last week. The 20-year-old has failed to impress in his debut season in England, scoring just once in 26 games for Everton. Many Americans flocked to beaches on Saturday as one Florida county expanded access and California experienced a heat wave, even as new coronavirus cases hit a record high in the United States the day before and deaths topped 53,000. Hair salons and other shops in Georgia, Oklahoma and some other states opened for a second day as pockets of the country sought to restart their economies following a month of government-ordered lockdowns. The tentative steps toward restarting life run against the warnings of many public health experts, who say the increased human interaction could spark a new wave of cases. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo repeated his warning that reopening businesses too soon was risky, while Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo pushed back against a protest at the State House in Providence as short-sighted, arguing it could force her to delay her restart date of 8 May at the earliest.

More now on reports that US President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is considering replacing its secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, because of early missteps in the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. A White House spokesman, Judd Deere, denied it and said the HHS under Azar continues to lead on a number of the president\u2019s priorities, Reuters reports. \u201cAny speculation about personnel is irresponsible and a distraction from our whole-of-government response to Covid-19,\u201d Deere said. The Journal, citing six people familiar with the discussions, said frustration with Azar was growing but the administration was reluctant to make big changes while the country was seeking to stop the virus, which has killed more than 53,000 people in the United States. Politico said the short list of names to replace Azar included Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus coordinator; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services chief Seema Verma and deputy HHS Secretary Eric Hargan. Asked for a response, HHS spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley said: \u201cSecretary Azar is busy responding to a global, public health crisis and doesn\u2019t have time for palace intrigue.\u201d Australia\u2019s coronavirus tracing app set to launch today despite lingering privacy concerns A controversial coronavirus tracing app will be released by the Australian government on Sunday, despite lingering privacy concerns. The app, based on source code from Singapore\u2019s Tracetogether software, maintains a log of bluetooth connections a person\u2019s phone makes with the phones of those they have come into contact with, making it easier for health authorities to trace potential Covid-19 carriers in the case of a positive diagnosis. For the app to be successful, just under half the population would need to carry it on their phones. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, after saying it was not his \u201cpreferred option\u201d, confirmed downloading the app would not be mandatory, and instead has likened it to a civic duty, such as buying war bonds in the second world war. He also flagged it as a necessary step to relaxing restrictions. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is considering replacing its secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, because of early missteps in the handling of the coronavirus pandemic, the Wall Street Journal and Politico reported on Saturday. The Journal, which cited six people familiar with the discussions, said frustration with Azar was growing but the administration was reluctant to make big changes while the country was seeking to stop the virus, which has killed more than 53,000 people in the United States. A White House spokesman told the newspaper that there was no plan to replace Azar and called talk of replacing him \u201cspeculation and a distraction.\u201d Politico said the short list of names to replace Azar included Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus coordinator; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services chief Seema Verma and deputy HHS Secretary Eric Hargan. China reported 11 new coronavirus cases on 25 April, compared to 12 on the previous day, with no fatalities, according to official data published on Sunday. Of the total, there were six cases of local transmission, including five in the northeastern border province of Heilongjiang, and one in southeast Guangdong province, which neighbours Hong Kong. The remaining five cases were imported, down from 11 on the previous day, National Health Commission data showed. The commission also reported 30 new asymptomatic cases, up slightly from 29 on the previous day. China has now reported a total of 82,827 confirmed infections, with 4,632 deaths. The G20, a group of rich and emerging economies, on Sunday launched an international initiative to accelerate access to health tools needed to fight the new coronavirus, Reuters reports. The finance minister of Saudi Arabia, the current G20 chair, said the group is still working to bridge an estimated $8 billion funding gap to combat the pandemic. \u201cThe G20 will continue reinforcing global cooperation on all fronts, and most importantly, on closing the immediate health financing gap,\u201d the minister, Mohammed al-Jadaan, said in a statement launching the \u201cAccess to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator\u201d initiative. He added that \u201cthe international community is still facing extraordinary uncertainty about the depth and duration of this health crisis\u201d, the statement said. Saudi Arabia earlier this month pledged $500 million to support global efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic. In the statement, it repeated its call on all countries, non-governmental organizations, philanthropists and the private sector to help close the financing gap. State media in Saudi Arabia are reporting that the curfew will be partially lifted for all regions starting Sunday, but that a 24-hour curfew will be maintained in Mecca, according to Reuters. Some economic and commercial activities, including retail stores, will be reopened during Ramadan, from 29 April to 13 May. Confirmed cases of coronavirus infection in Panama reached 5,538 on Saturday, a rise of 200 from the previous day, while related deaths increased by five to 159, the health ministry said. Director of epidemiology Lourdes Moreno presented the Central American country\u2019s latest figures at a news conference. The US Treasury Department said on Saturday it has released US$9.5bn in additional funds from the Payroll Support Program to US air carriers, bringing to $12.4bn the total provided to the airline sector hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, Reuters reports. In total, the government has disbursed grant funds to 10 major airlines and 83 smaller carriers. Congress approved $25 billion in grants for payroll assistance for passenger airlines. Treasury required major airlines receiving more than $100 million in assistance to repay 30% in low-interest loans over 10 years and issue warrants equal to 10% of the loan amount. Airlines may still need more money as US air travel demand has fallen by 95% and shows no sign of improving. On Friday, President Donald Trump said the U.S. government could pre-buy airplane tickets at a steep discount of 50% or more for travel for the next four or five years. \u201cYou infuse them with some cash. And in the meantime, we\u2019re flying the people of our country for ... a fraction of the cost,\u201d he said. Airlines for America, a trade group representing major U.S. airlines, declined to comment. Mexico\u2019s health ministry on Saturday reported 970 new cases of coronavirus infection and 84 additional fatalities, bringing the total in the country to 13,842 cases and 1,305 deaths. The government has said the real number of infected people is likely considerably higher than the confirmed cases. A special train possibly belonging to the North Korean ruler, Kim Jong-un, has been spotted at a resort town, according to satellite images reviewed by a Washington-based North Korea monitoring project, amid conflicting reports about Kim\u2019s health and whereabouts, Reuters reports. The monitoring project, 38 North, said in its report on Saturday that the train was parked at the \u201cleadership station\u201d in Wonsan on 21 April and 23 April. The station is reserved for the use of the Kim family, it said. Though the group said it was probably Kim\u2019s train, Reuters has not been able to confirm that independently, or whether he was in Wonsan. \u201cThe train\u2019s presence does not prove the whereabouts of the North Korean leader or indicate anything about his health but it does lend weight to reports that Kim is staying at an elite area on the country\u2019s eastern coast,\u201d the report said. Speculation about Kim\u2019s health first arose due to his absence from the anniversary of the birthday of North Korea\u2019s founding father and Kim\u2019s grandfather, Kim Il-sung, on 15 April. North Korea\u2019s state media last reported on Kim\u2019s whereabouts when he presided over a meeting on 11 April. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live coverage of coronavirus news from around the world with me, Helen Sullivan. You can get in touch directly on Twitter @helenrsullivan with news, tips, questions and comments. As the number of people who have lost their lives in this pandemic passes 200,000, the US president, Donald Trump, has declared his own White House press briefings \u201cnot worth the effort\u201d after comments he made about using disinfectant to cure coronavirus were met with shock and ridicule. The number of people who have died in the US currently stands at 53,449 according to Johns Hopkins University data. Here are the developments from the last few hours: The global death toll has passed 200,000. The number of confirmed deaths in the coronavirus pandemic increased to 202,368 on Saturday, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally. The figures for infections are likely to underestimate the true scale of losses of life due to suspected under-reporting and differing testing regimes. Boris Johnson will return to work on Monday and is \u201craring to go\u201d, a Downing street spokeswoman has confirmed. The prime minister has been recovering in his country residence after spending three nights in intensive care in April. He returns to face a dilemma over whether to ease the coronavirus lockdown, as leading scientists warn that the number of new cases remains much too high. German police arrested dozens of protesters in Berlin on Saturday for flouting the coronavirus lockdown measures they were demonstrating against. About 1,000 people turned out for the rally, which has become a weekly event in the German capital. Saturday\u2019s protest attracted mainly far-left activists but there were also rightwing supporters and members of other fringe groups. Paraguayan authorities have laid out details of a plan to begin lifting the country\u2019s total quarantine. The health minister Julio Mazzoleni announced at press conference on Friday that a new \u201cintelligent quarantine\u201d will begin on 4 May. It will gradually reintroduce public freedoms and economic activities through a four-stage plan set to run until early July. The UK\u2019s biggest steel producer needs about \u00a3500m in government support to see it through the coronavirus crisis, according to the Welsh MP Stephen Kinnock. Tata Steel has reportedly approached the UK and Welsh governments for a bailout after its big European customers halted production. The company employs 8,385 people across the UK including more than 4,000 workers at the Port Talbot steelworks in south Wales. Spain could lift more lockdown restrictions and allow adults out to exercise from 2 May if efforts to contain the spread of the virus continue to pay off, the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has said.",
