Wuhan Tianhe international airport said that a temperature checkpoint would be installed at the entrance of its main terminal and all passengers would be checked.

Thailand has been monitoring incoming passengers at four airports receiving daily flights from Wuhan, including Bangkok, Phuket, Don Mueang and Chiang Mai, since 3 January.

In Australia, the New South Wales and Victorian governments both issued alerts to health professionals about the virus, urging doctors to \u201cconsider novel coronavirus infection in patients with fever and respiratory symptoms and travel to Wuhan City, China in the 14 days before illness onset\u201d. The country\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said there was \u201cno current need for any travel advice in Australia\u201d. \u201cIt is important to note that the new coronavirus was acquired in one seafood market in Wuhan, China, which has been closed, with no new cases reported in the last week,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThere is no clear evidence of human to human transmission at this time.\u201d Murphy added that Australia was following WHO recommendations and had mechanisms in place to screen and respond to unwell travellers at airports and other points of entry to the country. The UK foreign office\u2019s website travel advice on China does not mention coronavirus. Travel is unusually heavy right now as people take trips to and from China to celebrate the Lunar New Year. The CDC said the airport screenings are part of an effort to better detect and prevent the virus from the same family of bugs that caused an international outbreaks of Sars and Mers that began in 2002 and 2012. The WHO says entry screening \u201coffers little benefit, while requiring considerable resources\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Australia\u2019s top health official says there is \u201cno current need\u201d to enhance existing airport screening measures to target an unknown Sars-like virus that has infected nearly 50 people in China and killed two since it was reported on New Year\u2019s Eve. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, said authorities in Australia were \u201cwatching developments very closely\u201d but had not issued a travel warning. \u201cThere is no current need for any travel advisory in Australia, which is consistent with recommendations from the World Health Organisation,\u201d he said in a statement on Saturday evening. The outbreak of the previously unknown coronavirus has been linked to a fish market at Wuhan, the capital of China\u2019s central Hubei province. The Wuhan South China Seafood City market, which also sells chickens, bats, marmots and other animals, has been closed since 1 January. Laboratory tests performed in China found the virus was not Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) or Mers (Middle East respiratory syndrome). Most of the cases were detected within days of the market being closed but Chinese authorities reported that four new patients had been diagnosed with viral pneumonia on Thursday. Three major airports in the United States have announced they will screen passengers arriving from Wuhan and screening has also been increased in airports in Thailand, which has reported two cases of the mystery virus, as well as airports in Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines. A case has also been detected in Japan. One of the cases in Thailand was detected by the thermal surveillance equipment at Bangkok airport. Murphy said the four new cases reported this week were \u201cof concern\u201d. \u201cWhilst there is no clear evidence of human to human transmission, the identification of recent cases several days after the closure of the fish market, initially identified as the likely source, raises this as a possibility,\u201d he said. \u201cImportantly, however, there have been no cases of infection in the several hundred healthcare workers who have been exposed to the patients in China.\u201d Murphy said Australia already had mechanisms in place to screen for unwell travellers, including laws requiring that airlines report passengers who are showing signs of an infectious disease, such as fever, sweats, or chills. Planes that report unwell passengers are met on arrival and assessed by biosecurity officers. The Australian Medical Association said it was also monitoring the situation. \u201cThe AMA is in regular contact with the chief medical officer and we will obviously seek further briefings should the current level of advice change,\u201d the AMA president, Dr Tony Bartone, said. Doctors in Australia have been advised to ask anyone presenting with pneumonia-type symptoms if they have recently travelled to Wuhan. Alerts issued by the New South Wales and Victorian health departments urged doctors to \u201cconsider novel coronavirus infection in patients with fever and respiratory symptoms and travel to Wuhan City, China in the 14 days before illness onset\u201d.",

Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines have all stepped up screening as well.</p> <p>The outbreak was still spreading, said Mike Turner of the Wellcome Trust, adding: \u201cWe are more concerned than three days ago. One consequence of a more connected world is that outbreaks have the potential to spread internationally much more rapidly.\u201d But Farrar said that global measures to fight emerging diseases have improved significantly. \u201cThe speed with which this virus has been identified, and the sharing of that information by China, has been amazing \u2013 a testament to the changes in public health in China since Sars, and the global coordination through the World Health Organisation. That has meant that the world is much better prepared to identify and treat patients.\u201d</p> <p>The Foreign Office said it had updated its travel advice for the Wuhan region, but guidance on visiting China remains unchanged. Most people with the infection are believed to have contracted it at a market that sells seafood and meat in Wuhan. \u201cIt is probable that we are looking at patients being affected over a number of days from multiple animal sources and with some degree of human-to-human transmission,\u201d said Farrar.</p>",

Jeremy Farrar, an expert on emerging diseases, said: \u201cWe are starting to hear of more cases in China and other countries, and it is likely that there will be many more.\u201d Scientists say the virus is a member of the coronavirus family, six members of which are known to infect humans; this would be the seventh. Mild coronaviruses cause the common cold, but more deadly strains can trigger severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), which killed nearly 800 of the 8,000 people infected in an outbreak in 2002. Fears this virus could spread similarly have risen as China prepares to celebrate its new year, with hundreds of millions of people moving around the country and visiting family overseas. Farrar said: \u201cWuhan is a major hub, and with travel a huge part of Chinese new year, the concern must remain high.\u201d New York\u2019s JFK airport, and San Francisco and Los Angeles international airports have started to screen passengers arriving from Wuhan. Chinese authorities introduced exit-screening on flights leaving Wuhan, and authorities in Hong Kong are running temperature checks for travellers from the mainland. Thailand \u2013 which has confirmed cases of the virus \u2013 announced that it was already screening passengers arriving in Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Phuket, and would soon introduce controls in the beach resort of Krabi. Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Indonesia and the Philippines have all stepped up screening as well. The outbreak was still spreading, said Mike Turner of the Wellcome Trust, adding: \u201cWe are more concerned than three days ago. One consequence of a more connected world is that outbreaks have the potential to spread internationally much more rapidly.\u201d But Farrar said that global measures to fight emerging diseases have improved significantly. \u201cThe speed with which this virus has been identified, and the sharing of that information by China, has been amazing \u2013 a testament to the changes in public health in China since Sars, and the global coordination through the World Health Organisation. That has meant that the world is much better prepared to identify and treat patients.\u201d The Foreign Office said it had updated its travel advice for the Wuhan region, but guidance on visiting China remains unchanged. Most people with the infection are believed to have contracted it at a market that sells seafood and meat in Wuhan. \u201cIt is probable that we are looking at patients being affected over a number of days from multiple animal sources and with some degree of human-to-human transmission,\u201d said Farrar.",
