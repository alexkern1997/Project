It places Joe Biden in the lead with 28%. Sanders, though, is a close second on 23%, with Tom Steyer (18%), Elizabeth Warren (12%) and Pete Buttigieg (10%) showing how divided the race is. And that is without factoring in the presence of Mike Bloomberg, whose strategy has been to not compete until Super Tuesday on 3 March.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e53a6738f08e1332474904d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-24T10:37:23.038Z\">10.37am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump sings Modi's praises at massive rally in India</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here are some video highlights of the speech that US president Donald Trump has given today at a huge rally attended by 100,000 people in Ahmedabad.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0c8c1d04-e18e-4f36-95bd-636ae81e03d7\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/o9ZJue2PeQ8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <p>He said: \u201cThe first lady and I have just travelled 8,000 miles around the globe to deliver a message to every citizen across this nation - America loves India\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump heaped praise on Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, saying that \u201ceverybody loves him\u201d but that he is \u201cvery tough\u201d.</p> \n  <p>And he spoke of improving trade and military co-operation between the US and the world\u2019s biggest democracy, saying: \u201cThe prime minister and I will also continue our important discussions about how to deepen the relationship between our two great countries.

Bloomberg\u2019s campaign is upset that his offices are being vandalized with political graffiti across the US. Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden are nearly tied in Texas ahead of the important Super Tuesday vote, a new poll found. Bloomberg\u2019s campaign is facing criticism over its social media policies once again after sharing misleading tweets misrepresenting what Sanders has said about political leaders in the past. MSNBC host Chris Matthews apologized to Bernie Sanders for comparing his Nevada win to a Nazi invasion. Joe Biden has secured an important endorsement from South Carolina Democratic representative James Clyburn ahead of an upcoming vote there. Joe Biden is set to recieve a notable endorsement this week: South Carolina Democratic representative James Clyburn will reportedly endorse the former vice president for the Democratic nomination on Wednesday. The Hill on why this endorsement is important: The House majority whip and a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, Clyburn carries significant weight in the South Carolina primary. The state is seen as a major test for Democratic candidates as they seek the support of African American voters. After suffering major defeats in Iowa, New Hampshire, and Nevada, Biden is banking on a positive performance in the upcoming South Carolina vote to keep his campaign alive. A Portland, Oregon, journalist shared her heartbreaking story of being failed by the for-profit healthcare system in the United States on Twitter over the weekend, in a passionate statement in support of Bernie Sanders for president. Her tweets explained what happened when her one-year-old son was struck by a careless driver and died after two surgeries, leaving her to navigate $175,000 in medical bills while grieving for her child. She noted that this happened \u201cdespite Obamacare and \u2018good\u2019 union insurance\u201d. Sanders\u2019s call for Medicare for All has become a central part of his campaign, as Americans struggle with rising healthcare and prescription costs. The MSNBC host Chris Matthews made a public apology to Bernie Sanders for comparing the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s win in the Nevada caucus to a Nazi invasion. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for comparing anything from that tragic era in which so many suffered, especially the Jewish people, to an electoral result in which you were the well-deserved winner\u201d, Matthews said in a statement. Matthews had faced increasing calls to resign from his hosting position over the statements about Sanders, who is Jewish and lost many family members in the Holocaust. Donald Trump\u2019s staffers have to hide ice cream from the president so he doesn\u2019t eat too much - who among us cannot relate? In a story by the New York Times, Trump\u2019s doctor Ronny Jackson followed up on previous public statements that he was attempting to help the president lose 10 to 15 pounds by bringing an exercise machine into the White House. He said those plans never came to fruition. In the past, Trump has said that he believes exercise is a waste of energy. From past reports: \u201cOther than golf, he considers exercise misguided, arguing that a person, like a battery, is born with a finite amount of energy.\u201d Instead Jackson said staffers are focusing on Trump\u2019s diet, secretly hiding cauliflower in the president\u2019s mashed potatoes and making ice cream less accessible. Joe Biden made a public statement on Monday in support of Vanessa Bryant, the widow of Kobe Bryant. The tweet was sent out on the day of the late basketball legend\u2019s public memorial service, which attracted 20,000 mourners. Biden has frequently spoken about his own personal tragedies and how he has handled them. In 1972 his wife and one-year-old daughter were killed in a car accident, and his first son, Beau, died of cancer during Biden\u2019s vice presidency. \u201cThere will come a day, I promise you, when the memory of Kobe and Gianna will bring a smile to your lips before it brings a tear to your eye\u201d, Biden said. Mike Bloomberg is again facing criticism for sharing misleading and offensive tweets. The campaign team for the Democratic candidate posted a real video of rival Bernie Sanders defending the Castro administration of Cuba. It then attempted to start an online campaign with the hashtag #BernieOnDespots, imagining what the Vermont senator would say about other regimes. Backlash over the tweets have called into question just how effective Bloomberg\u2019s massive spending spree on advertising has been. The candidate has burnt $500m in advertising since he launched his campaign and previously said he was willing to spend up to $1bn on his run for president. Some users pointed out on Twitter it was difficult to discern that the latest hashtag was a joke and not real quotes Sanders said about the leaders, including \u201cVladimir Putin is willing to poison anyone who disagrees with him, but have you seen how that guy looks without a shirt!! Mmm delish!\u201d Some have called the Putin tweet homophobic. Ultimately the team clarified with a tweet that \u201call of these are satire\u201d with the exception of the original video shared. Bloomberg was criticized earlier this month for a video he tweeted that was misleadingly edited. Twitter said under its new policy against misleading content, in the future it would be flagged as a doctored clip, but those features will not go into effect until 5 March. Twitter did not respond for request for comment on whether the #BernieOnDespots tweets also violated its policies on misinformation. A new survey from the Hobby School of Public Affairs at the University of Houston found Biden and Bernie Sanders are neck and neck among voters in Texas, a key state for the race to the Democratic nomination. Bernie Sanders is polling at 22.1% there while Joe Biden is 22.5% in the lone star state. Elizabeth Warren is in third place at 18.3%. The most important issue for voters there, according to the survey, are that the candidate can win the election against Trump. There differences in support between genders among all candidates except for Sanders: men were more likely to support Biden and women were more likely to support Warren while men and women were equally likely to support Sanders, the poll found. Texas will vote in its primary election on 3 March. A number of campaign offices of Democratic candidate Mike Bloomberg have been vandalized, his team tweeted on Monday. In Chicago, Michigan, Ohio, and Utah offices of Bloomberg have been defaced with graffiti criticizing his history of racially-charged policing policies and his extraordinary wealth. His campaign team said the incidents are indicative of people who use \u201chateful rhetoric and intimidation to influence this election\u201d and who are \u201cdriving our country further and further apart\u201d. The tweets have sparked a variety of responses, some defending the graffiti and criticizing the former New York City mayor for the policies highlighted by the vandalism. Hello readers, Kari Paul here to keep you posted on the latest for the next few hours. Stay tuned for updates. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Kari Paul, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Mike Bloomberg has officially spent more than $500m in his efforts to win the Democratic presidential nomination. His first real test will come next week on Super Tuesday, but his widely panned debate performance in Nevada could hurt his chances. Joe Biden\u2019s campaign criticized Bernie Sanders for the frontrunner\u2019s flattering comments about Fidel Castro, which intensified concerns of the effect a Sanders nomination would have on down-ballot Democrats. Trump addressed 100,000 people at a rally in India, where he praised the prime minister, Narendra Modi. Harvey Weinstein, the film producer who was accused of repeated sexual misconduct, was convicted on two charges, marking a key victory for the #MeToo movement. Global markets dropped as fears spread about the coronavirus, which has already claimed 2,600 lives. Kari will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The US stock market has closed down by more than 1,000 points as fears intensify of a spreading coronavirus. The Washington Post reports: The Dow Jones industrial average sank by more than 1,000 points or 3.5 percent, as Wall Street interpreted disease clusters in South Korea, Italy and Iran as a sign that the disease has outraced confinement efforts in China. Factories around the world are grappling with parts shortages as their Chinese suppliers struggle to resume normal operations. As global economic engines sputter, the Federal Reserve and other central banks are facing calls for emergency help. The Trump administration is expected to ask Congress for funding to help combat the virus, but experts fear they will not request enough money to adequately address the health threat. A new South Carolina poll out today shows Joe Biden leading by double digits, a result that is a bit at odds with other surveys from the state. According to PublicPolicyPolling, Biden stands at 36% in South Carolina compared to Bernie Sanders\u2019 21%. Tom Steyer, who has been in third place in other polls, was tied for fourth place at 7%. If Biden were to win South Carolina by double digits, it would allow him to claim he is the dominate moderate candidate in the race, potentially putting more pressure on candidates like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar to withdraw. But there is reason to be skeptical of those PPP numbers, considering the RealClearPolitics polling average of the state shows Biden up by just 5 points. Joe Biden\u2019s campaign has released a statement criticizing Bernie Sanders for his flattering comments about Fidel Castro. \u201cMake no mistake: Bernie Sanders\u2019 comments on Fidel Castro are a part of a larger pattern throughout his life to embrace autocratic leaders and governments across the globe,\u201d said Biden campaign adviser Crist\u00f3bal Alex. \u201cWe already have one president who praises dictators and their mob-like tendencies; we don\u2019t need another one.\u201d Democrats in Florida, a state with a large Cuban-American population, have similarly released statements criticizing Sanders for praising Castro\u2019s literacy program. Democratic officials in the state fear Sanders\u2019 potential nomination could have negative down-ballot consequences in Florida, and Biden, who has sought to portray Sanders as unelectable, is clearly trying to capitalize on those concerns. Set your alarms: Trump will hold a press conference in New Delhi at 6:30 am ET tomorrow. The president has developed a habit of holding long, freewheeling press conferences at the end of his international trips, so the appearance could generate a number of headlines. Florida Democrats are trying to distance themselves from some flattering comments Bernie Sanders made about Fidel Castro during his 60 Minutes interview. Given Florida\u2019s large Cuban-American population, some Democrats in the state have expressed fears that a Sanders nomination would have negative down-ballot consequences in November. Sanders\u2019 comments about Castro intensified those concerns. \u201cWe\u2019re very opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba but you know, it\u2019s unfair to simply say everything is bad,\u201d the self-describe democratic socialist said. \u201cYou know? When Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it?\u201d There are still some results left to count from the Nevada caucuses, but it appears Bernie Sanders won two-thirds of the state\u2019s 36 delegates. Many states still need to vote, but Sanders has opened up a large delegate lead early in the race, which could be crucial on Super Tuesday next week. Pete Buttigieg is campaigning in South Carolina, which will hold its presidential primary on Saturday. The former Indiana mayor joined a march calling for an increased minimum wage: But some Black Lives Matter protesters were also there for the march, criticizing Buttigieg for previously opposing increases to the minimum wage: Bernie Sanders appears to be enjoying a bump in national polls thanks to his strong performance in Nevada. According to Morning Consult\u2019s polling, Sanders\u2019 national standing has increased by four points since the Nevada debate, while his opponents have held steady or slightly dropped. With Super Tuesday just eight days away, the numbers are another indication that Sanders may soon gain an insurmountable delegate lead. Coming off his landslide Nevada victory, Bernie Sanders is now investing in South Carolina, which will hold its primary on Saturday. Joe Biden has said he has built a \u201cfirewall\u201d in South Carolina, where more than half of 2016 primary voters were African American. But a South Carolina poll released yesterday showed Biden\u2019s lead over Sanders narrowing to five points, so Sanders\u2019 team is expressing hope that they may be able to eclipse the former vice-president in the state. The latest numbers are in, and Mike Bloomberg has spent more than $500m so far on his presidential campaign. Bloomberg\u2019s spending dwarfs that of any of his opponents, including fellow billionaire Tom Steyer. The former New York mayor has expressed a willigness to spend up to $1bn on his campaign, though he said it will \u201chopefully not\u201d cost quite that much. Bloomberg\u2019s first test will come on Super Tuesday next week, but there are some signs that his support is slipping after his widely panned debate performance. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Harvey Weinstein, the film producer accused of sexual misconduct by dozens of women, was convicted on two counts, marking a key victory for the #MeToo movement. Trump held a massive rally in India, where he praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi as \u201cvery tough.\u201d Global markets dropped amid fears of a spreading coronvirus, which has already claimed 2,600 lives. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. With Bernie Sanders\u2019 status as the frontrunner in the Democratic presidential primary cemented, Republican senator Marco Rubio tweeted a video lamenting the dangers of democratic socialism. \u201cDemocratic socialism sounds benign, but at the core of Democratic socialism is Marxism, and at the core of Marxism is this fake offer that if you turn over more of your individual freedom, we\u2019re going to provide you security. We\u2019re going to provide you free healthcare. We\u2019re going to provide you free education,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cBut the problem is that when they can\u2019t deliver on it or you\u2019re not happy with it, you don\u2019t get your freedoms back.\u201d Rubio\u2019s video (oddly filmed as he drives a car) likely foreshadows the talking points Republicans will use against Sanders, a self-identified democratic socialist, if he wins the nomination. But some proponents of Sanders\u2019 policies have suggested this line of attack may not be as successful as Republicans think: Another Democratic congresswoman from Florida has criticized Bernie Sanders for offering some flattering comments about Fidel Castro in his 60 Minutes interview. Murphy, a moderate Democrat who serves as one of the co-chairs of the Blue Dog Coalition, won her 2018 race by 15 points, but a number of Florida Democrats have voiced concerns about down-ballot effects in heavily Cuban districts if Sanders wins the nomination. Harvey Weinstein, the film producer whose alleged sexual misconduct inspired the #MeToo movement, has been convicted on two counts. The Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington reports: The movie mogul\u2019s epic fall from grace is now complete, toppled from the pinnacle of independent cinema where he helmed films such as Pulp Fiction and Shakespeare in Love, amassing a total of 81 Oscars. The glamorous Manhattan and Los Angeles lifestyle he once enjoyed will soon be replaced by a New York state prison cell as he faces jail time. The jury of seven men and five women at the New York supreme court took five days to reach their verdict. The conviction marks the final comeuppance for a towering figure who wielded his power in the movie industry \u2013 as well as his commanding physical presence \u2013 over vulnerable young women seeking his help. Weinstein was found guilty of a criminal sexual act in the first degree and rape in the third degree, but he was acuitted on the more serious charges of predatory sexual assault and rape in the first degree. As Ed notes, Weinstein\u2019s conviction marks a victoty in the #MeToo movement: Though Judge James Burke cautioned the jury not to see the case as a referendum on #MeToo, Weinstein\u2019s conviction is certain to have far-reaching consequences for gender relations in the workplace, in Hollywood and far beyond. The world of powerful men who deploy their seniority as tools of sexual control is much less secure in its wake. Senator Amy Klobuchar leads the Democratic primary field in her home state of Minnesota, which will vote on Super Tuesday. According to a new MPR News/Star Tribune Minnesota poll, Klobuchar is at 29% in Minnesota, compared to frontrunner Bernie Sanders\u2019 23%. Elizabeth Warren is at 11%, and no other candidate hits double digits. Although the poll is good news for Klobuchar, who has so far failed to win a single contest, Sanders\u2019 strong second-place position will likely cause some alarm among her advisers. Sanders\u2019 has had impressive showings in the first three voting states, which will almost certainly help him to attract additional support, and Klobuchar needs to win her home state (at an absolute minimum) to stay alive. Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is overseeing the case of Roger Stone, will hold a closed hearing tomorrow to consider the former Trump associate\u2019s request for a new trial. Stone, who was sentenced to more than three years in prison last week for obstructing Congress\u2019 Russia investigation, has claimed his trial was tainted due to anti-Trump juror bias. But Jackson seems unlikely to issue a favorable ruling on his motion for a new trial, considering she praised the jurors for their service when she announced Stone\u2019s sentence last week. Mike Bloomberg\u2019s campaign is using Russia\u2019s reported efforts to help Bernie Sanders in the 2020 election as a means of criticizing the Vermont senator\u2019s electability. Reports emerged Friday that the Kremlin was interfering in the 2020 campaign to help Sanders, news that came two days after reports indicated Vladimir Putin\u2019s government was trying to help Trump get re-elected. The subject of Russian election interference is almost guaranteed to come up during tomorrow\u2019s debate, but the varying accounts of who the Kremlin is trying to help could muddy the waters. Another Florida Democrat, freshman congresswoman Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, criticized Bernie Sanders for offering some praise for the former Cuban leader Fidel Castro. During his \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview that aired last night, Sanders was asked about his past comments on the late communist leader. \u201cWe\u2019re very opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba but you know, it\u2019s unfair to simply say everything is bad,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cYou know? When Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it?\u201d That did not sit will with Mucarsel-Powell, who flipped a heavily Cuban House district in 2018. The comments also underscore how Sanders\u2019 increasingly likely nomination could leave down-ballot Democrats in Florida, a key swing state where many Cuban Americans reside, at a disadvantage. Global markets are dropping as fears intensify of an expanding coronvirus, which has already claimed 2,600 lives. The AP reports: Stocks are opening sharply lower on Wall Street, pushing the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 700 points, as virus cases spread beyond China, threatening to disrupt the global economy. The early plunge in U.S. trading erased the Dow\u2019s gains for the year. Markets in Europe and Asia had even bigger losses as infections spread in Italy, Iran and South Korea. Bond and gold prices surged as investors sought safety. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 84 points, or 2.5%, to 3,251. The Dow fell 775 points, or 2.7%, to 28,212. The Nasdaq lost 298 points, or 3.1%, to 9,282. The White House is expected to ask Congress for more money to fight the virus, but expects have warned that the potential request of $1 billion is not enough to address the health threat. Mike Bloomberg is hitting Democratic frontrunner Bernie Sanders for his record on guns, possibly foreshadowing tomorrow\u2019s debate in South Carolina. In a new ad, Bloomberg\u2019s campaign recounts how Sanders won the support of the National Rifle Association before he was first electied to Congress in 1990 because his opponent had supported banning assault weapons. During his long career in Congress, Sanders repeatedly voted against the Brady Bill, which called for waiting periods before acquiring guns and instant background checks. Sanders also supported a law that has been cited to halt lawsuits from mass shooting victims against gun manufacturers. Joe Biden has also tried to hammer Sanders for his record on gun control, but the Vermont senator has said his thinking of the issue has evolved. \u201cWe deserve a president who has never been bought by the NRA,\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s ad concludes. The billionaire candidate will likely echo that message on the debate stage tomorrow. This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Martin Belam. As many Democratic leaders freak out over the possibility of Bernie Sanders winning the presidential nomination after his landslide victory in Nevada, one senior House Democrat is preparing to endorse another candidate. House majority whip Jim Clyburn, South Carolina\u2019s longest-serving member of Congress, reportedly intends to endorse Joe Biden on Wednesday. Politico reports: The planned endorsement is expected three days ahead of the state\u2019s Saturday primary, giving Biden an important boost in a state that will likely determine the fate of his candidacy. Clyburn, the highest ranking African American in Congress, has long been close with Biden and has been open about his affinity for the former vice president during the Democratic primary. ... Clyburn was already considering formally backing Biden but the pressure intensified after Sanders\u2019 landslide win in Nevada on Saturday night, according to two people familiar with the endorsement discussions. \u2018I will endorse Wednesday morning,\u2019 Clyburn said Sunday on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u2018I\u2019m going to tell everybody who I\u2019m going to vote for. I\u2019m just not going to do it today.\u2019 Clyburn\u2019s endorsement will come as some centrist Democrats are calling on candidates like Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, who currently has a very narrow lead over Sanders in the Iowa caucuses, to drop out of the race to consolidate the moderate vote. But all the candidates have signaled they intend to carry on until at least Super Tuesday, when billionaire Mike Bloomberg will join the mix. All those factors could quickly give Sanders an insurmountable delegate lead in his path to the nomination. Bernie Sanders has angered people, including fellow Democrats, with comments he made about Cuba in last night\u2019s CBS News 60 Minutes interview. While being asked about past comments on Cuba, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re very opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba but you know, it\u2019s unfair to simply say everything is bad. \u201cYou know? When Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it?\u201d Sanders did go on to condemn the imprisonment of political dissidents under Castro, but that wasn\u2019t enough to prevent bipartisan criticism of the remarks. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that in the future, Senator Sanders will take time to speak to some of my constituents before he decides to sing the praises of a murderous tyrant like Fidel Castro\u201d tweeted Democrat Donna Shalala of Florida. Marco Rubio also criticised the comments. During the interview segment, Sanders attacked the current US president\u2019s policy of being cosy with authoritarian regimes, saying \u201cUnlike Donald Trump, I do not think that Kim Jong-un is a good friend. I don\u2019t trade love letters with a murdering dictator. Vladimir Putin, not a great friend of mine.\u201d You can watch the whole interview here. The president has now left the Taj Mahal in India, where he was accompanied by the first lady and by Ivanka Trump, and is heading for New Delhi on Air Force One. Someone has also obviously just handed his phone back to him, because his account has stopped tweeting in Hindi and he is tweeting about the Roger Stone case again. The pictures coming out of the Trump visit to New Delhi are going to be a lot less welcoming than those this morning in Ahmedabad, which is in Indian prime minister Modi\u2019s home state of Gujarat. While a group of Hindu nationalists held a prayer meeting in which they put a vermilion mark on the forehead of Trumps photograph on a poster, blessing him, there have also been anti-Trump demonstrations on streets in several Indian cities. While anti-Trump street demonstrations have been seen in the cities of Gauhati in the northeast, Kolkata in the east and Hyderabad in the south, it is in New Delhi where police have fired tear gas. Coinciding with the Trump visit, continuing clashes have erupted between hundreds of supporters and opponents of a new Indian citizenship law that provides fast-track citzenship for some foreign-born religious minorities living in the country, but explicitly not to Muslims. At the rally early in Ahmedabad, Trump had praised India\u2019s history of religious tolerance, saying many faiths \u201cworship side by side in harmony.\u201d A survey of US business economists has suggested that they are a lot happier with the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy than the president is. Trump has frequently tweeted his irritation about interest rates, and has in the past described Fed officials as \u201cboneheads\u201d. However nearly two-thirds of the economists asked by the National Association for Business Economics say that the Fed\u2019s interest rate policy is \u201cabout right\u201d. Beginning last summer, the Fed cut its key rate three times in 2019, reducing it to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%, which is very low by historic standards. Trump has repeatedly suggested the Fed should cut rates further, to zero, or even into negative territory. Confidence in the Trump economy seems high though. Just 13% of respondents forecast a downturn in 2020, which is down from 42% in last year\u2019s survey. 37% still foresee a recession in 2021. The results reflect the views of 210 economists from companies, trade associations and academia. Julian Assange has just stood up in court in London to speak It is the first day of the court hearing into the US attempt to extradite Assange from the UK. My colleague Ben Quinn has filed this report of proceedings so far. Jonathan Swan has an interesting looking exclusive for Axios, about Trump\u2019s \u201cDeep State\u201d hit list of \u201cdisloyal government officials to oust \u2014 and trusted pro-Trump people to replace them.\u201d According to Swan\u2019s reporting \u201ca well-connected network of conservative activists with close ties to Trump and top administration officials is quietly helping develop these \u2018Never Trump\u2019/pro-Trump lists\u201d and using them to suggest who the president should hire and fire. They are said to be playing on Trump\u2019s belief, after his impeachment acquittal, that \u201chis government \u2014 from Justice to State to Defense to Homeland Security \u2014 is filled with \u2018snakes.\u2019 He wants them fired and replaced ASAP.\u201d You can read the piece in full here - it goes into quite a lot of specifics about three specific memos, and backs up what the New York Times\u2019 Peter Baker wrote on Saturday, that \u201cin some of the most critical corners of the Trump administration, officials show up for work now never entirely sure who will be there by the end of the evening \u2014 themselves included.\u201d It has not been a great few days in court for long-time Trump ally Roger Stone, who on Thursday was sentenced to forty months in prison by Judge Amy Berman Jackson. Stone\u2019s attorneys had filed on Friday calling for her recusal. On Sunday his attempt to get her removed failed when she rejected his lawyers\u2019 arguments and vigorously defended her impartiality. In the court filing she insisted that she had been fair to Stone \u201ceven after he took to social media to intimidate the Court, after he violated conditions imposed by the Court, after he was convicted at trial, and after he was sentenced to a term of incarceration.\u201d She went on to say that the attempt to remove her appeared to be \u201cnothing more than an attempt to use the Court\u2019s docket to disseminate a statement for public consumption that has the words \u2018judge\u2019 and \u2018biased\u2019 in it.\u201d In sentencing Stone, Jackson had said that the veteran Republican operative\u2019s lies to lawmakers investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election amounted to a threat to American democracy. Stone was convicted of lying to the Intelligence Committee about his attempts to contact Julian Assange\u2019s WikiLeaks. Over on the Outside The Beltway blog James Joyner has some stinging words for Tom Steyer, who he describes as \u201cthe vanity candidate\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve long viewed Tom Steyer\u2019s quest for the Democratic presidential nomination as a bad joke. He has never held elective office and was pretty much a non-entity on the national scene before his announcement. He has spent millions of dollars manipulating the DNC\u2019s insipid rules and managed to get on the debate stage, where he\u2019s mostly been ignored. So far, that\u2019s gotten him to 2.2% in the national polls.\u201d Joyner goes on to argue that Steyer\u2019s presence as a spoiler in South Carolina risks, if not handing the nomination over to Bernie Sanders outright, at least doing enough to damage to any chance that Joe Biden could use South Carolina to pick up some campaign momentum. Read in full: \u201cSteyer as South Carolina Spoiler\u201d As Super Tuesday approaches and with his debate debut behind him, at the Guardian we\u2019ve been taking a closer look at Mike Bloomberg - the billionaire candidate. Here\u2019s part two of our series on Bloomberg, from Amanda Holpuch in New York, asking \u201cCan Mike Bloomberg buy his way to the White House?\u201d \u201cA key issue with trying to buy the presidency is that if a candidate isn\u2019t relying on small donors, it is more difficult to establish their actual popularity among the electorate. That\u2019s why in normal election years, the parties would usually be leaning toward candidates who demonstrated how well-liked they are through many donations. But half a billion dollars goes a long way in a US election.\u201d It\u2019s also worth noting today that the Bloomberg campaign has bought ad-space in the influential Axios newsletter. If you don\u2019t catch the words \u201cA message from Mike Bloomberg 2020\u201d in the small-print, it looks like one of their top stories is \u201cBloomberg is the strongest Democrat to take on Trump in November\u201d. Sanders, Biden, Warren and the rest would be sure to disagree. There really are some incredible photos coming out of Trump\u2019s visit to India today. This shot might give you an idea of the scale of the audience that Narendra Modi and the US president were addressing. The Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium, where the rally took place, has a seated capacity of 110,000 and is the second largest sports stadium in the world. This image gives an indication of the security precautions placed around the two leaders. My colleague Hannah Ellis-Petersen was there and has a full report. \u201cArchna Singh, 31, was among the locals from Ahmedabad who had turned out for the rally and had brought her two children. \u2018This is a very exciting day for us, to have the US president here shows how India is a very important country,\u2019 she said. \u2018This good relationship will make us stronger.\u2019\u201d The president\u2019s visit has now moved on to the world famous Taj Mahal monument. There is sometimes speculation on whether Trump actually writes some of the more official sounding tweets on his timeline in person, but I think we can safely assume that he isn\u2019t typing these Hindi ones out himself today. This one does sound very much like the president\u2019s own words in translation though: \u201cAmerica and India will strengthen their countries, enrich their people, make big dreamers bigger and make their future brighter than ever ... and this is only the beginning.\u201d Something to watch for in London today: Julian Assange is set for his latest face off with the US government as his extradition hearing begins in the British courts. Assange is wanted on 18 charges over the publication of US cables a decade ago, and faces up to 175 years in jail. He is accused of working with former US army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to leak hundreds of thousands of classified documents. My colleague Ben Quinn is covering the case, reporting that in the opening exchanges lawyers acting for the US government have said \u201cReporting for journalism is not an excuse for breaking laws\u201d, claiming that by disseminating material in an unredacted form, Assange knowingly put human rights activists, dissidents, journalists and their families at risk of serious harm in states operated by oppressive regimes. As anticipated, there is a large presence of protestors outside the hearing - some even, it is reported, having crossed over from France to join the protests. Today is only the next step in a lengthy process though. After opening arguments this week, the case is expected to be adjourned until May, when both sides will have an opportunity to lay out their evidence. The judge is unlikely to rule until several months after that, and whichever way the court decides, an appeal against the verdict is almost inevitable. Away from Trump\u2019s visit to India, people are still taking stock of the size of the Bernie Sanders victory in Nevada at the weekend. Here are Natasha Korecki and David Siders in Politico arguing that the Democratic establishment is truly beginning to panic about the prospect of a left-wing Sanders nomination. \u201cIn 30-plus years of politics, I\u2019ve never seen this level of doom. I\u2019ve never had a day with so many people texting, emailing, calling me with so much doom and gloom\u201d Former candidate Andrew Yang believes that the Sanders lead may be insurmountable by the middle of March. South Carolina is the next stop for the primaries. In 2016 Sanders was completely crushed by Hillary Clinton - she won with 73% of the vote to his 26%. It is going to be a very different story this time - with the Sanders opposition split between several candidates. Yesterday CBS News issued a poll, taken before the Nevada result, of voting intentions in South Carolina. It places Joe Biden in the lead with 28%. Sanders, though, is a close second on 23%, with Tom Steyer (18%), Elizabeth Warren (12%) and Pete Buttigieg (10%) showing how divided the race is. And that is without factoring in the presence of Mike Bloomberg, whose strategy has been to not compete until Super Tuesday on 3 March. Here are some video highlights of the speech that US president Donald Trump has given today at a huge rally attended by 100,000 people in Ahmedabad. He said: \u201cThe first lady and I have just travelled 8,000 miles around the globe to deliver a message to every citizen across this nation - America loves India\u201d Trump heaped praise on Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, saying that \u201ceverybody loves him\u201d but that he is \u201cvery tough\u201d. And he spoke of improving trade and military co-operation between the US and the world\u2019s biggest democracy, saying: \u201cThe prime minister and I will also continue our important discussions about how to deepen the relationship between our two great countries. Both of us understand that when leaders put the interest of their own citizens first, we can forge strong and fair partnerships, to build a safer and more prosperous world.\u201d The \u201cNamaste Trump\u201d rally is a follow up to the \u201cHowdy Modi\u201d event that the Indian prime minister attended in Houston in September. Before the rally in the stadium, the president, along with the first lady and Narendra Modi, attended the Gandhi Ashram in Ahmedabad. Trump wrote \u201cTo my great friend Prime Minister Modi...Thank you for this wonderful visit!\u201d in the guest book. Thousands of well-wishers lined the streets before the event waving flags, with a lot of support on display for president Trump and for the relationship between India and the US. At the rally Modi lead the crowd in a chant of \u201cLong live India-U.S. friendship.\u201d In his speech, Trump called Modi a \u201ctremendously successful leader\u201d who has transformed the country. He announced more military sales to India, including helicopters, and said he is working with Modi on a trade deal. The huge audience cheered when Trump mentioned US strikes on radical Islamic extremists. Good morning. Nevada is already in the rear-view mirror for the Democrats after the resounding win by Bernie Sanders there in the caucuses. With nearly 90% of the vote counted, the leftwing senator has 47.1% of the vote. Joe Biden has picked up 21%, and Pete Buttigieg is on13.7%, with Elizabeth Warren (9.6%) and Tom Steyer (4.7%) coming in 4th and 5th. But it is Steyer who is in the news, after he has qualified for Tuesday\u2019s debate, as focus turns to the South Carolina primary which seems like it is Biden\u2019s to lose. The president, meanwhile is up and about on a visit to India and tweeting in Hindi. He has been addressing a huge rally with India prime minister Narendra Modi, who he described as a \u201ctrue friend\u201d. The gathering in Ahmedabad was expected to draw a crowd of 100,000. Trump\u2019s visit, which he has described as the \u201cbiggest event\u2019 India has ever had, will last 36 hours.",

Until a few weeks ago wildlife farming was still being promoted by government agencies as an easy way for rural Chinese people to get rich. But the Covid-19 outbreak, which has now led to 2,666 deaths and over 77,700 known infections, is thought to have originated in wildlife sold at a market in Wuhan in early December, prompting a massive rethink by authorities on how to manage the trade. China issued a temporary ban on wildlife trade to curb the spread of the virus at the end of January and began a widespread crackdown on breeding facilities in early February. The country\u2019s top legislative officials are now rushing to amend the country\u2019s wildlife protection law and possibly restructure regulations on the use of wildlife for food and traditional Chinese medicine. The current version of the law is seen as problematic by wildlife conservation groups because it focuses on utilisation of wildlife rather than its protection. \u201cThe coronavirus epidemic is swiftly pushing China to reevaluate its relationship with wildlife,\u201d Steve Blake, chief representative of WildAid in Beijing, told the Guardian. \u201cThere is a high level of risk from this scale of breeding operations both to human health and to the impacts on populations of these animals in the wild.\u201d The National People\u2019s Congress released new measures on Monday restricting wildlife trade, banning consumption of bushmeat and sales of wildlife for meat consumption at wet markets between now and the time the Wildlife Protection Law can be amended and adopted.

      "bodyText": "South Korea has stepped up its \u201cmaximum measures\u201d to contain the coronavirus with plans to test around 200,000 members of a secretive church believed to be at the centre of the country\u2019s outbreak. Along with an emergency budget and a crackdown on the hoarding of face masks, the government in Seoul will test members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus after its founder agreed to provide authorities with the names of all its members in the country. It came as financial markets saw more heavy losses across Asia Pacific on Tuesday over fears the coronavirus was spreading more widely from China and will cause disruption in countries such as South Korea, the world\u2019s 12th biggest economy. The Nikkei in Tokyo was down 3.3% while the Shanghai Composite sank 2%. Stocks in Australia fell 1.6% and Hong Kong was also in the red although futures trading pointed to a recovery later in the day in European and US markets. In Japan, a fourth person from the Diamond Princess cruise ship died and the country\u2019s education minister said schools with reported coronavirus cases should be temporarily closed. Koichi Hagiuda told reporters on Tuesday that education boards of Hokkaido in northern Japan and Chiba City near Tokyo have been told to take this preventive measure, NHK says. In China, where 71 new deaths and 508 new cases were reported on Tuesday, health officials said strict control and prevention measures would remain in place in Hubei province, the epicentre of the global outbreak. The national health commission added it would also strictly control the outbound movement of people in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province with existing traffic controls. At Tianjin University, near Beijing, scientists said they had developed an oral vaccine for Covid-19. The professor who led the project, Huang Jinhai, said the vaccine could also serve as a potential therapy for infected patients. Chinese state media said the university was looking for partners to run clinical trials. In Italy, authorities announced the first case in the south of the country. A woman from Bergamo, who was on holiday with her friends in Sicily, tested positive for Convid-19. She is not in a serious condition. Her husband and friends have been quarantined for at least the next 15 days as Italian authorities scramble to contain the worst outbreak of the virus in Europe and the third worst in the world. The number of confirmed cases in the country has risen to over 220, with seven deaths. All those who have died had underlying health problems. South Korea reported 60 new cases on Tuesday, with 16 of them in the south-eastern city of Daegu, where the Shincheonji church is located, and 33 were from the surrounding North Gyeongsang province, Korea\u2019s centre for disease control said. The country now has more than 977 cases, the biggest number outside China. Ten people have died there. Over 60% of the people infected are linked to the church, officials believe, with a 61-year-old woman thought to be responsible for spreading it to fellow worshippers. The government plans to conduct coronavirus tests on all of the members \u201cas soon as possible\u201d once it has the information, the prime minister\u2019s office said in a statement. \u201cWe have constantly requested the list based on our assessment that it is essential to test all of the church members in order to contain the spread of the virus and relieve public anxiety,\u201d the statement said. The church, which has faced public criticism of its handling of the outbreak, asked the government to ensure the personal details in the lists do not become public. Estimates put the church membership at about 215,000 people. \u201cWe have been actively cooperating with the government to prevent the spread of the virus and overcome the outbreak,\u201d church founder and self-proclaimed messiah Lee Man-hee said in a letter posted online. Besides its members, the church would also check the people in training programmes to become full members, he added. \u201cAll of these will be implemented on the premise that the government takes steps to protect their personal information,\u201d Lee said. Daegu has been largely deserted since cases spiked sharply in the city last week with the only gatherings of people seen outside shops selling face masks. The government said it would spare no expense in helping Daegu combat the outbreak, although it has so far stopped short of restricting travel to the city. Instead, people who recently visited Daegu and nearby areas have been advised to stay at home if possible for two weeks. \u201cPeople have grave concerns about the safety of Shincheonji followers and the possibility of the spread of the virus. To contain the infectious disease, the maximum measures should be taken as long as related laws permit,\u201d said Lee Nak-yon, a Democratic party boss who attended a meeting with ministers in Seoul on Tuesday, news agency Yonhap reported. Around two trillion won ($1.6bn) would be released from a special reserve fund, the government said, with an emergency budget boost of around $8bn expected. Democratic party chairman Lee Hae-chan also called for stringent crackdowns on the illegal hoarding of face masks as demand soared. \u201cThere should be special measures that allow people to get face masks freely through administrative organisations,\u201d Lee said. Other measures to restrict the spread of the virus on Tuesday included the national basketball league banning spectators until the outbreak was under control. The country\u2019s football association has already postponed the start of the domestic season, many companies have told employees to work from home and a concert featuring K-pop stars BTS planned for next week has been cancelled. In addition, American and South Korean militaries said they were considering scaling back joint training because of mounting concerns about the coronavirus.

      "body": "<h2>Top story: \u2018This is a momentous day\u2019</h2> \n<p>Good morning \u2013 Warren Murray with Tuesday\u2019s news neatly parcelled.</p> \n<p>The dramatic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/24/harvey-weinstein-guilty-trial-charges-verdict\">conviction of Harvey Weinstein in New York for rape</a> is only the beginning of the former movie mogul\u2019s prosecution, with a further <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/24/harvey-weinstein-los-angeles-trial\">criminal case due to launch in Los Angeles</a> stemming from eight allegations. In the most high-profile trial of the #MeToo movement yet, a New York jury on Monday found Weinstein guilty of third-degree rape for an attack in a New York hotel and guilty of a criminal sex act for forcing oral sex on a former television production assistant. Weinstein was taken away in handcuffs and could face 25 years in prison.</p> \n<p>For now, an air of vindication prevails among <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/24/weinstein-accusers-what-they-said-accusations\">Weinstein\u2019s accusers</a> and the #MeToo movement. \u201cFor the women who testified in this case, and walked through traumatic hell, you did a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/24/hollywood-reacts-harvey-weinstein-conviction-ashley-judd-julianne-moore\">public service to girls and women everywhere</a>, thank you. #ConvictWeinstein #Guilty,\u201d tweeted Ashley Judd, an actor, activist and one of the first women to go on the record with Weinstein accusations for the New York Times.</p> \n<p>Alleged victims of Harvey Weinstein in the UK are bringing their own cases against the former Hollywood producer \u2013 six have taken out civil compensation claims. The Hollyoaks star Lysette Anthony, who alleges Weinstein raped her at her London home in the 1980s, said: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/24/alleged-victims-of-harvey-weinstein-in-uk-hailed-guilty-verdict\">This is a momentous day</a> and this is the day that hiding behind vicious, petty, transactional defence was slaughtered.\u201d Weinstein\u2019s lawyers have said they will appeal in the New York case. He has denied all claims of non-consensual sex.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Court forensics \u2018on knife-edge\u2019 \u2013 </strong>Innocent people are being wrongly convicted and criminals escaping justice because the forensic science system is not meeting basic standards, the regulator has said. Dr Gillian Tully revealed that in England and Wales, not one CCTV image analyst met the required standard and she could not vouch for analysis that is meant to show if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/25/forensic-science-failures-putting-justice-at-risk-says-regulator\">someone caught on camera was the same person as a suspect</a>. \u201cPeople are not fully tested according to international standards.\u201d The current mishmash of private and public providers of forensic analysis came about in 2012 when the coalition government allowed the loss-making Forensic Science Service to collapse. Now Tully has told the Guardian the service has been \u201con a knife-edge\u201d for years and after seven years the government has failed to deliver on a promise of enforceable standards.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Red wall of ill health \u2013 </strong>Life expectancy has stalled for the first time in more than 100 years and even reversed for the most deprived women in society as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/24/austerity-blamed-for-life-expectancy-stalling-for-first-time-in-century\">gap in health equality widens, with austerity largely to blame</a>, according to a review. Health has worsened in many of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/25/how-deprivation-in-the-north-has-led-to-a-health-crisis\">\u201cred wall\u201d constituencies in the north of England that backed Brexit</a> and returned Boris Johnson to power by voting Conservative for the first time. For example, in Heywood and Middleton, depression, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease all exceed the England average. And 21% of Heywood and Middleton is classed as \u201chighly deprived\u201d, compared with 0% in the PM\u2019s Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency. Separately, forecasting shows economies of Britain\u2019s smaller towns are set to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/25/england-north-south-divide-set-to-grow-with-smaller-towns-worst-hit\">fall further behind the biggest cities</a> over the next three years unless greater action is taken. The UK has some of the worst regional economic unbalance of the world\u2019s developed countries, say accountants EY.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Covid-19 cases build in Middle East \u2013 </strong>Fears are growing that coronavirus has infiltrated a main Muslim pilgrimage route, including the city of Qom, amid increasing alarm that Iranian officials have been slow to realise Covid-19 has taken root.

Coles has denied an intimate relationship with a woman known only as Jessica while he infiltrated political groups in the 90s.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018This is a momentous day\u2019 Good morning \u2013 Warren Murray with Tuesday\u2019s news neatly parcelled. The dramatic conviction of Harvey Weinstein in New York for rape is only the beginning of the former movie mogul\u2019s prosecution, with a further criminal case due to launch in Los Angeles stemming from eight allegations. In the most high-profile trial of the #MeToo movement yet, a New York jury on Monday found Weinstein guilty of third-degree rape for an attack in a New York hotel and guilty of a criminal sex act for forcing oral sex on a former television production assistant. Weinstein was taken away in handcuffs and could face 25 years in prison. For now, an air of vindication prevails among Weinstein\u2019s accusers and the #MeToo movement. \u201cFor the women who testified in this case, and walked through traumatic hell, you did a public service to girls and women everywhere, thank you. #ConvictWeinstein #Guilty,\u201d tweeted Ashley Judd, an actor, activist and one of the first women to go on the record with Weinstein accusations for the New York Times. Alleged victims of Harvey Weinstein in the UK are bringing their own cases against the former Hollywood producer \u2013 six have taken out civil compensation claims. The Hollyoaks star Lysette Anthony, who alleges Weinstein raped her at her London home in the 1980s, said: \u201cThis is a momentous day and this is the day that hiding behind vicious, petty, transactional defence was slaughtered.\u201d Weinstein\u2019s lawyers have said they will appeal in the New York case. He has denied all claims of non-consensual sex. * * * Court forensics \u2018on knife-edge\u2019 \u2013 Innocent people are being wrongly convicted and criminals escaping justice because the forensic science system is not meeting basic standards, the regulator has said. Dr Gillian Tully revealed that in England and Wales, not one CCTV image analyst met the required standard and she could not vouch for analysis that is meant to show if someone caught on camera was the same person as a suspect. \u201cPeople are not fully tested according to international standards.\u201d The current mishmash of private and public providers of forensic analysis came about in 2012 when the coalition government allowed the loss-making Forensic Science Service to collapse. Now Tully has told the Guardian the service has been \u201con a knife-edge\u201d for years and after seven years the government has failed to deliver on a promise of enforceable standards. * * * Red wall of ill health \u2013 Life expectancy has stalled for the first time in more than 100 years and even reversed for the most deprived women in society as the gap in health equality widens, with austerity largely to blame, according to a review. Health has worsened in many of the \u201cred wall\u201d constituencies in the north of England that backed Brexit and returned Boris Johnson to power by voting Conservative for the first time. For example, in Heywood and Middleton, depression, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease all exceed the England average. And 21% of Heywood and Middleton is classed as \u201chighly deprived\u201d, compared with 0% in the PM\u2019s Uxbridge and South Ruislip constituency. Separately, forecasting shows economies of Britain\u2019s smaller towns are set to fall further behind the biggest cities over the next three years unless greater action is taken. The UK has some of the worst regional economic unbalance of the world\u2019s developed countries, say accountants EY. * * * Covid-19 cases build in Middle East \u2013 Fears are growing that coronavirus has infiltrated a main Muslim pilgrimage route, including the city of Qom, amid increasing alarm that Iranian officials have been slow to realise Covid-19 has taken root. A local news agency in the city tweeted: \u201cDon\u2019t come to Qom and no one should get out of Qom. Qom should be closed. We need a lot of medical help here.\u201d Iranian officials have scrambled to deny 50 deaths in Qom, saying there were 47 infections and 12 deaths across Iran \u201cso far\u201d. In Najaf, Iraq, the Imam Ali mosque was closed and disinfected after a worshipper was found to be infected. There are fears of the virus proliferating because of Iraq\u2019s very weak health system. South Korea is to test 200,000 members of a sect that is believed to be at the centre of that country\u2019s outbreak, while in Japan a fourth passenger form the Diamond Princess cruise ship has died. China says its scientists has developed a vaccine for Covid-19 that has potential for mass production.

While their activities are concerning, they remain a small part of their broader movements and are presently unlikely to lead to wide-scale violence or pose a threat to social cohesion.</p> <p>Violence at protests in Australia is rare, and the vast majority of protest attendees are peaceful and support Australia\u2019s democratic ideals. Social discourse around anti-Islam and anti-migration issues has increased, and public protests have become more frequent. These protests provide an opportunity for ideological adversaries to converge, and sporadic violence can result. Recently, violence at protests has mostly comprised small-scale clashes between right-wing and left-wing opponents at anti-Islam protests, or protesters targeting police maintaining public order.</p> <p>Other groups with overseas separatist agendas are represented in Australia, but their membership is small and their influence is limited.

A very big thank you to everyone who helped me limp along today \u2013 Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp chief among them, as well as everyone else in the Guardian brains trust, including the moderators, for all they do. And of course, to you, for all the light and shade you bring to Politics Live. We\u2019ll be back early tomorrow morning. In the meantime \u2013 take care of you. Someone entered the word \u201cfondles\u201d into the Hansard for the first time, and that person needs to take a good hard look at themselves and their life choices. (This Twitter account tweets each time a new word is entered into the parliamentary record. There is no context, which makes it amusing at the best of times) And from Asio itself: The communal violence threat environment in Australia While Sunni Islamist extremism is the primary terrorist threat facing Australia, other groups continue to engage in politically motivated violence and the promotion of communal violence. These groups are diverse and have differing agendas, including extreme right-wing and extreme left-wing ideologies. Small subsets of individuals in these groups are willing to use violence to further their own interests. While their activities are concerning, they remain a small part of their broader movements and are presently unlikely to lead to wide-scale violence or pose a threat to social cohesion. Violence at protests in Australia is rare, and the vast majority of protest attendees are peaceful and support Australia\u2019s democratic ideals. Social discourse around anti-Islam and anti-migration issues has increased, and public protests have become more frequent. These protests provide an opportunity for ideological adversaries to converge, and sporadic violence can result. Recently, violence at protests has mostly comprised small-scale clashes between right-wing and left-wing opponents at anti-Islam protests, or protesters targeting police maintaining public order. Other groups with overseas separatist agendas are represented in Australia, but their membership is small and their influence is limited. Activities in support of overseas issues are mostly confined to fundraising and ideological support. You\u2019ll notice there that extreme leftwing terrorism is mentioned separately, to Islamist extremism and are included in the sentence starting with OTHER groups. Anne Aly, who was a counter-terrorism expert before she entered parliament responded to Peter Dutton\u2019s comments that left-wing terrorism was Islamic terrorism: The US has upgraded the threat of right wing terrorism. In Germany a right wing terrorist attack has led to an increase in their threat levels And in Australia the head of ASIO has repeated that there is an increased threat from right wing extremists. So which part of right wing extremists does the Minister not understand? He lined up to lecture Muslim communities about calling out violent jihadism calling it Islamic terrorism. Well now it\u2019s his turn to practice what he preached. Will the minister stand side by side with our law enforcement agencies and call out right wing extremism? I\u2019m not holding my breath. The day, as seen by Mike Bowers: Well. Today has taken a turn I did not see coming. Did anyone have \u2018the home affairs minister defines leftwing terrorism as Islamic terrorism\u2019 on their #auspol bingo card? Kristina Keneally, speaking Patricia Karvelas, says she is going to be \u201cgenerous\u201d and \u201csay perhaps the minister didn\u2019t quite understand the question you were posing\u201d. Because if I can reflect to your viewers, that Asio itself makes quite clear that Islamic extremism is, it represents a form of terrorist threat. And that it doesn\u2019t sit upon a left-right continuum. We need to rely upon the advice of our national security agencies here. And as was outlined quite clearly last night in a public address to the nation, that Australia does continue to face a significant threat, it is as probable, as he described, a probable threat of terrorist attack in Australia and he pointed to the two sources that he identifies. \u2026 One being Islamic extremism and it is important to note that that is an extreme form of Islam, not all, of course, adherents of Islam, that needs to be made clear. As well as the, as the director-general pointed out, the growing threat of rightwing extremism in Australia When the Senate gets it right, by Mike Bowers. Peter Dutton didn\u2019t make a mistake when he raised the Islamic reference \u2013 here was the earlier question and answer on that topic: Patricia Karvelas: You have been criticised today for referring to leftwing extremism as well as rightwing extremism. Mike Burgess mentioned rightwing extremism about six times in this speech on threats to Australia. Jenny McAllister raised where did you get your advice on using leftwing extremism given he didn\u2019t mention it? Peter Dutton: You can use Islamic extremist, you get in trouble for using that, you can use leftwing to describe everybody from the left to the right. I said today I don\u2019t care where people are on the spectrum, if they pose a threat to our country and want to do harm to Australians then they are in our sights. I am completely blind to where people are on the spectrum. I just find it such a semantic and nonsense debate if people are involved in a right-wing organisation, they are planning an attack, they are acting outside of the law, they will be treated no differently than somebody who is an Islamic extremist that is planning an attack in the same way. Patricia Karvelas: When you refer to leftwing terrorism do you mean the Islamic groups? Peter Dutton: Yes, I do and anybody in between. I don\u2019t care whether they\u2019re neo-Nazis or they\u2019re part of some cell that\u2019s been involved in a fight in the Middle East or trying to recruit people onshore or fund raise onshore. These are all people that Asio have been interest in and the fact that they have been able to thwart the number of attempts that they have, the fact that they have been able to make arrests and conduct investigations as recently as you point out today indicates that we have a very, very real problem. We have a problem, big problem, with foreign interference as well in our country. We\u2019re making sure that we can support the agencies to deal with that threat so that we can keep Australians safe. Islamic terrorists groups are motivated by religion, not, to my knowledge, leftwing political ideals. Patricia Karvelas pushes Peter Dutton on Afternoon Briefing to explain why he brought up \u201cleftwing\u201d terrorism when Mike Burgess did not mention it. You can use Islamic extremist, you get in trouble for using that, you can use left wing to describe everybody from the left to the right. I said today I don\u2019t care where people are on the spectrum, if they pose a threat to our country and want to do harm to Australians then they are in our sights. I am completely blind to where people are on the spectrum. I just find it such a semantic and nonsense debate if people are involved in a rightwing organisation, they are planning an attack, they are acting outside of the law, they will be treated no differently than somebody who is an Islamic extremist that is planning an attack in the same way. That has been the approach that I have always taken. I think it is such a juvenile distraction. The director-general of Asio pointed out, not just this director-general either, Duncan Lewis before him, the fact that ASIO has been concentrating on rightwing extremist lunatic groups and individuals for literally decades. I just don\u2019t understand why we get bogged down in this language. The bigger issue here is the threat that we face and what we are doing about it and that was the subject of Mr Burgess\u2019 speech last night. On the flip side, the government, Labor, and Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation are all opposing this motion from Sarah Hanson-Young at the moment: I shall move that the Senate: 1. Notes: a. The New South Wales Government has lifted its moratorium on floodplain harvesting and water pumping; b. Water from recent rains has not yet made it down the river and there are still towns without drinking water, dry catchments and storages and fish species facing collapse; c. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority says it is too early to say whether all storages will receive water or if flows will be enough to connect the rivers; d. The Queensland Government has also allowed floodplain harvesting which was criticised by the NSW Government; e. Upstream Basin states making decisions that only benefit them puts the entire river system in jeopardy; f. The Murray-Darling Basin is on the verge of collapse and family farms, river communities and the environment need national leadership. 2. Calls on the NSW Government to reinstate the moratorium on floodplain harvesting and water pumping. This is the next step in this Malcolm Roberts being put in charge of counting two people may be the greatest contribution he has made to Senate business, in his entire career Malcolm Roberts just had the easiest counting job the Senate has ever seen. Ayes: 55 Noes:2 Every single senator, except One Nation are voting for this motion. One Nation, like the cheese, sit alone. This isn\u2019t surprising, given where government MPs have been on this for days now. Pauline Hanson has used the Queensland police as her cover. Jim Chalmers on Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg walking back expectations for a surplus that they created themselves: The surplus is a test that they set for themselves and it remains to be seen whether they will meet that test. We won\u2019t know until the end of September whether there has been a surplus for the year that we\u2019re in now. The Government promised a surplus in its first year and every year after that. So far they\u2019ve only delivered six deficits. They are yet to deliver that first surplus they promised all those years ago. The priority should be supporting bushfire affected communities, businesses and workers and families. We\u2019ve said for some weeks now that that should be the highest priority. The surplus is a test that they set for themselves and it remains to be seen whether they will meet it. I listened carefully to what the Treasurer and Prime Minister said today about the Budget. I think what we\u2019re seeing is the usual predictable, clumsy, ham-fisted expectation management from the Treasurer who seems to wander around expecting a pat on the back for an outcome that has not yet been realized. We will see if it\u2019s realised in September. The New Zealand minister for M\u0101ori development has released this statement: Minister for M\u0101ori Development and Associate Minister for Trade and Export Growth Hon Nanaia Mahuta and Minister for Indigenous Australians, the Hon Ken Wyatt AM, MP will this week sign a collaboration arrangement to deepen the Trans-Tasman working relationship on indigenous issues. It is believed to be the first standalone bilateral arrangement of its kind in the world and aims to promote economic, social and cultural advancement between New Zealand and Australia. The Indigenous Collaboration Arrangement signing between the two Ministers will be held on Friday 28 February at: \u00b7 12:30-12:40pm (TBC) at the residence of the Australian Governor General Admiralty House, 109 Kirribilli Ave, Kirribilli NSW 2061, Sydney, Australia This is coming up in the next 15 minutes or so (from Kristina Keneally and Penny Wong:) I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move that the Senate: Notes that: On the same day that Queensland Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll said it was inappropriate to suggest the murder of a woman and her children by her husband could be an instance of a husband being driven too far, Ms Bettina Arndt, who received an Order of Australia honour in January, nonetheless said\u201dkeeping an open mind and awaiting proper evidence, including the possibility that Rowan Baxter might have been driven too far.\u201d The statement of Ms Arndt has the potential to bring the Order of Australia, instituted by Her Majesty The Queen, into disrepute. Order of Australia awards are a privilege and an honour and come with responsibilities. Agrees that: Ms Arndt\u2019s comments are reckless and abhorrent. The values that underpin Ms Arndt\u2019s views on this horrific family violence incident are not consistent with her retaining her Order of Australia. Question time ends. Richard Marles to Melissa Price: Is the minister\u2019s so-called announcement of a 60% Australian industry content on the future submarine contained in any contract between the Australian government and Naval Group? Price: I recall standing here over a week ago where I clearly outlined that, in the contract, we are in the design phase, and at the end of the design phase we will then be in a position to agree what the AIC contribution was going to be But good news: it\u2019s a great opportunity to talk about it. The good news is that now we have, our own minister for defence, has now met with her French counterpart. And now they have agreed that the AIC in the submarine contract will be no less than 60%. That is good news, Mr Speaker. But what my job, and what our job is on this side of the House, is to make sure that we maximise. Because that is the contractual objective in the contract. We will work hard to ensure that it\u2019s beyond 60%. I repeat, once the design phase is finished, we will then progress to that. But this is incredibly good news and I\u2019m disappointed that the deputy leader of the opposition does not see it for what it is. Meryl Swanson to Scott Morrison: Prime Minister, the community of Williamtown and surrounds in my electorate has been deeply affected by PFAS contamination. When will the prime minister release the government\u2019s response to the report into PFAS contamination, which was tabled in this parliament in December 2018? Morrison: And I thank the member for her question on this very important matter. As you would be aware, the issues surrounding PFAS have been going back over many, many government administrations. They go back over many ... Over this government\u2019s administration, over the previous government\u2019s administration, and many more beyond that, Mr Speaker. This government decided to actually take action on this issue. And as the member would be aware, we are currently engaged in mediation with the parties. Richard Marles to Melissa Price: My question is again to the minister for defence industry: can the minister explain why she counts the work of French language school Adelaide\u2019s Alliance Francaise as local content? These questions are based on this story from the Australian, published last week: Defence says contracts for a French language school, aBarossa Valley resort and the management consultancy that employs former defence minister Christopher Pyne are evidence of Australian industry involvement in the nation\u2019s $80bn Future Submarines program. Defence released a list of 137 \u201csubcontractors\u201d to the submarine project last week to placate local firms after French company Naval Group warned that Australian suppliers might not get 50% of the subs\u2019 contracts. But the list includes just six defence equipment suppliers and 28 engineering or technical services firms, while only about 50 are Australian-owned and operated. The list is dominated by general services businesses, including accountants, travel agents, lawyers, recruiters, hotels, and fleet managers. Price says there are a lot of small- and medium-sized businesses that will benefit from the submarine contract. She finishes with this: We are committed to the submarine program, on time, on budget, and on spec. It\u2019s already delayed, and the costs have already blown out. Vincent Connelly continues to be possessed by the ghost of a community theatre thespian who was doomed to serve as a stage hand and spent every performance in the wings, acting out the lead actor\u2019s lines. Richard Marles to Melissa Price: Can the minister explain why she counts nights in the Novotel Barossa Valley Resort as Australian industry content for the future submarines? Narrator: she could not. Peter Dutton in the \u201cHow safe are you\u201d dixer once again \u201cboth sides\u201d the terrorism threat. Mike Burgess mentioned \u201crightwing extremism\u201d six times in his annual speech on threats to Australia. He did not mention \u201cleftwing\u201d extremism or terrorism at all. And yet: Dutton: Whether it\u2019s the United Kingdom, the United States, France, anywhere in the world where we\u2019ve seen these people act out, there is the capacity for these people, whether they\u2019re on the right wing, whether they\u2019re on the left wing, anywhere in between \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter. It doesn\u2019t matter, Mr Speaker. The fact is that we will deal with that threat, and we will make sure of that ... Well, it\u2019s funny that the Labor party should interject, because they cut money from Asio. And if you think we\u2019re going to take a lecture from those people who, on 19 occasions, when we\u2019ve introduced legislation to support Asio and the federal police, they\u2019ve opposed it, Mr Speaker. Or they\u2019ve sought to water it down. And when they were in government, they cut money from Asio. So, I don\u2019t take a lecture from the Labor party. They want the public to believe that there is no difference between the Labor party and the Coalition when it comes to border protection or national security. They are weak on both. And we know that the previous leader of the opposition was particularly weak when it came to border protection.This guy, with his glass jaw, takes the cake. Watch him in question time. He has a glass jaw and he demonstrates it every day. The inspector general of the Australian defence force\u2019s 2018-19 annual report has been tabled in the Senate and reveals new details of the investigation it has been conducting into Australian special forces\u2019 conduct in Afghanistan. After interviewing 338 witnesses, the inspector general has revealed \u201cthere were 55 separate incidents or issues under inquiry covering a range of alleged breaches of the law of armed conflict, predominantly unlawful killings of persons who were non-combatants or were no longer combatants, but also \u2018cruel treatment\u2019 of such persons\u201d. It said: The inquiry is also examining incidents relevant to the organisational, operational and cultural environment which may have enabled the alleged law of armed conflict breaches. The inquiry is not focused on decisions made during the \u2018heat of battle\u2019. Rather, its focus is the treatment of persons who were clearly non-combatants or who were no longer combatants.\u201d The inspector general said the inquiry \u201cis now approaching the final stages of evidence-taking\u201d. The inspector general described its task as \u201cvery difficult\u201d because the investigation was prompted by \u201cvague rumours\u201d of wrongdoing and it had taken time to gain the confidence of special forces who have spent their career \u201cin an environment in which secrecy is treated as fundamental\u201d. The inspector general has committed to report to the chief of the defence force with a conclusion about whether the laws of armed conflict were breached. It suggested this might provide \u201cclosure\u201d to serving and former soldiers and special operations command \u201cby exposing past misconduct where appropriate to do so, enabling it to be considered separate from but informing the present and future development of the command\u201d. Scott Morrison: I was referring specifically to the report I cited in my earlier answer. In that report, it says, \u201cIn one instance, ministers explicitly decided to waive the project eligibility criteria for an application they wish to fund. The awarding of funding to projects also disproportionately favoured ALP-held seats,\u201d Mr Speaker. It went on to say, \u201cThe minister\u2019s office did not make any records outlining the extent to which each application had been assessed or how the application was ranked in respect to other competing applications.\u201d Mr Speaker, what I am aware of is that the Leader of the Opposition threw the rule book away when he ran projects for infrastructure when he was the minister. How dare he come here and throw mud, when he\u2019s covered in it himself? Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is to the Prime Minister: And I refer to his misleading of Parliament in a previous answer. Isn\u2019t it a fact that the evidence given by the Australian National Audit Office to the Senate Committee referred to section 4.32 and 4.33 of the Audit Office report that indicate that 272 ineligible projects were funded? (He got there for this one, with 10 seconds to spare) Morrison: I note the member has asked me a question in relation to my earlier answer. And in my earlier answer, I made reference to the Audit Report findings in relation to the program administered by the member for Grayndler, Mr Speaker. So, let me speak a little to those matters. As he\u2019s introduced that into his question, Mr Speaker. That project, it said in the report, eligibility and compliance checking process was developed by the department, but was abandoned partway through. Its implementation was not replaced with an alternative. \u201cProjects located in electorates held by... The Labor side of the house gets very loud, and Albanese raises a point of order on relevance. Tony Smith: The Leader of the Opposition can resume his seat. I get his gist. ...I\u2019m just going to make two points, because I listened... I don\u2019t like people interjecting. You just saw with the previous question from the member for Mallee, because it\u2019s my job to listen very closely. Now, the Leader of the Opposition making statements about misleading - you know, that\u2019s a very sort of abject term. And, of course, if he wanted to pursue that, he would need to pursue that by way of a motion of deliberately misleading, which he well knows. Even asking a question about a minister, or a prime minister, \u201cmisleading\u201d does open things up. That opens things up for a minister or prime minister to defend themselves. That\u2019s the first point. Defend themselves. And there\u2019s lots of precedent with that. The other thing I listened to very closely, because I have allowed - it is reference to a previous answer, as I have made in previous rulings, that doesn\u2019t... It does open the door, but it doesn\u2019t open it to an extent, as the member for Isaacs discovered, that you can just, by merely stating that, go to any matter you wish to. But I listened very carefully to the Prime Minister, who said he would refer to that on that basis \u201ca little\u201d. So, I\u2019ve - listening to him, and the Prime Minister is able to do that briefly by way of comparison Anthony Albanese doesn\u2019t get his question to Scott Morrison out in time: And I refer to his previous answer, where he again misled the parliament when he said there was nothing in the audit office report that contradicted his previous statement to the parliament. I refer him to sections 4.32 and 4.33 of the report, which says: \u201cIn addition to program ineligibility, this situation suggests, particularly in respect of the eight completed projects so selected for funding under the program may not have required \u2013 the Australian government funding to deliver the project ... So we move on to a dixer. David Littleproud somehow manages to mess up his own dixer, and is pulled into line by Tony Smith for answering a question he was not asked. The minister will resume his seat for a second. No, your microphone is off for a sec. I\u2019m just gonna say to the minister, I refer him to what I\u2019ve said about the ability to briefly compare and contrast. I\u2019m glad I listened to the question. No, I can see the prime minister ... I can tell the prime minister and others, what was actually asked did not include alternatives. And I listened very closely to the question. I have a transcript of it here. Let me be blunt. I\u2019m not sure it was planned, but I know what was asked. And the minister was not asked for alternatives. So, he needs to confine himself to the question, which was: \u201cGiven the significant changes facing the agriculture sector as a result of drought and bushfires, how is the government backing industry during difficult times?\u201d And it ended with the words \u201cdifficult times\u201d. This is still for sale in the Liberal party store It appears to be as \u201climited edition\u201d as the surplus itself. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: The prime minister has now had more than one full sitting day to correct his misleading of the parliament that only eligible projects were funded under his sports rorts scheme. Why has he failed to correct the record when the auditor general has given evidence to the Senate that his claim is just not true? That, in fact, 43% is the correct figure? Morrison: I thank the member for his questions. And the comments that I made on that matter were made on the basis of the information that was available to me from the ANAO report ... Mr Speaker, that ANAO report, at the time of my making that comment, Mr Speaker, made only one reference \u2013 one reference \u2013 to ineligible projects, as best as I\u2019m aware, on page nine. It said: \u2018No applications assessed as ineligible were awarded grant funding.\u2019 And that point was reiterated by the ANAO during the committee hearing. When speaking to the committee on Thursday 13 February, in response to a question from Senator Canavan, \u201cWas there a project that received funding that was assessed as ineligible by Sports Australia?\u201d Mr Speaker, the answer to that was: \u201cNo. \u201cThat\u2019s what the ANAO responded to in relation to that matter. And I would refer the ANAO report to the leader of the opposition, and he will not find in that report anything to contradict the statement that I made at that time, Mr Speaker, relying on that report. For context, none of the projects Sports Australia put forward were ineligible. But the minister\u2019s office took so long to approve the grants, that by the time funding was awarded (using the ministerial discretion) projects had become ineligible. And we know that the minister rejected Sports Australia\u2019s recommendations to decide on her own funding priorities. Which were in marginal and targeted seats. So none of the projects put forward by Sports Australia were ineligible. But that didn\u2019t mean that none of the funded projects were ineligible. Angus Taylor is playing his favourite game of \u201ccherrypicking the emissions reductions numbers\u201d as a dixer. Here is what is actually happening: There are so many backbenchers who unmask themselves as the worst sort of teacher\u2019s pets in their delivery. Tracy Flick could take lessons. Mark Butler to Scott Morrison: Is the prime minister critical of the New South Wales government for committing to net-zero emissions by 2050? Morrison: We\u2019re working with the NSW government. We\u2019re working with the NSW government. And just a few weeks ago, the premier and I stood together and we agreed a plan, some $2bn, to invest in what is happening in NSW and in Australia, to achieve important targets, Mr Speaker. And we have a plan. See, that\u2019s the thing, Mr Speaker. That\u2019s what the leader of the opposition doesn\u2019t understand. He doesn\u2019t have a plan, he just has some sort of vague commitment to something 30 years from now. See, I\u2019m happy to work with the NSW government, because they have a plan and we have a plan, and together we\u2019re implementing that plan. Michael McCormack is doing his leadership impersonation, but despite his characterisation of his own reviews, the crowd is not rolling in the aisles. Needs improvement. Probably not the smartest attack line, given Scott Morrison\u2019s stated mission to improve mental health, suicide rates, and child welfare in this country. Josh Frydenberg mocks the \u201cwellbeing budget\u201d Jim Chalmers has spoken on (which has been adopted by New Zealand). There\u2019s a very innovative approach from the member for Rankin, who likes to tax a lot, Mr Speaker. His very innovative approach, Mr Speaker, which, when he was burnishing his leadership credentials the other day at the Australia Institute, is to deliver a \u2018wellbeing budget\u2019, Mr Speaker. A \u2018wellbeing budget\u2019. Gone are the days of measuring GDP, gone are the days of measuring unemployment, gone are the days of lower taxes and balanced budgets, Mr Speaker. What are you gonna get from the member for Rankin\u2019s \u2018wellbeing budget\u2019, Mr Speaker? Double the hugs and triple the taxes, Mr Speaker. Double the hugs and triple the taxes, Mr Speaker. Now when Labor hasn\u2019t delivered a balanced budget since 1989, when the Berlin Wall was still standing, of course you\u2019ve gotta look for something else to measure, Mr Speaker. And we know the member for Rankin was co-architect with the member for McMahon in $387bn of higher taxes. Only the Coalition could be trusted to create a stronger economy and more jobs.\u201d Good to know that the wellbeing of the Australian public is considered such a laughable matter by the treasurer. Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg: Why won\u2019t the treasurer admit that since he took over, economic growth has almost halved, wages growth has stalled, consumption growth has weakened, business investment and productivity have declined, underemployment has increased, government debt and household debt have reached new record highs, and that all of this happened before the fires and the coronavirus hit? \u201cGive us a hug! Come over here for a hug!\u201d Labor MPs yell (I would bet the drawer full of chocolate I have one of these came from Ed Husic.) Frydenberg: Mr Speaker, where\u2019s the member for Rankin when you need a hug in this place, Mr Speaker? Where is the member for Rankin? He\u2019s sitting across from you, minister. Frydenberg: Now, the member for Rankin mentioned unemployment, Mr Speaker ... (Yadda, yadda, yadda, when Labor was in power etc ...) Mr Speaker, I can inform the House that in January of this year, when ... that the IMF has said that Australia\u2019s economic growth will be higher than the United States\u2019, higher than the United Kingdom, higher than France, higher than Germany, higher than Japan, higher than Canada in 2020 and 2021. Mr Speaker, the facts tell the story that the Australian economy has grown on the Coalition\u2019s watch, Mr Speaker. More small businesses are being created. More people have found jobs and, importantly, we have delivered lower taxes, Mr Speaker. More than $300bn of lower taxes have passed through the parliament. Only the Coalition can be trusted to deliver a stronger economy and more jobs. Josh Frydenberg still doesn\u2019t know how to use a microphone, however he has discovered an octave only dogs can hear, so six of one. We are back on the \u201cIs the minister aware of any alternative approaches\u201d dixer train and the five molars I have ground down with stress fractures from gritting my teeth so hard over the past couple of years are less painful than this. Richard Marles and Peter Dutton have a slanging match across the chamber as Scott Morrison finishes that answer, which is as useful as looking for meaning in a Justin Bieber song. Richard Marles to Scott Morrison: Last night the director general of Asio said the extreme rightwing threat in Australia is real and it\u2019s growing. Also last night, the UK government prescribed additional rightwing extremist groups. Why has the Australian government not listed a single rightwing extremist group as a terrorist organisation? Morrison: It is this government that restored the funding to our intelligence agencies, our border protection authorities, that those opposite, when they were in government, stripped out and left Australians vulnerable on their watch. In 2013, Mr Speaker, this government came to office to keep Australians safe, and no government has invested more and applied itself more to give those who are working on counterterrorism in this country the resources they need to go after those who would seek to do Australians harm. That includes rightwing extremists, Mr Speaker. That includes Islamic terrorists \u2013 extremist Islamic terrorists, Mr Speaker. Whatever their cause of hate, whatever their motivation to do Australians harm, this government is standing up to them with the resources and the commitments and the legislation and the powers and the tools that those opposite never had the stomach to put in place. And on each occasion, Mr Speaker, it would seem that every time we\u2019ve sought to get stronger national security legislation achieved in this place, those opposite have sought to water it down. Scott Morrison is continuing the managing of expectations over the budget surplus it says it has already delivered, but has not \u2013 and may not \u2013 because of outside influences. It\u2019s true to say, Mr Speaker, that the Australian people, the Australian economy, has had its fair share of damaging impacts, particularly in recent times and in recent years, Mr Speaker. And we certainly don\u2019t need any more. We are not immune from these things, but, Mr Speaker, we are well prepared. And our government, over the course of the last six years, has been ensuring that as we go into these very difficult crises that we have been managing in recent times, that our sensible and disciplined economic management has been putting Australia in the best possible place to deal with these types of crises. And, Mr Speaker, when we do things in a disciplined and responsible way, we think them through. Where we have goals to create jobs, we have plans to create jobs, and we implement those plans to create jobs, Mr Speaker. When we say and we go to the Australian people and we say we\u2019ve got record funding to put in schools and hospitals and to fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme, we have the careful, disciplined budget management so the Australian people know we can deliver on those commitments, which we are, Mr Speaker. That\u2019s what careful, disciplined, responsible economic management is based on.\u201d Chris Bowen to Greg Hunt: There are Australian survivors, including one pleading with the government to respond to the parliamentary report into Australia thalidomide tragedy before more survivors die. Why hasn\u2019t the prime minister responded to this report which was handed down in March last year? Hunt: I\u2019m actually very pleased to receive this question. It\u2019s a matter of extreme importance. No government in the last 50 years has taken it as seriously as us. Those Australians who suffered from thalidomide and all of the consequences were given a grave injustice. On my watch, in my time, on our watch, in our time, it is our goal to do what no government has previously done. And that is to ensure that there is justice, that there is an apology, that there is vindication, and that there is support going forward. I note \u2013 I heard an interjection from the member for Maribyrnong. This is an issue for which he did not provision for at the election. Having said that, we are now working very carefully through a once-in-a-generation response to an issue which has not been dealt with previously by any Australian government in any systemic fashion over 50 years. And we will provide that response in a way that no other government has ever done. And as I said, I note that, given the opportunity to make a provision for this, the opposition did not. The member for Maribyrnong, as leader, did not. The shadow minister, as shadow treasurer, did not. But we will take steps to do what no government has ever done, and we are working through that calmly and carefully and appropriately to deliver justice to those thalidomide victims who have never before been given that justice. You\u2019ll note that Hunt just blamed the opposition for not coming up with a response to a report it has had, as the government, since March last year. It\u2019s the downhill slide to QT. Today\u2019s topics should be a pretty easy guess. Equinor is the third major company to pull out of the Great Australian Bight. BP abandoned its plans in 2016. Chevron followed suit in 2017. That these are commercial decisions tells you everything you need to know about where the fossil fuel industry is heading. Resources minister Keith Pitt has responded to Equinor\u2019s decision to pull out of the Great Australian Bight: The discussions I\u2019ve had with Equinor indicated this is purely a commercial decision. There are no other influences at all. It is quite simply a suppressed world oil price, a look at the risk ... The Great Australian Bight is a frontier exploration area. It is challenging. It is costly. Those companies make a decision based on a potential return. And I completely understand why they\u2019ve made the decision. Regardless, it is disappointing for Australia. That sound you hear is Wayne Swan\u2019s satisfied sigh as he places his whisky class back down on his desk. Scott Morrison was asked whether or not he believed Australians would forgive him for not delivering the surplus he already said he delivered (if indeed, that is what happens): What the Australian people are looking for as we deal with this crisis \u2013 as we\u2019ve dealt with many others others in recent times \u2013 is the calm, measured, information- and fact-based approach, being upfront and honest with the Australian people about what we see every single day. The chief medical officer has been doing that on a daily basis with his counterparts now for many weeks. I think Australians are better placed, I\u2019d argue, than most anyone in the world today in understanding what is happening in their own country when it comes to how these issues are being managed. So we\u2019re just going to calmly, maturely, soberly, continue to deal with these issues. The budget will be brought down in May: it will contain the information as we know it at the time. But Australia would not have been as well prepared for dealing with these series of crises that we have been dealing with now for months were it not for the calm, sober, and methodical financial discipline that we have put in place over the last six years. We didn\u2019t rush to any panic solutions or panicked options. I remember last year, people last year \u2013 in October, in August, in September, telling us to splash money around. On goodness knows what. We kept our heads at that point, and we\u2019ve kept our heads as we\u2019re continuing to move through these crises now. And we\u2019ll continue to keep our heads because that\u2019s what the Australian people elected us to do. Government MPs have met in Canberra, with the partyroom discussion focused on the ramifications of the coronavirus on a range of industries, including tourism, education and trade. But the prime minister, Scott Morrison, told MPs that while the effects will be \u201ctough\u201d, the virus did not give the government a \u201cleave pass\u201d to not act on the other issues that Australians expected the government to be focused on, such as aged care. MPs were also assured by the health minister, Greg Hunt, that the government had a \u201cpandemic plan ready to go\u201d if it was required. One MP urged that no taxpayer-funded bail-outs be provided to the university sector to compensate for the impact of the virus, saying universities were well placed to absorb the cost. Morrison used the warning about the economic consequences of the rapidly spreading virus to criticise Labor for adopting the target of net zero emissions by 2050. \u201cGiven the economic challenge, Labor\u2019s reckless approach on the economy is particularly troubling, signing up to a target with no knowledge of what it would cost,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t commit to anything that I don\u2019t know the cost of, if I don\u2019t know the impact on jobs. It is not about being for or against the target. The leader of the opposition has got no plan; he has got no clue what the impact would be.\u201d Morrison said the government needed to know the cost before making a decision on targets, while also criticising Labor for not yet outlining its 2030 target. \u201cThe question is what will Labor do in 2030 if elected? What measures will they have in agriculture and transport? And they can\u2019t answer those questions.\u201d Morrison, however, did concede that Australians wanted \u201cjobs and lower emissions\u201d. \u201cThey want both, and we have a plan for both,\u201d he said. MPs also discussed other issues, including the costs of passenger security screening for regional airports and the government\u2019s bushfire response. It\u2019s almost like sometimes there are things governments can\u2019t control when it comes to its budgets, and you can make promises and not deliver? *cough global financial crisis cough* Scott Morrison says there is no way the government could have predicted the coronavirus last year. The government has not said it will be delivering a surplus, but, as we have been saying for months now, the language has changed from when Morrison said this in May last year: \u201cI said we brought the budget back to surplus next year.\u201d Morrison now: What we\u2019ve noted about the impact of this global virus is that the information changes almost every day, both on the clinical side as well as what we\u2019re learning about the economic impacts. The duration of what the impact of this virus will be, and its impact around the global economy, is also not known at this point. So, again, we can respond to questions where the answer is known in relation to that matter. We\u2019ll obviously, at this point \u2013 those variables can\u2019t be fully considered and, by the time we get to the ... I haven\u2019t finished my response yet. Settle down. What I\u2019m saying is: we will deal with that at the time of the budget. Now, when we framed the budget a year ago, I mean \u2013 hands up those who thought there was going to be a coronavirus epidemic when the budget was released last May. Of course no one did. These are unknown global shocks. So we\u2019re dealing with those shocks and we\u2019re processing that through how we look at the budget as we go into May and beyond. Is the government still able to guarantee a surplus? Scott Morrison: As we work through this crisis, what we\u2019ve been seeking to do \u2013 and I\u2019d encourage others to do the same \u2013 speculation doesn\u2019t help anybody. Information and facts do. When we stand here before you and we talk about these matters, what we\u2019ll relay is the information and the facts that we have. We\u2019re not going to speculate on these matters. We\u2019ve got a process that we\u2019re working through to consider the economic impacts, but also to continue to look at those ways that we can seek to alleviate some of those impacts where we can. But that is not a simple exercise because the impacts are economy-wide. Josh Frydenberg says the impact of coronavirus (now officially called Covid-19) will be \u201cmore significant than the bushfires\u201d. Not only that, its impact will be broader: Treasury have told me they haven\u2019t finalised their advice on the economic impact of the virus. They say there\u2019s considerable uncertainty around what exactly that impact will be, but they are continuing their discussions with the key players in the economy who are impacted. But the message is very clear: the impact will be more significant than the bushfires, and it plays out more broadly across the Australian economy. Stepping out of federal politics for a moment, WA\u2019s Labor treasurer, Ben Wyatt, has announced he will not seek re-election in March next year. Josh Frydenberg continues: As the prime minister referred to, I have been talking to people in the building industry who have expressed concern about their ability to get product in the event that the Chinese factories remain closed for a period of time. Our message today is that the Australian economy is remarkably resilient. It is in its 29th consecutive year of economic growth. In fact, that was something that was marvelled upon by other nations at the G20 meeting in Riyadh. We\u2019ve seen our labour market remain relatively strong in recent months. We have seen more than 1.5m jobs being created. We have seen our housing market stabilised; we have seen strong export volumes and our commodity prices have held up as well, even in the event of the coronavirus. So, Australia, with its AAA credit rating, in its 29th consecutive year of economic growth, with our economic plan that we continue to implement, will continue to see Australia remain strong, despite the economic challenges we face. Josh Frydenberg is once again lowering expectations for the budget, laying out the impacts to the budget over the past year or so. That surplus the government promised in the next financial year is looking as increasingly shaky as the grammar used to describe it: The Australian economy has been facing a number of economic shocks that have been beyond our control. The trade tensions between the United States and China, the ongoing drought, the fires, the flood and now the impact of the coronavirus. At the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors\u2019 meeting in Riyadh, the issue about the impact of the coronavirus was the top priority. There were concerns expressed about the shutters going up on the global economy and it wasn\u2019t just those countries that were geographically approximate to China, namely Singapore, Japan and Korea, but it was also economies in countries further afield, like Italy, that were feeling the effects. The International Monetary Fund has stated that they see \u2013 and, of course, this is preliminary work \u2013 that the impact on the global economy will be about 0.1 of a percentage point in the year 2020. That would see the IMF\u2019s forecast for global growth come down from 3.3 down to 3.2%. Here in Australia, the economic impacts have been significant, as the prime minister referred to, not just the tourism and education sectors, which together contribute around $16 billion to the Australian economy, but also agriculture, and the destruction to end-to-end supply chains. The prime minister is giving an update to the Covid-19 situation in Australia: The evidence of that has been demonstrated in these many weeks now that have passed since the coronavirus has become an even more significant issue as each week has passed. We are learning more and more about the virus and the government\u2019s decisions from the outset have been exercising an abundance of caution. That abundance of caution, I think, has been rewarded in the outcomes that we have so far been able to achieve. But we\u2019re not complacent going forward. So far, our measures have proved to be effective. I can confirm that of the 15 cases that had previously been identified here in Australia that were sourced from Wuhan, all 15 of those patients have now been discharged and have overcome the virus. There are, as you know, seven other \u2013 what the chief medical officer \u2013 advises me are mild cases from the passengers on the Diamond Princess and they are the only remaining cases that we have in Australia today. I note that there are some 30,000 Australians \u2013 and more \u2013 and Australian residents and close family members and others who have arrived under the existing travel bans since 1 February of this year. As you know, there were exemptions put in place for those Australians and those other groups. There has been not human-to-human transmission of the virus outside of the groups that I mentioned before, from the Diamond Princess and the group that came from Wuhan. So, outside of those groups, there has been no human-to-human transmission in Australia. Sarah Hanson-Young on Equinor\u2019s decision: The decision of oil giant Equinor to pull out and dump its plans for oil drilling in South Australia\u2019s gorgeous Great Australian Bight is a huge win for South Australia. A massive win for the community, for the environment, and our fishing and tourism industries. This had been a long-fought fight. Thousands of people were involved in sending a very clear message to this foreign company that we didn\u2019t want them in South Australia. We didn\u2019t want them ruining our beautiful beaches and destroying our coastline. It\u2019s quite clear that South Australians want to protect the Great Australian Bight. They want to give it world heritage protection. The best thing the government can do now is to embrace the community sentiment to back world heritage protection and to celebrate how good our bight is. South Australia has a very positive future. A fishing and tourism industry, a renewable energy industry that can power not just our state, but the whole country into the future. This age-old dirty oilfield proposal was never going to fly. The company, of course, had said that it pulled out because it just doesn\u2019t stack up commercially. It didn\u2019t stack up with community sentiment, didn\u2019t stack up with the environment and it doesn\u2019t stack up economically. Labor\u2019s position to adopt a net zero emissions target by 2050 was discussed in a meeting of MPs in Canberra on Tuesday. One MP asked how the party ensured it kept the focus on the \u201cjobs and opportunities\u201d that come with climate action. Anthony Albanese talked about state governments and the number of organisations that already supported carbon neutrality by 2050, highlighting the position as creating \u201cmore jobs, cheaper power, and lower emissions\u201d. \u201cThe truth is, many in the government want to support net zero but because of the division in the government they cannot,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cThe challenge to debate Scott Morrison on climate is a challenge that will be repeated. If Morrison had confidence in his arguments he wouldn\u2019t always avoid debates.\u201d He said there was both a challenge and opportunity for \u201can enormous amount of jobs\u201d, pointing to a hydrogen hub in Fremantle, a solar plan in Gladstone to power an aluminium refinery, and the take-up of solar panels in Blacktown. \u201cPeople are choosing cheaper energy with renewables.\u201d Another also mentioned remarks made by Peter Dutton about there being both left- and right-wing extremists, saying rightwing extremism was not a \u201cpolitical label\u201d, it was a term used by security agencies. Labor MPs also discussed legislation before parliament, with MPs deciding to wait for Senate committee reports before deciding a final position on the government\u2019s proposed bill to ban cash transactions over $10,000 and legislation that will allow workers to opt out of superannuation funds nominated in their workplace deals. It will also wait until court action on a proposed site for medical nuclear waste is concluded before considering its position on legislation to establish the new dump site near Kimba, which was voted on by the local council. A decision on a Greens bill to include a climate trigger in the EPBC Act will also be deferred until it is examined by a Senate committee. The prime minister has called a press conference in the blue room for 12.40. That\u2019s the second most important press conference location. The bells are ringing. What insanity will greet us today? Who knows? This is the Australian parliament, where insanity is considered a political strategy. Cue the immediate outcry of politicians capitulating to PC warriors, and influencing independent processes if the Order of Australia board, which as Sam Maiden reported yesterday is reviewing the honour, agrees it should be stripped. Just a reminder: a Senate motion doesn\u2019t mean she will lose it. Just that the Senate thinks she should. Sarah Hanson-Young is celebrating the Equinor decision to pull out of its $200m Great Australian Bight drilling plans: South Australians love our gorgeous bight and we want it protected for future generations and the rest of the world to come and experience. What we need now is world heritage protection. The Greens\u2019 bill for world heritage listing would give the bight the protection it needs and deserves from any other oil and gas companies proposing to put it at risk. I call on all other members of parliament to back it. This decision also shows this is the beginning of the end of fossil fuels. Opening a new fossil fuel basin in the middle of our ocean was always madness. Moving to net zero emissions by 2050 means we must reduce pollution now, not give the green light to new polluting projects. Hello good people of blogs, just grabbing the quiet time on Tuesday to let you know that Anthony Albanese has written to Scott Morrison proposing a service to mark the first anniversary on 15 March of the Christchurch shootings. The Albanese letter reads: \u201cAustralia and New Zealand have long enjoyed a close relationship \u2013 one of kinship and shared history. The fact that an Australian citizen is facing trial for launching those violent attacks on Christchurch mosques that killed 51 people and injured some 49 others is a sorrowful aspect of that shared history.\u201d Albanese continues: While there are many ways that Australia could mark the first anniversary of this sad day, I urge you to hold a national, multi-faith service on Sunday 15 March 2020. I recommend that the service be held in either Sydney or Melbourne, in recognition of the largest Muslim populations in Australia. Obviously this suggestion from the Labor leader comes in the context of a brisk debate that\u2019s broken out here this morning about violence by left- or right-wing extremists (triggered by Peter Dutton\u2019s both sides-ism this morning in response to a speech from the Asio boss). The party room meetings are on as we write this, so things are a little quiet. We\u2019ll bring you what happened inside, once they are out Keith Pitt\u2019s office is all over the Equinor announcement: Minister for Resources, Water and Northern Australia Keith Pitt says the decision by Norwegian-based energy company Equinor to discontinue its oil exploration program in the Great Australian Bight, offshore from South Australia, is disappointing but the company is not leaving Australia. \u201cEquinor has made it clear this was a commercial decision and the company will continue to be part of the Australian oil and gas industry,\u201d Minister Pitt said. \u201cI know many will find Equinor\u2019s decision not to proceed with this oil exploration project in the Great Australian Bight extremely disappointing, and it is particularly hard for South Australia. \u201cThe Liberals and Nationals government remains committed to encouraging the safe development of Australia\u2019s offshore petroleum resources, which is overseen by a world-class independent regulator in the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (Nopsema). \u201cThe Bight Basin remains one of Australia\u2019s frontier basins and any proposals for new oil and gas fields in this area will be assessed fairly and independently.\u201d This is pretty big, given the fight to stop this in the first place: Norwegian fossil fuel company Equinor has abandoned its plans to drill in the Great Australian Bight. That follows BHP pulling out in 2016. Why? The company says it doesn\u2019t make commercial sense for it to continue the operation, despite being given approval late last year. However, we ARE preserving Holdens as historical artifact. This is the June 2019 recommendation Tim Watts was speaking about, from the Australian taskforce to combat terrorist and extreme violent material online report: Recommendation 4.3 \u2014 Relevant Australian government agencies, academia, researchers, and civil society bodies that monitor and review terrorist and extremist organisations to share with digital platforms (where legally and operationally feasible) indicators of terrorism, terrorist products and depictions of violent crimes. But we know that \u201clefties\u201d are often on Peter Dutton\u2019s mind. Tim Watts continued: Again the government is unable to point to a single initiative it is pursuing to achieve this, instead it points to its taskforce to combat terrorist and extreme violent material online report and tells us that this is all the platform\u2019s responsibility. But the taskforce last met in June 2019 \u2013 there have been no public progress reports since. Nor has there been a \u2018testing event\u2019 simulating government and industry responses to a terrorist scenario per recommendation 4.1 of the taskforce report. There\u2019s been no funding of research to better understand and prevent white nationalist radicalisation online in Australia. The Department of Home Affairs tells us that it supports the expansion of the global internet forum to counter terrorism, an industry-led initiative to help smaller platforms vet extremist content. So then why isn\u2019t Australia a member of its advisory committee, which is the only way that states can exercise influence? We don\u2019t know whether a single far-right organisation has been shared with online service providers \u2013 consistent with recommendation 4.3 of the taskforce report? Rightwing terror is increasing and it was an Australian \u2013 almost one year ago \u2013 that was responsible for a historically obscene massacre. We need to be doing much more to prevent it ever happening again. Labor MP Tim Watts spoke on the far-right extremism threat in Australia last night in the chamber: The government also says it\u2019s spent just under $6m a year on countering violent extremism programs since 2013-14. However, both funding streams are directed at \u2018all potential drivers of radicalisation to violence\u2019 and it\u2019s unclear how much, if any, of this is targeting those at risk of far-right and white nationalist narratives. The government also claims its social cohesion package responds to this commitment \u2013 but the programs funded under this package are overwhelmingly for promoting the inclusion of multicultural communities, not targeting those at risk of white nationalist propaganda. Watts also spoke on what Australia has done in regards to the \u2018Christchurch call\u2019, which was put in place after the Christchurch massacre and is designed to have governments work with social media and internet platforms to \u2018counter violent extremism in all its forms including through the development and promotion of positive alternatives and counter-messaging\u2019. In response the Department of Home Affairs tells us that it \u2018undertakes a range of activities to promote positive alternatives and counter the messaging depicted in violent extremist propaganda\u2019. A \u2018range of activities\u2019 the government couldn\u2019t even give a single example of anything they were doing in this space. My colleague Josh Taylor asked who nominated the not-an-actual-psychologist for an Australia Day honour. You\u2019re not allowed to know. While we are on the topic of rightwing extremism it is worth pointing out that overnight, the UK added another rightwing group to its terrorism list: A neo-Nazi group is to become the second extreme rightwing outfit to be banned as a terrorist organisation in the UK, the home secretary has announced. Sonnenkrieg Division (SKD), members of which have been jailed for serious offences, is to be proscribed, making membership of the group illegal and punishable by up to 10 years in prison, Priti Patel said. Another order will recognise the extreme rightwing group System Resistance Network as an alias of the already proscribed neo-Nazi organisation National Action. Having a look at Australia\u2019s list, we have listed exactly none. That is despite both Duncan Lewis, the former Asio boss, and now Mike Burgess, both pointing out the growing rightwing extremism threat in Australia. Budget crunch time is coming. Andrew Tillett, from the Australian Financial Review, had this story which points to just how hard balancing the budget is proving for the government: A cash-strapped Morrison government is considering leasing warships to alleviate an upcoming budget crunch for the defence department as construction gets under way on a slew of multibillion-dollar projects. Finance minister Mathias Cormann has told defence companies to come up with \u2018innovative\u2019 financing proposals if they want the green light for new military hardware. It was Barnaby Joyce\u2019s favourite morning of the year: the pollies v press touch football match. The politicians lost. In his speech, Mike Burgess mentions \u201cright wing\u201d six times. He does not mention left wing at all. Rightwing extremism has been in Asio\u2019s sights for some time, but obviously this threat came into sharp, terrible focus last year in New Zealand. In Australia, the extreme rightwing threat is real and it is growing. In suburbs around Australia, small cells regularly meet to salute Nazi flags, inspect weapons, train in combat and share their hateful ideology. These groups are more organised and security conscious than they were in previous years. We continue to see some Australian extremists seeking to connect with like-minded individuals in other parts of the world, sometimes in person. They are not merely seeking to share ideology and tactics. Earlier this year, Asio advice led to an Australian being stopped from leaving the country to fight with an extreme rightwing group on a foreign battlefield. While these are small in number at this time in comparison to what we saw with foreign fighters heading to the Middle East, any development like this is very concerning. Meanwhile, extreme rightwing online forums such as the Base proliferate on the internet, and attract international memberships, including from Australians. These online forums share and promote extremist right wing ideologies, and encourage and justify acts of extreme violence. We expect such groups will remain an enduring threat, making more use of online propaganda to spread their messages of hate. While we would expect any rightwing extremist-inspired attack in Australia to be low capability, ie a knife, gun or vehicle attack, more sophisticated attacks are possible. And we also need to be mindful of state-sponsored terrorism as states seek to use terrorism to further their goals. This dispersal of the terrorist threat and the range of actions they might choose to carry out will continue to complicate our efforts to combat the threat they pose. We will need to continue to monitor a threat spectrum that stretches from self-radicalising lone actors across the range of extremist ideologies through to experienced terrorists associated with long standing extremist groups. And here is the question and answer which gave us the \u201cboth sides\u201d answer from Peter Dutton, in response to Asio boss Mike Burgess\u2019s comments about growing rightwing extremism threats in Australia: Q: Just on the question of blindness to ideology, the director general made some pretty specific comments about rightwing extremism. It\u2019s coming up to the anniversary of the Christchurch terrorist attack. Do you need to acknowledge that there is a particular and growing threat from rightwing extremism in Australia? Dutton: Well, I think, again, we made the point when [Duncan] Lewis was the director general that Asio has been working on rightwing extremism literally for decades in our country. And I just don\u2019t care honestly \u2013 you can portray me in whatever way you like. If somebody is going to cause harm to Australians, I just don\u2019t care whether they\u2019re on the far right, far left, somewhere in between, they will be dealt with. And if the proliferation of information into the hands of rightwing lunatics or leftwing lunatics is leading to a threat in our country, then my responsibility is to make sure our agencies are dealing with it and they are. They look at the threat posed by an individual or organisation and they\u2019ll deal with it. And that\u2019s what I think Australians would expect. Oh, it looks like Peter Dutton has been studying the Scott Morrison question deflection technique. Cool. Beans. Q: Is nuclear technology safe? Dutton: I\u2019ve dealt with that issue. (And yes, we ask again, and yes we push, but we cannot force someone to answer a question.) Michelle Rowland also stopped by doors this morning to lay out Labor\u2019s lines for the coming day when it comes to defending its climate policy: We know what happens next in this movie \u2013 we\u2019ve seen it before. There\u2019ll be a scare campaign, there will be untruths, there will be Liberal propaganda sent out on every medium trying to convince Australians to be scared. Well, the reality is that this is not a time to be making Australians who already have uncertainty about everything from stagnant wages to the economy of our country, and the global economy [scared]. It\u2019s not a time for scare campaigns. It\u2019s a time to listen to the experts; it\u2019s a time to take action because the cost of inaction cannot be borne. Women\u2019s Legal Service Queensland says it is time for an \u201cemergency response\u201d from the commonwealth in relation to domestic and family violence. It has set out three priorities it says need to be implemented as soon as possible if there is to be any chance of properly addressing the scourge: 1. Legislation to remove the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility and create emphasis on safety in the Family Law Act; 2. Establishment of a family law system domestic violence death review process to understand and prevent family law deaths; 3. Restore and build funding to specialist legal services with the aim that calls for help don\u2019t go unanswered. Mark Butler is holding a quick press conference to talk Labor\u2019s 2050 net zero emissions target. He says it is not only in line with what Australia has committed to with the Paris agreement, it is also, increasingly, what Australians want (even if they didn\u2019t vote for it at the last election). It\u2019s not just polling which is pointing that way though. Zali Steggall\u2019s climate bill, which includes a petition to have it treated as a conscience vote, now has 50,000 signatures, with every electorate in Australia represented. Australia\u2019s spy boss, Mike Burgess, used his annual address last night to warn of the growing rightwing terrorism threat in Australia. As Ben Doherty reported: Burgess said while violent Islamist fundamentalism remained Asio\u2019s primary concern, the threat of rightwing extremism \u2013 of the type espoused by the Australian-born Christchurch killer \u2013 was \u2018real and growing\u2019. \u2018In suburbs around Australia, small cells regularly meet to salute Nazi flags, inspect weapons, train in combat and share their hateful ideology.\u2019 Burgess said Australians were signing up as members to international white supremacist hate groups such as the Base, where members use online platforms to share extremist rightwing ideologies and encourage each other into committing acts of violence. \u2018We expect such groups will remain an enduring threat, making more use of online propaganda to spread their messages of hate. \u2018While we would expect any rightwing extremist-inspired attack in Australia to be low capability, ie a knife, gun or vehicle attack, more sophisticated attacks are possible. And we also need to be mindful of state-sponsored terrorism as states seek to use terrorism to further their goals.\u2019 An Australian earlier this year was stopped from leaving the country to fight with an extreme rightwing group on a foreign battlefield after authorities received a tip-off from Asio. Peter Dutton responded to that with: Well, I think, again, we made the point when [Duncan] Lewis was the director general that Asio has been working on rightwing extremism literally for decades in our country. And I just don\u2019t care honestly \u2013 you can portray me in whatever way you like. If somebody is going to cause harm to Australians, I just don\u2019t care whether they\u2019re on the far right, far left, somewhere in between, they will be dealt with. And if the proliferation of information into the hands of rightwing lunatics or leftwing lunatics is leading to a threat in our country, then my responsibility is to make sure our agencies are dealing with it and they are. They look at the threat posed by an individual or organisation and they\u2019ll deal with it. And that\u2019s what I think Australians would expect. Scott Morrison was asked about what he would be doing about domestic violence. Anne Aly, who first revealed her domestic violence experience in her memoir, is featured in her local paper today, talking about what she went through. Morrison says it will once again be on the Coag agenda. Countering domestic violence and dealing with family violence is a priority every day for my government. Not just on any one day. Every single day. Because every single day women are confronted, and children, with horrendous family violence. And so each and every day we are putting in place the plan, the fourth national action plan, a process that was actually started by the previous Labor government, and in a few weeks\u2019 time Coag will be coming together again and this will be one of the many topics that will be on that agenda, working together. We have record funding going into this from the federal level and there will be a fifth action plan and a sixth action plan, and that will be done by working together. This issue doesn\u2019t know politics. It just knows that there is hurt and pain and tragedy and devastation to families and every day addressing that is a priority for me and my government. He left before he could be asked about whether or not the not-a-psychologist should be stripped of her Order of Australia award. The other half of Kristina Keneally\u2019s doorstop was taken up on the motion Labor wants to move: Today in the Senate we will have a vote on a motion put forward by senator Penny Wong and myself calling on the Senate to agree that the comments by Bettina Arndt in relation to family violence do not underpin the values of the Order of Australia and I encourage all senators to stand firm, to reject the abhorrent and reckless comments of Bettina Arndt and to make clear that there is no excuse for family violence. There is no excuse for what happened to Hannah Clarke and her three children, it was a murder plain and simple, but there is nothing plain and simple about the tragedy that is domestic violence. And there is nothing plain and simple about using your position with an Order of Australia to spread comments that could be seen to be inciting violence, that seem to be condoning violence. And I note that Liberal senators such as Sarah Henderson and Hollie Hughes have been speaking out on this and I welcome their comments. I look forward to the Senate later today voting on this motion and I encourage all senators to reflect upon it and vote to recognise, and to endorse, that Bettina Arndt\u2019s comments are not reflective of the values that underpin the Order of Australia. The climate wars (it\u2019s been 84 years) continue in Australia\u2019s political discourse. Kristina Keneally opened with this volley this morning, giving unexpected praise to some fellow politicians on the other side of the fence: You might not expect a former Labor premier of New South Wales to say this, but let me just reflect: how good is Gladys Berejiklian? I mean, here is a Liberal leader in NSW who\u2019s being quite clear with the community. Net zero emissions by 2050 is a NSW target, Gladys Berejiklian says, and it\u2019s because it is right in line with the Paris agreement. But Gladys Berejiklian is leading, Steven Marshall in South Australia is leading, right around the country, the business community is leading. Our farmers even know they have had, here in Australia, our farmers have had some $1bn wiped off the crop production across the last two decades because the climate is changing, and what are our farmers doing? They\u2019re changing. Our farmers are aspiring to net zero emissions not by 2050, but by 2030. So we\u2019ve got farmers, we\u2019ve got the business community, we\u2019ve got state and territory governments, we have 73 government across the world leading in this and we\u2019ve got Scott Morrison, an ad man with no plan, failing to show up. No wonder Australians are frustrated and disappointed in their prime minister. Peter Dutton has called a press conference for 9.15am in the Senate courtyard. That will be about this: Foreign interference in Australia is higher than it has ever been, and \u201csleeper agents\u201d for foreign powers have lain dormant for years in Australia before being uncovered, the head of Australia\u2019s domestic spy agency has warned. In a wide-ranging annual threat assessment address delivered in Canberra on Monday night, the director general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (Asio), Mike Burgess, reiterated earlier security agency warnings that a terrorist attack in Australia is \u201cprobable\u201d, and said that rightwing extremism, brought into \u201csharp terrible focus\u201d by last year\u2019s Christchurch massacre, was manifesting in \u201csmall cells\u201d of adherents gathering to salute Nazi flags, inspect weapons and disseminate \u201chateful ideology\u201d. The intelligence chief said the threat of rightwing extremism was real and growing, and that the number of overall terrorism leads under investigation had doubled over the past year. This is the motion Kristina Keneally and Penny Wong will be hoping to move: 1) Notes that: a) On the same day that Queensland police commissioner Katarina Carroll said it was inappropriate to suggest the murder of a woman and her children by her husband could be an instance of a husband being driven too far, Ms Bettina Arndt, who received an Order of Australia honour in January, nonetheless said \u201ckeeping an open mind and awaiting proper evidence, including the possibility that Rowan Baxter might have been driven too far\u201d. b) The statement of Ms Arndt has the potential to bring the Order of Australia, instituted by Her Majesty the Queen, into disrepute. c) Order of Australia awards are a privilege and an honour and come with responsibilities. 2) Agrees that: a. Ms Arndt\u2019s comments are reckless and abhorrent. b. The values that underpin Ms Arndt\u2019s views on this horrific family violence incident are not consistent with her retaining her Order of Australia. It\u2019s party room meeting time in Canberra, which means climate policy will once again be in the spotlight, as both sides grapple with how to move forward. Barnaby Joyce has moved things in a very Barnaby Joyce way, pointing the finger at his colleagues in the NSW state government for setting a net zero emissions 2050 target. He says it\u2019s a lame attempt to secure Greens preferences. Matt Canavan is also waging war against a net zero emissions policy which he says is just being put forward for \u201cwarm glow in the cities\u201d. That would be the same policy that more than 70 countries \u2013 so far \u2013 have signed up to. Because it is part of the Paris agreement. And because it is necessary to, you know, SAVE THE PLANET. Labor\u2019s first big policy announcement is what started this latest incarnation of a climate policy debate. While the government has had fun sticking it to Labor, it is also trying to work out what it is going to do. It hasn\u2019t ruled out heading in that direction itself, because it doesn\u2019t really have a choice. But the Nationals, as always, are the ones causing issues. Wading through it, is going to be a pretty sticky job. But increasingly it is where the public wants the government to go (despite the May election result). As Katharine Murphy reports: A clear and growing majority of Coalition voters support the Morrison government adopting a net zero target for 2050, with support for that proposition climbing 12 points in a month, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The latest fortnightly survey shows a majority of Australian voters support net zero either strongly or somewhat (75%, up four points in a month), and 68% of Coalition voters in the sample hold that positive view. Last month, the proportion of supportive Coalition voters was 56%. The decisive shift in positive sentiment from Coalition voters follows calls from within the government to consider the 2050 target, and Labor\u2019s decision late last week to sign on to net zero \u2013 confirmation that has reignited the climate wars in Canberra. While the Morrison government is leaving its options open on a 2050 target, its current messaging is suggestive of substituting a technology roadmap for a target. The debate about net zero dominated parliament on Monday. The Coalition is blasting Labor for adopting the target in the absence of a fleshed-out plan to get there, while Labor and the Sydney independent MP Zali Steggall are pressuring the government to detail the impact of failing to act to prevent dangerous global heating. The other issue bubbling along is the Australia Day honour bestowed upon a woman who has continually pushed an MRA agenda, including most recently, providing for the possibility that a man who murdered his wife and three children by setting them on fire may have been \u201cdriven too far\u201d. Liberal and Labor politicians have called for her to be stripped of the honour. Pauline Hanson\u2019s role in the latest family law court inquiry is also in the spotlight after she \u201cnot all menned\u201d the tragedy. Hanson did her usual \u201cyou don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve been though\u201d cry warble in the Senate to fight back against the calls, but don\u2019t expect that issue to be dropped either. You have Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp with you. I have not yet had a coffee, but will fix that as soon as I get my head around the day. Which would be easier with a coffee. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

      "body": "<h2>What is a pandemic?</h2> <p>Pandemics have nothing to do with the severity of a disease but are to do with its geographic spread. According to the World Health Organization, a pandemic is declared when a new disease for which people do not have immunity spreads around the world beyond expectations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/feb/25/could-coronavirus-be-china-chernobyl-moment-podcast\">Coronavirus: could this be China's Chernobyl moment? \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cases that involve travellers who have been infected in China and have then returned to their home country, or who have been infected by that traveller, known as the \u201cindex case\u201d, do not count towards declaring a pandemic. There needs to be a second wave of infection from person to person throughout the community. In the US, the UK and Australia, there is no active community transmission at present.</p> <p>Once a pandemic is declared, it becomes more likely that community spread will eventually happen, and governments and health systems need to ensure they are prepared for that.</p> <p>An epidemic, on the other hand, is a sudden increase in cases of an illness or disease that can be unique to one country or community.</p> <h2>When is a pandemic declared?</h2> <p>Prof Mary-Louise McLaws, an infection control expert who has worked as an adviser to WHO, said declaring a pandemic was not always clear-cut because it could depend on the modelling used, which may differ between the WHO and other health organisations. Ultimately, the WHO gets the final say. There is no threshold, such as a certain number of deaths or infections, or number of countries affected, that needs to be met.

      "bodyText": "What is a pandemic? Pandemics have nothing to do with the severity of a disease but are to do with its geographic spread. According to the World Health Organization, a pandemic is declared when a new disease for which people do not have immunity spreads around the world beyond expectations. Cases that involve travellers who have been infected in China and have then returned to their home country, or who have been infected by that traveller, known as the \u201cindex case\u201d, do not count towards declaring a pandemic. There needs to be a second wave of infection from person to person throughout the community. In the US, the UK and Australia, there is no active community transmission at present. Once a pandemic is declared, it becomes more likely that community spread will eventually happen, and governments and health systems need to ensure they are prepared for that. An epidemic, on the other hand, is a sudden increase in cases of an illness or disease that can be unique to one country or community. When is a pandemic declared? Prof Mary-Louise McLaws, an infection control expert who has worked as an adviser to WHO, said declaring a pandemic was not always clear-cut because it could depend on the modelling used, which may differ between the WHO and other health organisations. Ultimately, the WHO gets the final say. There is no threshold, such as a certain number of deaths or infections, or number of countries affected, that needs to be met. For example, the Sars coronavirus, identified in 2003, was not declared a pandemic by the WHO despite affecting 26 countries. However its spread was contained quickly, and only a handful of nations were significantly affected, including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Canada. \u201cWHO do things for lots of reasons but part of the reason for declaring a pandemic, if they do declare one, would be to get the critical mass on board to take it seriously and not ignore symptoms, and to get the finances required to help tackle and control it,\u201d McLaws said. However, if declaring a pandemic triggers global panic, this can defeat the purpose of trying to raise awareness. Much has been written about whether the declaration of H1N1, colloquially known as \u201cswine flu\u201d, as a pandemic in 2009, caused unnecessary panic, overwhelming emergency departments and causing governments to overspend on antiviral medications. Coronavirus symptoms are generally mild and most people recover within six days. Infectious diseases expert Prof Peter Collignon said it appeared that the fecal-oral route may be an important part of coronavirus transmission. In countries with strong water sanitation and a safe and reliable water supply, the impact of a pandemic could be less severe. If WHO declares a coronavirus pandemic what will it mean for the way an outbreak is treated and prepared for? Currently there is local spread of coronavirus in China, South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy and Singapore. The director of infectious diseases and immunology at the Menzies Health Institute in Queensland Prof Nigel McMillan, said it was concerning to see media reports over-sensationalising what a pandemic might mean. \u201cWe don\u2019t wish to induce panic food or petrol stockpiling, when for 95% of the population, this will be a mild cold,\u201d he said. But a pandemic would mean travel bans would no longer be useful or make sense and would alert health authorities that they need to prepare for the next phase. \u201cThis includes preparing our hospitals for a large influx of patients, stockpiling any antivirals, and advising the public that when the time comes ,they will need to think about things like staying at home if ill, social distancing, avoiding large gatherings etc,\u201d McMillan said. McLaws said this might prove the toughest part for governments \u2013 encouraging people to change their behaviours, such as forgoing or cancelling large social events if they are sick. In response to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) outbreak 17 years ago, McLaws collaborated with Beijing to review the reasons for healthcare workers acquiring Sars. \u201cWhat those health workers saw, and the way they saw their colleagues get sick, meant they cooperated with the government to contain the spread,\u201d she said. \u201cCountries used to a good level of health in their population may need to work harder to get their citizens ready.\u201d Experts say a vaccine is approximately 18 months away. What are other examples of pandemics? The 2009 H1N1 outbreak, HIV (1981), Spanish flu (1918), bubonic plague (1347) and smallpox (1870) are all examples of pandemics.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Those entering the UK from areas quarantined by the Italian authorities \u2013 10 small towns in Lombardy and one in Veneto \u2013 should follow the guidance, even if they do not have symptoms.</p> \n<p>The health secretary said the government advice was in accordance with warnings from the World Health Organization that Covid-19 could become a pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt present we don\u2019t think there are any Brits in the area that\u2019s been quarantined by the Italian government,\u201d Hancock told Sky News. \u201cBut of course the government doesn\u2019t track where people move around Europe, so if people are in that area they should get in contact and we will do what we can to help.\u201d</p> \n<p>The worsening situation in northern Italy was described as \u201cvery worrying\u201d by Hancock, who said it was a significant outbreak with more than 200 people affected, including those who had died.</p> \n<p>He said Britain was expecting cases of the illness and had been preparing.

In Lombardy, Veneto, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Piemonte and Emilia Romagna, it has ordered a seven-day suspension of public and private events, schools and higher education facilities, as well as museums and cultural institutions. Hancock said: \u201cThere is a good chance that we contain this at [the virus] sort of level, where the number of cases \u2026 is relatively low. The numbers of cases in China are coming down and we think that direction of travel is credible. \u201cBut the problem is there are outbreaks elsewhere, like in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and so we are preparing in case this becomes a pandemic. But we are confident there\u2019s a good chance of avoiding that, but we are taking a belt and braces approach.\u201d A total of 6,536 people have been tested in the UK, of which 6,527 were confirmed negative and nine positive. There are also four confirmed cases from the Diamond Princess cruise ship who arrived in the UK from Japan. About 80% of people with coronavirus experience only mild symptoms, and children do not seem to be affected, except in a small number of cases, according to the health secretary. China has reported 77,658 cases and 2,663 deaths. Reports from Seoul in South Korea say 893 have been infected. Italy has 229 cases and seven deaths. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, told Sky News: \u201cWe are all worried. We shouldn\u2019t panic but this is extremely serious. It\u2019s not yet a pandemic \u2026 but clearly it is hugely serious and we have to be alert, we have to act. \u201cI\u2019m not going to criticise or throw stones at the government. Broadly they\u2019ve taken the correct approach. We know the amount of pressure our NHS is under at the moment \u2013 intense strain after years of cuts. If this hits us very badly, there are questions about whether our NHS has the resources to cope.\u201d",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>To begin with, it was memes showing bats in soup, or people eating the animals whole, as health authorities announced that bats may have been the source of the viral outbreak. But as celebrations for new year slowed down, hashtags such as #whattodowhenstuckathome and #learnanewskill trended on Weibo, China\u2019s Twitter, giving life to a host of funny videos and entertainment.</p> \n<p>Recreating outdoor life indoors became a hit: a man sitting on a high chair in his living room \u201cfishing\u201d from his own goldfish tank; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZcpYSkcYPM\" title=\"\">masked women dancing with doctors in Wuhan\u2019s hospitals</a>, reminiscent of the popular group-dancing seen in parks and public squares; Ferrero Rochers being flipped inside their box with cotton buds, a parody of the way that street food stalls cook popular octopus-ball snacks.

On the last day of lunar new year, a day after Li\u2019s death, buildings in Beijing lit up in red with \u201cWuhan add oil\u201d. Similar light displays marked the Communist party\u2019s 70th anniversary in October last year.</p> \n<p>Today, social media is still awash with entertaining videos, many portraying acts of selflessness. A short video showing a guard at a \u201ccoronavirus test station\u201d in a thick army coat in the blustery, snowy landscape has been viewed millions of times. Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency, has found its own protagonists of this blitz spirit, such as the crying guard who sits on the ground <a href=\"https://twitter.com/XHNews/status/1227920804001665026\" title=\"\">eating his lunch</a> but jumps up seconds later \u201cwhen duty calls\u201d, or an Egyptian family who \u201cchose\u201d to stay in Wuhan.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/24/coronavirus-china-wuhan-lockdown-economy-south-korea-npc-annual-parliament\">Coronavirus: China postpones National People's Congress</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A series of star-filled songs about the outbreak have added to the culture of positivity and patriotism.

But beyond the funny memes and songs of unity, you can still find devastating personal stories \u2013 the disease has now claimed <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/other/coronavirus-toll-in-china-reaches-2592/ar-BB10jifV\" title=\"\">2,592 lives in China</a>.

A man called Fang Bin who shot scenes inside local hospitals showing body bags is thought to have been arrested. In recent weeks state media has ramped up its efforts to portray unity and boost patriotism. On the last day of lunar new year, a day after Li\u2019s death, buildings in Beijing lit up in red with \u201cWuhan add oil\u201d. Similar light displays marked the Communist party\u2019s 70th anniversary in October last year. Today, social media is still awash with entertaining videos, many portraying acts of selflessness. A short video showing a guard at a \u201ccoronavirus test station\u201d in a thick army coat in the blustery, snowy landscape has been viewed millions of times. Xinhua, China\u2019s official news agency, has found its own protagonists of this blitz spirit, such as the crying guard who sits on the ground eating his lunch but jumps up seconds later \u201cwhen duty calls\u201d, or an Egyptian family who \u201cchose\u201d to stay in Wuhan. A series of star-filled songs about the outbreak have added to the culture of positivity and patriotism. Jackie Chan sings on both Wuhan, are you OK? and Believe Love Will Triumph. For now, while plenty bemoan the censor\u2019s heavier hand, government channels remain essential sources of information and updates. The truth is that most people are not interested in being controversial, and are just trying to pass the time and are happy for a morale boost. Yesterday, a friend urged me not to ask too many questions about coronavirus on WeChat, as it has become \u201ctoo sensitive\u201d. But beyond the funny memes and songs of unity, you can still find devastating personal stories \u2013 the disease has now claimed 2,592 lives in China. Long after posts are deleted, their screenshots linger: look and you can still find reposted threads and articles detailing families torn apart, and gravely sick patients unable to access treatment. \u2022 Yuan Ren is a former editor at Time Out Beijing, and has written extensively on China",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Film mogul faces up to 25 years behind bars Harvey Weinstein and his defence team tackled his rape trial in New York in the same way he once approached awards season: attack, dominate, cast doubt. But to no avail. The disgraced film producer was on Monday found guilty by jurors on two charges, in a victory for the #MeToo movement that he inadvertently helped to create. With his career and his reputation in tatters, Weinstein faces up to 25 years in prison \u2013 not to mention fresh charges in Los Angeles. Hollywood reaction. The US film industry reacted with relief to the conviction, with Weinstein accusers including Ashley Judd, Rose McGowan and Annabella Sciorra hailing the verdict as a step forward. Cultural moment. Weinstein\u2019s fall and the #MeToo movement have also generated a glut of films, TV shows and books inspired by the scandal. Middle East and Europe gripped by spread of coronavirus A seventh person has died from Covid-19 in Italy, as the authorities grapple with the worst coronavirus outbreak in Europe. Across the Middle East there are fears the disease has infiltrated a Shia Muslim pilgrimage route, with the Iranian shrine city of Qom thought to be a hub of the virus. And the Seoul government has said it will test all 200,000 members of the secretive Shincheonji Church of Jesus, thought to be at the centre of the outbreak in South Korea, where the number of infections is nearing 1,000. Pandemic debate. The World Health Organization is still playing down fears of a coronavirus pandemic despite some experts saying its worldwide spread is all but inevitable. Stock markets. After a precipitous fall on Monday, stock markets have steadied. But experts warned of further drops as the crisis continues. Democrats coming to terms with Sanders as likely nominee The Democratic party establishment is struggling to come to terms with the fact that Bernie Sanders is its probable presidential nominee. On Monday Joe Biden and the Bloomberg campaign criticised Sanders for his positive comments about Fidel Castro in a 60 Minutes interview \u2013 remarks that could alienate the Cuban community in Florida, a key swing state. Sanders said he opposed the \u201cauthoritarian nature\u201d of Castro\u2019s regime, but added: \u201cHe had a massive literacy program \u2026 Is that a bad thing?\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s black vote. In the latest part of the Guardian\u2019s analysis of Michael Bloomberg\u2019s campaign, Daniel Strauss asks whether African Americans will overlook the former New York mayor\u2019s stop-and-frisk past if they think he can beat Trump. Mourners pay tribute at emotional Kobe Bryant memorial A tearful Michael Jordan, Shaquille O\u2019Neill and Kobe Bryant\u2019s widow Vanessa paid tribute to the late basketball hero and his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, at a memorial service in Los Angeles on Monday. Thousands of fans packed into the Staples Centre, home of Bryant\u2019s team the Lakers, for an event that opened with a performance by Beyonc\u00e9 and was attended by a host of NBA stars and celebrities. Helicopter lawsuit. Vanessa Bryant has filed a lawsuit against the owner of the helicopter that crashed in fog last month, killing Kobe and Gianna Bryant as well as seven other victims. Cheat sheet The trauma inflicted on migrant children and their parents by the Trump administration\u2019s family separation policy constitutes torture, a not-for-profit medical group has concluded in an in-depth report on its psychological impact. The Pentagon has said it staged a military exercise last week in which it simulated a \u201climited\u201d nuclear exchange with Russia, to demonstrate the feasibility of fighting a battle with nuclear weapons, without it resulting in a world-ending conflict. Apple may have to disclose the details of censorship demands made by China and other countries \u2013 potentially exposing the tech giant\u2019s kowtowing to Beijing \u2013 under new human rights commitments being demanded by shareholder groups. A California couple in their 70s survived for a week on fern fronds and puddle water after getting lost on a Valentine\u2019s Day hike in woods north of San Francisco. Must-reads The shameless Nazi-killing catharsis of Hunters Critics have complained that Amazon\u2019s new drama Hunters is unsubtle, gory and loose with the facts about the Holocaust. But as a Jewish writer, Charles Bramesco says he found this Nazi-hunting thriller to be a cathartic and empowering revenge fantasy. How I found solace in nature, and fear for its future Recovering from addiction and depression, Lucy Jones took comfort from long walks in nature, and later from growing plants. But as she learned about the healing power of the natural world, she writes, she also began to feel grief at its destruction. The Native American families with a legacy of violent deaths Thousands of Native American women and girls have been killed in the US over the years. But this crisis afflicts some families more than others: an untracked number of Indigenous people have more than one relative missing or murdered, as Hallie Golden discovers. China\u2019s secretive wildlife farm industry Almost 20,000 farms breeding unusual species including peacocks, porcupines, ostriches and boar have been shut down across China amid the spread of the coronavirus \u2013 a crisis that has laid bare the vast scale of this hitherto secretive industry, reports Michael Standaert. Opinion Harvey Weinstein was long considered immune to justice, says Moira Donegan. His conviction is a victory for the #MeToo movement, but also a symbol of how far we still have to go. For all the controversy it created, the #MeToo movement has claimed relatively few high-profile arrests, even in cases where evidence is abundant and the number of public accusers reaches into the dozens. Sport Jurgen Klopp\u2019s still-unbeaten Liverpool side have claimed their 21st consecutive home league victory, against West Ham, equalling the all-time English record, setting a new Premier League record \u2013 and equalling Manchester City\u2019s record of 18 successive league wins. Deontay Wilder has blamed his knockout defeat to Tyson Fury on the elaborate, 40lb costume he wore on his way into the ring on Saturday night, claiming it tired his legs before the fight.

Some will be contemplating cancelling, while others will want to know what their consumer rights are. I have a trip to Italy booked. Can I get my money back? About 3 million people from the UK visit Italy every year, and the situation regarding the country is moving fast. The Italian authorities implemented a series of measures on 22 February, and the latest reported coronavirus death toll there had risen to seven, with the number of confirmed cases at 229. On insurance and refunds, the bottom line is that it very much depends on what the UK government is officially advising. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said travel insurance was not designed to cover \u201cdisinclination to travel\u201d where the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advice had not changed to advise against travel. Despite telling Britons returning from northern Italy to self-isolate if they develop coronavirus symptoms, the FCO has not advised against travel to the country. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said people with flu-like symptoms who have been north of Pisa are asked to stay at home for 14 days. If the government subsequently does advise against all but essential travel to any part of Italy, most if not all tour operators and airlines will almost certainly cancel immediate trips and offer full refunds. At that point, many insurance policies will cover non-refundable travel costs such as hotels if the policyholder has been unable to reclaim these from the travel firm. If you were due to travel to an area of Italy that is currently in lockdown, you could reasonably argue that your holiday cannot go ahead and claim on your travel insurance. Insurers have said they will look at claims on a case-by-case basis. However, those choosing to cancel trips to other areas of Italy are unlikely to be covered by their travel insurance \u2013 unless the FCO advises against travel to the country. The same advice applies to Tenerife and Croatia, where the first cases were reported overnight. What are insurers and travel companies saying regarding Italy? The speed of the developments appears to have caught firms by surprise, with many scrambling to clarify their position. Nel Mooy, the head of travel proposition at Axa, one of the biggest underwriters of travel policies in the UK, said: \u201cOur stance is consistent with the travel advice from the FCO. At the moment the FCO isn\u2019t advising against travelling to Italy.

      "bodyText": "At least a dozen schools across the UK have put students and staff into self-isolation after returning home from coronavirus-hit northern Italy, as plans were announced to test flu patients in an attempt to spot whether the highly contagious condition is spreading. Pupils from County Antrim in Northern Ireland, Pembrokeshire in Wales, Guernsey in the Channel Islands and Cheshire, Yorkshire, Berkshire, Teesside and Cornwall in England were sent home on Tuesday to quarantine themselves for 14 days despite not showing any signs of infection, following advice from the UK chief medical officers. Anyone who in the last two weeks has come back from Iran, specific lockdown areas in northern Italy, certain parts of South Korea and Hubei province in China is being asked to stay indoors, call NHS111 and avoid contact with other people, even if they do not have symptoms. Thousands of people cannot enter or leave 11 towns in the Lombardy and Veneto regions of Italy for the next two weeks without special permission. Many Britons, including school parties, visited the region on ski holidays over half-term. Despite advice from Public Health England (PHE) and the Department for Education that schools should stay open, two schools closed completely to all pupils for deep-cleaning after half-term ski trips to Italy. Trinity Catholic college in Middlesbrough said it would reopen on 3 March, while Cransley school in Northwich, Cheshire, is shut until 2 March after the headteacher said a number of pupils were showing \u201cflu-like symptoms\u201d. Meanwhile, Public Health England (PHE) has announced flu patients are to be assessed for coronavirus in an effort to spot whether it is spreading. Standard flu test samples from patients in some hospitals in England will also be assessed for the virus. So far diagnostic tests have only been conducted on patients who are believed to be infected, but health officials plan to roll out the assessment more widely. It is not believed that coronavirus is circulating in England, but experts hope to spot any spread and put preventive measures in place. PHE has put the new system in place in eight NHS hospitals across the country. About 100 primary care sites, such as GP surgeries, will also participate in the scheme so milder cases can be detected. England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said on Tuesday that there were a number of contingency plans if the virus spread. Speaking at the Department of Health and Social Care in central London, Whitty said schools could be shut, whole families quarantined and transport reduced if coronavirus became a global pandemic. About 50 pupils and staff from a school in Co Antrim were sent home for 14 days\u2019 self-quarantine after returning from an Italian ski holiday. The group, from Cambridge House grammar school in Ballymena, were in the Lombardy region but did not visit nine towns affected by the infection and are showing no symptoms. They travelled through Milan airport, the school\u2019s principal, Elma Lutton, said. Brine Leas academy in Nantwich, Cheshire, has also been affected by travel to Italy. The school said on Twitter it would remain open but that the sixth-form college would close due to staff shortages. Sandbach high school, also in Cheshire, said students and staff who had visited Aprica, in Lombardy, were to stay indoors and self-isolate, even though no one was showing any symptoms. Guernsey grammar school sent home students who had been on a trip to Piedmont in northern Italy, after one began \u201cshowing the relevant symptoms\u201d, local authorities have said. Other schools which sent home pupils and staff who had been to northern Italy included Salendine Nook high school in West Yorkshire, Newquay Tretherras school in Cornwall and Haverfordwest high school in Pembrokeshire.",

      "bodyText": "A thousand guests and workers at a hotel in Tenerife have been quarantined after an Italian doctor and his wife tested positive for coronavirus, and as the first cases of the disease were detected in Austria, Croatia and Switzerland. The number of confirmed cases of the virus in Spain rose to five on Tuesday afternoon after an Italian woman living in Barcelona tested positive following a recent trip to northern Italy, the location of Europe\u2019s biggest coronavirus outbreak. Spanish health authorities had already identified two confirmed cases \u2013 one on the remote Canary island of La Gomera and another on the Balearic island of Mallorca \u2013 but the Catalan case is the first detected in mainland Spain. Catalonia\u2019s regional government said a 36-year-old Italian woman had been placed in quarantine after visiting Bergamo and Milan earlier this month. The Catalan health minister, Joan Guix, said regional authorities were \u201cconstantly updating their health protocol and are in contact with the Spanish health ministry and other regional governments\u201d. He said the quarantined woman was showing mild, flu-like symptoms, adding that 25 people who may have come into contact with her had been told to stay at home as a precaution. News of Spain\u2019s rising infection toll came as the Austrian state of Tyrol, which borders Italy, confirmed its first two cases of the virus and a hotel in Innsbruck was placed under lockdown after an Italian receptionist there contracted the virus, according to local media. Croatia confirmed its first case in a hospital patient in the capital, Zagreb, and Switzerland\u2019s first cases of the disease was confirmed on Tuesday by the federal office of public health. Meanwhile in the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that Americans should \u201cprepare for the expectation that this might be bad\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much of a question of if this will happen in this country any more but a question of when this will happen,\u201d said Dr Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. And Dr Bruce Aylward, who led team of international experts who visited China for the WHO, said every country in the world should learn from Beijing\u2019s experience of containing the coronavirus. \u201cHundreds of thousands of people in China did not get COVID-19 because of this aggressive response,\u201d he said. Hotel lockdown Health authorities in the Canary Islands ordered the lockdown of the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel in south Tenerife after the Italian doctor complained of feeling ill and tested positive for the virus on Monday. The following day, the regional government announced that his wife had also tested positive. The Italian couple are thought to have spent six days at the four-star, seafront hotel, which is used by the package holiday firms Tui and Jet2Holidays. The pair are believed to be from the north of Italy, where most of the country\u2019s 283 cases have been reported. By Tuesday afternoon, the hotel, on the outskirts of Adeje, was quiet and workers had been told not to come to work. The resort was guarded by police officers in face masks who declined to speak to the media, and a red barrier had been erected a few hundred metres from the main entrance. The shops, bars and restaurants inside had been sealed off, and staff who had turned up to work in the morning had been told to go home. A letter sent by managers to guests said they had to stay in their rooms after the coronavirus diagnosis. \u201cH10 Hotels has implemented all health and operational recommendations from the health authorities to ensure the safety and wellbeing of customers and employees,\u201d the hotel said. \u201cAdditionally, we are providing customers and hotel staff all the necessary care and attention so that, despite the inconveniences this situation may cause, they are taken care of in the best way possible.\u201d A British guest told Reuters he was among those in quarantine and complained of a lack of information. \u201cWe can see from the window there are security officers outside the hotel and about 50 hotel employees,\u201d Christopher Betts said on the phone from his hotel room, adding that guests were asked to remain in their rooms. Betts said they had been allowed to have breakfast in the hotel restaurant but added: \u201cWe have received no information whatsoever.\u201d He said he had not been tested for the virus. Waiters at a restaurant a short walk from the hotel said most of Tuesday\u2019s lunch bookings had been cancelled as a result of the lockdown. The few customers who ventured in were given a warm welcome, a dose of hand gel and asked, very politely, to keep a few yards away. But despite the tense mood, people praised the local authorities for their calm and quick response to the situation. Ashotel, the association of hoteliers on Tenerife and four other Canary islands, called for calm and said the established protocols were in effect. \u201cThe hotel where the affected tourist was staying is doing everything it can to deal with the situation and is demonstrating complete responsibility and following all the steps laid out in the protocol,\u201d said a spokeswoman for the association. \u201cThe situation inside the hotel is normal; all the customers are being kept informed about what\u2019s going and are cooperating fully when it comes to following the recommendations laid out by the authorities.\u201d The Spanish government also urged people to remain calm and said the cabinet-wide commission on coronavirus had met to discuss the latest developments on Tuesday morning. Nadia Calvi\u00f1o, one of Spain\u2019s four deputy prime ministers, said the country would \u201cadopt all necessary precautions\u201d when it came to the virus, adding that the government was committed to \u201ctotal transparency\u201d and to keeping people properly and punctually informed. \u201cSpain has a first-class healthy system and we\u2019ve been putting out a message of calm and of confidence from the very beginning of all this,\u201d said Calvi\u00f1o. The Canaries are still dealing with the aftermath of a Saharan sandstorm that reduced visibility and left thousands of travellers stranded in airports over the weekend. The meteorological phenomenon, which is known as a calima, was accompanied by strong winds of up to 75mph that fanned at least three wildfires on different Canary islands.",

      "body": "<p>Every competition in international track cycling is important. Unlike their road counterparts, who race almost weekly during the long World Tour season, track cyclists compete barely half a dozen times each year. On the rare occasions these riders don national colours and fly around velodromes, months of preparation are tested in the cauldron of a race environment.</p> <p>The most significant of these gatherings is the UCI Track World Championships, with the latest edition beginning on Wednesday in Berlin. In Olympic years, the world championships gain a peculiar hue. For some teams qualification for Tokyo will dependon a strong placing here. For others, a medal could give them the mental edge to succeed again at the Olympics in five months\u2019 time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/22/elinor-barker-madison-world-cycling-championships\">Cyclist Elinor Barker: I\u2019m still baffled women\u2019s Madison is a new event</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But unlike the other three years of this quadrennial cycle, in 2020 these world championships are not the primary goal for most riders. The pain of failure can be quickly salved by Olympic success, while rainbow stripes in Germany will be little consolation for those who leave Tokyo empty-handed.</p> <p>After finishing the 2019 world championships atop the medal table (equal with the Netherlands), expectations are high for Australia. Strong performances would provide a significant boost as the Australians seek redemption following a disappointing 2016 Olympic campaign. With the nation\u2019s track cyclists counting down the days until racing begins, Guardian Australia was allowed into the team camp.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018You\u2019d be kicking yourself for ever\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>11am, Saturday: hotel lobby</em></p> <p>In the corner of a trendy Berlin hotel, directly opposite the velodrome, four Australian staff have claimed the most comfortable couches in the lobby. A day and a half after arriving, the performance director Simon Jones, endurance coach Tim Decker, psychologist Ruth Anderson and team manager Rik Fulcher are still acclimatising. As riders come and go past them \u2013 the women\u2019s team pursuit squad are particularly pleased to have found an Australian coffee shop nearby \u2013 the quartet ponder plans for the day. Jones ticks off final details, before reminding his colleagues: \u201cThis is a rehearsal for the Olympics.\u201d</p> <p>They have earned a moment\u2019s respite: getting 17 athletes, 21 staff and 1.9 tonnes of equipment from the Cycling Australia high-performance centre in Adelaide to Germany is quite the feat. Fulcher, a two-decade CA veteran, plays Tetris with the team\u2019s baggage allowance to minimise excess fees. \u201cWe always try to wing it with 100kg or so above what we pre-purchase,\u201d he says with a grin. \u201cSometimes we get lucky, sometimes we don\u2019t.\u201d The team typically fly economy, although on this occasion two sprinters \u2013 Steph Morton and Kaarle McCulloch \u2013 were upgraded to business to help them manage lingering injuries. \u201cThat was a nice treat,\u201d says Morton.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ead73d50c8c70031034a233eb29ac39f560cb833\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ead73d50c8c70031034a233eb29ac39f560cb833/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Australian bikes stored in a bathroom\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australian bikes stored in a bathroom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kieran Pender/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Australians are always among the first to arrive at international competitions; only New Zealand landed in Berlin before them. \u201cAfter long flights we get a lot of stiffness, so any pre-existing conditions can be irritated,\u201d says the team physiotherapist Patrick Custance. \u201cThe first day or two we want to get them active and moving, plus doing lots of stretching and soft-tissue work.\u201d Following a quiet Friday, nervous energy is building in the squad as they await their first track session.</p> <p>With the world championships bringing together riders from across the globe, the coronavirus has some teams on edge. The Australian delegation has been equipped with bottles of hand sanitiser; handshakes are banned. Upon seeing this correspondent, Morton offers an elbow bump instead. Australia are sharing their hotel with Japan, Ireland, New Zealand, Canada, the Netherlands, Malaysia and Mexico, and more than one nation has given its riders face masks.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You do all this hard work and then you could fall over at the last hurdle with a cold</p> <footer> <cite>Performance director Simon Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Although Jones is not overly concerned about the virus, he believes a renewed emphasis on hygiene is timely. \u201cHealth is one of our biggest risks at competitions,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are sharing food halls and training areas with athletes from everywhere.\u201d The team recently ran a special session on hygiene, emphasising the correct way to wash hands with the aid of special dyes. \u201cYou do all this hard work and then you could fall over at the last hurdle with a cold. You\u2019d be kicking yourself for ever.\u201d</p> <p>After a relaxing morning, the team gather for lunch in the hotel dining room. Carbohydrates and salads are in abundant supply. The Australians sometimes travel with their own chef, but on this occasion the nutritionist Jill Leckey has consulted with the local kitchen staff. Back in Adelaide the Irishwoman worked with each rider to tailor individual nutrition plans, and is keeping a surreptitious eye on their plates at meal-time. \u201cBy competition time the hard work has been done,\u201d Leckey says. \u201cOur main task now is getting them properly fuelled for race day.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018My goal is to smile every day\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>3pm, Saturday: hotel lobby</em></p> <p>With only a handful of training sessions and team meetings scheduled between arrival and competition, the wait can drag and nerves occasionally fray. \u201cSometimes I wish it was already race day,\u201d says Decker. In the final moments before a big event, track cycling can become as much a mental challenge as a physical endeavour.</p> <p>\u201cDistractions are critical in these last few days,\u201d says the sprinter McCulloch. \u201cI used to really struggle \u2013 there is so much time to fill, but now I really enjoy this period of time. I don\u2019t have to worry about anything.\u201d McCulloch does yoga and watches Netflix, while other athletes play boardgames or read. The hotel has a fussball table, which proved popular with the men\u2019s pursuit team. \u201cMy goal for this world championships is to smile every day,\u201d McCulloch says. \u201cSo far my smiles haven\u2019t been forced!\u201d</p> <p>Psychologist Anderson works intensively with each athlete ahead of races. \u201cWe create competition plans, so athletes know how to self-regulate anxiety and other factors relevant to their performance in the lead up to and during competition,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are trying to develop their understanding that psychological functioning is as important to high performance as the things they do from a physical and technical perspective\u201d</p> <p>Having a positive team culture certainly helps, and the Australians are well-known among other nations for making the most noise at mealtime. \u201cWe are fortunate,\u201d says endurance rider Sam Welsford. \u201cWe have a good tradition \u2013 we know when to switch on and when to switch off. That\u2019s important, otherwise you can get caught up in it all.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b5da2c593e89392f72212e29d91e86480b0969f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b5da2c593e89392f72212e29d91e86480b0969f/0_388_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sprinters Steph Morton and Kaarle McCulloch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sprinters Steph Morton and Kaarle McCulloch chat during a training session in Berlin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kieran Pender/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>\u2018It\u2019s too late\u2019</strong></h2> <p><em>6pm, Saturday: velodrome</em></p> <p>Above the team pits in Berlin\u2019s cavernous velodrome, dozens of national flags hang down from the roof. As the Australians walk into the arena for the first time, more than one stops to gaze up at the blue and white standard they are here to represent.</p> <p>The UCI staggers team training times, and in the evening slot only New Zealand are using the track alongside Australia \u2013 representatives of the neighbouring nations chat amiably. As the riders brace themselves for their first ride, mechanics buzz about preparing bikes and soigneurs set up a refuelling station. Both endurance and sprint teams are taking to the track, although a fairly relaxed session is planned. One coach\u2019s notebook has just two objectives listed \u2013 \u201clearn the track\u201d and \u201cdecide on team line\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere are no final touches,\u201d says the sprint coach Nick Flyger. \u201cIt is all planned, it is all rehearsed. At this point we are trying not to change things \u2013 it\u2019s too late.\u201d Flyger arrived earlier in the day and is battling jetlag; he became a parent with partner Anna Meares just just two weeks ago, and the lack of sleep is evident.</p> <p>Flyger\u2019s male sprinters face the most pressure in Berlin: they are the only section of the Australia team with Tokyo qualification still up in the air. A late injury to Matthew Glaetzer compounded the pressure, with the star sprinter missing the competition. \u201cWe need to finish top-eight in the team sprint,\u201d says Flyger. \u201cIt is not an ideal situation, but we have the talent to get the job done.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8354fc02880bca94bda6fb8d2163c1de3d328cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8354fc02880bca94bda6fb8d2163c1de3d328cd/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maeve Plouffe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maeve Plouffe reviews footage from the training session.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kieran Pender/the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The riders train in a staccato manner, hopping on and off the track at regular intervals. Coaches offer advice, with tablet computers in-hand to display footage \u2013 video recordings are available from the track within seconds. Given the team\u2019s focus on Tokyo, the sprinters have not fully tapered: they are still doing strength-training during the buildup to competition. But even the slight dip in intensity over the past week means the first session back on the track hurts. \u201cIt is a weird feeling,\u201d says Morton, \u201ca bit like getting sick on holiday. But I have done enough of these now to know it is normal.\u201d</p> <p>After post-training debriefs, aided by timing splits and graphs, the riders rug up before they confront the icy Berlin weather. Jones, an Englishman headhunted from Team Sky to lead Australia following the Rio disappointment, has a final word with staff before departing on the tail of his riders. Was he happy with the first training session? \u201cNever completely,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are always a few niggly bits here and there. We have to be constantly changing and evolving.

      "bodyText": "Every competition in international track cycling is important. Unlike their road counterparts, who race almost weekly during the long World Tour season, track cyclists compete barely half a dozen times each year. On the rare occasions these riders don national colours and fly around velodromes, months of preparation are tested in the cauldron of a race environment. The most significant of these gatherings is the UCI Track World Championships, with the latest edition beginning on Wednesday in Berlin. In Olympic years, the world championships gain a peculiar hue. For some teams qualification for Tokyo will dependon a strong placing here. For others, a medal could give them the mental edge to succeed again at the Olympics in five months\u2019 time. But unlike the other three years of this quadrennial cycle, in 2020 these world championships are not the primary goal for most riders. The pain of failure can be quickly salved by Olympic success, while rainbow stripes in Germany will be little consolation for those who leave Tokyo empty-handed. After finishing the 2019 world championships atop the medal table (equal with the Netherlands), expectations are high for Australia. Strong performances would provide a significant boost as the Australians seek redemption following a disappointing 2016 Olympic campaign. With the nation\u2019s track cyclists counting down the days until racing begins, Guardian Australia was allowed into the team camp. \u2018You\u2019d be kicking yourself for ever\u2019 11am, Saturday: hotel lobby In the corner of a trendy Berlin hotel, directly opposite the velodrome, four Australian staff have claimed the most comfortable couches in the lobby. A day and a half after arriving, the performance director Simon Jones, endurance coach Tim Decker, psychologist Ruth Anderson and team manager Rik Fulcher are still acclimatising. As riders come and go past them \u2013 the women\u2019s team pursuit squad are particularly pleased to have found an Australian coffee shop nearby \u2013 the quartet ponder plans for the day. Jones ticks off final details, before reminding his colleagues: \u201cThis is a rehearsal for the Olympics.\u201d They have earned a moment\u2019s respite: getting 17 athletes, 21 staff and 1.9 tonnes of equipment from the Cycling Australia high-performance centre in Adelaide to Germany is quite the feat. Fulcher, a two-decade CA veteran, plays Tetris with the team\u2019s baggage allowance to minimise excess fees. \u201cWe always try to wing it with 100kg or so above what we pre-purchase,\u201d he says with a grin. \u201cSometimes we get lucky, sometimes we don\u2019t.\u201d The team typically fly economy, although on this occasion two sprinters \u2013 Steph Morton and Kaarle McCulloch \u2013 were upgraded to business to help them manage lingering injuries. \u201cThat was a nice treat,\u201d says Morton. The Australians are always among the first to arrive at international competitions; only New Zealand landed in Berlin before them. \u201cAfter long flights we get a lot of stiffness, so any pre-existing conditions can be irritated,\u201d says the team physiotherapist Patrick Custance. \u201cThe first day or two we want to get them active and moving, plus doing lots of stretching and soft-tissue work.\u201d Following a quiet Friday, nervous energy is building in the squad as they await their first track session. With the world championships bringing together riders from across the globe, the coronavirus has some teams on edge. The Australian delegation has been equipped with bottles of hand sanitiser; handshakes are banned. Upon seeing this correspondent, Morton offers an elbow bump instead. Australia are sharing their hotel with Japan, Ireland, New Zealand, Canada, the Netherlands, Malaysia and Mexico, and more than one nation has given its riders face masks. Although Jones is not overly concerned about the virus, he believes a renewed emphasis on hygiene is timely. \u201cHealth is one of our biggest risks at competitions,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are sharing food halls and training areas with athletes from everywhere.\u201d The team recently ran a special session on hygiene, emphasising the correct way to wash hands with the aid of special dyes. \u201cYou do all this hard work and then you could fall over at the last hurdle with a cold. You\u2019d be kicking yourself for ever.\u201d After a relaxing morning, the team gather for lunch in the hotel dining room. Carbohydrates and salads are in abundant supply. The Australians sometimes travel with their own chef, but on this occasion the nutritionist Jill Leckey has consulted with the local kitchen staff. Back in Adelaide the Irishwoman worked with each rider to tailor individual nutrition plans, and is keeping a surreptitious eye on their plates at meal-time. \u201cBy competition time the hard work has been done,\u201d Leckey says. \u201cOur main task now is getting them properly fuelled for race day.\u201d \u2018My goal is to smile every day\u2019 3pm, Saturday: hotel lobby With only a handful of training sessions and team meetings scheduled between arrival and competition, the wait can drag and nerves occasionally fray. \u201cSometimes I wish it was already race day,\u201d says Decker. In the final moments before a big event, track cycling can become as much a mental challenge as a physical endeavour. \u201cDistractions are critical in these last few days,\u201d says the sprinter McCulloch. \u201cI used to really struggle \u2013 there is so much time to fill, but now I really enjoy this period of time. I don\u2019t have to worry about anything.\u201d McCulloch does yoga and watches Netflix, while other athletes play boardgames or read. The hotel has a fussball table, which proved popular with the men\u2019s pursuit team. \u201cMy goal for this world championships is to smile every day,\u201d McCulloch says. \u201cSo far my smiles haven\u2019t been forced!\u201d Psychologist Anderson works intensively with each athlete ahead of races. \u201cWe create competition plans, so athletes know how to self-regulate anxiety and other factors relevant to their performance in the lead up to and during competition,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are trying to develop their understanding that psychological functioning is as important to high performance as the things they do from a physical and technical perspective\u201d Having a positive team culture certainly helps, and the Australians are well-known among other nations for making the most noise at mealtime. \u201cWe are fortunate,\u201d says endurance rider Sam Welsford. \u201cWe have a good tradition \u2013 we know when to switch on and when to switch off. That\u2019s important, otherwise you can get caught up in it all.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s too late\u2019 6pm, Saturday: velodrome Above the team pits in Berlin\u2019s cavernous velodrome, dozens of national flags hang down from the roof. As the Australians walk into the arena for the first time, more than one stops to gaze up at the blue and white standard they are here to represent. The UCI staggers team training times, and in the evening slot only New Zealand are using the track alongside Australia \u2013 representatives of the neighbouring nations chat amiably. As the riders brace themselves for their first ride, mechanics buzz about preparing bikes and soigneurs set up a refuelling station. Both endurance and sprint teams are taking to the track, although a fairly relaxed session is planned. One coach\u2019s notebook has just two objectives listed \u2013 \u201clearn the track\u201d and \u201cdecide on team line\u201d. \u201cThere are no final touches,\u201d says the sprint coach Nick Flyger. \u201cIt is all planned, it is all rehearsed. At this point we are trying not to change things \u2013 it\u2019s too late.\u201d Flyger arrived earlier in the day and is battling jetlag; he became a parent with partner Anna Meares just just two weeks ago, and the lack of sleep is evident. Flyger\u2019s male sprinters face the most pressure in Berlin: they are the only section of the Australia team with Tokyo qualification still up in the air. A late injury to Matthew Glaetzer compounded the pressure, with the star sprinter missing the competition. \u201cWe need to finish top-eight in the team sprint,\u201d says Flyger. \u201cIt is not an ideal situation, but we have the talent to get the job done.\u201d The riders train in a staccato manner, hopping on and off the track at regular intervals. Coaches offer advice, with tablet computers in-hand to display footage \u2013 video recordings are available from the track within seconds. Given the team\u2019s focus on Tokyo, the sprinters have not fully tapered: they are still doing strength-training during the buildup to competition. But even the slight dip in intensity over the past week means the first session back on the track hurts. \u201cIt is a weird feeling,\u201d says Morton, \u201ca bit like getting sick on holiday. But I have done enough of these now to know it is normal.\u201d After post-training debriefs, aided by timing splits and graphs, the riders rug up before they confront the icy Berlin weather. Jones, an Englishman headhunted from Team Sky to lead Australia following the Rio disappointment, has a final word with staff before departing on the tail of his riders. Was he happy with the first training session? \u201cNever completely,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are always a few niggly bits here and there. We have to be constantly changing and evolving. If we didn\u2019t have a problem, I would probably create one.\u201d \u2018This will be a real dog fight\u2019 6.15pm, Sunday: hotel room With a rest-day scheduled for Monday, the Australians have just one velodrome session remaining on Tuesday before the world championships begin. Squeezed into a modest hotel room as rain pours outside, the female team pursuit squad are gathering for video analysis. Five riders and three coaches make themselves comfortable in the small space, as the sports scientist Sian Barris loads footage from a session earlier that afternoon. The team discuss the nuances of the Berlin velodrome \u2013 every track is different, and this one contrasts with their Adelaide track. \u201cYou need to go later than you want, and just trust you\u2019ll get the boost on the drop,\u201d says Annette Edmondson as they analyse each other\u2019s swing (when a rider exits from the front and re-joins at the back).

      "bodyText": "I can see the logic of the emergency planners wanting to temporarily close schools in areas hit by coronavirus (UK planning: Schools may be closed if number of cases surges, 25 February) but no mention is made that these closures need to be accompanied by all those children staying at home for the duration of the closures. If not, then there will be potentially hundreds of children running around the areas in question. And if the children are to stay in their homes, then what about their parents? Shouldn\u2019t these areas be closed down altogether \u2013 as in Italy and other countries \u2013 or would it be simply left to people to \u201cself-isolate\u201d? Disturbingly, and despite being told that the Department of Health and the NHS are well prepared for any UK coronavirus cases, the government\u2019s response to a pandemic will not be to impose any travel or movement restrictions because of the \u201clack of scientific evidence on the impact on internal travel restrictions on transmissions\u201d. Sounds like a \u201cwe\u2019ll suck it and see\u201d approach. Gary Bennett Exeter \u2022 Having flown to the UK from Venice to Manchester on Monday night, you can image my surprise to not experience any checks on temperature or indeed anything else (Time running out to contain coronavirus, experts warn, 24 February). We were checked for our temperatures on arrival in Venice on Friday, and since then the Carnevale has been postponed and nearby areas have been put into lockdown. Is the UK taking this threat seriously? Philip Collier Bolton \u2022 A year ago I published a novel, \u2013 The Zeno Effect \u2013 exploring the social and political consequences of an aggressive, genetically engineered viral pandemic. While I do not expect the present Covid-19 crisis to reach the heights of my fictional equivalent, I have no doubt that it will prove to be a pandemic of significant proportions. As a sociologist, what engaged me in the novel was the decay and collapse of social order in the wake of rampant disease. Public discussion of the coronavirus event has not yet much touched upon this possibility, tending to focus on more immediate economic consequences. However, while affluent countries with highly developed health systems are likely to be able to protect themselves against such social disorder, poor countries are surely not in a position to do so. In these circumstances it is vital that rich nations offer significant aid to the poor, not simply out of common humanity \u2013 although definitely that \u2013 but also because the knock-on effects of widespread societal collapse will be long-term and terrible for us all.

Lombardy and Veneto, where the majority of coronavirus cases are, are among Italy\u2019s wealthiest regions and make up between 25% and 30% of the country\u2019s GDP. \u201cThe main factor, and most worrying one, is the supply stock, in the sense that people aren\u2019t going to work and therefore production is lower than usual,\u201d said Francesco Giavazzi, an economics professor at Milan\u2019s Bocconi University. \u201cCommerce has also been disrupted, with products not arriving where they\u2019re supposed to arrive.\u201d Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister, said the economic fallout would be \u201cvery strong\u201d but was hopeful that the contagion would soon be under control. Enrico Giovannini, an economist and professor at Rome\u2019s Tor Vergata university, said Italy\u2019s ability to limit the damage would mostly depend on the political reaction. \u201cThe coronavirus has come at a time when businesses were already being very cautious,\u201d he said. \u201cOn top of that, there is the immediate economic impact of cancelled cultural and sporting events as well as the reduction of train services. A strong political response, particularly in regards to fiscal policies, will be decisive in confronting the economic shock.\u201d \u201cSo many people have been coming in for face masks since Thursday,\u201d said Isidoro Colaizzo, who owns the chemist opposite the cathedral. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any left but are expecting a delivery in the next few days. The fear was to be expected, but I want to assure people that they are in safe hands and authorities are doing everything to contain this.\u201d",

Despite warnings from experts that the quarantine of passengers and staff on the Diamond Princess ship <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/18/global-health-experts-question-cruise-ship-coronavirus-quarantine-measures\">may have been counterproductive</a>, allowing the virus to spread, tourists fear they may be in for a similarly long stay at the hotel.</p> <p>Hannah Green, 27, from Hertfordshire, who is staying with her boyfriend and one-year-old son, told PA Media: \u201cWe woke up to a note under our door this morning saying for health reasons not to leave our room.</p> <p>\u201cI called downstairs to reception as soon as I saw it and they wouldn\u2019t tell us anything. So I quickly got on my phone and googled and saw a man had tested positive for coronavirus so I basically assumed it was that.</p> <p>\u201cBut since then, we\u2019ve had nothing from the hotel \u2013 no one has told us anything or what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>She said that since arriving on Saturday they had experienced a \u201choliday for hell\u201d, having also been confined to the hotel on Sunday because of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/feb/24/canary-islands-sandstorm-leaves-tourists-stranded-in-pictures\">the sandstorm that struck the Canary Islands.</a></p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in our room with the baby,\u201d said Green. We\u2019re worried for the baby \u2026 I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be allowed to leave. We don\u2019t want to be here. We\u2019re fed up now.\u201d</p> <p>The four-star H10 Costa Adeje Palace, located on the seafront, has 467 rooms, four pools and three restaurants. The quarantine meant customers missed lunch, forcing them to raid their minibars, although guests said they received food packages later in the afternoon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/tenerife-zip/giv-3902OOCMjc1XmEFw/\" data-alt=\"Map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/tenerife-zip/giv-3902OOCMjc1XmEFw/\">Map</a> </figure>  <p>Steve McHardy, 53, an estate agent from Kinross, in eastern Scotland, said he and his wife Susan, also 53, were supposed to leave on Tuesday but woke up to messages from friends who live on the island telling them of the situation. They decided to sunbathe instead but but then were told to go to their room around lunchtime, he said.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no indication of whether we\u2019ll get out when we\u2019ve been tested or after 14 days,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cPeople questioned how many doctors are coming. If there\u2019s 1,000 people, you don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take to be tested and how they will decide in what order people are tested.\u201d</p> <p>He praised hotel staff but said information had not been forthcoming. \u201cWe\u2019ve got jobs and animals to go back to,\u201d he said before adding with resignation: \u201cIt is what it is. It\u2019s day one; if I\u2019m here in 17 days\u2019 time, it might be a different conversation.\u201d</p> <p>David Hoon, 60, and Pamela Scott, 63, from Matlock, Derbyshire, said the situation was very worrying.</p> <p>\u201cNobody is telling us what\u2019s going on, how long this is going to last and who is going to feed us,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8040361/New-coronavirus-fears-tourists-Italian-doctor-tests-positive-holidaying-Tenerife.html\">Hoon told MailOnline</a>. \u201cThe way this has been handled is a disgrace.</p> <p>\u201cThe hotel is like a ghost house and my fear is that by trapping us inside it, we stand more chance of catching the coronavirus. This whole thing is very worrying.\u201d</p> <p>A message on the hotel\u2019s website said it would be closed until 15 March. It said it was \u201cproviding customers and hotel staff all the necessary care and attention so that, despite the inconveniences this situation may cause, they are taken care of in the best way possible\u201d.</p> <p>The hotel was locked down after an Italian doctor complained of feeling ill and tested positive for the virus on Monday.

      "bodyText": "British tourists have been left in limbo waiting to learn their fate after the Tenerife hotel they are staying in was placed in lockdown because of coronavirus fears. Guests were confined to their rooms after an Italian doctor who stayed at the hotel tested positive for the potentially deadly virus. Despite warnings from experts that the quarantine of passengers and staff on the Diamond Princess ship may have been counterproductive, allowing the virus to spread, tourists fear they may be in for a similarly long stay at the hotel. Hannah Green, 27, from Hertfordshire, who is staying with her boyfriend and one-year-old son, told PA Media: \u201cWe woke up to a note under our door this morning saying for health reasons not to leave our room. \u201cI called downstairs to reception as soon as I saw it and they wouldn\u2019t tell us anything. So I quickly got on my phone and googled and saw a man had tested positive for coronavirus so I basically assumed it was that. \u201cBut since then, we\u2019ve had nothing from the hotel \u2013 no one has told us anything or what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d She said that since arriving on Saturday they had experienced a \u201choliday for hell\u201d, having also been confined to the hotel on Sunday because of the sandstorm that struck the Canary Islands. \u201cWe\u2019re in our room with the baby,\u201d said Green. We\u2019re worried for the baby \u2026 I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be allowed to leave. We don\u2019t want to be here. We\u2019re fed up now.\u201d The four-star H10 Costa Adeje Palace, located on the seafront, has 467 rooms, four pools and three restaurants. The quarantine meant customers missed lunch, forcing them to raid their minibars, although guests said they received food packages later in the afternoon. Steve McHardy, 53, an estate agent from Kinross, in eastern Scotland, said he and his wife Susan, also 53, were supposed to leave on Tuesday but woke up to messages from friends who live on the island telling them of the situation. They decided to sunbathe instead but but then were told to go to their room around lunchtime, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no indication of whether we\u2019ll get out when we\u2019ve been tested or after 14 days,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cPeople questioned how many doctors are coming. If there\u2019s 1,000 people, you don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take to be tested and how they will decide in what order people are tested.\u201d He praised hotel staff but said information had not been forthcoming. \u201cWe\u2019ve got jobs and animals to go back to,\u201d he said before adding with resignation: \u201cIt is what it is. It\u2019s day one; if I\u2019m here in 17 days\u2019 time, it might be a different conversation.\u201d David Hoon, 60, and Pamela Scott, 63, from Matlock, Derbyshire, said the situation was very worrying. \u201cNobody is telling us what\u2019s going on, how long this is going to last and who is going to feed us,\u201d Hoon told MailOnline. \u201cThe way this has been handled is a disgrace. \u201cThe hotel is like a ghost house and my fear is that by trapping us inside it, we stand more chance of catching the coronavirus. This whole thing is very worrying.\u201d A message on the hotel\u2019s website said it would be closed until 15 March. It said it was \u201cproviding customers and hotel staff all the necessary care and attention so that, despite the inconveniences this situation may cause, they are taken care of in the best way possible\u201d. The hotel was locked down after an Italian doctor complained of feeling ill and tested positive for the virus on Monday. The following day, the regional government announced that his wife had also tested positive. The Italian couple are thought to have spent six days at the four-star seafront hotel, which is used by the package holiday firms Tui and Jet2Holidays. They are believed to be from the north of Italy, where most of the country\u2019s 283 cases have been reported. On Tuesday afternoon, the hotel, on the outskirts of Adeje, was guarded by police officers in face masks who declined to speak to the media, and a red barrier had been erected a few hundred metres from the main entrance. The shops, bars and restaurants inside had been sealed off, and staff who had turned up in the morning had been told to go home. A letter sent by managers to guests said they had to stay in their rooms. \u201cH10 Hotels has implemented all health and operational recommendations from the health authorities to ensure the safety and wellbeing of customers and employees,\u201d the hotel said. \u201cAdditionally, we are providing customers and hotel staff all the necessary care and attention so that, despite the inconveniences this situation may cause, they are taken care of in the best way possible.\u201d Another British guest told Reuters he was among those in quarantine and complained of a lack of information. \u201cWe can see from the window there are security officers outside the hotel and about 50 hotel employees,\u201d Christopher Betts said on the phone from his hotel room, adding that guests were asked to remain in their rooms. Betts said they had been allowed to have breakfast in the hotel restaurant but added: \u201cWe have received no information whatsoever.\u201d He said he had not been tested for the virus. Ashotel, the association of hoteliers on Tenerife and four other Canary islands, called for calm and said the established protocols were in effect. \u201cThe hotel where the affected tourist was staying is doing everything it can to deal with the situation and is demonstrating complete responsibility and following all the steps laid out in the protocol,\u201d said a spokeswoman. \u201cThe situation inside the hotel is normal; all the customers are being kept informed about what\u2019s going and are cooperating fully when it comes to following the recommendations laid out by the authorities.\u201d",

As things stand, he is set to pay 400p-a-pop for a 16.7% slice of the luxury carmaker, versus a market price that fell as low as 360p on Tuesday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/25/coronavirus-live-updates-outbreak-latest-news-italy-italia-deaths-symptoms-china-stocks-wall-street-dow-jones-economy-falls\">Coronavirus: Europe on alert as four more deaths reported in Italy \u2013 updates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Life looked different when debt-laden Aston Martin unveiled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/31/aston-martin-to-enter-f1-from-2021-under-500m-rescue-deal\">its rescue proposals</a> at the end of last month. Stroll seemed to be off to a flyer as the share price shot up to 500p on relief that the Canadian billionaire would soon be installed as executive chairman.</p> <p>But the coronavirus has changed the short-term outlook for all carmakers selling into the Chinese market. Jaguar Land Rover said last week it was selling \u201czero\u201d cars in the country, so it\u2019s not surprising that Aston Martin\u2019s shares have retreated: China is a key target for its new SUV model.</p> <p>Is Stroll free to try to renegotiate the terms of his consortium\u2019s investment, which still has \u201cproposed\u201d status until shareholders give approval? It\u2019s unclear. The small print merely talked about \u201ccertain customary termination rights\u201d.</p> <p>Would Stroll wish to drive a harder bargain, though? That\u2019s probably more relevant and, actually, there may be no reason for Aston Martin\u2019s beleaguered board to fret. Stroll may take the long view that, when you\u2019re planning to invest over many years, being a few million quid down at the outset matters little.</p> <p>On the other hand, only 100% clarity counts in the current investment climate. Aston Martin reports full-year numbers on Thursday, which is the point at which the Stroll placing is meant to move to the next stage, paving the way for a follow-on \u00a3318m rights issue that still needs to be underwritten.</p> <p>In other words, there are many elements in the rescue package and all are essential. Best to hit the accelerator.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Hammerson feels the hurt</h2> <p>\u201cThe magnitude of the challenge facing UK retail is significant,\u201d declared Hammerson chief executive David Atkins. He should have reached that obvious conclusion half a decade ago, before the owner of the Bullring shopping centre in Birmingham and Brent Cross in London got drenched in the shopkeeping storm.</p> <p>An earlier disposal programme might have spared his shareholders some of the misery that culminated on Tuesday with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/25/bullring-hammerson-dividend-shopping-centre\">a 46% cut in next year\u2019s dividend</a>.</p> <p>Hammerson has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/21/hammerson-offloads-seven-uk-retail-parks\">flogging assets</a> in the past year to get borrowings under control and avoid a full-blown crisis of the sort that has engulfed rival Intu, owner of Manchester\u2019s Trafford Centre. Jolly good, but being less ugly than Intu is not much of a boast. Hammerson\u2019s self-help measures should have come earlier.</p> <p>Instead, back in 2017, Atkins and chairman David Tyler came up with the baffling idea of bidding for Intu itself. That \u00a33.4bn deal was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/18/hammerson-abandons-planned-34bn-buyout-of-rival-intu\">shot down by Hammerson\u2019s own shareholders</a>, who could see, even if the board couldn\u2019t, the madness of doubling down on shopping centres.</p> <p>In a different sector, the board might have walked the plank after such a humiliation but, in the comfortable world of property, life rarely works that way. Atkins has been in charge since 2009 and, even at the point at which the divi is whacked, there seems to be no pressure on him to leave. Remarkable.</p> <h2>The Barclays boss is in serious bother</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd559127e23e18c2182d397f1daca4d3154447fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd559127e23e18c2182d397f1daca4d3154447fd/0_167_5002_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jes Staley, the CEO at Barclays.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jes Staley, the CEO at Barclays.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Edward Bramson, in his latest broadside at Barclays, didn\u2019t go so far as to say chief executive Jes Staley should be fired over his links to Jeffrey Epstein, which is now the subject of a regulatory inquiry. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/25/barclays-attacked-by-activist-investor-over-ceos-epstein-links\">The activist merely wants the board to \u201ctreat these matters seriously\u201d.</a></p> <p>The Barclays chairman Nigel Higgins will rightly feel obliged to wait for the regulators\u2019 view, but Bramson\u2019s point about ending \u201cthe cycle of disruption\u201d is well made. The bank needs stability and Staley looks increasingly unlikely to provide it. A gentle glide to retirement at the end of next year, which seems to be the current plan, feels too leisurely.</p>",

      "bodyText": "At what point does the coronavirus crisis qualify as a \u201cmaterial adverse change\u201d for City deal-making purposes? Lawrence Stroll, would-be rescuer of Aston Martin, may be asking the question right now. As things stand, he is set to pay 400p-a-pop for a 16.7% slice of the luxury carmaker, versus a market price that fell as low as 360p on Tuesday. Life looked different when debt-laden Aston Martin unveiled its rescue proposals at the end of last month. Stroll seemed to be off to a flyer as the share price shot up to 500p on relief that the Canadian billionaire would soon be installed as executive chairman. But the coronavirus has changed the short-term outlook for all carmakers selling into the Chinese market. Jaguar Land Rover said last week it was selling \u201czero\u201d cars in the country, so it\u2019s not surprising that Aston Martin\u2019s shares have retreated: China is a key target for its new SUV model. Is Stroll free to try to renegotiate the terms of his consortium\u2019s investment, which still has \u201cproposed\u201d status until shareholders give approval? It\u2019s unclear. The small print merely talked about \u201ccertain customary termination rights\u201d. Would Stroll wish to drive a harder bargain, though? That\u2019s probably more relevant and, actually, there may be no reason for Aston Martin\u2019s beleaguered board to fret. Stroll may take the long view that, when you\u2019re planning to invest over many years, being a few million quid down at the outset matters little. On the other hand, only 100% clarity counts in the current investment climate. Aston Martin reports full-year numbers on Thursday, which is the point at which the Stroll placing is meant to move to the next stage, paving the way for a follow-on \u00a3318m rights issue that still needs to be underwritten. In other words, there are many elements in the rescue package and all are essential. Best to hit the accelerator. Hammerson feels the hurt \u201cThe magnitude of the challenge facing UK retail is significant,\u201d declared Hammerson chief executive David Atkins. He should have reached that obvious conclusion half a decade ago, before the owner of the Bullring shopping centre in Birmingham and Brent Cross in London got drenched in the shopkeeping storm. An earlier disposal programme might have spared his shareholders some of the misery that culminated on Tuesday with a 46% cut in next year\u2019s dividend. Hammerson has been flogging assets in the past year to get borrowings under control and avoid a full-blown crisis of the sort that has engulfed rival Intu, owner of Manchester\u2019s Trafford Centre. Jolly good, but being less ugly than Intu is not much of a boast. Hammerson\u2019s self-help measures should have come earlier. Instead, back in 2017, Atkins and chairman David Tyler came up with the baffling idea of bidding for Intu itself. That \u00a33.4bn deal was shot down by Hammerson\u2019s own shareholders, who could see, even if the board couldn\u2019t, the madness of doubling down on shopping centres. In a different sector, the board might have walked the plank after such a humiliation but, in the comfortable world of property, life rarely works that way. Atkins has been in charge since 2009 and, even at the point at which the divi is whacked, there seems to be no pressure on him to leave. Remarkable. The Barclays boss is in serious bother Edward Bramson, in his latest broadside at Barclays, didn\u2019t go so far as to say chief executive Jes Staley should be fired over his links to Jeffrey Epstein, which is now the subject of a regulatory inquiry. The activist merely wants the board to \u201ctreat these matters seriously\u201d. The Barclays chairman Nigel Higgins will rightly feel obliged to wait for the regulators\u2019 view, but Bramson\u2019s point about ending \u201cthe cycle of disruption\u201d is well made. The bank needs stability and Staley looks increasingly unlikely to provide it. A gentle glide to retirement at the end of next year, which seems to be the current plan, feels too leisurely.",

      "bodyText": "The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned that the coronavirus outbreak could cause \u201csevere disruption\u201d to the lives of ordinary Americans, and urged families and communities to start making preparations. The extent of the spread of the virus in the US is uncertain, as the CDC stopped the distribution of coronavirus testing kits after they were found to be flawed. Working testing kits are now available in only a handful of states, and it is not clear when new kits will be ready. Donald Trump told journalists in India on Tuesday that coronavirus is \u201cvery well under control in our country\u201d and \u201cis going to go away\u201d. However, the head of immunization at the CDC, Nancy Messonnier, said that disruption to everyday life may be severe as the virus spreads among local communities. \u201cAs more and more countries experience community spread, successful containment at our borders becomes harder and harder,\u201d Messonnier said in a telephone press briefing. \u201cUltimately, we expect we will see community spread in this country. It\u2019s not so much a question of if this will happen any more, but rather more exactly when this will happen, and how many people in this country will have severe illness.\u201d In the absence of a vaccine or medicines, other methods would be needed to contain the spread of the disease, including possible school closures, and telecommuting where possible instead of travelling to workplaces. \u201cI understand this whole situation may seem overwhelming, and that disruption to everyday life may be severe. But these are things that people need to start thinking about now,\u201d Messonier said. \u201cI had a conversation with my family over breakfast this morning, and I told my children that \u2013 while I didn\u2019t think they were at risk \u2013 right now, we as a family, need to be preparing for significant disruption of our lives.\u201d The CDC acknowledged that the test kits it began distributing to state authorities earlier this month have been found to be faulty. The agency said in a statement that \u201cperformance issues were identified related to a problem in the manufacturing of one of the reagents which led to laboratories not being able to verify the test performance\u201d. Messonier said that 12 \u201cstates and localities\u201d had working test kits, but according to independent health experts, that overall number includes only five states. \u201cI am frustrated like I know many of you are that we have had issues with our kit, and I want to assure you that we are working to modify the kit and hope to hand out a new version to state or local jurisdictions soon,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cWe are working as fast as we can.\u201d Jeremy Konyndyk, who led the Obama administration\u2019s response to the Ebola outbreak in 2014, said it was unclear why the US was lagging behind the rest of the world on testing. \u201cIt is puzzling to me that the government has been unable so far to resolve that problem, at a time when most other countries that are facing the disease have been able to do testing at a much larger scale,\u201d Konyndyk said. \u201cWe have a lot of people in the government working very, very, very hard on this, but we do not have the kind of fully mobilized US government response that we need.\u201d He also expressed alarm at the gulf between the Trump reassurances and the situation being presented by the president\u2019s own officials. \u201cThe president\u2019s overarching priority here seems to be much more about keeping the markets calm than taking every measure to keep Americans safe, and that worries me,\u201d Konyndyk said. \u201cAnd it also makes me wonder if they are leaving some [preventive] options on the table for fear of spooking the markets.\u201d Stock prices plunged at new reports showing the the worldwide spread of the virus.

Top stories Iran\u2019s deputy health minister said he has contracted the coronavirus and placed himself in isolation, a day after appearing feverish at a press conference in which he played down its spread in the shrine city of Qom and said mass quarantines were unnecessary. A thousand guests and workers at a hotel in Tenerife have been quarantined after an Italian doctor and his wife tested positive for coronavirus, and as the first cases of the disease were detected in Austria, Croatia, Switzerland and mainland Spain. A further three people have died from the virus in northern Italy according to a local official. Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh claimed on Monday that the coronavirus outbreak is being \u201cweaponised\u201d by the media to bring down Donald Trump when in fact it is simply a version of the \u201ccommon cold\u201d. Follow the latest on our live blog. The federal government is spending up to $2m buying water from a Queensland agribusiness company, Eastern Australia Agriculture, in a bid to keep an internationally significant wetland from dying, despite paying $80m to the same company three years ago for water rights for the same purpose. The $80m purchase of overland flows from Eastern Australia Agriculture has been controversial and is now under scrutiny by Australian National Audit Office. The extremely large purchase was done without tender by the former agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce, who concluded that the opportunity was exceptional and that it warranted direct negotiations. The government\u2019s controversial cashless debit card scheme is causing more harm than good, a new study has found, as are other compulsory welfare income management programs. Researchers from four universities said in a new report released on Wednesday that they had \u201cuncovered an overwhelming number of negative experiences\u201d stemming from the card, ranging from feelings of \u201cstigma, shame and frustration\u201d to practical issues such as cardholders simply not having enough cash for essential items. \u201cOur research is certainly not the first to suggest these set of policy measures require a fundamental rethink,\u201d the study said. Australia Three baboons escaped from their truck in Sydney Tuesday afternoon, while being transported to a major Sydney hospital so one of them could have a vasectomy. Callers to Sydney talkback radio station 2GB were first to report they\u2019d seen primates running about the area of the Royal Prince Alfred (RPA) hospital. Environmental concerns are getting top billing in the Infrastructure Australia priority list for the first time. In its latest list, released on Wednesday, Infrastructure Australia said climate change was altering the water cycle and was projected to cause sea level rises of 0.4 to 0.6 metres. Federal government plans to establish a nuclear waste dump in South Australia face a Senate roadblock, as Labor delays a decision on whether to support it and native title holders prepare to come to Canberra to lobby against the nominated site. Peter Dutton has declared that \u201cleftwing terrorism\u201d includes Islamist extremism after being blasted by Labor for applying false equivalence in the national security debate. The world Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president ousted during Arab spring has died at 91. Egypt\u2019s autocratic former president ruled with an iron fist for three decades before being toppled during the Arab spring protests in 2011. Mike Bloomberg has deleted controversial tweets that sarcastically praised dictators in an attempt to damage his rival Democratic presidential candidate senator Bernie Sanders after garnering intense backlash online. The verdict in the New York case against Harvey Weinstein is only the beginning of his prosecution, with separate charges filed in Los Angeles against the disgraced producer. Julian Assange was handcuffed 11 times, stripped naked twice and had his case files confiscated after the first day of his extradition hearing, according to his lawyers, who complained of interference in his ability to take part.

      "bodyText": "Mounting fears over the spread of the coronavirus led to another global market sell-off on Tuesday, with investor panic wiping nearly \u00a3100bn off the value of Britain\u2019s biggest companies in the past two days. The FTSE 100 index closed at its lowest level in a year, down 1.9% at 7,018, lowering the value of Britain\u2019s blue-chip companies by about \u00a335bn. It followed a major sell-off on Monday, when \u00a362bn was wiped off the value of the index. Travel companies have been among the worst hit by the market turmoil. The cruise operator Carnival, whose Diamond Princess ship was the scene of a major outbreak, was the biggest faller on Tuesday, down 5.9%. Markets across Europe suffered heavy losses and Wall Street was sharply lower as investors digested the implications of the apparent acceleration in the number of new cases in Europe and the Middle East, after it initially spread from the Chinese city of Wuhan throughout Asia. Italy is the worst-affected country in Europe, and Austria, Croatia, mainland Spain and Switzerland all reported their first confirmed cases on Tuesday. Those reports added to concerns that the outbreak will cause significant disruption across the European economy, with financial services, travel, tourism and consumer goods demand all expected to take a hit. The outbreak is expected to cause a decline in the personal luxury market of between \u20ac30bn and \u20ac40bn (\u00a325bn-\u00a333bn), as sales have come to a virtual standstill in China and are suffering in Asia and Europe from the fall in Chinese travellers, according to a report by the asset manager AllianceBernstein and Boston Consulting Group. Travel companiesare already counting the cost of measures to contain the disease, as well as a slump in demand for travel to affected areas that is expected to push down demand for air travel in the Asia-Pacific region by about 8% this year, according to the International Air Transport Association. Qatar Airways on Tuesday switched to smaller planes for its flights to South Korea and Iran, both of which are in the grip of serious outbreaks. Qatar had previously cancelled all flights to major Chinese cities until the end of March. United Airlines, the world\u2019s fourth-largest airline by revenue, withdrew its financial forecasts for the year because of the impact on demand for air travel. The investment banks Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank both restricted business travel by their employees to South Korea and the affected areas in northern Italy, as well as advising against non-essential travel. JP Morgan, Citigroup and Credit Suisse were also among the investment banks which curbed trips to northern Italy. Mastercard warned late on Monday that the impact on cross-border travel and business could cut two or three percentage points off its revenue growth forecasts for the first quarter, implying a hit of between $78m and $117m (\u00a360m-\u00a390m). However, Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy, said the UK economy could be less vulnerable than most if British people opted for \u201cstaycations\u201d over spending their cash abroad. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday that it wanted companies, hospitals, communities and schools to begin preparing to respond to the virus.

      "bodyText": "Schools could close and travel around the UK could be restricted under stepped-up government plans to deal with the coronavirus as its spread accelerates across Europe. Four countries registered new cases on Tuesday, while the death toll rose in Italy, which is struggling to contain the outbreak. England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a variety of things you need to look at, you look at things like school closures, you look at things like reducing transport. \u201cThe expectation is not that we will do all these things, the expectation is we will be looking systematically, using the science, at all the building blocks and balancing the effects against costs to society.\u201d Contingency planning may request that whole families self-isolate if one of them shows symptoms and, in a further expansion of British efforts to detect and contain the virus, patients who have flu and other breathing conditions will be tested. Health officials plan to start with patients in eight hospitals in England, including some in intensive care, and also at 100 primary care centres, including GP surgeries. Experts said the move would help show if the virus was spreading, although officials stressed there was no evidence that it was circulating in the community at the moment. So far, 13 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK but have not suffered any major setback to their health as a result of Covid-19, the illness the virus can trigger. Nevertheless, concern about the proliferation of cases in northern Italy prompted a dozen UK schools to send home pupils and the teachers who accompanied them on half-term skiing trips in the Italian Alps, telling them to self-isolate for 14 days after their return. The schools include ones in County Antrim in Northern Ireland, Pembrokeshire in Wales, Guernsey in the Channel Islands and others in Cheshire, Liverpool, Yorkshire, Berkshire, Teesside and Cornwall. Despite advice from Public Health England and the Department for Education that schools should stay open, two closed completely to all pupils for deep-cleaning. Trinity Catholic college in Middlesbrough said it would reopen on 3 March, while Cransley school in Northwich, Cheshire is shut until 2 March after the headteacher said a number of pupils were showing \u201cflu-like symptoms\u201d. The schools\u2019 response came amid growing confusion over the government\u2019s advice on whether it is safe to travel to northern Italy, with the health secretary and chief medical officer expressing conflicting views. Whitty initially said advising people to avoid travel to the area was \u201cnot a reasonable thing to do\u201d. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, contradicted that, signalling that he thought it best to avoid northern Italy, where the bulk of the country\u2019s 320 positive cases have emerged. Asked on Sky News if he would fly to Italy, he replied: \u201cCertainly southern Italy is perfectly reasonable to travel to.\u201d But when asked if he would travel to the north, he said: \u201cI\u2019m not planning on [it], put it that way.\u201d On Tuesday evening, official Foreign Office guidance clarified the situation, advising against all but essential travel to 11 towns in northern Italy. All 11 deaths in Italy so far have occurred in elderly people who were suffering from underlying health conditions, the youngest of whom was 62. However, the virus is spreading there, with new cases detected in Tuscany, Liguria and Sicily, well south of the centre in Lombardy. Public Health England said that anyone who has been to a large area of the region above but not including Pisa, Florence and Rimini should self-isolate for a fortnight if they develop flu-like symptoms on returning to the UK. The advice came as: The virus appeared in more European countries, with confirmed cases reported in Spain, Austria, Switzerland and Croatia. Nearly \u00a3100bn was wiped off the value of Britain\u2019s biggest companies in 48 hours, with the FTSE 100 index closing at its lowest level in a year, reducing the value of Britain\u2019s blue-chip companies by about \u00a335bn. British tourists were among 1,000 holidaymakers and workers quarantined in a hotel in Tenerife after an Italian doctor and his wife tested positive for coronavirus. Austria also placed an Innsbruck hotel under lockdown when an Italian receptionist was found to have contracted the virus. The Irish Rugby Football Union called for an urgent meeting with the country\u2019s health minister after he called for the Six Nations rugby match between Ireland and Italy to be postponed because of the risk posed by Covid-19. The government banned the \u201cparallel export\u201d of two drugs \u2013 one for treating HIV, the other a malaria medication \u2013 that are being tested as potential treatments for the virus. Parallel exporting is when firms buy medicines for the UK and resell them for a higher price abroad. The number of confirmed cases in Spain rose to seven on Tuesday after an Italian woman living in Barcelona tested positive following a recent trip to northern Italy. Spanish health authorities had already identified two confirmed cases, one on the remote Canary island of La Gomera and another on the Balearic island of Mallorca. The Catalan case is the first detected in mainland Spain. About 1,000 holidaymakers at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel in south Tenerife have been told to stay in their rooms and were set to be tested for the virus, according to a guest.

The Labour leadership contest already feels like it has lasted an eternity and there\u2019s a fair chance that by the time it ends on 4 April half the country will never get to find out who has actually won because they will have died of the coronavirus.

So Rebecca Long-Bailey, Lisa Nandy and Keir Starmer took to the stage like an old band preparing to perform their greatest hits. They may have had their artistic differences along the way but they\u2019d miss each other if they weren\u2019t there. They\u2019ve been together so long now that they can now finish each others\u2019 sentences and they even laugh politely at the same gags they must have already heard countless times before. It\u2019s showbiz, baby.</p> \n<p>The hustings opened with a quick show of hands. How many people had already made up their minds who they were planning to vote for? Almost everyone stuck an arm in the air. And how many were open to the possibility of changing their minds? Almost every hand went down. Still, there were one or two votes still to be won and the band quickly fell into their familiar roles. Long-Bailey on bass, remaining somewhat in the shadows and struggling to make eye contact with the audience. Nandy on lead guitar with a few showstopping licks and Starmer on steady-as-she-goes rhythm guitar and vocals, the unifying force holding the act together.</p> \n<p>Still, the songs remained pretty much the same. Long-Bailey did deviate slightly from the script by saying that not all Labour\u2019s policies in the last election were totally ideal \u2013 a big concession from her \u2013 but she still felt like the continuity candidate trying to make out she was somehow different to Jeremy Corbyn. And maybe deep inside she is, but she just can\u2019t bring herself to admit it. She feels almost paralysed in the crossfire. Constrained by loyalty and afraid to bust out and say what she really thinks.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"857831f4-ed8c-4dc5-9e5c-f4e3092b4731\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Rebecca Long-Bailey</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A close ally of the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, the Salford MP and shadow business secretary has been groomed as a potential leftwing contender for the top job.</p>\n    <p><b>Pitch&nbsp;</b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/29/rebecca-long-bailey-labour-party-britain\">Promising to champion \u201cprogressive patriotism\u201d</a>.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Lisa Nandy</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The Wigan MP has built a reputation as a campaigner for her constituency and others like it, many of which have fallen to the Tories.

The latest volatility comes after the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention warned US citizens to prepare for an \u201cinevitable\u201d outbreak of the coronavirus within the United States. The heightened vigilance in the US comes as countries such as Iran, Italy and South Korea announced yesterday another jump in the number of reported cases of the coronavirus.</p> <p><strong>Volatility climbs further, as coronavirus reality hits</strong>: Market participants are becoming resigned to the fact that the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus may extend longer than previously anticipated. The heightened level of uncertainty saw the US VIX spike to fresh 14 month-highs, to trade above the 28 level overnight. US stocks took another plunge as a result, with the S&amp;P500 shedding around 3 per cent on Tuesday, paced by major falls in industrial, energy and materials stocks.

Within the past two weeks, the CDC said it would start to use the national flu surveillance tracking infrastructure to test patients who have flu symptoms for COVID-19 in five cities across the US. But elsewhere, tests are still not widely available. Recently, the Association of Public Health Laboratories said that only California, Nebraska, and Illinois had the capacity to test people for the virus. Compare this with Singapore and S. Korea, which have carried out significant testing. High case complication rates could swamp medical systems - According to recent studies we have seen from Wuhan, the case-complication rate (number of cases requiring ICU level of care) could be between 5-10%, suggesting that if there is a global break out, we could see hospitals swamped with acute cases.</p> <p>Our analysis of the WHO\u2019s published criteria for assessing if this is a pandemic shows these have been met already. What might an outbreak in the USA do to markets? - Imagine trying to quarantine a large city in the USA for a month, similar to how the Chinese have shut down Wuhan, or the way the Italians are trying to ring-fence 10 towns near Milan. Our working hypothesis is that it wouldn\u2019t work, and could cause panic on a scale that would spook markets.</p> <p>Our base case hypothesis is that a Trump government is unlikely to choose reduced economic activity, and supply chain disruption, so spread of the virus, if it were to emerge in the US, would be more likely.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48c15f049e0fceacda172c93442f137c768cf059\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48c15f049e0fceacda172c93442f137c768cf059/0_0_672_896/375.jpg\" alt=\"Jefferies research on coronavirus\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e5549778f086a28115b2525\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-25T16:22:49.654Z\">4.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Stocks are really on the slide in New York.</strong></p> <p>The Dow has lost another 1.3%, or 374 points, on top of the 1,000 shed on Monday. </p> <p>Sentiment is shifting fast, in the face of more coronavirus infections.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e5545d98f08e13324749ece\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-25T16:06:22.044Z\">4.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Nearly every share on the FTSE 100 is down today, as fears of a Covid-19 pandemic ripple through the City again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a054a0a3c08021af0e7a3ad26e1093974491cdc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a054a0a3c08021af0e7a3ad26e1093974491cdc/0_0_822_391/500.jpg\" alt=\"The FTSE100\" width=\"500\" height=\"238\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The FTSE 100 today</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Refinitiv</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e5543788f086a28115b24c2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-25T15:59:02.019Z\">3.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>This latest selloff comes as new coronavirus cases are reported in Switzerland, Austria and Croatia.....</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/25/coronavirus-live-updates-outbreak-latest-news-italy-italia-deaths-symptoms-china-stocks-wall-street-dow-jones-economy-falls\">Coronavirus: Switzerland, Austria and Croatia report cases as Tenerife quarantines hotel \u2013 updates</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e5542248f08e13324749ea3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-25T15:51:22.660Z\">3.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>As things stand, the FTSE 100 index is on track to lose roughly another \u00a330bn today, on top of the \u00a362bn shed yesterday.</strong></p> <p>Every sector is down, led by consumer cyclicals (-2%), telecoms (-2%), energy (-2%), utilities (-1.9%) and banks (-1.9%).</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e553ec48f0811db2fafe428\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-25T15:41:02.797Z\">3.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Market sell-off accelerates</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>It\u2019s turning into another rout!</strong></p> <p>Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index is now down another 130 points, or 1.7%, at 7030, as we enter the final hour of trading.</p> <p>That\u2019s still a four-month low on an intraday basis, but would be the lowest closing level in a year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"517be175119394d0cfd0c9389d628d38e42a8267\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/517be175119394d0cfd0c9389d628d38e42a8267/0_0_1426_564/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The FTSE 100\" width=\"1000\" height=\"396\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The FTSE 100 over the last two years</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Refinitiv</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cruise operator Carnival is now down 5.7%, on fears that tourism will be badly hurt by the coronavirus, followed by Meggitt (which cited the virus as a threat this morning).</p> <p>Wall Street has fallen into the red too -- with the Dow down 168 points at 27,792.

Vessels need to wait 14 days until they are able to access the port and offload, slowing down US imports. For China, where the outbreak first began, the virus could topple China\u2019s dominant manufacturing position and companies will need to diversifying their supply chains. This could lead to more balanced global trade relationships, particularly if emerging manufacturing countries such as Vietnam are about to capitalise on the opportunity. We know Chinese GDP in the first and second quarter will be impacted by the effects of the Coronavirus and its likely supply chains will move to Vietnam. We\u2019ll also see more advanced goods such as tech going to India, and more apparel going to Bangladesh.</p> <p>\u201cThe automotive industry will also be affected by the Coronavirus. Supply chains are slowing down in China as manufacturing is not at its full capacity. Factories are opening back up but with only about 50% of the workforce.

      "bodyText": "Finally, here\u2019s our news story on today stock market turmoil: And our main liveblog on the coronavirus crisis is here: Goodnight! GW Jennifer Ellison, principal at B|O|S in San Francisco, told MarketWatch that the markets are in \u201cone of those spirals,\u201d \u201cObviously, the story is about the spread of the coronavirus that\u2019s spooked investors. Investors don\u2019t know how bad it will get.\u201d Tech stocks had a bad day, with Apple losing over 3%. Investors are very concerned that global supply chains are going to be badly hurt by Covid-19, if China\u2019s manufacturing doesn\u2019t return to normality soon. I think the Dow has just posted its fourth-biggest points drop ever. So, following the 1,000+ point slump yesterday, it\u2019s clearly suffered its biggest two-day points decline ever. But.. in percentage terms (which are more important), this week\u2019s slump is less serious. Still serious, though - nearly 7% in two days! Here\u2019s a handy explanation of today\u2019s market mayhem, from Kyle Rodda of IG: Global financial markets remain in a frenzy, as market participants price-in a potential global spread of the coronavirus. The latest volatility comes after the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention warned US citizens to prepare for an \u201cinevitable\u201d outbreak of the coronavirus within the United States. The heightened vigilance in the US comes as countries such as Iran, Italy and South Korea announced yesterday another jump in the number of reported cases of the coronavirus. Volatility climbs further, as coronavirus reality hits: Market participants are becoming resigned to the fact that the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus may extend longer than previously anticipated. The heightened level of uncertainty saw the US VIX spike to fresh 14 month-highs, to trade above the 28 level overnight. US stocks took another plunge as a result, with the S&amp;P500 shedding around 3 per cent on Tuesday, paced by major falls in industrial, energy and materials stocks. The spill takes the S&amp;P500\u2019s losses for the week to just shy of 7 per cent. Newsflash: Wall Street has suffered its second day of heavy losses. The Dow has just closed, down 3.15%. That is a loss of 879 points, to 27,081, on top of the 1,000 shed in yesterday\u2019s rout. Investors are clearly very worried about the latest jump in Covid-19 cases, including in Europe, and afraid there\u2019s lots more to come. Wall Street is staggering to the finishing line, after a torrid session. With 10 minutes left, the Dow is 789 points down at 27,171 (-2.82%), having been over 900 points south a few minutes earlier.,... The oil price has also fallen sharply today, hitting a two-week low. Again, that reflects fears of a global slowdown. Marketwatch has the details: West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery fell $1.53, or 3%, to settle at $49.90 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, for the lowest front-month contract finish since Feb. 10, according to Dow Jones Market Data. April Brent crude dropped $1.35, or 2.4%, to end at $54.95 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe. That was the lowest settlement since Feb. 11. Crumbs... with just ninety minutes to go, the Dow is flirting with its second quadruple-digit plunge in a row. It\u2019s now down 900 points. The worst-performing sectors in New York today are mining companies, industrial companies, banks and energy firms. They all suffer when investors worry that the global economy is stumbling, meaning less demand for iron ore, oil and manufactured foods -- and higher debt defaults. .....Make that down 3%! The Dow is now down 821 points this session, as the selloff intensifies dramatically. The US stock market is down 2.5% since Donald Trump tweeted that it was \u201cstarting to look very good to me!\u201d A fresh wave of selling has knocked the Dow down by almost 700 points, or 2.5%, to 27,270. That\u2019s its lowest level of 2020, and on track for its lowest close since the start of November last year. Despite Kudlow\u2019s best efforts, the Dow is now down 621 points today - knocking another 2.2% off the index. The White House has sent Larry Kudlow, head of the National Economic Council, into action to calm the market rout. Kudlow has tried his best, telling CNBC that the US economy is \u201cholding up nicely\u201d. He declared: \u201cWe have contained this. I won\u2019t say [it\u2019s] air-tight, but it\u2019s pretty close to air-tight,\u201d Kudlow added that while Covid-19 is a \u201chuman tragedy,\u201d it will probably also not be an \u201ceconomic tragedy.\u201d \u201cThere will be some stumbles. We\u2019re looking at numbers; it\u2019s a little iffy,\u201d But at the moment, the numbers that we\u2019re looking at ... there\u2019s no supply disruptions out there yet.\u201d But.... arguably it\u2019s too early to see the impact of the recent disruption in the economic data (certainly the \u2018hard\u2019 data that policymakers rely on). Also, the key to this crisis is government response. U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut says the US is falling short here: Ouch! The Dow is now down 2% today, having lost 579 points to trade at 27,381. American Express is the biggest faller, down over 4%, followed by chemicals firm Dow (3.8%), Visa (-3.6%) and Cisco (-3.3%). Here\u2019s the message that sent Wall Street sliding again today: While stocks are slumping again, Wall Street\u2019s fear index is rising. The VIX index, which tracks volatility, has jumped by over 8% today: Newsflash: US government bond prices have just hit a record high, as investors dash for safety. This has driven the yield, or interest rate, on 10-year Treasury bills down to just 1.32%, its lowest ever level. That indicates a lot of nervousness about US growth prospects in the face of the coronavirus threat. It also shows that investors who have been selling shares today are putting the money into safer assets (and US government bonds are as safe as it gets). Back in New York, stocks are hitting fresh lows as Americans are warned to prepare for Covid-19. The Dow Jones industrial average is now down 522.51 points, or 1.87%, in a fresh bout of anxious selling. The slide comes as America\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said people should prepare for COVID-19 to spread in their communities, following a jump in cases abroad. Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, warned: \u201cWe really want to prepare the American public for the possibility that their lives will be disrupted because of this pandemic\u201d Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics reckons the UK economy is less vulnerable to the coronavirus crisis than other countries, for several reasons including: Ample spare industrial capacity means manufacturing output can recover quickly after disruptions fade. U.K. tourists\u2019 spending abroad exceeds overseas tourists\u2019 spending in Britain by 50%; less flying can lift GDP. We see no sign yet that U.K. consumers are altering their behaviour in surveys or online search data. JP Morgan\u2019s Jamie Dimon has, it seems, found a reason to be cheerful about coronavirus: The World Economic Forum would certainly be a good place for Covid-19 to spread -- as thousands of attendees cram into its congress centre (and the parties outside). However.... WEF wrapped up a month ago, so attendees would surely have been struck down by now. The Financial Times have done a good piece about the fall in junk bond prices -- which is another sign that investors are very worried. Here\u2019s a flavour: Fears over the impact of the coronavirus outbreak sparked a sharp sell-off in junk bonds on Monday, pushing borrowing costs for the riskiest energy companies to their highest level in more than three years. The additional yield, or spread, on a widely watched high-yield energy bond index run by Ice Data Services rose to 8.35 percentage points above benchmark US Treasuries, its highest level since August 2016, as investors reacted to news that the virus had spread further in countries from Italy to Iran. It marked the biggest one-day rise in borrowing costs for these riskier energy companies since an intense bout of selling in early 2016, when surging oil supply undercut prices. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the worst trading days we have seen in recent memory,\u201d said John McClain, a portfolio manager at Diamond Hill Capital Management. \u201cIt\u2019s a sanity check for investors. We had the melt-up in December and people have been ignoring the tell-tale warning signs this year. Every European stock market has suffered heavy losses again today. Switzerland was one of the worst hit, after it recorded its first coronavirus case today. Banks and utilities performed particularly badly, in a session in which every sector fell. Here\u2019s the closing prices: FTSE 100: down 138 points, or 1.95%, at 7,017 German DAX: down 244 points or 1.9% at 12,790 French CAC: down 112 points or 1.9% at 5,679 Italian FTSE MIB: down 336 points or 1.4% at 23,090 Swiss SMI: down 234 points or 2.2% at 10,478 Spanish IBEX: down 232 points or 2.45% at 9,250 I\u2019ve just double-checked...and indeed, almost \u00a335bn was wiped off the FTSE 100 today. That means the index has shed \u00a397bn this week already. Newsflash: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index of top shares has ended the day at its lowest closing level in a year. The Footsie has closed at 7017 points, down 138 points or 1.94% today. That\u2019s on top of the 247 points shed on Monday. This is the lowest closing point since February 2019, (although the FTSE 100 did briefly dip lower last October). Nearly every share fell today -- here are the biggest fallers. By my maths, this wipes around \u00a334bn off the index -- on top of the \u00a362bn shed yesterday. David Madden , analyst at CMC Markets, says coronavirus fears drove markets down: The colossal losses that were racked up yesterday encouraged some bargain hunting at the start of today\u2019s session, but that old concerns crept in, hence why we are offside again. The coronavirus fears have gripped European stocks as dealers are worried that this part of the world could go down the Wuhan route in terms of being on lockdown. Yesterday, Europe-focused airlines like easyJet and Ryanair posted painful losses, and they are in the red again today, and that tells you everything you need to know about tourism sentiment. How bad could coronavirus, and the market selloff, get? Well..... Simon Powell of investment bank Jefferies fears that the latest cases in South Korea, Italy and Iran point to the risk of a global pandemic. Powell suspects that there are more cases in America than officially reported. And given movement of Chinese, Korean and Iranian nationals into the US, we could soon see an outbreak there that \u201csignificantly\u201d rattles markets. Powell writes that US hospitals could be \u201cswamped with acute cases\u201d - especially as it will be extremely hard to lockdown an American city. Originally, doctors in the US were advised not to test people unless they had been to China or had contact with someone who had been diagnosed with the disease. Within the past two weeks, the CDC said it would start to use the national flu surveillance tracking infrastructure to test patients who have flu symptoms for COVID-19 in five cities across the US. But elsewhere, tests are still not widely available. Recently, the Association of Public Health Laboratories said that only California, Nebraska, and Illinois had the capacity to test people for the virus. Compare this with Singapore and S. Korea, which have carried out significant testing. High case complication rates could swamp medical systems - According to recent studies we have seen from Wuhan, the case-complication rate (number of cases requiring ICU level of care) could be between 5-10%, suggesting that if there is a global break out, we could see hospitals swamped with acute cases. Our analysis of the WHO\u2019s published criteria for assessing if this is a pandemic shows these have been met already. What might an outbreak in the USA do to markets? - Imagine trying to quarantine a large city in the USA for a month, similar to how the Chinese have shut down Wuhan, or the way the Italians are trying to ring-fence 10 towns near Milan. Our working hypothesis is that it wouldn\u2019t work, and could cause panic on a scale that would spook markets. Our base case hypothesis is that a Trump government is unlikely to choose reduced economic activity, and supply chain disruption, so spread of the virus, if it were to emerge in the US, would be more likely. Stocks are really on the slide in New York. The Dow has lost another 1.3%, or 374 points, on top of the 1,000 shed on Monday. Sentiment is shifting fast, in the face of more coronavirus infections. Nearly every share on the FTSE 100 is down today, as fears of a Covid-19 pandemic ripple through the City again. This latest selloff comes as new coronavirus cases are reported in Switzerland, Austria and Croatia..... As things stand, the FTSE 100 index is on track to lose roughly another \u00a330bn today, on top of the \u00a362bn shed yesterday. Every sector is down, led by consumer cyclicals (-2%), telecoms (-2%), energy (-2%), utilities (-1.9%) and banks (-1.9%). It\u2019s turning into another rout! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index is now down another 130 points, or 1.7%, at 7030, as we enter the final hour of trading. That\u2019s still a four-month low on an intraday basis, but would be the lowest closing level in a year. Cruise operator Carnival is now down 5.7%, on fears that tourism will be badly hurt by the coronavirus, followed by Meggitt (which cited the virus as a threat this morning). Wall Street has fallen into the red too -- with the Dow down 168 points at 27,792. That early recovery is but a memory..... Wall Street\u2019s rally is running out of gas - just like Europe\u2019s short-lived \u2018recovery\u2019 this morning. The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow are now flat, quickly losing their early 0.5% bounce from 45 minutes ago. That\u2019s hit sentiment in Europe, where stocks are falling further. In London, the FTSE 100 is now down 85 points, or 1.2%, at 7,071 points - a new four-month low. Luxury goods firms are expecting to lose tens of billions of pounds of sales because of the crisis. A survey of top chief executives and finance officers estimated the industry could lose \u20ac30 billion to \u20ac40 billion in sales this year, for an estimated total sales of \u20ac309 billion in 2020. Some of this is products that would have been shipped to China (where many stores are still closed). But it also covers potential sales lost because tourists from China, and beyond, will be staying home this year. That would mean a 15% drop in earnings for the industry, or around \u20ac10bn. Quartz has more details: The main concern is business in China, where sales are plummeting due to widespread store closures and shoppers hunkering down in their homes. The survey estimates as many as 10 million to 15 million products originally destined for China could go unsold, forcing companies to redirect those items to other parts of the world. Luxe outerwear company Moncler, for instance, said on a recent earnings call with investors and analysts that it had frozen shipments to Greater China and sent them instead to regions such as Europe. But there\u2019s also worry over a worldwide impact. Chinese tourists are big spenders on luxury goods and contribute to sales in cities from Tokyo to New York. Many have put off flying or face travel restrictions. In Paris, retailers have noticed a marked decline in shopping Chinese travelers. Just in: US consumer confidence has risen, but isn\u2019t actually as strong as expected. The Conference Board\u2019s index of consumer morale has come in at 130.7, rather weaker than the 132 which economists expected. That\u2019s still a rise, though, because January\u2019s report has been revised down to 130.4 from 131.6. Consumers reported that their current economic situation had worsened, but they\u2019re optimistic about future prospects. Or at least they were! This survey took place before the virus escalated in recent days. In other data news: US house price inflation picked up in December, with prices rising by 3.8% over the last year. The coronavirus could trigger recessions across the global economy unless it is contained soon, fears Dr. Kerstin Braun, president of Stenn Group (which provides trade finance). We already know from our own research that half of firms in the UK and US (46% and 45% respectively) predict a recession in 2020, while a further third (37% and 35%) predict a global recession this year. These predictions could very much become a reality if the virus isn\u2019t contained and every week we\u2019re seeing news of another countries\u2019 GDP hit. Tourism dependent countries, particularly those in Asia such as Thailand, Malaysia and Cambodia could be worst affected, after bookings have dried up from the globe-trotting Chinese who account for over 15% of the world\u2019s tourism spending. She warns that outbreak also threatens to harm global trade, and badly jolt the auto industry. US imports are being held hostage at the ports when coming in via ship. Vessels need to wait 14 days until they are able to access the port and offload, slowing down US imports. For China, where the outbreak first began, the virus could topple China\u2019s dominant manufacturing position and companies will need to diversifying their supply chains. This could lead to more balanced global trade relationships, particularly if emerging manufacturing countries such as Vietnam are about to capitalise on the opportunity. We know Chinese GDP in the first and second quarter will be impacted by the effects of the Coronavirus and its likely supply chains will move to Vietnam. We\u2019ll also see more advanced goods such as tech going to India, and more apparel going to Bangladesh. \u201cThe automotive industry will also be affected by the Coronavirus. Supply chains are slowing down in China as manufacturing is not at its full capacity. Factories are opening back up but with only about 50% of the workforce. Given the automotive industry is already struggling to adopt to the lower and changing demand for cars, particularly as more people are opting for electronic vehicles, the Coronavirus is likely the automotive industry could be soon hit.\u201d Breaking away from coronavirus.... more than 1,800 jobs are at risk at supermarket chain Tesco, as it shakes up its bakeries operations. The Press Association has the details: Tesco is to slash more than 1,800 jobs as part of changes to bakeries in its large supermarkets. The retailer said 1,816 bakery staff are at risk of redundancy as part of the overhaul, which will take place from May. Tesco said it will convert 58 of its bakeries to be able to finish off pre-baked products in-store, and 201 sites will only bake some of its most popular items from scratch. It said the move, which will also see bakeries at another 257 sites remain unchanged, means it will need fewer staff members. Jason Tarry, Tesco\u2019s UK and ROI chief executive, said: \u201cWe need to adapt to changing customer demand and tastes for bakery products so that we continue to offer customers a market-leading bakery range in store. \u201cWe know this will be very difficult for colleagues who are impacted, and our priority is to support them through this process. We hope that many will choose to stay with us in alternative roles.\u201d Tesco said it will look to find other jobs for the staff, with \u201cthousands of store vacancies\u201d expected to be available across its network between now and May. Shares in US biotech firm Moderna have surged by 20% in early trading in New York. Last night, the Boston-based firm became the first company to release a potential coronavirus vaccine, which it has sent to the US National Institutes of Health to be tested in humans. That doesn\u2019t mean the vaccine is ready to be released, of course -- but it\u2019s an important step forward. Cambridge biotech. DING DING! The opening bell is ringing on Wall Street, as traders return to their desks after Monday\u2019s whopping selloff. And the early moves are up. Shares are staging a small recovery after the Dow\u2019s 1,000 point plunge yesterday, with technology stocks among the risers. Dow Jones industrial average: up 155 points or 0.5% at 28,116 S&amp;P 500: up 18 points or 0.5% at 3,244 Nasdaq: up 84.9 points or 0.9% at 9,306 So, a small recovery... can it last? Upscale American department store chain Macy\u2019s is starting to feel the impact of coronavirus. After reporting results today, the company said it expects a \u201csmall impact\u201d on sales in the current quarter, due to lower tourism levels. This is \u201cnothing to be concerned about yet\u201d, Macy\u2019s insisted, but it also cautioned that the situation is still \u201cunfolding\u201d. US shoe vendor Wolverine World Wide has warned that the coronavirus will hurt its profitability, by disrupting its supply chain and cutting sales. Wolverine, whose brands include Hush Puppies, Merrell and Bates, predicts that Covid-19 will knock $30m off its revenues in the first half this year. That will also reduce profits by around 4%, or 10 cents per share, to around $2.20 per share. It says: In recent years, the Company has diversified its supply chain away from China and in 2020, China is expected to represent less than 20% of its global production, down from approximately 40% in fiscal 2019. The Company is continuing to monitor and adjust to the fluid coronavirus situation, and recognizes that there could be additional future impact to the global supply chain or customer demand. The coronavirus is having a painful impact on Italy, forcing several towns to lock down. The Italian economy was already on the brink of recession, and financial analyst Kathleen Brooks of Minerva fears it could be driven in to a deep crisis: The coronavirus crisis is also causing ructions in the bond market. The cost of insuring junk-rated company debt has hit its highest level since October, Bloomber\u2019s Katie Linsell points out. That reflects concerns that a pandemic could leave some firms unable to repay their debts. After another tough morning, 87 of the 100 companies on the FTSE 100 are in the red as lunchtime approaches. Neil MacKinnon, Global Macro Strategist at VTB Capital, says investors are right to be very worried: \u201cThe fact of the matter is that the virus has spread outside of China and is present in the major economies. China is still in lockdown and the economy is 50% operative, according to estimates from Bloomberg. Once travel restrictions inside China are lifted there is a risk of the virus increasing again and/or a reluctance of people to return to work. This looks like more of an \u2018L-shaped recovery\u2019 as far as the Chinese economy is concerned and full-capacity working is unlikely to happen before the third quarter. The ramifications are certainly global, given that China has accounted for a third of global GDP growth over the past decade. The disruption to global supply chains and disruption to trade and investment flows is considerable.\u201d Newsflash! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has hit a new four-month low, as markets slide again. The blue-chip index is now down 55 points at 7100, an 0.8% drop. That\u2019s its lowest level since 4th October, adding to the 247 points lost yesterday. Engineering firm Meggitt and chemicals group Croda are the top fallers, down 4.4% and 3.2% respectively, after they warned that the coronavirus will hurt their businesses this year (as reported earlier). The travel industry is also sliding again, with TUI down 3% and easyJet down 2% Stocks are under pressure across Europe too, in the face of the latest cases in Iran, Italy and the Canaries. The Stoxx 600 index has lost another 1%, on top of its 3.3% fall on Monday. David Madden of CMC Markets says investors are fretting about a global Covid-19 pandemic: Equity markets in Europe enjoyed a rebound in early trading in the wake of yesterday\u2019s bloodbath of a session, but the positive move was short-lived. The brutal losses endured yesterday coaxed a few buyers out of the woodwork, but given that equity benchmarks are back in the red suggests that sentiment is still sour. The coronavirus crisis in Italy remains at the forefront of traders\u2019 minds. Dealers are fearful the health emergency will spread within Italy, and beyond its borders. Investment sentiment is fragile as there is the possibility of major disruption across Europe, so traders aren\u2019t taking any chances. Hopes of a recovery on Wall Street have fizzled out too.... Hong Kong has posted some shockingly bad trade data today, which show that its economy is sinking deeper into recession. Hong Kong\u2019s exports plummeted the most in more than a decade in January, down 22.7% year-on year. Imports dropped by 16.4%, their 14th monthly decline in a row. Hong Kong\u2019s economy was already shrinking, following the long pro-democracy protests last year. The coronavirus crisis is dealing another blow to its tourism sector, forcing shops to close. Stephen Innes of AxiCorp says: If this is a foreshadow of things to come, I think investors across the globe will need to fasten in as things could get incredulously worse before improving Donald Trump then claimed that the stock markets would hit fresh heights if he were elected, but tumble if he loses in November. The US stock market has gained over 40% since Trump\u2019s shock win in 2016, and there probably is some nervousness on Wall Street about Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders clamping down on the financial sector. This week\u2019s jitters, though, are definitely virus-related.. Just in: Donald Trump is discussing yesterday\u2019s market tumble, on his trip to New Delhi. The stock markets don\u2019t appear to share Donald Trump\u2019s view that the coronavirus is under control, says Pierre Veyret, technical analyst at ActivTrades. He writes: Investors remain stuck between their appetite for risk and the blurry impact of coronavirus which is leading to mixed market sentiment this week. President Trump tried to reassure investors by saying the US economy was still sound, robust and not yet impacted by the deadly virus. These words were also underlined by NEC Director Kudlow who even said investors should \u201cseriously considering buying the dip\u201d. However, these words were not enough for most investors who are already fearing, if not a direct, at least an indirect impact on US imports/exports in the coming days or weeks. The White House is facing heavy criticism for not reacting faster to Covid-19, but has now requested $2.5bn in emergency funding. Last night, Donald Trump tweeted that the stock market was looking \u2018very good\u2019 -- effectively encouraging Americans to buy shares following the Dow\u2019s 1,000-point dive. European stock markets are now all in the red again, as coronavirus fears rear up again. In another worrying development, authorities in Tenerife are testing hundreds of tourists after a visitor fell ill at a Canary Islands hotel. With Iran reporting two more deaths from Covid-19 a moment ago, and that latest case in Italy, traders are ditching equities again. Here\u2019s the damage: FTSE 100: Down 36 points or 0.5% at 7129 German DAX: Dow 46 points or 0.33% at 12,988 French CAC: down 24 points or 0.4% at 5,767 Italian FTSE MIB: down 147 points or 0.6% at 23,277 Spanish IBEX: down 69 points or 0.7% at 9,414 Today\u2019s flurry of corporate warnings highlights the damage that a Covid-19 pandemic would have on the global economy -- both on supply chains and on customer demand. Olivier Blanchard, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, fears that governments will struggle to cushion this blow: European stocks are under pressure again, because Italian authorities have just announced the first positive coronavirus case in the South of Italy. A woman from Bergamo, who was on holiday with her friends in Sicily, has tested positive for Covid-19. The patient, who is not in serious conditions, has been transferred to the Hospital Cervello in Palermo, our Coronavirus liveblog reports.... Three more people have died from the virus in Iran (taking the total to 15), and there are almost 1,000 cases in South Korea. This bad news is weighing on the markets, with cruise operator Carnival and holiday operator TUI both down 2%, among the big fallers in London. The UK, Italian and Spanish markets are all in the red again. Josh Mahony, senior market analyst at IG, explains: What was largely a Chinese issue to resolve has soon become an international problem, with European eyes transfixed on Italian efforts to curb the spread of the virus. With European borders open and the Italian \u2018patient zero\u2019 still unknown, things could easily turn from bad to worse in the efforts to keep the coronavirus at bay. With tourism to and from China plummeting, there is little reason to expect any different in Europe if this virus spreads throughout the continent. The declines seen for largely European-focused airlines such as easyJet and Ryanair highlight the increasing fear that we will see travel locked down closer to home, with obvious knock-on implications for consumer activity should that occur The rally has fizzled out! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has dropped back to yesterday\u2019s two-month closing low of 7163 points, and the Stoxx 600 index is slightly negative. Another specialist UK manufacturer, Morgan Advanced Materials, also expects to lose millions of pounds due to Covid-19. Morgan makes heat-resistant products such as thermal ceramics, crucibles and high-tech seals for use in extreme temperatures and corrosive environments. It has has been forced to suspend work at a Chinese factory since the coronavirus outbreak began. It also expects to keep a plant in northern Italy closed for the next two weeks. This will dent Morgan\u2019s output - and thus revenues and profits -- as Reuters explains: Industrial materials maker Morgan Advanced Materials has closed its manufacturing facilities in China because of the coronavirus outbreak and expects a hit to 2020 revenue and headline operating profit as a result, the company said on Tuesday. The British company, which generates around 10% of its revenue from China, said the outbreak will take around \u00a33.5m ($4.5m) off its headline operating profit and about \u00a37m pounds off its revenue in 2020. Morgan made operating profits of \u00a3134m last year, so this is a small but noticeable hit. UK engineering and consulting firm Ricardo has issued a profit warning, due to the coronavirus. Ricardo, which focuses on the transport, energy and scarce resources sectors, has told investors that full-year earnings will suffer a \u2018material\u2019 hit because of the Coronavirus\u2019 disruptive impact on its China auto and rail operations. Ricardo, which has nine offices and technical centres in China, says business development, project delivery and client engagement have all suffered from the crisis. It says: As we start the second half of the year, we have seen increased headwinds in the automotive sector which we anticipate will lead to suppressed order intake in our US, EMEA and China Automotive businesses. The Coronavirus outbreak...has already had an operationally disruptive impact on our Automotive and Rail operations in China and we anticipate continuing disruption to client engagement, project delivery and business development in the coming months in mainland China and surrounding countries. Based on the issues highlighted above we are anticipating material impact to our forecast second half profits and thus full year European stock markets have opened a little higher after Monday\u2019s rout, but it looks very fragile. The EU-wide Stoxx 600 index is up 0.5% this morning, having tumbled 3% yesterday. Germany\u2019s DAX and France\u2019s CAC are up around 0.6%. However the Italian FTSE MIB is continuing to fall, down another 0.5%, after it reported 7 coronavirus deaths and over 200 infections. The number of cases of Covid-19 worldwide has now hit 80,000 - our main liveblog on the crisis has all the details: UK specialist chemicals firm Croda has also told the City that the coronavirus crisis could hurt its business. FTSE 100-listed Croda has five offices in China, in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Hong Kong and Taipei, so has suffered some disruption from the restrictions enforced by Beijing. It told shareholders this morning: At this time, to the best of our knowledge, no Croda employees have been infected by the virus. Our sales offices have reopened, as have our two production units, albeit with more limited operations than usual. China represents 6% of Croda\u2019s Core Business sales, 2% of Group production and a limited component of our raw material supply chain. However, there is potential for some disruption to customer and consumer demand. We will continue to monitor the impact. Shares in Croda are down 1.5%, after it also cautioned that demand in industrial markets is expected to remain weak but stable. Shares in UK engineering firm Meggitt have fallen by 4.5% at the start of trading, after it warned that the coronavirus crisis will hit its growth. Meggitt, which makes components for the aerospace, defence and energy markets, told shareholders that its key markets will suffer from the spread of Covid-19. It told the City that organic revenue growth will slow this year, explaining: Sector specific factors including the production halt of the 737 MAX and supply chain disruption, as well as the wider macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 are expected to hold back margin progression in the short-term. Meggitt added that air travel grow is likely to be curtailed by the virus (as industry body IATA warned last week), and that global supply chains will probably suffer from a production backlog due to Chinese factories being closed. This has pushed the company\u2019s shares to the bottom of the FTSE 100 leaderboard, down 27p at 567p. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Investors around the globe are reeling from the worst day in two years, as anxiety over the coronavirus crisis hit fever pitch. Stocks tumbled across the globe on Monday, with America\u2019s Dow Jones shedding more than 1,000 points by the close. That\u2019s its third biggest points decline ever, as technology companies, energy providers and mining firms bore the brunt. The corporate cost of the crisis is mounting too. Overnight, Mastercard cut its financial outlook due to the outbreak and United Airlines withdrew its full-year 2020 guidance. Japan\u2019s stock markets has suffered heavy losses overnight, as traders catch up with events after a holiday on Monday. The Nikkei index has fallen by 3.34%, or 781 points, to 22,605 in a spate of nervy selling. Australia\u2019s S&amp;P/ASX index has fallen again today, losing another 1.6%. European stocks also shed over 3% yesterday, with the Italian FTSE MIB sliding by over 5% after a spate of coronavirus deaths in Italy. Fears of a pandemic, with massive implications on global supply chains and world economic growth, are rife. But after very heavy losses across the board yesterday, we may see a small recovery in European stock markets today. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has just opened 30 points higher, at 7,186. That\u2019s only a teensy recovery, mind, as it plunged by 247 points during Monday\u2019s rout. Investors are glued to the latest reports of infection levels, with the global death toll now over 2,600. So there\u2019s little chance of the markets calming down soon, argues Michael Hewson of CMC Markets. There is no question financial markets are coming round to the realisation that this particular crisis is likely to have a slightly longer shelf life than many thought was the case a couple of weeks ago, however flu outbreaks are hardly anything new. They happen every year and according to the World Health Organisation flu kills up to 650,000 a year, yet markets are reacting to an outbreak that has so far only affected a fraction of that number. That is not to downplay the seriousness of the coronavirus outbreak, given how little we know about it, but it could be argued that the reaction of governments to the outbreak in closing borders and restricting movement is actually making things worse, as well as sowing confusion and fear amongst their populations. For now, there appears little prospect that financial markets look likely to settle down in the short term, which means investors will have to get used to an extended period of uncertainty and volatility.

Against this background share markets, commodity prices and the $A remain at high risk of more downside in the short-term, but assuming some containment and a growth rebound in the June quarter markets should rebound by then. Easier than otherwise monetary and fiscal policies - with ever more stimulus measures announced in China and more monetary and fiscal easing globally - would add to this. The key things to watch for remain a further downtrend in the daily number of new cases globally and a peak in new cases in developed countries.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In a big picture sense, the fall in share markets should be seen as just another correction after markets ran hard and fast into record highs this year from their last decent correction into August last year.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e5481b08f086a28115b1e58\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-25T02:09:41.613Z\">2.09am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Australia\u2019s chief medical officer is asked about the impact on the Olympics of the virus.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re closing this blog now but you can continue to follow our live coverage here: Here\u2019s a summary of what has happened on Tuesday: Italian authorities updated the death toll in the country to 11. Four additional deaths were reported in the country on Tuesday. New cases were confirmed in Spain and Switzerland. Concerns were growing at the spread of the virus on mainland Europe. A hotel in Tenerife where an Italian man who has tested positive for coronavirus was staying has been put on lockdown. One thousand guests at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel have been placed in isolation to halt any further spread of the disease. One British holidaymaker has described the situation as a \u201choliday from hell\u201d. Travellers returning to the UK from northern Italy may need to self-isolate as part of measures to stop the spread of coronavirus. Official government advice has been changed to say that those who have been to northern Italy, north of Pisa, should self-isolate if they develop flu-like symptoms on their return to the UK. Britons who have been in lockdown regions of Italy, including those in the Lombardy and Veneto region, should self-isolate at home for 14 days even if they have no symptoms. Some schools in the UK have closed or sent pupils home because they had recently returned from skiing visits to northern Italy. In Iran, the death toll due to the coronavirus has reached 16, a health ministry official told state TV on Tuesday. Iran has the highest number of deaths from coronavirus outside China, where the virus emerged late last year. The deputy health minister, Iraj Harirchi, has been infected and is under quarantine. Italian authorities announced on Tuesday the first positive coronavirus case in the south of Italy. A woman from Bergamo, who was on holiday with her friends in Sicily, has tested positive for Covid-19. Croatia and Austria became the latest European countries to confirm cases of coronavirus. The Madrid regional government has just reported a new coronavirus case and activated the protocol, taking the number in Spain up to seven. The spread of the coronavirus has accelerated across Europe with new cases in four countries and a rising death toll in Italy, which is desperately struggling to contain the outbreak, Denis Campbell, Helen Pidd and Sam Jones write. Concern about the proliferation of cases prompted a dozen UK schools to send home pupils to self-isolate for 14 days after returning from half-term skiing trips in Lombardy. The Irsh Rugby Football Union (IRFU) is seeking an urgent meeting with the country\u2019s health minister as to why the Ireland vs Italy rugby match should be cancelled. Simon Harris has said the match should not go ahead on 7 March because of a coronavirus outbreak in northern Italy. The union has said: The IRFU is seeking an urgent meeting with Minister Harris as to the specific reasoning behind calling for the cancellation of the Ireland v Italy Six Nations fixture in the context of the government\u2019s overall travel policy to and from Italy and other affected countries. Until such time as the IRFU has had contact with the minister and gets an understanding of the government\u2019s strategic policy on travel to and from Ireland and the cancellation of mass gatherings, it is not in a position to comment further. The number of coronavirus cases in Spain rose to six on Tuesday after a man in a hospital in Castell\u00f3n, in the eastern region of Valencia, tested positive for the virus. Spanish health authorities said that, in accordance with protocol, his tests had been sent to the National Microbiology Centre in Madrid for a second, definitive test. The Valencian regional government said it had activated its coronavirus protocol following the preliminary diagnosis. Authorities in Palermo have announced the closure of all the schools at least until Monday, after a woman from Bergamo, who was on holiday with her friends in Sicily, tested positive for Convid-19. It is the first case in the south of the country. The mayor of Palermo, Leoluca Orlando, announced an investigation is ongoing to check and eventually test people she has been in contact with during her stay in the Sicilian capital. Her husband and a friend of the patient tested positive for Convid-19 too. There have been 11 deaths as Italy\u2019s coronavirus outbreak has spread from Lombardy and Veneto to Sicily, Tuscany and Liguria as Premier Giuseppe Conte said the country would emerge from the crisis with its head held high. Some 322 people have been infected with the virus in Italy, according to the Civil protection chief. The first case of coronavirus has been registered in Liguria, the regional government said Tuesday. Only 3% of Italian coronavirus patients have died, and all of them had pre-existing conditions, Walter Ricciardi of the World Health Organisation told a Rome press conference Tuesday. \u201cWe must scale back this great alarm,\u201d said Ricciardi, a former director at Italy\u2019s Higher Health Institute (ISS). Of 100 sick people, 80 get well of their own accord, 15 have serious but manageable problems, 5% are extremely serious, of which 3% die. Furthermore, as you know, all the people who died already had serious health conditions. He said the alarm \u201cis right, is not to be underestimated, but the disease must be placed within the correct terms\u201d. A school in Liverpool has joined a growing list to have sent home pupils and staff over coronavirus fears following a trip to northern Italy. Cardinal Heenan Catholic high school in West Derby said pupils and staff went on the ski trip during half term but did not visit any of the towns currently under quarantine in Italy. All staff and pupils were medically screened on entry to and from Milan airport and, as a precautionary measure, the school has sent all of these pupils and staff home. In a letter and email issued to all parents, the headteacher Karen Smyth said the latest advice from officials is that anyone who has visited the northern areas of Italy should isolate themselves if they show symptoms of the coronavirus, contact NHS 111 or their GP by phone but do not visit the surgery or any walk-in centres. The school will monitor the potential symptoms within the pupil and staff populations, in particular those who travelled on the ski trip. The letter adds: \u201cIt is important to recognise that the risk of catching coronavirus is minimal.\u201d The new confirmed case takes the total number of coronavirus cases in Germany to 17. There have been no deaths. The car supplier Webasto said last month a Chinese employee had tested positive for the virus upon returning to China following a visit to the headquarters near Munich. Several other German colleagues were apparently also infected during the visit. Authorities in the southern German state of Baden-Wuerttemberg have confirmed the first case of coronavirus there after a 25-year-old man who had recently been in Milan tested positive. The state\u2019s health ministry said the man, who had likely become infected during a visit to Italy, had contacted authorities after coming down with flu-like symptoms. He was taken to a hospital later on Tuesday to receive treatment in isolation, the ministry added. People in close contact with the patient will be kept in home isolation and be asked about their state of health every day. As soon as a contact person develops symptoms, they will also be isolated in hospital. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has advised against all but essential travel to the towns in northern Italy that local authorities have effectively quarantined. A spokesman has said: We advise against all but essential travel to 10 small towns in Lombardy and one in Veneto, which are currently in isolation due to an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus. Any British nationals already in these towns should follow the advice of the local authorities. Officials are advising British nationals returning to the UK from the area to follow advice from the chief medical officer and Public Health England. The new travel advice reads: The FCO advises against all but essential travel to 10 small towns in Lombardy (Codogno, Castiglione d\u2019Adda, Casalpusterlengo, Fombio, Maleo, Somaglia, Bertonico, Terranova dei Passerini, Castelgerundo and San Fiorano) and one in Veneto (Vo\u2019 Euganeo) which have been isolated by the Italian authorities due to an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus. The government of Italy has introduced extraordinary measures that allow regions to implement civil protection measures in response to coronavirus. This includes the isolation of 10 small towns in Lombardy and one in Veneto. The regions of Lombardy, Veneto, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Piemonte and Emilia Romagna have implemented measures including the suspension of public or private events, the suspension of schools and higher education and the suspension on the opening of museums and cultural institutions for seven days. If you are already in the regions affected you should follow the instructions of local authorities. Algeria has confirmed its first case of the coronavirus, Reuters has reported, citing state television. The country\u2019s health minister has reportedly said an Italian man who arrived in Algeria on 17 February has been put into quarantine. Kuwait\u2019s civil aviation authority has suspended all flights with Singapore and Japan over coronavirus fears, the nation\u2019s state news agency KUNA reports. A statement was issued in accordance with the Kuwaiti health ministry\u2019s instructions on Tuesday. The day before, Kuwait suspended flights with South Korea, Iran, Thailand, Italy and Iraq over similar concerns. It has registered nine cases of coronavirus \u2013 all coming from Iran. The Six Nations rugby union match between Ireland and Italy, which is due to take place this weekend in Dublin, should be cancelled over coronavirus fears. The Irish health minister, Simon Harris, told RTE news: The very clear view of the public health emergency team was that this game should not go ahead and that it would constitute a significant risk, because a very large number of people will be travelling from what is now an affected region. My department will be contacting the IRFU in relation to this. I know it will cause a great disappointment to many but it is important to make decisions in relation to public health above and beyond all other considerations. Update: We initially said this game had been cancelled. This post has now been amended to more accurately reflect Harris\u2019s comments. The Irish Rugby Football Union has yet to respond to the statement and confirm whether or not the match will be postponed. It is a case of when, not if the coronavirus spreads to communities in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned. According to the New York Times, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, Dr Nancy Messonnier, has said: It\u2019s not so much of a question of if this will happen in this country any more but a question of when this will happen. She said public health officials could not say how severe the effect would be but peope in the country should prepare themselves for significant disruption. We are asking the American public to prepare for the expectation that this might be bad. A 76-year-old woman has died in the northern Italian city of Treviso, the Veneto region has said. She is the 11th victim in the country. About 1,000 holidaymakers at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel in south Tenerife have been ordered to remain in their rooms and will be tested for the coronavirus this evening, according to a guest. Police officers have been pictured surrounding the building and guests were not served lunch, while hotel employees who arrived for work were made to wait outside and not let in, after health authorities in the Canary Islands ordered the hotel to be locked down on Monday after an Italian couple tested positive for the virus. Rosie Mitford, an 18-year-old nursing student on holiday with her father and brother, said she was \u201ca bit fed up\u201d. We\u2019ve been in our rooms for about five hours now and had no food. We\u2019re all a bit fed up and tired about this now, but we feel fine, physically, so that\u2019s good. We\u2019ve just been updated they\u2019re going to test us once tonight and once tomorrow morning, apparently they are temperature tests. This morning, there was a breakfast buffet at 8am with fruit and yoghurt, and guests were told lunch would be brought to their rooms, but by 5.30pm at least some people were still waiting. This was most likely down to staff shortages, according to Mitford, who made a picnic out of vending machine food with her brother. Staff have not been allowed in for the whole day. They have been sat on the streets getting pretty angry as they had been in the sun for about six hours. Staff inside wearing big proper masks, that we haven\u2019t been given. They\u2019ve been very helpful, they\u2019re just trying to deal with it. The nursing student said she is passing the time doing university work, but has been taking photos and watching events ensue outside the hotel. Police are everywhere. There\u2019s chains and padlocks on the gates outside, along with police vans. She was meant to go home on Sunday but because of a sandstorm her flight got cancelled, and her flight on Monday was also cancelled as the crew had worked too long. On both occasions she spent about six hours in the airport. Then, today, she woke up ready to go to the airport again and found a note left under her door saying not to leave, while the phones in their rooms have been cut off all day. However, she is remaining calm and not allowing herself to become frustrated after the series of unfortunate events. Its not really a panicking vibe. Everyone is just milling about staying in their rooms. But they are not telling us much, everything we have found out has been from looking online. All pupils who went on Guernsey grammar school\u2019s February half term skiing trip to Piedmont have been sent home after one began \u201cshowing the relevant symptoms\u201d, local authorities have said. Guernsey\u2019s Public Health Services say the child will be tested for coronavirus and asked that all children who were on the trip isolate themselves at home until the results come back. Dr Nicola Brink, the local director of public health, has said: The relevant symptoms for a coronavirus (cough, fever, shortness of breath) are common to many winter illnesses which are frequently seen at this time of year. The risk to the children and staff attending this ski trip is currently considered to be low and our actions at this stage are precautionary. Every country in the world should learn from China\u2019s successful experience of containing the coronavirus and treating those who fall sick, according to Dr Bruce Aylward, who led a visiting team of international experts. Speaking in a personal capacity at the World Health Organization in Geneva, he has said: Access the expertise of China. They have done this at speed and they know what they are doing. They are really, really good at it. China\u2019s epidemic has peaked and the numbers are on their way down, thanks to an unprecedented engagement at every level by Chinese citizens, he added. The data they saw suggested it had saved many people from sickness and possible death. \u201cHundreds of thousands of people in China did not get Covid-19 because of this aggressive response,\u201d he said. Angelo Borrelli, the chief of the Civil Protection agency, has said the three people who died were all in their 80s and came from the worst impacted region: Lombardy. There have been three further deaths in the coronavirus outbreak in northern Italy, according to a local official. The authorities say the number of virus cases in the country has grown to 322, with 10 deaths now confirmed. Here is more from the WHO press conference earlier, courtesy of Reuters. In Geneva, Dr Bruce Aylward, head of the joint WHO-Chinese mission on the coronavirus outbreak, said countries needed to shift their mindset to preparing for an outbreak of the novel coronavirus and be ready to respond rapidly when it arrived. He told his reporters on his return to Switzerland that China\u2019s \u201cextraordinary mobilisation\u201d to handle the virus outbreak showed how aggressive policy steps could curb the disease\u2019s spread. Authorities should prepare hospital beds, isolation zones and respirators for severe cases, Aylward said, adding: \u201cChina knows how to keep people alive.\u201d He also said the number of virus infections of Chinese health care workers was coming down, with supplies now largely in place for them after most of them were infected in the community. Trinity Catholic College in Middlesbrough has announced it will close for the rest of the week after some pupils and staff \u201cbegan showing flu-like symptoms\u201d following a school skiing trip to northern Italy last week. The school had earlier said that the 36 pupils who went on the trip would be sent home but in an afternoon update sent to parents it announced the decision to close the school for deep cleaning. A statement from the Nicholas Postgate Catholic Academy Trust, which runs the school, told parents: Following a ski trip by pupils and staff from Trinity Catholic College to northern Italy over the half-term, a small number of pupils and staff began showing mild flu-like symptoms today. As a trust we are advising the school to ensure that the pupils and staff who visited Italy last week self-isolate, regardless of whether they are showing symptoms of being unwell. All pupils who attended the trip have been asked by the school to inform NHS 111 and insist on being tested for the coronavirus, even if displaying very mild symptoms. Regardless of the current Department for Education and Public Health England advice that the school should remain open to all other pupils, the headteacher has decided, in discussion with the senior leadership team and the CEO of the [Nicholas Postgate Catholic Academy Trust] to completely minimise possible spread of infection amongst families and close the school for the remainder of the week. During this time, the school will be able to conduct a precautionary deep clean of the school buildings. We appreciate that there will be many views on this action amongst parents, and hope that everyone understands the ongoing fluidity of the situation. There are a number of pupils and staff who have vulnerable family members and it is the school\u2019s duty of care to put in place the most secure of measures to minimise any possible infection. Elsewhere, Penair School in Cornwall was thrown into confusion at 9.30am today when the headmaster, James Davidson, sent home a group of children and teachers who had been on a half-term school trip to the Lombardy region where the coronavirus has hit Italy hardest. Davidson said that on the advice of Public Health England they should remain at home \u201cto self-quarantine for 14 days\u201d, but just hours later he reversed the order saying that updated PHE advice meant they could return. In any event they had been at school for the whole of Monday. The party had returned from Ponte di Legno at the weekend. In a statement the school said: [PHE has] stated if students or staff develop any symptoms relating to the coronavirus they should isolate immediately and call 111. If they have no symptoms they do not need to isolate and can return to school. Once again we apologise for any disruption caused, however students wellbeing is always our first priority. Although WHO earlier praised China\u2019s response to the outbreak of the coronavirus, US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has hit out at China and Iran over their handling of the crisis. He accused the two governments of censorship and of trying to cover up the severity of the spread of the deadly illness. At a State Department news conference, Pompeo criticised Beijing for expelling three Wall Street Journal reporters and said a free press was needed to ensure accurate information about the virus is available to the public and medical personnel, the Associated Press reported. He also said Iranian authorities must tell the truth about the virus, amid signs the outbreak there may be far wider than officially acknowledged. Expelling \u201cour journalists\u201d exposes once again the government\u2019s issue that led to Sars and now the coronavirus, namely censorship, Pompeo said of China. Had China permitted its own and foreign journalists and medical personnel to speak and investigate freely, Chinese officials and other nations would have been far better prepared to address the challenge, he claimed. On Iran, which now has the second highest number of infections after China and where the head of the country\u2019s counter-coronavirus task force has tested positive for the virus, Pompeo said the US is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d that the government may have suppressed vital details about the outbreak. \u201cAll nations, including Iran, should tell the truth about the coronavirus and cooperate with international aid organisations,\u201d he said. In another sign of growing global alarm over the coronavirus outbreak, a prominent Brazilian journalist is today reporting that Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, has been told he should cancel plans to travel to Italy and Hungary in the coming weeks. \u201cThe Bolsonaro family is being advised to cancel trip to Italy, a foreign office source has just told me. Hungary trip also in trouble,\u201d Vera Magalh\u00e3es tweeted on Tuesday. \u201cThe reason: the assessment that the coronavirus outbreak is going to get worse in Europe.\u201d Its worth noting here that there have not yet been any cases confirmed in Latin America. Greece, one of the countries in Europe which has not yet recorded a case of coronavirus, has unveiled emergency measures after mounting alarm over the steep jump in cases in Italy. In the event of an outbreak, the centre-right government said it would enforce draconian steps to contain the disease, including restricting travel on any form of public transportation. Air, sea and rail services would also be limited to prevent the virus spreading. Under the emergency act, authorities will have the right to use private clinics and medical services, government spokesman Stelios Petsas told reporters. Citizens suspected of having the virus could also be placed in quarantine to prevent infections spreading. The measures were announced as officials banned school trips to Italy, saying schoolchildren currently in the country would be returned to Greece with immediate effect. Given its proximity to Italy, Greece has stepped up surveillance of ports with regular ferry connections to the neighbouring EU state. However, infectious disease experts fear the worst should Covid 19 arrive in Greece, with the country\u2019s austerity-hit public health system still reeling from almost a decade of budget cuts. Meanwhile, a man suspected of displaying flu-like symptoms upon arrival from Italy was declared healthy by doctors in the western port city of Patras on Tuesday. The four chief medical officers across the UK have updated their self-isolation health advice for travellers returning from certain countries to cover a wider area. Anyone who has arrived in the UK since 19 February from Iran, specific areas of northern Italy and South Korea, plus the Hubei province in China, is now advised to stay indoors and avoid contact with other people. This guidance has been issued to people even if they do not have symptoms, and they should phone their GP \u2013 or NHS24 on 111 out of hours. Anyone who visited the two cities at the centre of the outbreak in South Korea, Daegu and Cheongdo, is advised to self-isolate for a fortnight. All travellers returning from Iran are requested to self-isolate, even if they do not have symptoms. For northern Italy, all travellers returning from specific lockdown areas identified by the Italian government are advised to self-isolate regardless of whether they have developed symptoms. People returning from parts of Italy north of Pisa, Florence and Rimini in the past week are asked to monitor their health, and self-isolate if they develop symptoms. Anyone who has travelled to the UK from Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam is also now advised to monitor their health, and self-isolate if they develop symptoms. Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer Dr Catherine Calderwood said: Scotland remains well-equipped to deal with any positive cases of coronavirus. While all tests here have so far been negative, we have established plans in place to ensure a rapid response in the event of a confirmed case. However, early detection of any positive cases will be vital, to contain the virus and stop it spreading. That\u2019s why it\u2019s vital people stay up to date with the latest health and travel advice, and take the same basic precautions they would to avoid colds or influenza, such as washing hands and covering their nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. Existing advice from the four UK CMOs to stay indoors remains in place for anyone who has travelled to the UK in the last 14 days from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau. The popularity of half-term skiing trips in Lombardy has seen at least 12 schools across the UK either close or send pupils home today, after updated advice from Public Health England widened the regions affected by Covid-19 to include northern Italy. The 12 schools hit so far, including one in Wales and three in Northern Ireland, appear to have all travelled to ski resorts via Milan\u2019s airports, close to one of Italy\u2019s virus hotspots. Darren Christian, principal of Salendine Nook high school in Huddersfield told parents: Our ski trip returned from northern Italy (Milan airport) on Saturday 22 February. This is an area which is affected by the virus. As a result of this, we have sent home 19 children and four staff, as a precautionary measure in line with Public Health England\u2019s advice. These children and staff will be returning to school on Monday 9 March. Hall Cross academy in Doncaster asked staff and students who attended the school\u2019s half-term ski trip to Italy to \u201cremain at home and self-isolate for 14 days\u201d. A third school in Cheshire, Sandbach high school, has also sent pupils home as a precaution. Meanwhile, 36 pupils from Trinity Catholic College in Middlesbrough were also told to stay home. Its head teacher, Louise Dwyer, told parents: The health and safety of our pupils is of paramount importance to us, therefore I have taken the decision to send home the pupils that have travelled to northern Italy whilst I await further guidance. Treatharras secondary in Newquay and Crispin School in Street, Somerset, have also sent pupils and staff home as a precaution following ski trips to Italy. Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has defended the measures his country has taken to contain the outbreak and predicted the number of new cases would stabilise soon, after a 27% increase in cases on Tuesday \u2013 from 222 to 283. Obviously I can\u2019t say I\u2019m not worried because I don\u2019t want anyone to think we\u2019re underestimating this emergency. But we trust that with the measures we\u2019ve implemented there will be a containing effect in the coming days. Italy has not yet identified the source of the outbreak, and Croatia, Austria and Switzerland have now recorded cases. Many of the cases in Italy have been confined to Lombardy, and Conte claimed that an alleged failure to completely follow official protocol at hospitals in the region contributed to its spread. However, Lombardy\u2019s chief health official, Giulio Gallera, defended the region\u2019s handling of the crisis and rebutted Conte\u2019s criticism. \u201cIt\u2019s offensive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d About 40,000 healthcare workers, many of whom volunteered, are in Wuhan helping with the response, according to Aylward. This is a modern city of 15 million people. It\u2019s a ghost town but behind every window there are people cooperating with this response. People have said there is a big presence forcing them, but there isn\u2019t. It\u2019s staggering. Every person you talk to there has a sense they are mobilised in a war against a virus, and they\u2019re organised. He added that China has \u201crepurposed the machinery of government\u201d, such as check points, toll booths and tightly controlled transportation networks, to address the disease outbreak while taking multiple hospitals out of general use. Everyone has a role and it has been repurposed to fit into this machinery and it works through a prevention and control task force that answers straight to the state council and president. It\u2019s a technologically turbocharged response. They are using big data and AI in places. They\u2019ve had to manage massive amounts of data and map huge numbers of contacts, 70,000 people over vast areas. Bruce Aylward, head of the WHO-China joint mission on Covid-19, has paid tribute to health workers in China who delivered \u201clife-saving\u201d crisis response services as the virus began to spread. He praised the approach taken by China to the \u201cfrightening\u201d never-seen-before virus. They used standard, old-fashioned public health tools and applied these with a rigour and innovation of approach on a scale that we\u2019ve never seen before in history. They have taken case findings, contact duration, social distancing, movement restriction and used that approach to try and stop a new emergent, respiratory born pathogen. Here, there was no vaccine, there was no therapeutic, the Chinese took a very pragmatic approach in deciding we are going to go after containment of this virus using that set of tools. A lot of people, myself included, were maybe concerned as to whether or not you can truly stop that kind of pathogen ... and isolate the cases ... but China took a very systematic approach. Switzerland has confirmed its first case of coronavirus, the country\u2019s federal office of public health has announced. Further details will be provided at 5pm CET (4pm GMT), the health department said, declining to say where the first case had been detected. The Swiss public broadcaster, RTS, said authorities in Ticino, on the border with Italy, had confirmed the case occurred in their region. The World Health Organization is delivering an update on the coronavirus at a news briefing, as it continues to spread. You can watch it here, and we will keep abreast of developments. Italy has taken appropriate measures to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, with a focus on halting further person-to-person transmission, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday. Italy has seen the biggest outbreak of the disease in Europe, with more than 260 cases and seven deaths reported, most in the north of the country, according to Reuters. After talks with Italian officials in Rome about the response, WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said: WHO experts are providing support in the areas of clinical management, infection prevention and control, surveillance and risk communication. At this stage the focus is on limiting further human-to-human transmission,\u201d the WHO said in a statement posted overnight. Several clusters of infections in different regions had already been detected, it said, while noting that based on current data, in the majority of cases \u2013 four out of every five \u2013 people experience mild or no symptoms. \u201cThe measures taken by the Italian government or the regional governments have been pretty strong and most likely should help in containing this virus as good as possible,\u201d Lindmeier added. A separate WHO mission to Iran, which had been announced for Tuesday, has been delayed, he said, adding that he had no date for its departure. He urged countries to boost their readiness, saying the virus is \u201cknocking at their door\u201d. The first case of coronavirus in mainland Spain has been identified by health authorities in Catalonia, according to the La Vanguardia newspaper. It would be the country\u2019s fourth confirmed case, if the report is correct, after three tourists from Germany, Italy and Britain were diagnosed with the illness in the Canary Islands and in Mallorca. Donald Trump has played down fears of the coronavirus spreading in the US, after requesting an additional $2.5bn to reinforce defences \u201cin case something should happen\u201d. On Tuesday, during his two-day visit to India, the US president told a news conference that the situation was \u201cvery well under control in our country\u201d, as his administration asked Congress for funds to prepare for the possibility of an outbreak \u2013 and to assist other nations. The Associated Press reported that he referenced a group of 14 Americans who tested positive for the coronavirus and were among hundreds of their fellow citizens recently evacuated from a cruise ship off the Japanese coast and brought to US facilities. Trump said those individuals were placed into quarantine and \u201cwe think they\u2019ll be in very good shape very, very soon.\u201d Meanwhile, he said China was getting the epidemic under control. They\u2019ve had a rough patch and ... it looks like they\u2019re getting it under control more and more. They\u2019re getting it more and more under control so I think that\u2019s a problem that\u2019s going to go away, but we lost almost 1,000 points yesterday on the [stock] market. However, Democrats criticised his response and highlighted how the Trump administration is shifting money from various public health accounts, including the Ebola preparedness fund to make up the $2.5bn figure. Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said there were a shortage of kits to test for the virus and condemned Trump\u2019s proposed budget cuts to health agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. All of the warning lights are flashing bright red. We are staring down a potential pandemic, and the administration has no plan.We have a crisis of coronavirus, and President Trump has no plan, no urgency, no understanding of the facts or how to coordinate a response. As of Tuesday, the US had 35 of about 80,000 known cases, while one American citizen has died in China. Hello all, its Mattha Busby here, taking over from my colleague Martin Belam. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said he is not planning a trip to northern Italy, as flights continue to the country despite those returning from affected areas being told to self-isolate. The government has been forced into a defence of its approach to the coronavirus outbreak after people have complained of conflicting messages, since the Foreign Office has not changed its travel advice or suggested Britons should avoid travelling to Italy. Hancock told Sky News: We don\u2019t think there are any Brits in the area that has been quarantined by the Italian government but the government does not track where people move around Europe, so if people are in that area then they should get in contact and we will do what we can to help. He said travelling to southern Italy would be \u201cperfectly reasonable\u201d, but he was not planning to travel to the north of the country amid what he described as a \u201csignificant outbreak\u201d of the coronavirus. We have not changed the official government travel advice but I\u2019m not planning on going. If people go and then they come back and feel ill with flu-like symptoms then we are asking them to self-isolate and stay at home for two weeks and try not to come into contact with anybody else. So that is obviously quite a significant imposition on people, we get that, but of course the top priority is to keep the public safe. No 10 also insisted there was not a contradiction between the health advice and travel advice in place for northern Italy. In both instances the advice which we issue is based on the evidence and on the professional opinion of medical experts. We have been led by medical expertise from the beginning of this outbreak and we will continue to be so. In terms of travel advice, that is kept continuously under review. Please email me on mattha.busby.freelance@guardian.co.uk or message me on Twitter @matthabusby if you have any news related to the coronavirus. About 50 pupils and staff at a school in County Antrim have been sent home as a precaution against coronavirus after they went on a ski trip to northern Italy. The Cambridge House grammar school group are showing no symptoms and did not visit any of the affected towns \u2013 but they were in the Lombardy region and were sent home as a \u201cprecautionary\u201d measure, the principal, Elma Lutton, said. Two schools in Cheshire have also taken precautionary steps after half-term ski trips to Italy, with Cransley school in Northwich completely closing and Brine Leas academy in Nantwich closing its sixth form due to staff shortages as a result of teachers self-isolating. Here is a summary of what has happened so far today. There have now been 80,000 people affected by the virus around the world. A hotel in Tenerife where an Italian man who has tested positive for coronavirus was staying has been put on lockdown. One thousand guests at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel have been placed in isolation to halt any further spread of the disease. One British holidaymaker has described the situation as a \u201choliday from hell\u201d. Travellers returning to the UK from northern Italy may need to self-isolate as part of measures to stop the spread of coronavirus. Official government advice has been changed to say that those who have been to northern Italy, north of Pisa, should self-isolate if they develop flu-like symptoms on their return to the UK. Britons who have been in lockdown regions of Italy, including those in the Lombardy and Veneto region, should self-isolate at home for 14 days even if they have no symptoms. Some schools in the UK have closed or sent pupils home because they had recently returned from skiing visits to northern Italy. In Iran, the death toll due to the coronavirus has reached 16, a health ministry official told state TV on Tuesday. Iran has the highest number of deaths from coronavirus outside China, where the virus emerged late last year. The deputy health minister, Iraj Harirchi, has been infected and is under quarantine. Italian authorities announced on Tuesday the first positive coronavirus case in the south of Italy. A woman from Bergamo, who was on holiday with her friends in Sicily, has tested positive for Covid-19. Croatia and Austria became the latest European countries to confirm cases of coronavirus. Expatriates in Italy have told of confusion in the north of the country, as it battles to contain the coronavirus that appears to have spread to the south. Jodie, a beautician who has lived in Dolo, between Venice and Padua, for 15 years, said the atmosphere is strange and \u201cno one knows what is going to happen\u201d. Will they block the whole of northern Italy? Surely the virus has had enough time to spread by now as everyone was carrying on with life as normal up until this weekend. We mostly think they won\u2019t quarantine us, even though there has been a case of a person in Mira testing positive \u2013 20 mins away \u2013 as it\u2019s too late.\u201d Schools have been closed for the week and the mayor has been keeping residents updated on her Facebook page, while the WhatsApp group she shares with her children\u2019s schoolfriends\u2019 mothers has \u201cstarted going crazy with panicked messages about the number of cases\u201d. My friend complained of \u2018racism\u2019 after the hotel she had booked saw she lived in Dolo and called her to say they had cancelled her stay. Another had a job interview in Padua centre and basically got the job as no one else turned up. Others from different parts of Italy have been calling to check we\u2019re OK and you can\u2019t find any antibacterial products anywhere, hand wipes, soap, face masks as they all sold out on Saturday. She is among countless other families sat at home with their children, trying to limit going out as much as possible. However, now some delivery services are said to have been suspended, too. One of my friends works as an Amazon driver and told us that Amazon has stopped delivering to certain areas. It must be serious. Mick Parker, who works at an English-language school in Milan that has been closed for the week upon the instruction of the local government, said he is \u201cquite impressed\u201d at how quickly the Italian authorities took action. The shelves in Lidl are almost empty and only had about five people going around. Most bars are closing at 6pm but restaurants appear to be open. Many of the streets are empty and Chinatown seems to be in lockdown, though whether it was self-imposed or due to a loss of business is unclear. He likened the exodus from the city to the month of August, when many people go on holiday. People are clearly concerned but I\u2019m actually quite impressed how quickly the Italian government took action. A lot of people are jokingly talking in apocalyptic terms, but it does feel a bit like one walking around. The sense of concern seems more palpable now. Kirsten King, who lives about 20 miles away from V\u00f2, Venuto, said the fact a nearby town is closed off with patrols on the road feels \u201cmedieval\u201d. Her area has not been locked down, but schools and cinemas are closed and sports events have been cancelled, while most people are staying at home. My husband is the GP in our village, Veronella, so he\u2019s been inundated with communications from the ministry of health since Saturday and has had to impose strict containment procedures. He has to wear a mask when receiving patients and has forms to fill in for suspect cases, no more than one or two people in the waiting room which is kept unheated and well ventilated, no access to patients with flu-like symptoms \u2013 only phone contact or home visits as necessary. Obviously he and all our family risk quarantine should a patient be diagnosed with Covid-19. \u201cI am sickened by the attempts to manipulate the crisis by the poisonous Matteo Salvini,\u201d she added, after he attempted to politicise the coronavirus outbreak in the country by attacking the Italian government for not defending the country\u2019s borders. Josie, who is British and has lived in Brescia for two years, said that despite the museums and schools being closed for the week many Italians continuing life as normal she feels anxious. As soon as I saw what was happening on Friday, and heard the rumours about containment measures, I went to the supermarket and stocked up on food and water filters just in case. Some people here don\u2019t see the point of the precautions, but I think we all have a responsibility to protect the most vulnerable people in our communities, like the elderly and those with weakened immune systems. She teaches English and is worried about going back to work too soon, amid false reports on Monday that a person with the coronavirus died at the local hospital. I wish I didn\u2019t live alone. My friends here live with their partners and have a sounding board, but being at home alone without someone to talk to about my deeper fears is hard. I live next to the Capitolium temple and would expect hoards of tour groups around the afternoon, and there is nobody. I don\u2019t know how this is going to progress, but it feels like the start of a horror movie in many ways. Jamie Wakefield, who is from Eastbourne and lives in Rimini, said that despite there being two cases of the coronavirus in Emilia-Romagna, all schools have been closed until next week. What is surprising is the people panicking and queuing at the supermarkets, emptying the shelves of pasta and almost everything else. The news reports are somewhat sensationalist with no real practical advice of what to do in order to avoid contamination. The media doesn\u2019t seem to want to offer the reassuring notion that the virus is not as devastatingly destructive as many people seem to be making out. To be honest, I don\u2019t know what the authorities intend to do in a week\u2019s time when the schools are supposed to reopen and the cases will have risen. Will everything slowly get shut down completely? I don\u2019t see any other way. England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has said that if coronavirus becomes a global pandemic, then schools could be shut and public transport reduced. Speaking to reporters Whitty said: \u201cThere\u2019s no secret there\u2019s a variety of things you need to look at, you look at things like school closures, you look at things like reducing transport. \u201cThe expectation is not that we will do all these things, the expectation is we will be looking systematically, using the science, at all the building blocks and balancing the effects against costs to society.\u201d He also suggested that if the situation worsened, whole families could be asked to self isolate if one of them had symptoms of the virus. He added: \u201cWe might want to look at things like should people stay at home with their families in that situation.\u201d Some schools in England have already shut today because of fears that pupils may have brought coronavirus back with them from skiing trips in northern Italy. [See 13:17 and 12:11] In scenes that are becoming increasingly familiar around the world here are some pictures of public places in South Korea being disinfected. With nearly 1,000 confirmed cases, the country now has the highest incidence of coronavirus outside of mainland China. Schools across the UK are sending pupils home as they struggle to comply with the latest official advice on Covid-19 for students and staff who spent last week\u2019s half-term holiday in northern Italy. Penair School in Truro this morning told parents to collect children who had been on a skiing trip to Ponte di Legno, which is near the Swiss border and well away from the towns currently under lockdown by the Italian authorities. In a message sent to parents the Truro school said: \u201cFollowing an announcement at 8am this morning, regarding the coronavirus, by the health secretary and having sought guidance from Public Health England (PHE) we are required to send all children and staff home who attended the ski trip, to self-quarantine for 14 days. Please be assured this is a precautionary measure.\u201d Meanwhile Brine Leas Academy in Nantwich said it was temporarily closing its sixth form after teachers and students also returned from a half-term trip to Italy. Cransley School, an independent school also in Cheshire, announced it would close for a week after some pupils reported feeling ill after a skiing trip to Bormio in Lombardy. The decisions followed today\u2019s updated advice from PHE for travellers returning from northern Italy \u2013 defined as north of Pisa, Florence and Rimini \u2013 to self-isolate if they felt symptoms of Covid-19, including fever or shortness of breath. PHE also said any travellers who had visited the 11 \u201cspecific lockdown areas\u201d in northern Italy since 19 February should call 111 and avoid contact with others. Other parents report being told to keep their children home from school after returning from family holidays in northern Italy over the half-term break. We\u2019ve got a video of schoolteacher Marzio Toniolo describing life under lockdown in San Fiorano, one of the northern Italian towns under quarantine as coronavirus cases rise. Around 50,000 residents of 11 towns across Lombardy and Veneto have been quarantined for at least the next 15 days as Italian authorities scramble to contain the worst outbreak of the virus in Europe and the third worst in the world. One British tourist at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace in Tenerife has told PA Media that she was enduring the \u201choliday from hell\u201d. Hannah Green, 27, from Hertfordshire, said she has been stuck inside with her boyfriend and one-year-old son twice since they arrived on Sunday \u2013 first because of a sandstorm that swept the Canary Islands, and now because of the positive coronavirus test at the hotel. She described the communication from the hotel on Tuesday as \u201cnon-existent\u201d, telling the news agency: \u201cWe woke up to a note under our door this morning saying for health reasons not to leave our room. I called downstairs to reception as soon as I saw it and they wouldn\u2019t tell us anything. \u201cSo I quickly got on my phone and Googled and saw a man had tested positive for coronavirus, so I basically assumed it was that. But since then we\u2019ve had nothing from the hotel \u2013 no one has told us anything or what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d She said that while some people were moving around the hotel, she was staying put, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re in our room with the baby. We\u2019re worried for the baby.\u201d She now hopes to leave as soon as possible, adding: \u201cIf we\u2019re allowed to leave we\u2019re going to go home, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be allowed to leave. We don\u2019t want to be here. We\u2019re fed up now. We had the sandstorm earlier and now this. Holiday from hell, honestly.\u201d Here\u2019s a map of where the hotel is in Tenerife. The UK government has updated the advice it is giving to people who have recently been travelling. The full advice is now as follows: Based on the scientific advice of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) the UK chief medical officers are advising anyone who has travelled to the UK from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau in the last 14 days and is experiencing coughing or fever or shortness of breath, to stay indoors and call NHS 111, even if their symptoms are mild. We are carrying out enhanced monitoring of direct flights from these areas. Passengers will be told how to report any symptoms they develop during the flight, at the time of arrival, or after leaving the airport. These areas have been identified because of the volume of air travel from affected areas, understanding of other travel routes and number of reported cases. This list will be kept under review. If you have returned from these specific areas since 19 February, you should call NHS111 and stay indoors and avoid contact with other people even if you do not have symptoms: Iran. Specific lockdown areas in northern Italy as designated by the government of Italy. Special care zones in South Korea as designated by the government of the Republic of South Korea. Hubei province (returned in the past 14 days). If you have returned from these areas since 19 February and develop symptoms, however mild, you should stay indoors at home and avoid contact with other people immediately and call NHS111. You do not need to follow this advice if you have no symptoms: Northern Italy (defined by a line above, and not including, Pisa, Florence and Rimini). Vietnam. Cambodia. Laos. Myanmar. If you\u2019re staying in the H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel in Tenerife, which has been quarantined after an Italian guest tested positive for coronavirus, we\u2019d like to hear from you. You can tell us about the situation by responding to this encrypted form or via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056. A school in Cheshire has been forced to close amid concerns that students returning to the UK from a ski trip to Italy could be infected with coronavirus. Cransley School, in Northwich, took the decision to close the school after NHS clinical services advised any staff or pupils who went on the trip to Bormio to self-isolate. A number of students are believed to be experiencing symptoms of the virus after visiting the area in the Lombardy region, where hundreds of residents have contracted the deadly infection. The school has closed to all pupils to undergo a \u201cdeep-clean\u201d and has advised those returning from the excursion to self-contain regardless of whether they are showing symptoms. The headteacher, Richard Pollock, used the school\u2019s official Facebook page to share his decision to close the school, adding that he would visit Warrington General hospital tomorrow. He said: \u201cRegardless of the current Public Health England advice (that the school should remain open to all other pupils) I have decided, in discussion with the SMT and the chair and vice-chair of governors, to completely minimise possible spread of infection and close the school for the remainder of the week. \u201cDuring this time, the school will be able to conduct a deep clean, and monitor the results of tests amongst those pupils who are currently showing flu-like symptoms. \u201cI understand that there will be a variety of reactions to this decision amongst parents, and hope that all families will understand the developing situation and the changing and inconsistent advice given to the school. The staff, pupils and families of Cransley are our highest concern.\u201d A second school in Cheshire, Brine Leas Academy in Nantwich, has also been affected by travel to Italy. The school said on Twitter it would remain open but that the sixth form college would close due to \u201cstaff shortages\u201d. Croatia\u2019s prime minister, Andrej Plenkovi\u0107, has confirmed its first case of coronavirus infection, in a patient who is hospitalised in the capital. \u201cThe patient is in the Zagreb clinic for infectious diseases. It is a younger person and he has milder symptoms. He is in isolation and his condition is good at the moment,\u201d Plenkovi\u0107 told a news conference. The health minister, Vili Bero\u0161, said the patient had stayed in Milan from 19 to 21 February. In Iran, it is being reported that the deputy health minister has tested positive for coronavirus. According to the semi-official news agency ILNA, the spokesman for Iran\u2019s health ministry confirmed in an interview with state television that Deputy Minister Iraj Harirchi has been infected and is now under quarantine. Iraj Harirchi had been working as normal on Monday, and gave a news conference with journalists in Tehran about the virus during which he reportedly had been sweating and looking uncomfortable. It appears that Austria has its first two cases of coronavirus, in the province of Tyrol. There\u2019s no indication yet of the source of the outbreak, but Tyrol borders northern Italy where officials are struggling to contain a growing number of cases. Back in the City, the FTSE 100 index of leading blue-chip shares has fallen to a new four-month low. The small gains reported earlier didn\u2019t last. Traders have been spooked again by the latest coronavirus cases in Iran, Italy and the Canary Islands, which have pushed down markets across Europe. The engineering group Meggitt and chemicals firm Croda are leading the FTSE 100 fallers, after they both warned shareholders this morning that Covid-19 will hit their businesses. Neil MacKinnon, a global macro strategist at VTB Capital, says investors are alarmed by the economic damage caused within China, and the rising infections in other countries. \u201cOnce travel restrictions inside China are lifted there is a risk of the virus increasing again and/or a reluctance of people to return to work. This looks like more of an \u2018L-shaped recovery\u2019 as far as the Chinese economy is concerned and full-capacity working is unlikely to happen before the third quarter.\u201d \u201cThe ramifications are certainly global, given that China has accounted for a third of global GDP growth over the past decade. The disruption to global supply chains and disruption to trade and investment flows is considerable,\u201d MacKinnon warns. The FTSE 100 is down 55 points, or 0.7%, at 7101 \u2013 its weakest level since 4 October. That\u2019s on top of the 247 points lost in Monday\u2019s rout. The Stoxx 600 index, which tracks Europe\u2019s largest companies, has dropped by almost 1% today. Our business liveblog has more details: Italian authorities are investigating the skyrocketing online prices for hygienic masks and sanitising gels after the coronavirus outbreak in northern Italy, according to two senior magistrates. \u201cWe have decided to open an investigation after media reports of the insane prices fetched up by these products on online sales websites in the last two days,\u201d the Milan deputy chief prosecutor, Tiziana Siciliano, told Reuters. The biggest outbreak in Europe has hit Italy, with more than 260 cases and seven deaths reported, most in the north of the country. Many pharmacists have run out of hygienic masks and hand sanitisers, with people going online to buy them. \u201cThe price of masks online has risen from one cent to \u20ac10 each and a one-litre bottle of disinfectant that last week was on sale for \u20ac7, was up to \u20ac39 yesterday,\u201d Siciliano said. As the emergency has spread, police have also issued warnings that criminals posing as health inspectors have been using false identity papers to try to gain access to people\u2019s houses to steal money or other valuables. I will be passing over the live blog to my colleague shortly, so here is a summary of updates so far. There have now been 80,000 people hit by the virus. A hotel in Tenerife, part of the Canary islands \u2013 where an Italian man who has tested positive for coronavirus was staying \u2013 has been put on lockdown. One thousand guests at the hotel have also been placed in isolation to halt any further spread of the disease. The H10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel on the south of the island is under quarantine and it was reported that police were \u201censuring that none of the customers staying at the hotel left or entered the hotel\u201d. Travellers returning to the UK from northern Italy may need to self-isolate as part of measures to stop the spread of coronavirus, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said. He said that official advice, updated on Tuesday, had been changed to say that those who have been to northern Italy, north of Pisa, should self-isolate if they develop flu-like symptoms on their return to the UK. Hancock also said Britons who have been in lockdown regions of Italy, including those in the Lombardy and Veneto region, should self-isolate at home for 14 days even if they have no symptoms. In Iran, the death toll due to the coronavirus has reached 16, a health ministry official told state TV on Tuesday. Iran has the highest number of deaths from coronavirus outside China, where the virus emerged late last year. Four new cases of coronavirus have been detected in Iraq in Kirkuk province, the health ministry said. This means there are now five cases in the country. Italian authorities announced on Tuesday the first positive coronavirus case in the south of Italy. A woman from Bergamo, who was on holiday with her friends in Sicily, has tested positive for Covid-19. The patient, who is not in a serious condition, has been transferred to the Hospital Cervello in Palermo. The holiday package firms Tui and Jet2holidays use the Tenerife hotel at the centre of the coronavirus scare. The H10 Costa Adeje Palace is a four-star seafront hotel with nearly 500 rooms, and has four pools and a gym. A letter sent by managers to guests says they must stay in their rooms after a man there was diagnosed with coronavirus. A spokesman for the firm Jet2, which has its headquarters in Leeds, said in a statement to the PA Media news agency: We are aware of reports that a non-Jet2holidays customer staying at the H10 Costa Adeje Palace in Tenerife has tested positive for coronavirus. Under the advice of the regional and the Spanish government authorities, the hotel has been placed under quarantine. The health and safety of our customers is our absolute priority, and we will release more information as it becomes available. In line with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) advice, our flying programme remains unchanged.\u201d Irish authorities are expected to announce more stringent measures against coronavirus on Tuesday in an effort to delay what is considered its almost inevitable arrival in Ireland. The national public health emergency team (NPHET) is to meet this afternoon to review preparations and recommendations related to travel and mass gatherings. The outbreak in Italy has significantly increased the chance of a coronavirus case reaching Ireland, the health minister, Simon Harris, said on Monday. Ryanair shares tumbled 13% on the ISEQ index of Irish shares on Monday. A Pro 14 rugby game between Ulster and Benetton, which was due to take place in the northern Italian city of Treviso on Saturday, has been postponed. Ireland\u2019s Six Nations game against Italy at Dublin\u2019s Aviva stadium on 7 March \u2013 which is expected to draw up to 5,000 Italian visitors - is still scheduled to go ahead. That may change depending on whether Italy manages to contain its outbreak. Organisers of an international James Joyce symposium in June in Trieste, northern Italy, told the Times they planned to go ahead in hope that by then the outbreak will be contained. Closing borders, blanket travel bans and more extreme government policies will not stop the spread of coronavirus, according to the head of the World Travel and Tourism Council. It comes as travel companies face huge economic losses amid fears about the virus. In the UK, the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 was EasyJet, which sank 16.7%, while Tui and British Airways owner IAG were both down by more than 9% at the close. Gloria Guevara, the president and chief executive of the World Travel and Tourism Council, called for governments and authorities worldwide not to overreact with disproportionate measures in a bid to control Covid-19. She said: \u201cGovernments and those in authority must not seek to choke travel and trade at this time. Closing borders, imposing blanket travel bans and implementing extreme policies are not the answer to stopping the spread of coronavirus. \u201cPast experience shows that taking such extreme action has been ineffective at best. We urge governments to explore fact-based measures which don\u2019t affect the vast majority of people and businesses for whom travel is essential.\u201d As infection numbers continue to grow, the World Health Organization spokesman said on Tuesday that many countries have pandemic plans ready, and some may act on them depending on their situation but WHO itself does not plan \u201ca big announcement\u201d. He added that countries have to be prepared \u201cliterally knocking at every door\u201d. People could be banned from gathering in large numbers to contain coronavirus, Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer has said. Dr Catherine Calderwood looked to how cases have been dealt with in Italy, with football matches called off and church services in the affected regions cancelled . Speaking on BBC Good Morning Scotland, she said the government and NHS were working on \u201ccontainment first\u201d and then \u2013 if coronavirus was discovered in this country \u2013 a range of measures to try to limit the number of people infected. \u201cIf we do have a cluster, as has happened in Italy, then we move into delaying the spread,\u201d Dr Calderwood said. \u201cDelaying the spread would mean some of the measures that have happened already in Italy \u2013 stopping people coming together in large groups so that one or a few individuals do not spread to many, many more around them.\u201d Singapore will ban visitors with recent travel history to Cheongdo and Daegu in South Korea amid fears over the virus. The country has stepped up its \u201cmaximum measures\u201d to contain the coronavirus with plans to test around 200,000 members of a secretive church believed to be at the centre of the country\u2019s outbreak. Two more people infected with the new coronavirus have died, taking the toll in Iran to 16, a health ministry official told state TV on Tuesday. Iran has the highest number of deaths from coronavirus outside China, where the virus emerged late last year. Rory Stewart, the former international development secretary and independent candidate for mayor of London, has criticised the World Health Organisation for being \u201cfar too slow\u201d to describe the new coronavirus outbreak as a global pandemic. At an event in London, run by Christian Aid on Monday night, Steward said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the WHO was \u201cnot getting this response right.\u201d \u201cThey have been far too slow to declare a public health emergency of international concern, a month too late, and they have been far too slow to declare a global pandemic,\u201d he said. On Tuesday, he told the BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme the WHO\u2019s failure to declare the outbreak a global pandemic, was \u201cbig problem\u201d as it held up World Bank funds to developing countries and thus had increased the chance of the virus spreading to countries like Britain. Stewart said: \u201cTedros has been unbelievably slow, firstly to declare a world health emergency and then a global pandemic.\u201d \u201cAnd that\u2019s a big big problem, because until the pandemic\u2019s declared, you can\u2019t release the World Bank\u2019s funds, so that poorer countries can put the processes in place to be able to deal with the virus and that increases the chance of it spreading to countries like Britain. And that was purely for political reasons, the desire not to offend the Chinese government.\u201d He said that \u201chuge amounts\u201d of pressure should be placed on the WHO, to ensure they do not make the same mistakes they made with Ebola. \u201cSo we are a member of the World Health Organisation I was actually there when Tedros was appointed, huge amounts of pressure needs to be put on the WHO to sort this out. They made the same mistake with Ebola, they are making it again at the moment with coronavirus.\u201d He said the second thing needed was to \u201creassure people\u201d. \u201cWhat you don\u2019t want is conspiracy theories spreading because we are not communicating clearly enough and regularly enough, that this is well understood, that actually the Chinese situation is unusual because of the way it was handled in China. And that we have good procedures in place to make sure we handle it better in Britain and that we are thinking about what we can do about transport, about policing, in a worse case scenario.\u201d A Turkish Airlines plane flying from Iran has been diverted to Ankara at the request of the government, an aviation source said. An aviation news website said one passenger was suspected of being infected by coronavirus. Turkey\u2019s Demiroren news agency broadcast video showing ambulances lined up beside the plane, with personnel wearing white protective suits on the tarmac. The plane was flying from the Iranian capital, Tehran, and had been scheduled to land in Istanbul. Turkey shut its borders to Iran on Sunday and cut flights due to the spread of the virus in that country. The Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent, Sam Jones, reports on the latest below. The Tenerife hotel where the Italian man who has tested positive for coronavirus was staying has been put on lockdown and its thousand guests placed in isolation to halt any further spread of the disease. A well-placed source on the island confirmed to the Guardian that the hotel, theH10 Costa Adeje Palace hotel on the south of the island, was under quarantine.The Diario de Avisos, a Tenerife-based newspaper, said that strict protocol was being followed at the hotel. It reported that police were \u201censuring that none of the customers staying at the hotel left or entered the hotel\u201d.Spain\u2019s national health ministry declined to comment, referring queries to the regional health ministry, which could not be contacted for comment. Japan\u2019s largest advertising agency, Dentsu, has said one of the employees at its headquarters has been infected with coronavirus and that it has instructed all HQ-based employees to work from home. Zoe McLean, 43, from Herefordshire \u2013 who i due to travel to Venice soon \u2013 said that she felt government advice about travel to northern Italy was unclear. \u201cMy partner and I have a two-week holiday planned in northern italy, flying next Sunday but we are now in limbo. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office says it is safe to travel but today the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said those returning may have to self-isolate themselves,\u201d she said. \u201cIt all seems a bit conflicted and leaves us uncertain about what to do. If we cancel out trip at the moment we won\u2019t get any money back \u2013 lots of flights and hotels have been paid for in advance. But if we go \u2026 we do worry about the risk of picking up the virus and bringing it home to elderly relatives and neighbours.\u201d On Tuesday, Hancock said the official advice around coronavirus is being updated so that people returning to the UK from any areas quarantined by the Italian government should self-isolate whether they show symptoms or not. Speaking on BBC Breakfast on Tuesday, Hancock said: \u201cYes, the official advice which will be formally updated at 8am is going to change so that those who have been to northern Italy \u2013 north of Pisa \u2013 if they have flu-like symptoms should self-isolate. \u201cIf people have been to the affected areas that the Italian government have quarantined then they should self-isolate whether or not they have symptoms.\u201d The British couple who were diagnosed with coronavirus onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan have said they are recovering from the disease . Speaking live from a specialist infectious diseases hospital in Japan, David Abel said: \u201cWe have had a fever, our temperatures were high \u2013 that\u2019s all worked its way out quite naturally in our body, which we\u2019re very thankful for. \u201cThe best course of treatment for us is allowing the body\u2019s natural immunity to get rid of whatever is there.\u201d The couple were both diagnosed with pneumonia, and have been tested for the Covid-19 infection again today, with the results expected tomorrow. David said although he has lost weight, he is gaining strength every day, and his wife Sally, who is being treated in the same room, is \u201cvirtually over\u201d her pneumonia. \u201cThey were talking a few days ago about putting me on a respirator. Thank God that was not needed,\u201d said David. \u201cLanguage is a barrier [\u2026] but they are lovely nurses and doctors, and we laugh about it. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult when you\u2019re confined to four walls, and you lose your normal freedom and you lose your normal communication and there\u2019s no natural daylight. It\u2019s really hard going but we\u2019re alive. \u201cWe\u2019ve got memories from the fabulous cruise and we\u2019ve got a real hope of seeing our friends and family back in the UK in the not too distant future, and that\u2019s what is keeping us going.\u201d The outbreak of the coronavirus has killed 15 in Iran and there have been 95 confirmed cases, according to the health ministry. Latest figures show the virus, which started in China, has now infected more than 80,000 people globally. Health authorities in the Canary islands have activated their coronavirus protocol after an Italian man staying in Tenerife tested positive for the virus. In a statement issued late on Monday night, they said \u201can Italian citizen has tested positive during initial tests at the University hospital of Our Lady of Candelaria\u201d in Tenerife, adding that samples would now be sent to the National Microbiology Centre near Madrid for definitive tests. \u201cThe man is in isolation and under medical supervision,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Canary Islands have, in coordination with the national health ministry, activated the same protocol undertaken in other parts of the country where other suspected cases of the disease have been detected.\u201d If the tests are positive, Spain will have three confirmed cases of the coronavirus \u2013 one on the remote Canary island of La Gomera and another on the Balearic island of Mallorca. Stock markets have steadied after falling on Monday amid fears over the spread of coronavirus. However, experts have warned of further drops as the outbreak rages on. The FTSE 100 Index opened with small gains on Tuesday as it pulled out of the biggest fall for four years. More than \u00a362bn was wiped off the value of Britain\u2019s top share index in the previous session after news of the first major outbreak of coronavirus in Europe, with Italy suffering hundreds of cases. Indices across Europe showed signs of stabilising as investors looked to pick up bargains after the heavy falls, thanks also to a cautious rise on the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong overnight. The Dax in Germany and France\u2019s Cac 40 were just over 20 points lower each within the first hour of trading on Tuesday, having both fallen 4% on Monday. Russ Mould, an investment director at AJ Bell, said: While stocks still have a long way to go to make up for Monday\u2019s losses, it is encouraging to see share prices starting to move up. It would suggest there are plenty of investors confident enough to go shopping for bargains rather than widespread fear.\u201d But Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said it was likely markets were only pausing for breath. He said: There is no question financial markets are coming round to the realisation that this particular crisis is likely to have a slightly longer shelf life than many thought was the case a couple of weeks ago. There appears little prospect that financial markets look likely to settle down in the short term, which means investors will have to get used to an extended period of uncertainty and volatility.\u201d If you want to share any thoughts or news tips with me about the coronavirus then please email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com or tweet me @sloumarsh. My direct messages are open. Thanks A health expert has said that he is sceptical about a vaccine being created to deal with the coronavirus before the situation has been brought under control. The director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Prof Peter Piot, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cI don\u2019t expect that there will be a vaccine available for millions of people who would need it before the end of the year. \u201cI am very sceptical that we will have a vaccine before this epidemic is brought under control. But it may be very useful to have one if this becomes seasonal and every year we have a wave of this.\u201d Four new cases of coronavirus have been detected in Iraq in Kirkuk province, the health ministry said. This means there are now five cases in the country. The patients are an Iraqi family who had been on a trip to Iran, the ministry said in a statement. They have been placed in quarantine. Iraq reported its first case of the virus on Monday, an Iranian theology student in the holy Shia city of Najaf. The new coronavirus is a \u201cgame changer\u201d that will require a rethink of global supply networks especially in the health and medicine, the French finance minister said. \u201cThe coronavirus epidemic is a game-changer for globalisation,\u201d Bruno Le Maire said during a visit to Athens, adding that the outbreak had highlighted an \u201cirresponsible and unreasonable\u201d reliance on China. \u201cWe cannot continue to rely on China for 80 to 85% of pharmaceutical active ingredients,\u201d said Le Maire. And the resulting industrial slowdown in China would have a \u201cdirect impact\u201d on industrial resupply, he added. The minister said the virus that has killed nearly 2,600 people worldwide would have an impact on travel, given the number of Chinese tourists to Europe. France alone attracts more than 2.5 million Chinese visitors a year, an \u201cimportant\u201d share of the French tourism sector, Le Maire said. In France, one person has died from the virus so far \u2013 an elderly Chinese tourist. A further 11 have been treated in hospital , with 10 recovering. Spanish health authorities are carrying out tests on hundreds of tourists in a Canary Islands hotel after a coronavirus case has been identified. Holidaymakers have reportedly been quarantined inside a complex in Tenerife, and local reports have named the hotel as the H10 Costa Adeje Palace in Adeje, in the south of the island. It\u2019s a region that is extremely popular with British tourists at this time of the year. Spanish health authorities could not immediately confirm the lockdown but said hundreds of tourists and staff in the hotel were being tested for the virus. \u201cWe are checking people who had contact with the patient including the people in the hotel,\u201d said a spokeswoman for Canary Island\u2019s health department. The novel coronavirus has claimed three more lives in Iran, state media reported, taking the country\u2019s overall death toll to 15. Two of those who died were elderly women in the central province of Markazi. Another patient in the northern province of Alborz has also died, the state news agency Irna reported. \u201cOne was an 87-year-old woman with a history of cardiovascular, pulmonary, liver and kidney diseases who passed away after being hospitalised for two days,\u201d Abbas Nikravesh, head of Saveh city\u2019s medical university, told IRNA. The other was an 82-year-old with \u201cserious blood and cardiovascular diseases\u201d who died after being hospitalised for a day, he added, noting that she had a history of visiting Qom as her children live there. \u201cThree cases of coronavirus infection have been confirmed in Saveh city so far, with two dead,\u201d Nikravesh said. \u201cThere is now one infected 78-year-old woman from Afghanistan under special care.\u201d IRNA did not name the patient in Alborz or detail any underlying health conditions. \u2018This patient was under special care in recent days when he passed away,\u201d Hassan Inanlou, deputy head of Alborz\u2019s medical university, was quoted as saying. According to IRNA, there are two more confirmed cases hospitalised in Alborz. Iran has confirmed 61 cases of coronavirus infection so far. Here is the latest from Lorenzo Tondo, a Guardian correspondent covering Italy and the migration crisis. He reports from Palermo. Italian authorities have announced on Tuesday the first positive coronavirus case in the South of Italy. A woman from Bergamo, who was on holiday with her friends in Sicily, has tested positive for Convid-19. The patient, who is not in serious conditions, has been transferred to the Hospital Cervello in Palermo. She had been on holiday in Palermo since before the outbreak of the virus in the country. Her husband and friends have been quarantined for at least the next 15 days as Italian authorities scramble to contain the worst outbreak of the virus in Europe and the third worst in the world. In the meantime, a 60-year old Italian entrepreneur from Florence, who came back from Singapore, has also tested positive for Convid-19, as the number of confirmed cases in the country rises to over 220, with seven deaths. All those who have died had underlying health problems. On Monday, the country\u2019s prime minister Giuseppe Conte blamed the surge on a hospital he did not name, citing that the disease had spread \u2018\u2019because safety protocols were not respected\u2019\u2019. \u201cThe economic impact of the virus could be very strong\u2019\u2019, Conte added, \u201cAt this moment, we can calculate that there will be a negative economic impact, we are not yet in a position to forecast what will happen\u2019\u2019. On Saturday, the Italian authorities implemented draconian measures to try to halt the coronavirus outbreak in the north of the country, including imposing fines on anyone caught entering or leaving outbreak areas. More than 3,000 tests for coronavirus have been carried out over the last few days, although authorities are still trying to identity \u201cpatient zero\u201d \u2013 the person who brought the virus to the region. The first man infected, a researcher at Unilever, came down with symptoms after attending a dinner at which there was a colleague who had recently returned from China, who tested negative for the virus. \u201cThe peak in Italy is partly due to all the tests being done,\u201d said Roberta Siliquini, a former president of Italy\u2019s higher health council. \u201cWe have found positive cases in people who probably had few or no symptoms and who may have overcome the virus without even knowing it.\u201d Meanwhile, Maltese chandlers and port workers in Paola and Valletta, in Malta, have stopped their operations over coronavirus fears, refusing to board vessels coming from Italy to unload cargo, Malta Today has reported. According to MaltaToday, \u201cport workers are complaining of a lack of medical staff in the area as they handle cargo that has arrived from Italian ports.\u2019\u2019 The Italian government has been criticised for hastily cancelling flights to and from China as, without coherence across Europe, people have been able to fly to other European cities and enter Italy from there. A Tenerife hotel withs 1,000 guests is reportedly in lockdown after an Italian tourist tested positive to contracting the new coronavirus. The holidaymakers have been quarantined inside the complex, and local reports have named the hotel as the H10 Costa Adeje Palace in Adeje, south of the island. It\u2019s a region that is extremely popular with British tourists at this time of the year. Police are said to be surrounding the hotel to make sure no one enters or leaves to control the virus\u2019 spread. Italy may need to call on the European Union to offer leeway on its budget targets as it struggles with the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, a senior official said. Deputy economy minister, Laura Castelli, made the comments a day after prime minister Giuseppe Conte warned that the fallout from the outbreak, which has concentrated in the economic powerhouses of northern Italy, would be \u201cvery strong\u201d. The country\u2019s economy is already on the brink of recession, with one of the highest debt burdens in the eurozone. \u201cThere are resources that the EU can give us in relation to economic events that could lower GDP considerably. We hope we won\u2019t need it but it\u2019s a situation in which the EU should,\u201d Castelli told RAI radio. Officials from the World Health Organization and the European Union were due to meet in Rome on Tuesday to discuss the crisis. Italy, the country in Europe worst affected, has reported more than 220 cases and seven deaths, mostly in Lombardy, the northern region that includes the financial capital Milan and Veneto. The tourist industry, which accounts for about 13% of GDP, fears a plunge in bookings as the government has ordered a clampdown on public events including soccer matches. The Venice carnival \u2013 one of the world\u2019s premier tourist attractions \u2013was shut early for the first time in decades and airlines began restricting flights to Italy.

Thanks Fans of Japanese girl group Perfume wait in line for fan merchandise before the start of the group\u2019s concert outside Tokyo Dome on Tuesday. Japan\u2019s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that new measures like companies letting their employees work from home and hospitals expanding their capacity to treat many patients will determine if Japan could control its coronavirus outbreak. Two more Iranians infected with coronavirus have died, media website Eghtesad online said on Tuesday, taking the death toll to 14 \u2013 the highest tally of deaths outside China. \u201cTests showed they had the new coronavirus,\u201d the head of the medical science university of Saveh said, according to the website. Iran\u2019s state TV said a team from the World Health Organisation (WHO) will arrive in the country on Tuesday. Iran has yet to say how many people it has quarantined but the semi-official Mehr news agency said 320 people had been hospitalised in the Shi\u2019ite holy city of Qom, where Tehran confirmed its first two deaths last week. The outbreak in Iran comes as its clerical rulers face mounting U.S. pressure that has hit the economy hard. The outbreak threatens to isolate Iran even further, with several countries suspending flights after coronavirus cases in travellers from Iran were confirmed in Canada, Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, Afghanistan and Iraq. Some neighbouring countries have closed their borders. Six arab countries have reported their first cases of coronavirus. Kuwait said on Tuesday the total number of infected people there had risen to eight. Bahrain said it also had eight cases, four of whom were Saudi nationals and two Bahrainis. To prevent the spread of the virus, Iranian authorities have ordered the nationwide cancellation of concerts, soccer matches, closures of schools and universities in many provinces as a precaution. South Korea reports 84 more cases of new virus, bringing total number of infections to 977. Japan\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said on Tuesday that new measures \u2013 including companies letting their employees work from home \u2013 will determine whether Japan can control its coronavirus outbreak. \u201cWe are at an extremely important time in ending the spread of infection at an early stage,\u201d Abe said at a meeting of a task force on the outbreak. He said sporadic cases of unknown transmission routes and small clusters were occurring, but slowing down the pace of new infections was crucial to stopping its spread. Japan has confirmed 850 cases, third highest among nations behind China and South Korea. They include people infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Abe\u2019s government has been widely criticized after the quarantine of the ship was seen to have failed to stop the virus from spreading. Three former passengers on the ship died, and more than a dozen people who were evacuated from it by their home countries later tested positive for new coronavirus. Hancock added that the government was not aware of any Britons who were in the quarantined areas of northern Italy. However, he said that anyone who is should make contact with the embassy in Rome. \u201cWe are not aware of any British citizens who are within the quarantined area, if they are we would ask them to get in contact with the consulate in Rome,\u201d he said. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said the official advice around coronavirus is being updated so that people returning to the UK from any areas quarantined by the Italian government should self-isolate whether they show symptoms or not. Speaking on BBC Breakfast on Tuesday, Hancock said: \u201cYes, the official advice which will be formally updated at 8am is going to change so that those who have been to northern Italy \u2013 north of Pisa \u2013 if they have flu-like symptoms should self-isolate. \u201cIf people have been to the affected areas that the Italian government have quarantined then they should self-isolate whether or not they have symptoms.\u201d Caitlin Fletcher, an Australian living and studying in Seoul, said: The South Korean government has automatically extended foreign f4 visas \u2013 which are mainly for students \u2013 to prevent immigration offices from being overwhelmed. Those registered all received text messages yesterday and I checked the website this morning. Most classes have been pushed back at least a fortnight and foreign students enrolled in courses in Daegu have been un-enrolled. I am a student in Seoul, the capital. Schools in South Korea at the moment are currently on holidays, so the government has just extended the break. Many of the planned university graduation ceremonies last week had to be cancelled in Seoul. I know that the government asked the universities to delay the start of the next semester, particularly at the language schools, to account for foreign students. Over the last few days, it has been noticeable that the numbers of infection cases is rising. There are less people out on the streets but there are still people around, and shops and restaurants are still open. One of the bigger department stores had to close so that they could disinfect the food court last weekend. I can only imagine the damage the virus has had on the economy. General travel is not advised. Seoul is quite far from Daegu \u2013 about four hours by car \u2013 so it\u2019s not like the infections are in the capital of South Korea. However, people are concerned \u2026 I have friends in Hong Kong and I know face mask prices there are skyrocketing. Here they are more expensive than normal but still available. A common misconception is that you can buy one mask and wear if for a while. Most masks last just a few hours so it\u2019s actually better to wear two a day. I caught the subway on Sunday and I would say 85% of people are wearing masks, not 100%. One of three Wall Street Journal reporters ordered to leave China has been told by the government that she can remain. China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, told a daily briefing that Chao Deng, who has been unable to leave the Wuhan \u2013the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 following a lockdown that sought to contain the spread of the virus, is being allowed to remain on humanitarian grounds. She can comply with the order to leave China after the epidemic ends, he said, adding that she cannot do any reporting work while there. Deng and two other Wall Street Journal reporters were ordered to leave last week after the newspaper did not comply with Beijing\u2019s repeated demands for an apology and investigation into a Feb 3 column that called China the \u201creal sick man of Asia.\u201d Kuwait reports three new cases of coronavirus, raising total to eight. The outbreak has now affected 80,000 people globally. The World Health Organization has named the illness COVID-19, referring to its origin late last year and the coronavirus that causes it. The latest figures reported by each government\u2019s health authority as of Tuesday in Beijing: Mainland China: 2,663 deaths among 77,658 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei. Hong Kong: 81 cases, two deaths. Macao: 10 cases. Japan: 850 cases, including 691 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, four deaths. South Korea: 893 cases, eight deaths. Italy: 229 cases, seven deaths. Singapore: 89 cases. Iran: 61 cases, 12 deaths. United States: 35 cases; separately, one US citizen died in China. Thailand: 37 cases. Taiwan: 30 cases, one death. Australia: 23 cases. Malaysia: 22 cases. Vietnam: 16 cases. Germany: 16 cases. France: 12 cases, one death. United Arab Emirates: 13 cases. United Kingdom: 13 cases. Canada: 11 cases. Philippines: 3 cases, one death. Kuwait: 3 cases. There have been three cases in India, two in Russia, three in Spain, two in Israel, two in Oman, two in Bahrain, one in Lebanon, one in Belgium, one in Nepal, one in Sri Lanka, one in Sweden, one in Cambodia, one in Finland, one in Egypt and one in Afghanistan. The number of novel coronavirus cases in south Korea is approaching 900 as the president Moon Jae-in said the outbreak is \u201cvery grave\u201d. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) confirmed 60 new cases in its morning update \u2013 after three days of triple-digit increases \u2013 taking the tally to 893, the largest national total anywhere outside China. The latest numbers come as the country announced its smallest rise in cases for several days. On Tuesday, president Moon Jae-in visited the outbreak\u2019s epi-centre in South Korea\u2019s fourth-largest city Daegu. More than 80% of the infections have been in Daegu and neighbouring North Gyeongsang province. \u201cThe situation is very grave,\u201d President Moon Jae-in said, wearing the uniform of a government emergency official. \u201cWe will achieve a victory in the fight against this virus,\u201d he added. The streets of Daegu - which has a population of 2.5 million - have been largely deserted for days, apart from long queues at the few shops with masks for sale. South Korea\u2019s parliament cancelled sessions Tuesday as it closed for cleaning after confirmation a person with the coronavirus had attended a meeting last week. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised travellers to \u201cavoid all nonessential travel\u201d to South Korea. Hong Kong has said it will not allow arrivals from South Korea other than returning residents, while a Mongolian ban on flights to and from the South came into force Tuesday. I am now taking over the live blog from the Guardian\u2019s London office. If you want to share any thoughts or news tips with me about the coronavirus then please email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com or tweet me @sloumarsh. Dubai International airport, the world\u2019s busiest for international travel, says UAE will limit Iran flights over the virus outbreak. The British engineering company Meggitt warned that its growth in 2020 would be constrained by factors including the disruption caused by coronavirus. The company said organic revenue growth in 2020 would come in at between 2% to 4%. That compares with the 8% rise in organic revenue growth for 2019 which it posted on Tuesday, helping drive underlying operating profit up by 10% to \u00a3402.8m. Here\u2019s a summary of what we know about the coronavirus so far: South Korea plans to test about 200,000 members of a secretive church believed to be at the centre of the country\u2019s outbreak. More than 890 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in the country, with nine fatalities. China reported 71 new deaths and 508 new infections and vowed to \u201ccomprehensively\u201d ban the trade and consumption of wild animals,. A Chinese university research team said it had developed an oral vaccine for the virus and appealed for partners in clinical trials. The latest Mission Impossible film halted production in Venice over virus fears. Italy has moved all Serie A football games and Europa League games behind closed doors to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. Japan postponed J-League matches. Asian stocks fell on opening on fears of the virus spreading. The Australian government said the impact of coronavirus will be worse than the recent bushfires. A fourth Diamond Princess passenger has died in Japan. Hong Kong has extended the closure of schools until 20 April. It also closed its borders to South Korea arrivals. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has raised its warning level for trips to South Korea to \u201cavoid non-essential travel\u201d. Two more people have died in Iran from Covid-19, according to the Reuters news agency, taking the number of fatalities in the country to 14. On Monday, Iranian officials scrambled to deny that 50 people had died of the virus in the shrine city of Qom, which is thought to be a hub of the disease in the country. You can read our full story on fears gripping the Middle East over the virus outbreak below: Catholic churches in the South Korean capital have suspended all masses and events until 10 March. \u201cAll churches of the archdiocese of Seoul will stop holding masses and all indoor and outdoor events for the next 14 days from 26 February through 10 March,\u201d the archbishop of Seoul, Cardinal Andrew Yeom Soo-jung, said in a statement. This includes the city\u2019s Myeongdong cathedral. Seoul\u2019s archdiocese has 232 chapels and churches under its jurisdiction. Earlier, the Seoul city government banned all gatherings of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a minor Christian sect believed to be responsible for a surge in the number of coronavirus infections in the country. At Tianjin University, near Beijing, scientists say they have developed an oral vaccine for Covid-19, according to the Global Times. The professor who led the project, Huang Jinhai, said the vaccine could also serve as a potential therapy for infected patients. The outlet said Huang had taken four doses himself and had not experienced any side-effects. \u201cThe oral vaccine uses food-grade saccharomyces cerevisiae as a carrier and the spike protein of the coronavirus as a target spot to produce antibodies to fight Covid-19, according to a statement from Tianjin University,\u201d the Global Times said. The university is reported to be looking for partners to run clinical trials. Vietnamese garment makers will face a severe shortage of materials in the second quarter of this year, because of disruption to their supply chains, the chairman of the Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association says. Garments and textiles are Vietnam\u2019s third-largest export earner, and the industry is heavily reliant on materials from China. An estimated 50% of materials are shipped from China. Japan\u2019s J-League says it has postponed seven Levian Cup matches scheduled for Wednesday due to concerns about the coronavirus outbreak and is considering postponing all domestic soccer games through the first half of March. The J-League said the decision to postpone Wednesday\u2019s matches was part of efforts to contain the spread of the virus. \u201cThe J-League will make maximum efforts to prevent infection and prevent its spread,\u201d it said in a statement. The spread of the coronavirus has forced the cancellation of many sports events in recent weeks, including Serie A soccer matches in Italy, and raised alarm bells for Tokyo 2020 organisers. Japan\u2019s health minister, Katsunobu Kato, said on Tuesday it was still too early to talk about cancelling the Olympics, which are due to start on 24 July. The International Olympic Committee has said it had been advised by the World Health Organization that there is no case for contingency plans to cancel or relocate the Games. You may recall that yesterday we reported that Wuhan was lifting some restrictions for people who wanted to leave the city. However, it was reversed a few hours after being announced and Ying Yong, the newly appointed party chief in Hubei, called for strict control of the exit routes. The province\u2019s health commission has reiterated that on Tuesday. Schools in Hong Kong will stay closed until after the Easter holidays have finished in April, according to a report in the South China Morning Post. They were due to reopen on Monday 16 March but the Post says the government will keep them shut until after Easter, which is the weekend of 11/12 April. However, they may allow students to sit university exams set to start on 27 March. South Korea\u2019s numbers for coronavirus infections has gone up again \u2013 60 new infections were announced on Tuesday, bringing the country\u2019s total to 893. Nine people have died in the country. China\u2019s national health commission says strict control and prevention measures will remain in place in Hubei province, the epicentre of the global outbreak. The national health commission added it would also strictly control the outbound movement of people in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province with existing traffic controls. It follows an announcement yesterday \u2013 later reversed \u2013 that non-infected people who required medical operations would be able to leave Wuhan. Here are some more figures from state media on the scale of the fight against the virus in China. Some sobering statistics from Chinese state media on the economic impact of the virus \u2013 60% of firms face difficulties, with 6% facing bankruptcy. The China Global TV network has made an interesting graphic on the spread of the virus in Italy. The Wall Street Journal reporter in Beijing makes a good point about the difficult choice facing Chinese migrant workers: stay at home without a job, or return to cities where they will face quarantine. A passenger from the Diamond Princess in their 80s has died, the Japanese broadcaster NHK has reported. The country\u2019s education minister has also asked asked education boards with reported coronavirus cases to temporarily close schools. Koichi Hagiuda told reporters on Tuesday that education boards of Hokkaido in northern Japan and Chiba City near Tokyo have been told to take this preventive measure, NHK says. He also said some schools without confirmed infections should also consider closing. Trading is now well under way in Hong Kong where the index is down slightly, and China where the Shanghai Composite is off 1.17%. But Asia Pacific has continued to recover lost ground elsewhere with the Nikkei down a mere 2.84% and Australia off 1.3%. Seoul is up 0.5%. We heard in that news conference questions about the impact of the virus on the Olympics. Brendan Murphy, the country\u2019s chief medical officer said it was too early to tell, but the Australian Olympic team\u2019s medical director, David Hughes, has told the Sydney Morning Herald that human-to-human transmission of Covid-19 in Japan was a \u201cfar from ideal\u201d situation. He has warned that the next two weeks will be \u201cthe real test\u201d in assessing what risk the coronavirus poses to this year\u2019s event in Tokyo, and says the Australian team has begun drawing up contingencies for training in \u201csafe areas\u201d. Dr Hughes told the news outlet the virus was a \u201csignificant challenge that we would rather not have\u201d but was proceeding on the basis the Games would go ahead. \u201cThe next couple of weeks is going to be the real test in seeing whether this local transmission can be brought under control,\u201d he said. Japan has 851 confirmed cases of the virus. Of those, 691 were passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The Tokyo Olympics are due to be held from 24 Jul to 9 August. Shane Oliver, chief economist of the wealth manager AMP in Sydney, says in a note today that he now expects the global economy to stagtnate or possibly shrink a bit in this quarter. His base case is that the outbreak will be contained by March and that markets will bounce back. But there is still uncertainty as he notes that \u201csome estimates suggest that as much as 50% of China\u2019s economy has been locked down for the last three weeks which means nearly 12% knocked off Chinese GDP this quarter\u201d. Containment measures across large economies such as Italy and South Korea \u201cwill spread the economic disruption globally\u201d. As such, he says: Our rough estimate is that March quarter global GDP could now be zero or slightly negative. He concludes: The increasing global spread of the coronavirus has increased the risk of greater economic disruption for longer resulting in say a 20% fall in share markets. However, our base case of containment is that Chinese, global and hence Australian growth will rebound in the June quarter (avoiding recession in Australia\u2019s case) although the risk of a delay is significant. Against this background share markets, commodity prices and the $A remain at high risk of more downside in the short-term, but assuming some containment and a growth rebound in the June quarter markets should rebound by then. Easier than otherwise monetary and fiscal policies - with ever more stimulus measures announced in China and more monetary and fiscal easing globally - would add to this. The key things to watch for remain a further downtrend in the daily number of new cases globally and a peak in new cases in developed countries. In a big picture sense, the fall in share markets should be seen as just another correction after markets ran hard and fast into record highs this year from their last decent correction into August last year. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer is asked about the impact on the Olympics of the virus. He says it\u2019s too early to tell. \u201cThe impact (of the coronavirus) will be more significant than the bushfires and it plays out more broadly across the Australian economy,\u201d says Australia\u2019s treasurer, Josh Frydenberg. He says the Treasury has not finalised their analysis of the impact of the virus and that there\u2019s \u201cconsiderable uncertainty\u201d about it. We are now hearing from Australia\u2019s health minister, Greg Hunt. \u201cNo country has a guarantee. No country is immune,\u201d he says referring to the outbreaks in South Korea, Japan and Iran. He says Australia is following a \u201clong-prepared plan\u201d. The chief health officer Prof Brendan Murphy has the microphone now. He says he is concerned about the outbreaks in South Korea, Japan and Iran. \u201cWhilst the numbers aren\u2019t very high in Iran, the death rate would suggest that the numbers are probably higher than being reported,\u201d he says. He repeats that there is no community transmission in Australia, but adds: \u201cIf there is a global pandemic we are prepared\u201d. South Korea is planning more measures to contain the virus, including more powers to enforce quarantine and a range of stimulus for the economy. The government is clearly very worried on the latter score and is preparing an emergency budget to help tackle the outbreak. But a slowdown in South Korea is also a big concern for the rest of us because it plays a key role in the world economy. South Korea is the 12th biggest economy in the world \u2013 bigger than Spain, Mexico and Australia. But it is the 6th biggest exporter in the world and because it doesn\u2019t have many natural resources most exports are things that are used to make other stuff \u2013 known as intermediate goods. South Korea is one of the world\u2019s biggest manufacturers of semiconductors, the key electronic component of so many everyday devices. Samsung \u2013 a conglomerate or chaebol, made up of dozens of separate companies \u2013 not only makes phones and TVs, it it is the No 2 maker of semiconductors after Intel. Another Korean firm, SK Hynix, is fourth on the list. Carmaking is also a huge part of the Korean economy with Hyundai ranked third in the world behind Toyota and VW. It suspended production at its massive Ulsan site earlier this month because of a shoretage of parts from China and has warned that dealerships can expect delays to delivery of new models as a result. Read more here on how global businesses are suffering: We\u2019re now hearing from the Australian treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, on the economic impact of the virus. He has just returned from the G20 finance minister\u2019s meeting. \u201cHere in Australian the economic impact has been significant,\u201d he says, \u201cnot just the tourism and education sectors, which together contribute around $16bn to the Australian economy, but also agriculture, and the destruction to end-to-end supply chains.\u201d Morrison says the outbreak is affecting the building and supply chain industries, in addition to the education and tourism sectors in Australia. This is a global health crisis. And the world economy has become increasingly interconnected and interdependent over many, many years. And what this impact is is putting up walls and blockages between those connections, between all of these countries. Even without a travel ban, there would have been a significant reduction in the movement of people, as we\u2019re seeing all around the world. We\u2019re hearing a news conference from the Australian PM, Scott Morrison. He says that 15 patients who had been diagnosed with the virus have now been discharged. The seven remaining cases are returnees from the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship. He says all those cases are mild. He says there is no human-to-human transmission in Australia. Hong Kong has closed its borders to anyone arriving from South Korea, except for Hong Kong residents, who will have to undergo two weeks of medical surveillance. John Lee, Hong Kong secretary of security, told reporters the security bureau would issue a travel red alert in response to the outbreak in South Korea and anyone who had been there in the past fortnight would be denied entry. South Korea has seen the biggest outbreak outside of mainland China. Eight people have died, and more than 830 are infected. Two people have died in Hong Kong after contracting Covid-19, out of 79 confirmed cases. Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy legislator, appeared to criticise the chief executive, Carrie Lam, on Twitter. In late January, amid protests by medical workers calling for Hong Kong to close all of its land borders with mainland China, Lam said it \u201cmay fuel discrimination\u201d. Hong Kong eventually closed all but a few of the border crossings, and implemented compulsory quarantine for arrivals from mainland China, but the administration\u2019s response since the outbreak has been criticised. In South Korea, the government has called for \u201cextraordinary\u201d measures to contain the virus, including the creation of a supplementary budget, as cases of the virus jump to 833, with 8 deaths. There will be a crackdown on the illegal hoarding of face masks, with officials saying the next 7-10 days will be crucial in containing the outbreak. Footage from Daegu, the centre of the outbreak in the country, shows lengthy lines to buy face masks. Stocks are fighting back a bit in Asia Pacific after that ugly start today. The Nikkei is off 3.1% compared with more than 4% at the beginning of trading. In Australia, the ASX200 is down 1.6% after falling 2.4% earlier. The Australian dollar is clinging on around 11-year lows of US66.15c. Here\u2019s my colleague Ben Butler with another update: The Australian market has clawed back some of its early losses. After falling as much as about 2.5% in early trade, by lunchtime the benchmark ASX200 index was trading at about 1.6% down from yesterday. But coronavirus fears continue to flay stocks that are heavily exposed to China or sell to Australia\u2019s debt-laden consumers. Airline flight website Webjet is down 6.8%, softdrinks company Coca-Cola Amatil is off 5.25% and telco TPG - which has recently been given the green light to merge with rival Vodafone Hutchinson - has fallen about 2.6%. Miner Rio Tinto, which reports its results tomorrow, is down 1.9% while rival BHP is down 1.75%. Both rely heavily on selling iron ore to Chinese customers. Let\u2019s have a look at how today\u2019s numbers compare with previous days ... I have added the past few days statistics below, but today\u2019s announced deaths are less than half of Monday\u2019s (71 compared to 150). This seems to confirm WHO chief\u2019s comments that the epidemic has\u201cpeaked\u201d inside China. Tuesday 25 February: 71 deaths, 508 new cases Monday 24 February: 150 deaths, 409 new cases Sunday 23 February: 97 deaths, 648 new cases Saturday 22 February: 109 deaths, 397 new cases Friday 21 February: 118 deaths, 889 new cases Thursday 20 February: 114 deaths, 394 cases (China stopped counting clinically diagnosed cases this day as confirmed cases and instead counted only cases that had tested positive) Wednesday 19 February: 136 deaths, 1,749 new cases Tuesday 18 February: 98 deaths, 1097 new cases Monday 17 February: 105 deaths, 2,048 new cases Sunday 16 February: 142 deaths, 2,009 new cases Saturday 15 February: 143 deaths, 2,641 new cases Friday 14 February: 121 deaths, 5,090 new cases Thursday 13 February: 254 deaths, 15,152 new cases (On this day China began including cases diagnosed by doctors and scans in addition to patients who had tested positive to virus). The White House is preparing an urgent request for $2.5bn in funds from Congress to address the deadly coronavirus outbreak. The request is still being developed but is likely to come this week, a senior administration official said. The Department of Health and Human Services has already tapped into an emergency infectious disease rapid response fund and is seeking to transfer more than $130m from other HHS accounts to combat the virus but is pressing for more. \u201cWe need some funding here to make sure that we protect all Americans,\u201d deputy White House press secretary Hogan Gidley said on Fox News. \u201cWe need to combat this, we need to make sure our people are safe and the president is always going to take action to do that.\u201d Among the funding requirements is money to reimburse the Pentagon, which is housing evacuees from China who are required to undergo 14-day quarantines at several military bases in California. We\u2019re getting the Chinese Health Commission figures for new deaths and cases, and here are the headline points: 71 new deaths (68 in Hubei [56 in Wuhan]. Two cases in Shandong, one in Guangdong) 508 new cases (499 in Hubei, of which 464 in Wuhan) 530 suspected new cases 2,589 new cases recovered and discharged This means cumulatively, there have been 77,658 confirmed cases and 2,663 deaths. Chinese state media has given some new figures for prison infections of Covid-19 in Hubei province. We heard last week that there were more than 200 infections in the women\u2019s prison, a figure that the People\u2019s Daily says now stands at 279. There are also 43 cases of the infection in Shayang Hanjin prison, but no fatalities have bene reported. The losses in Tokyo aren\u2019t quite as steep as futures were pricing in and that might have something to do with signs that the market expects central banks to come to the rescue with renewed stimulus in the shape of interest rate cuts. Futures for the Federal Reserve funds rate \u2013 a measure of what might happen with US rates \u2013 have surged in the last few days to price in a better-than-even chance of a quarter-point rate cut in April, Reuters reports. They imply more than 50 basis points of reductions by year end which may be enough to keep the show on the road \u2013 and, of course, the current occupant of the White House in place. Central banks across Asia have already been easing policy, while governments have promised large injections of fiscal stimulus, something western countries might have to consider. China has unleashed all manner of stimulus in the past month while South Korea has followed suit. China has \u201ccomprehensively\u201d banned the trade and consumption of wild animals, according to Chinese state media. On Monday the standing committee of the National People\u2019s Congress adopted a proposal to prohibit wildlife trade and transportation, and to end the consumption of wild animals. The move makes the suspension announced in January, permanent. \u201cThe move aims to safeguard biological and ecological security and effectively prevent major public health risks,\u201d Xinhua news reported. The consumption of any terrestrial world animal, including those bred in captivity, was \u201cthoroughly prohibited\u201d, it said, and subject to severe punishment. The use of wild animals in medicine or for scientific research is also now subject to strict conditions and approval processes. China\u2019s government has banned the trade and consumption of wild animals during previous outbreaks, including SARS, after the disease was linked to the consumption of wild animals. The source of the coronavirus outbreak has not been confirmed, and scientists are working to decode its origins. One theory is that a wild animal like the pangolin \u2013 a widely trafficked animal which is high demand in Asia \u2013 ate infected bat droppings, and then was sold at the market at Wuhan. Filming on the latest Mission Impossible film has been stopped over over fears of the coronavirus outbreak in Italy, Press Association reports. The action movie, which stars Tom Cruise, was scheduled for a three-week shoot in Venice, but that has now been stopped after more than 200 people tested positive for the virus in Italy. It is the largest number of confirmed cases of the disease outside Asia. In a statement, Paramount Pictures said it was following the advice of the Venetian government and using an \u201cabundance of caution\u201d in halting production. \u201cDuring this hiatus we want to be mindful of the concerns of the crew and are allowing them to return home until production starts. We will continue to monitor this situation, and work alongside health and government officials as it evolves,\u201d the studio said. It is understood Hollywood star Cruise, 57, was not in Italy for filming. A big fall in Tokyo as expected. Seoul, where the Kospi took a hammering of 3.87% yesterday, is off 0.3%. As we look at the precipitous falls on markets around the world, it\u2019s important to remember that indices have been pushed to record highs from Wall Street to London and from Frankfurt to Sydney. For example, even after today\u2019s renewed battering, the ASX200 is still in positive territory for the year so far. Many would argue they were long overdue a correction so in some ways it\u2019s not a massive surprise that there is finally a reaction to concerns about what the coronavirus might mean for the global economy. And it\u2019s worth noting that futures trading is pricing in a rise on Wall Street later on today. Many traders will see this fall simply as \u201cbuying opportunityu\u201d. Could the Donald be right? The virus is affecting businesses all over the world. Here\u2019s a roundup of some of the main points in the last few hours: Investment banks including Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Nomura have curbed trips to Italy because of the outbreak, according to Reuters. Mastercard says the virus will knock 2-3% off its revenues as travel and e-commerce is curbed by the outbreak. United Airlines withdrew its earnings estimate for 2020 because of uncertainty over how long the virus outbreak will last. Kuwait has suspended flights to South Korea, Italy and Iran. Bahrain civil aviation authority has suspended all its flights from Dubai airport and Sharjah airport for 48 hours. However, Apple is reopening half its stores in China, according to Bloomberg.. The World Health Organization has said the new coronavirus epidemic has \u201cpeaked\u201d in China its chief but warned that a surge in cases elsewhere was \u201cdeeply concerning\u201d. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the peak in China occurred between 23 January and 2 February and the number of new cases there \u201chas been declining steadily since then\u201d. Although Tedros said \u201cthe sudden increase in new cases is certainly very concerning\u201d, he said: \u201cusing the word pandemic now does not fit the facts, but it may certainly cause fear\u201d. The word pandemic is used to describe a serious disease that is spreading in an uncontrolled way around the world. Some experts believe that a pandemic is inevitable. \u201cWe now consider this to be a pandemic in all but name, and it\u2019s only a matter of time before the World Health Organization starts to use the term in its communications,\u201d said Dr Bharat Pankhania, from the University of Exeter Medical School. You can read our full story below. Italy has moved all Serie A football games and Europa League games behind closed doors to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. \u201cFollowing the demands of the sports world and knowing that the ban on sporting events open to the public remains in force in six regions of northern Italy, we have agreed to the holding of matches behind closed doors,\u201d said sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora after a meeting of the Council of Ministers. Italy reported its seventh death from the virus on Monday and it has the most confirmed cases in Europe. Inter Milan announced their Europa League match with Ludogorets on Thursday would be played with no fans present. \u201cIn agreement with UEFA, the Lombardy regional health authorities and Milan city council, our return game with Ludogorets will be played behind closed doors,\u201d an Inter statement said. The sports minister did not specify which Serie A matches at the weekend would be included in the ban. There are six games in the regions he mentioned, including the clash on Sunday evening between leader Juventus and third-place Inter. With economic uncertainty gripping the markets, the credit card giant, Mastercard, has said it will likely take a hit of between 2% and 3% due to the coronavirus outbreak. The company said it now expects revenue growth between 9% and 10% in the current quarter as the virus impacts travel and e-commerce across borders. The credit card giant also expects that net revenue growth on a year-over-year basis in 2020 would be at the low end of the low-teens range. As losses in Sydney extend to 2.4%, traders are braced for a huge fall of almost 7% in Tokyo when trading starts there in about 35 minutes. It\u2019s partly because there was a bank holiday yesterday so there\u2019s some pent-up selling to be done. But that\u2019s a big drop in anyone\u2019s terms. It shows that the complacency of recent weeks, when some indices such as the Dow and the ASX hit nrecord highs, is being swiftly replaced by a selling frenzy. Oil also sold off 4% overnight so the gloom is stretching across different assets. Bond yields are heading for the floor as well as money shifts into the safety of government securities. Yields - or the interest rate - move in the opposite direction to bond prices. So the more demand for bonds, the more they cost but the lower the yield goes. My colleague Ben Butler has this: The benchmark ASX200 is down 2.3% shortly after the market\u2019s open, with falls across all sectors. Logistics company Qube has taken the biggest hit, shedding more than 10%. The company unveiled a 15% fall in profits this morning, but says the drop is due to accounting standards changes. Other stocks taking a big hit include troubled financial services group IOOF, down 6.1%, funds manager Magellan, down 5.7%. All the big four banks - ANZ, Commonwealth, NAB and Westpac - are down more than 2%. Airline comparison site Webjet is getting slaughtered, falling more than 6.3%, while travel agency Flight Centre is off by 3%. The falls in Sydney have deepened to 2.3% which is in line with what futures trading suggested. The ASX200 in Sydney is down 1.11% in the first minutes of trade. Not everyone is gloomy though. Donald Trump has tweeted from India that the virus was under control in the United States. And, more boldly, he said that he thought the stock market was \u201cstarting to look very good to me!\u201d. There\u2019s a lot of markets chatter around this morning. Chris Weston from Pepperstone in Melbourne says Asia is heading for a \u201cdark and sinister\u201d opening and the first half hour will be the key, he says. Asia equities face a dark and sinister open, with Aussie SPI futures some 2.6% from the official ASX200 close. We can use that as a guide, and while some of the move lower in US equities was already discounted, we see S&amp;P500 futures 1.9% lower from the same time. It takes a brave soul to be buying these markets, but the opening 30 minutes will be key to psychology \u2013 it could well be a buyer strike and another day where order book dynamics take hold and the sellers exasperate the move. Expect moves of 2% for the Nikkei 225 and Hang Seng too. Michael McCarthy of CMC Markets said stock market investors had pressed the panic button after a couple of weeks of gains in the face of mounting signs that the virus was going to have a big negative impact on the global economy. Investors had been \u201cforced to acknowledge both supply and demand shocks\u201d he writes: Share markets tanked in overnight trading as equity investors finally moved into line with other markets. European and US indices fell by 3% to 4%. Crude oil dropped 4%, and base metals fell. In contrast safe haven markets extended recent gains. US ten-year bonds traded down to 1.36%, and thirty-year bonds hit their lowest point ever at 1.83%. Gold lifted towards $1,700 an ounce, and the Japanese yen gained a big figure. Significant viral outbreaks in Japan, Korea and Italy raised pressure and forced investors to acknowledge both supply and demand shocks. The disruption to supply chains if countries close borders to contain outbreaks could see global trade grind to a halt. Strong rallies in bonds and gold over the last two weeks reflected growing worry about the economic impact of the Covid-19 virus. Many share markets hit all-time highs over the same period, despite these clear warning signs. An important driver of the overnight damage in stocks was the sharp reversal in sentiment from complacency to concern. The world\u2019s trading day kicks off in Sydney shortly where the benchmark ASX200 index is expected to fall sharply for the second day running. It lost 2.3% on Monday and futures trade points to a dip of 2.4% this morning after heavy losses in Wall Street, where the Dow Jones average had its worst day since December 2018. In Japan, where the Nikkei was closed on Monday for emperor\u2019s day, futures point to a fall of 5% at the opening later today. Welcome to the rolling coverage of the coronavirus outbreak as concerns continues to build about the spread of the disease outside China. The main developments are: The outbreak is a pandemic in \u201call but name\u201d according to a UK expert The death toll in Italy has risen to seven with more than 100 declared cases \u2013 the most outside Asia \u2013 as the authorities urged people to stay calm. Stock markets in Asia are braced for more heavy losses after billions of dollars were wiped off values in the US and Europe. China has postponed its annual party congress due to start in Beijing next week. Austria is stopping suspected carriers from entering the country at its borders. Iran says 12 people have died, denying reports from a news agency in the country that 50 had fallen victim in the pilgrim city of Qom. UK schools would be shut under emergency measures drawn up to deal with a serious outbreak The US is considering a response to China\u2019s \u201cegregious\u201d expulsion of Wall Street Journal reporters. Kuwait has suspended flights to South Korea, Italy and Iran.",
