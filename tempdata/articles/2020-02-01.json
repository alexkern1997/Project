British Airways has cancelled all of its 129 flights that were scheduled to fly to Beijing and Shanghai from London Heathrow, from 29 January until 29 February, affecting up to 24,000 passengers.</p> \n  <p>Similarly, Virgin Atlantic has today announced it will be suspending its flights to and from China, as of 2 February, until further notice. According to Cirium data, the decision could affect 56 of the British carrier\u2019s scheduled flights and as many as 11,500 passengers to the end of February.</p> \n  <p>This is despite the World Health Organization specifically asking countries not to impose travel and trade restrictions with China.

not getting to the correct places. </p> \n  <p><strong>Michael Standaert</strong>, who is reporting for the Guardian from China, earlier reported how the Red Cross Society of Hubei has come under fire from Chinese netizens who say the charity is sending high-quality medical grade N95 filtration masks to hospitals that are not at the centre of the outbreak nor fever clinics in the greatest need of masks.</p> \n  <p>The Red Cross subsequently released a statement saying their announcement was mislabelled and it should have said they were KN95 masks, not N95 masks, which is why those other hospitals got them and not the frontline treatment hospitals.</p> \n  <p>But a chief executive of a company that makes high-quality face masks in China cast doubt on the claim. \u201cTo me that sounds like quite the excuse,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cN95 and KN95 uses exactly the same standards.

I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t get to all of them. Here\u2019s the latest full report: The number of confirmed deaths from China\u2019s coronavirus outbreak has risen to 258, as authorities in hardest-hit Hubei province reported 45 new fatalities, AFP reports. In its daily update, the provincial health commission also said newly confirmed cases of infection in Hubei continued to grow at a steady pace, to 1,347. That puts the national total over 11,000, based on numbers previously issued by the central government. The seventh case of coronavirus has been confirmed in California, CNBC reports. The Santa Clara Public Health Department said an adult man tested positive for the new coronavirus, marking at least the seventh case in the US as the outbreak spreads across the globe. The patient contracted the virus in Wuhan and has been isolated at home since, county officials said at a press conference Friday. Spain\u2019s National Centre for Microbiology has confirmed the country\u2019s first case of coronavirus after a man was diagnosed with the virus on the remote island of La Gomera in the Canaries, the Health Ministry said late on Friday. The patient is part of a group of five people taken into observation on the island and isolated after it was found they had come into contact with a German man diagnosed with the virus. The death toll from coronavirus has jumped to 249 in China\u2019s Hubei, Reuters is reporting. The last figure we had was 213. More than 9,709 cases have been confirmed in mainland China so far. Here\u2019s a summary to get you up to speed: Two patients in England, who are members of the same family, have tested positive for coronavirus. They are being treated in Newcastle. The Foreign Office said it was \u2018aware of frustrations\u2019 of Brits who had wanted to leave Wuhan but proved unable to board the evacuation plane. Michael Gove told Sky News the government would send another plane to Wuhan to evacuate British nationals if needed. Russia has reported its first two cases of coronavirus. Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister Tatiana Golikova told reporters the infected people were Chinese citizens who had been isolated. The plane carrying 83 Britons to the UK from Wuhan in China landed at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire and the evacuees were driven to a facility on the Wirral where they will stay in quarantine for the next 14 days. Thailand has recorded its first human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus after a taxi driver was apparently infected by a traveller. The Trump administration has declared a public health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak. It has also announced it will temporarily bar entry to the US for people traveling from China. A plan to evacuate Australians stranded in China is likely to go ahead over the weekend, the AAP news agency is reporting. Here is an explainer about what coronavirus is: Thailand has recorded its first human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus after a taxi driver was apparently infected by a traveller, heightening concern over the virus\u2019s potential to spread across the globe. The taxi driver was among five new patients confirmed on Friday in the worst-hit country outside China, bringing the total number of cases in Thailand to 19. Read more on that here: Here\u2019s an interesting article about Wuhan, which gives an idea about how the city and its inhabitants have handled the crisis. The Trump administration has declared a public health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak. It has also announced it will temporarily bar entry to the US for people traveling from China unless they are Americans or immediately related to US citizens. The restrictions on travel begin on Sunday afternoon. Robert R Redfield, director of the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention said: \u201cThis is a serious health situation in China, but I want to emphasise the risk to the American public currently is low. It is our goal to keep it that way.\u201d Read more here: There is a press briefing going on at White House with members of the US taskforce. You can watch it here: Six buses were led by a police escort to the rear of the hospital and on to a side road leading to the accommodation block, PA media reports. A medic wearing a white specialist suit was sat next to the coach driver of each vehicle. The convoy, which also included a number of ambulances, then travelled out of sight. Patients disembarked from behind barriers covering the accommodation entrance but some could be seen inside wearing masks as they walked upstairs to their rooms for the next fortnight. Here are a few pictures of the evacuees arriving at Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral. Buses carrying 83 Britons who returned to the UK from Wuhan on Friday morning have arrived at a facility on the Wirral. The convoy travelled from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire to Arrowe Park Hospital, where the Britons will be quarantined for 14 days in NHS staff accommodation. Here\u2019s a bit more detail about the two people diagnosed with coronavirus following some reader questions via email. They were taken ill at the StayCity apartment hotel in York on Wednesday and were later confirmed to be the first UK cases of the coronavirus. It is understood the two guests travelled to the UK from China recently. They are two members of the same family. They are undergoing treatment in Newcastle because it is a specialist Airborne High Consequence Infectious Diseases (HCID) centre. Public Health England (PHE), which is urgently trying to trace those who came into contact with the two people, said steps will be taken to reduce the risk to the public and it is \u201cidentifying the areas where there is deemed to be a risk\u201d. A PHE spokeswoman said: \u201cOur public health experts are well trained at assessing risk, and are adopting approaches that they have used in a number of emerging infections to reduce the risk to the public.\u201d At the StayCity hotel on Friday, business carried on as usual, with guests continuing to check in for weekend breaks in York despite the firm confirming that two people who have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK had been staying there. Outside the hotel, two guests told the Guardian that as recently as Friday morning they had been told by reception staff the reports that two tourists had been taken ill from their apartment on Wednesday were \u201clies\u201d. \u201cThis morning they said it was a lie and not to listen to it,\u201d said Andy Neale, 21, who is staying at StayCity for the night with his girlfriend. \u201cIt\u2019s not ideal. They should\u2019ve taken some precaution.\u201d He added that the incident had marred the couple\u2019s getaway, saying: \u201cMy girlfriend is stressing out, she\u2019s using hand wipes on everything.\u201d A family who were staying in the hotel on a visit from Asia to see their daughter, who is a student in York, said they had been told the cases were \u201cfalse information\u201d when they asked staff if reports were true. Helen Papakosta, 15, from Greece, showed reporters a video she had taken on her phone of people in hazmat suits arriving at the hotel on Thursday morning \u2013 presumably to deep clean the suite where the affected guests had been staying. Although her mother, Chrisa Papakosta, 48, whom she had been staying at the hotel with, was unfazed by the event she was \u201cconcerned\u201d by it. A statement from StayCity, the chain that owns the hotel, read: \u201cWe have now received confirmation that two guests staying in one of our apartments in York have been tested positive for the coronavirus. \u201cWe have been advised by Public Health England that there is minimal ongoing risk of infection to either guests or staff, and as such our York property remains open for business. In due course the apartment concerned will undergo a thorough environmental clean and disinfection by a specialist contractor. We would like to reassure all our guests that we are following official advice on this matter and that the health and safety of everyone working and staying in our properties remains of paramount importance to us.\u201d Following on from the earlier post about health officials urgently trying to trace anyone who came into contact with two people diagnosed with coronavirus, Public Health England have clarified the definition of close contact. A new statement defines close contact as coming within two metres of the infected person for 15 minutes. Earlier we reported that Sharon Peacock, the director of the National Infection Service at PHE, said: \u201cPublic Health England is contacting people who had close contact with the confirmed cases. The two cases were staying in York when they became unwell. \u201cClose contacts will be given health advice about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the 14 days after contact with the confirmed cases. \u201cThis tried-and-tested method will ensure we are able to minimise any risk to them and the wider public.\u201d Up to 35,000 passengers could be affected by the cancellation of flights to mainland China by UK airlines, PA Media reports: British Airways announced on Wednesday it had grounded its daily flights connecting Heathrow with Beijing and Shanghai, after a change in government travel advice relating to the outbreak. It has cleared its schedules until at least the end of February. Virgin Atlantic initially continued its flights between Heathrow and Shanghai, but on Thursday night it announced it will suspend the route for 14 days. Several Chinese carriers are running their usual schedule to UK airports such as Heathrow, Gatwick and Manchester. Global travel and data analytics firm Cirium calculated that the decision of British Airways and Virgin Atlantic to suspend flights has affected the travel plans of as many as 35,000 passengers. Peter Morris, chief economist at Ascend by Cirium, said: \u201cCirium data clearly shows the dramatic impact that coronavirus is having, with nearly 10,000 scheduled flights to, from and within China being suspended between January 23 and 28. \u201cWhile the industry is playing its part to help prevent the spread of the virus, the outbreak will inevitably cause significant disruption of schedules and travel patterns in the short and medium term.\u201d If you are feeling concerned about how coronavirus is spread, here\u2019s a good explainer by my colleagues Hannah Devlin and Ellen Wishart. The Wuhan coronavirus outbreak is a new illness and scientists are still assessing how it spreads from person to person, but similar viruses tend to spread via cough and sneeze droplets. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, they release droplets of saliva or mucus. These droplets can fall on people in the vicinity and can be either directly inhaled or picked up on the hands then transferred when someone touches their face, causing infection. For flu, some hospital guidelines define exposure as being within six feet of an infected person who sneezes or coughs for 10 minutes or longer.

Lunar new year celebrations across the UK have been cancelled because of the outbreak of the coronavirus. Events due to take place this weekend have been called off in Oxford, Cambridge, Colchester, Exeter, Manchester, Wigan and Bristol. Marvin Rees, the mayor of Bristol, said the decision to cancel the celebrations at the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery had been made after discussions with the city\u2019s Chinese community and in solidarity with those affected. \u201cOur deepest sympathies are with Chinese friends both at home and abroad who have been affected by coronavirus, and I want to extend my condolences to those who have lost loved ones,\u201d he said. The United States drew China\u2019s wrath with a travel warning on Friday. Russia, Britain, Sweden and Italy all reported their first cases, with Rome declaring its own national emergency as it sought to reconstruct the itinerary of two infected Chinese tourists. \u201cDo not travel to China due to novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan,\u201d the US state department said, raising the warning for China to the same level as Afghanistan and Iraq. Beijing, which has only just started to mend tattered trade ties with the US, called that move \u201ctruly mean\u201d given the World Health Organization had commended its containment efforts and not recommended travel or trade curbs. \u201cThe World Health Organization urged countries to avoid travel restrictions, but very soon after that, the United States did the opposite,\u201d the Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s truly mean.\u201d Japan also advised citizens to put off non-urgent travel to China, while Bahrain recommended no travel to any country hit by the virus, and Iran and Mongolia urged a ban on all travellers from China. Singapore, a major travel hub in Asia, stopped entry of passengers with a recent history of travel to China and also suspended visas for Chinese passport holders. The ban extends to those just transiting Singapore. Just a quick update on numbers: Just under 10,000 cases (9,692) have been confirmed by the Chinese authorities, with 213 people having died, all in China. And cases have spread to more than 20 countries outside China, including England. Modelling research published in the Lancet estimates that up to 75,800 individuals in Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, may have been infected with the new coronavirus by 25 January. The coach company that collected British passengers after they landed in the UK on a flight from Wuhan has said its vehicles will be \u201cdeep cleaned\u201d. At least seven coaches from Horseman Coaches Ltd were seen arriving at the Brize Norton RAF base in Oxfordshire at around 10am. The drivers had agreed to take the job, a company spokesman said, and will be given paid leave to \u201cremain at home for the next 10 days\u201d. The vehicles will also be removed from service for a minimum of 10 days after they are cleaned, the company said. After several delays, the evacuation flight left Wuhan at 9.45am local time on Friday, carrying 83 Britons and 27 non-UK nationals, mostly from EU countries. The Horseman Coaches spokesman told the PA news agency: \u201cThe Department for Health have procedures in place for the vehicles to be deep cleaned. \u201cThat is part of the process of this undertaking, which will happen as soon as the vehicles are clear.\u201d He added: \u201cI can give everybody assurance that everything will be cleansed sufficiently.\u201d On arrival in the UK the British passengers on the evacuation flight boarded the coaches and faced the more than three-hour drive to Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral for a quarantine period of 14 days, where they will be housed in an NHS staff accommodation block with access to the internet. The Horseman Coaches spokesman declined to comment on whether or not the drivers would also have to be put in isolation, but this was later clarified. A statement on the company\u2019s Facebook page said it had been contacted by the British government on Thursday afternoon, adding: \u201cAs an extra precaution Horseman Coaches have decided to take, the drivers involved will take paid leave and remain at home for the next 10 days, and likewise after the cleansing of the vehicles, the vehicles will be removed from service for a minimum of 10 days.\u201d Health officials are urgently trying to trace those who came into contact with two people diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK. Public Health England (PHE) confirmed that the two people taken ill had been staying in York when they became unwell. The pair are being treated by Newcastle upon Tyne hospitals NHS foundation trust in its specialist Airborne High Consequences Infectious Disease Centre (HCID). It is understood that they travelled to the UK from China recently. Prof Sharon Peacock, director of the National Infection Service at PHE, said: \u201cPublic Health England is contacting people who had close contact with the confirmed cases. The two cases were staying in York when they became unwell. \u201cClose contacts will be given health advice about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the 14 days after contact with the confirmed cases. \u201cThis tried-and-tested method will ensure we are able to minimise any risk to them and the wider public.\u201d Earlier, Peacock said that while staff were working to trace people who had been in contact with the pair, they did not currently have \u201cany idea\u201d of how high that number might be. On Wednesday night, the StayCity apartment-hotel in York was put on lockdown when some family members, believed to be Chinese nationals, were taken to hospital after falling ill. The Guardian reporter Josh Halliday has been speaking with families living near the Merseyside hospital being used to quarantine potential coronavirus cases. They have said they are concerned and confused as dozens of evacuated Britons were due to arrive at the NHS facility. Some residents expressed concern about the proximity of the quarantine site to their homes and questioned whether the busy hospital would be able to cope with the additional pressure. Del Willden, 53, said he had nothing but praise for hospital staff and was pleased the evacuees had returned safely from China. But he added: \u201cMy concern is for the hospital. This is my local hospital and I know and have experienced the struggles they suffer on a daily basis.\u201d Singapore has announced that it is closing its borders with China. The island nation banned Chinese visitors and other foreigners who had been to China in the past 14 days. The visa suspension will come into effect immediately so travellers can be informed in advance, while the travel restriction will start at 11.59pm on Saturday. The government did not say when these restrictions would be lifted. Singapore, which currently has 13 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, has China as one of its biggest trading partners and is a popular destination for Chinese tourists. Previously, the government of Mongolia said on Friday that it would close its border with China until 2 March in an effort to prevent the virus from being imported. The first case of the coronavirus has been confirmed in Sweden, according to a report in the digital news publisher The Local. A patient at the Ryhov county hospital in J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping, central-southern Sweden, has tested positive for the coronavirus, the Public Health Agency of Sweden (Folkh\u00e4lsomyndigheten) confirmed to the website. The patient is a woman who landed in Sweden on 24 January after visiting the Wuhan area in China. At that point she had no symptoms, said the agency. But she later developed a cough and contacted the health services in J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping. She is being kept in isolation at the clinic for infectious diseases and is not seriously ill. RECOMMENDED: How worried should you be about the coronavirus in Sweden? \u201cIt is important to remember that individual cases is not the same thing as the infection spreading in Sweden. We currently consider this risk to be very low based on experiences from other countries,\u201d said Karin Tegmark Wisell, head of the Public Health Agency\u2019s department for microbiology. Nearly 10,000 Chinese flights have now been suspended since the coronavirus outbreak, according to global travel and data analytics expert Cirium. The thousands of cancellations in the last week, come as authorities in China, and around the world, grapple with the spread of the virus. Cirium statistics show that 9,807 scheduled flights within, to and from mainland China did not fly from 23 January. The data spans the period from the day before the first reported flight cancellation to 28 January \u2013 the latest day for which figures are available. A growing number of international carriers are suspending scheduled flights to mainland China, including UK airlines. British Airways has cancelled all of its 129 flights that were scheduled to fly to Beijing and Shanghai from London Heathrow, from 29 January until 29 February, affecting up to 24,000 passengers. Similarly, Virgin Atlantic has today announced it will be suspending its flights to and from China, as of 2 February, until further notice. According to Cirium data, the decision could affect 56 of the British carrier\u2019s scheduled flights and as many as 11,500 passengers to the end of February. This is despite the World Health Organization specifically asking countries not to impose travel and trade restrictions with China. The health organisation said it would question border closures, quarantining of aeroplane passengers who aren\u2019t ill, and similar steps. The hospital in Newcastle which is treating Britain\u2019s first confirmed cases of coronavirus has urged other patients to attend their appointments as normal. Two Chinese nationals were taken to the hospital from a hotel in York after displaying symptoms of the virus. In a statement this afternoon, Newcastle upon Tyne hospitals NHS foundation trust said there was \u201cno risk\u201d to other patients and visitors while the pair were undergoing treatment. It said: \u201cOur hospital is one of five highly specialised infectious diseases units capable of dealing with this illness. \u201cYou should not be concerned \u2013 there is no risk to other patients and visitors. \u201cAll of our services are operating as usual. If you have a hospital appointment, please attend this as planned.\u201d The two patients taken unwell are being treated in the Royal Victoria Infirmary\u2019s High Consequence Infectious Diseases (HCID) unit, which has specialist areas where patients can be isolated to ensure infectious diseases are not spread further. There are specific areas where staff can change in and out of protective clothing and equipment, while patient isolation rooms have tightly controlled air flow and filtering. In severe cases of infection for patients, treatment can include life support such as the use of a ventilator, dialysis to support the kidneys and artificial hydration or nutrition. Eagle eyed readers are questioning why the driver of the coach, which is transferring passengers on the evacuation flight from Wuhan to the UK to Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral, is not wearing any protective clothing. The driver, in a high-vis jacket, is next to a medic who is wearing a full Hazmat suit including a helmet with a visor. Passengers on the evacuation flight from Wuhan to the UK have been speaking to the media. The 83 British passengers who landed at at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire earlier today are now being transferred by coach to an accommodation block at Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral, where they will be quarantined for 14 days, monitored and treated if any symptoms develop. The remaining 27 passengers, all non-UK nationals, will then be flown on to Spain. James Convey told Sky News from the plane: \u201cIt was quite a positive atmosphere to be honest. Everyone was relieved to get out of China. \u201cThere were a lot of obstacles for a lot of people to get on that plane and a lot of us overcame those obstacles with the help of the British and Chinese authorities. \u201cWe\u2019re all very relieved to be back in the UK. \u201cIt was a very tight turnaround. We had about 1.5 hours\u2019 notice to get to Wuhan airport. All the transport was locked down. The roads were closed. \u201cBut my mother-in-law managed to call in a few favours \u2026 amazingly we did get there on time. \u201cI think there\u2019s probably a lot of people who didn\u2019t \u2026 but also there were lots of people on the flight.\u201d A plan to evacuate Australians stranded in China is likely to go ahead over the weekend, the AAP news agency is reporting. Evacuees will be flown out of China on a Qantas passenger plane and could leave Wuhan in the early hours of Monday morning. A scheduled Qantas plane leaving Sydney for Hong Kong on Friday night will stay there waiting for the green light from Chinese officials to enter Wuhan. Evacuees will be flown back to Darwin first before being transported on to Christmas Island in smaller aircraft where they will be met by medical specialists who have spent the weekend preparing a quarantine facility. The nation\u2019s top health bureaucrats have not yet recommended suspending all flights from China but the Transport Workers Union is calling on the government to do so. This is Nazia Parveen taking over the live blog from Manchester now. As usual, please send me any coronavirus-related information, tips, questions or stories that you think we should be covering and I\u2019ll do my best to get them in. You can reach me via email at nazia.parveen@theguardian.com or via my Twitter profile, @NParveenG Patrick Graham, one of the British citizens evacuated from Wuhan, shared footage of the plane touching down at RAF Brize Norton. He joked with his social media followers: \u201cThe infected are coming,\u201d before adding: \u201cThank you staff wamosair for getting us home \u2013 they also have to go into a period of quarantine for bringing us home.\u201d He shared a screenshot of the news the UK has confirmed two cases of the deadly virus and wrote: \u201cPlease don\u2019t blame us \u2026 we have only just landed.\u201d The Unite union has released a statement saying the welfare of staff at Arrowe Park hospital, where those travelling from China are being quarantined, needs to be a top priority. Unite has more than 1,000 members at the Wirral University teaching hospital NHS foundation trust, which includes the hospital. Its regional officer Derek Jones said: The unions were briefed on the situation by the NHS management today as the welfare of our members working at the hospital is a prime concern. It should be remembered that those who are being quarantined are British nationals who left Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak in China, and are entitled to the excellent care that the health service can provide. Staff at the hospital will not be asked to treat those being quarantined as this is being dealt with centrally by the Department of Health and Social Care. Should any of those at Arrowe Park develop symptoms associated with the virus they will be transferred to the world-renowned Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine which is highly specialised to care for such cases. The staff, who were asked to leave the residential blocks at short notice to accommodate those flying in from China, are being put up in hotels and apartments at NHS England\u2019s expense. Unite is satisfied that this emergency is being dealt with in a professional manner, but we will be monitoring how the situation develops in the coming days as the welfare of NHS staff remains a key concern. These are the first pictures of the chartered passenger jet carrying 83 British nationals repatriated from Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, as it lands at RAF Brize Norton in Charterton, west of London, this afternoon. British nationals who have returned to the UK are to be transported to Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral where accommodation has been arranged to keep them in quarantine for two weeks - the expected incubation period of any potential infection. The military medical personnel who have been aboard the flight for the evacuation will also be placed in quarantine, but at a separate military facility, Sky News reports. After Britons have disembarked, the jet is due to continue on to Spain, where the home countries of European Union citizens will take responsibility for the remaining 27 passengers. Two people in Siberia have tested positive for the new coronavirus, the first confirmed cases of the disease in Russia since the outbreak began in neighbouring China last month, Andrew Roth, the Guardian\u2019s Moscow correspondent reports. Two Chinese citizens who had fallen ill in Russia tested positive for the disease, the deputy prime minister Tatiana Golikova said on Friday. The cases were discovered in opposite ends of Siberia, in the Transbaikal and Tyumen regions. Officials said the two people had been isolated and there was \u201cno chance\u201d of the disease spreading in Russia. Russia announced it would take measures to evacuate its citizens from the Wuhan area of China and also limit flights to the country. Russia on Thursday closed 16 of its land border crossings with China, while allowing the continued transit of freight and mail. On Friday, Russia said that it would begin evacuating 300 of its citizens from Wuhan and 341 from the province of Hubei, the area hardest hit by the outbreak. Russia simultaneously announced the cancellation of most regional flights to and from China, while maintaining several routes operated by Aeroflot and Chinese flights arriving into Moscow. Golikova also said the Russian government would wait until Monday to make a final decision on whether to hold or cancel the Sochi Investment Forum, a business junket usually attended by Vladimir Putin. The plane carrying Britons to the UK from Wuhan in China has landed at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire. Eighty-three British passengers on the delayed Wamos Air Boeing 747 will be taken by coach to an accommodation block at Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral, where they will be quarantined for 14 days, monitored and treated if any symptoms develop. The remaining 27 passengers, all non-UK nationals, will then be flown on to Spain. The new coronavirus has been confirmed in a child in Germany, the southern state of Bavaria said on Friday, bringing the total number of known cases in Germany to six. The new case is a child of an employee at the same firm where four more individuals in the Munich area were infected, the state health ministry said in a statement. All affected people are in stable condition, the ministry said. The Global Times, the English-language mouthpiece of China\u2019s Communist party, has published a propaganda video depicting drones equipped with speakers urging people to wear masks and stay inside. It is not clear the extent to which these drones have actually been rolled out across the country. China has won international plaudits for a huge mobilisation against the virus, writes Emma Graham-Harrison, including the near-impossible feat of building two new hospitals in as many weeks. But \u2026 As information about the early days of the outbreak has slowly filtered out of China, it has become increasingly clear that the same political system that allowed Beijing to order such a dramatic response also initially allowed the virus to fester. Hong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, has resisted pressure to completely shut down the border with mainland China, saying it was not the answer to stem the spread of a virus, AP reports: Medical workers have threatened to strike if the government refuses to do so, and some restaurant owners have also echoed calls to bar all mainland visitors. Lam said the number of mainland arrivals has shrunk since Hong Kong this week suspended ferry and high-speed trains to the mainland, as well as shut six smaller border checkpoints. She urged healthcare workers to reconsider their planned strike, saying the government will provide all necessary resources and give them first priority to the city\u2019s limited supply of protective equipment and masks. Lam said countries shouldn\u2019t adopt a discriminatory approach in handling the new illnesses. Lam said schools would be closed now until 2 March, and civil servants can also choose to work from home for another week. Russia has reported its first two cases of coronavirus. Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister Tatiana Golikova told reporters the infected people were Chinese citizens who had been isolated. Golikova also said all direct flights to China from Russia would be halted from 9pm GMT on Friday, with the exception of national airline Aeroflot. More than 9,800 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed as of Friday evening in Beijing, according to a report by the Associated Press. China: 9,692 cases on the mainland. In addition, Hong Kong has 12 cases and Macau has five. Most of the 213 deaths have been in central Hubei province, where illnesses from the new type of coronavirus were first detected in December. Thailand: 19 Japan: 14 Singapore: 13 Taiwan: 9 Malaysia: 8 Australia: 7 South Korea: 11 France: 6 Vietnam: 5 United States: 6 Germany: 5 Canada: 3 United Arab Emirates: 4 Italy: 2 United Kingdom: 2 India: 1 Philippines: 1 Finland: 1 Nepal: 1 Cambodia: 1 Sri Lanka: 1 India\u2019s first coronavirus patient has been moved to hospital, where her condition is said to be improving, according to a report on the Indian news site NDTV. More than 1,000 people in various parts of Kerala, on the south-west tip of India, are under observation for suspected cases of coronavirus, with 15 in isolation wards in various hospitals, according to the broadcaster. Authorities were attempting to contact all the passengers who travelled on a flight from Kolkata to Cochin on 23 January the infected patient had been on, a day after she travelled from Beijing. Foreign Office sources said they were aware of the frustrations of some Britons in Wuhan, particularly those who had wanted to but proved unable to board a plane, Dan Sabbagh reports. They said the complicated situation on the ground and sometimes difficult working relationship with the Chinese authorities made it hard to communicate effectively with those who were hoping to be evacuated. The number of Britons stranded in the Wuhan region is estimated at about 40. Only 83 of the anticipated 120 were able to board the emergency flight; the rest will be able to fly home on a subsequent plane, although it is not clear when that will leave. Officials said consular staff made considerable efforts to get people on the flight. The chartered plane was delayed on the tarmac for a further three hours to try to get people onboard, but British officials said it had to leave within the overall time slot provided by China. Confusion about whether the Chinese would let families of mixed British and Chinese nationality also complicated the picture, with the UK saying it was only at the last minute that Beijing relented and said Chinese passport holders could fly to the UK with their British family members. Rebecca Ratcliffe, of the Guardian\u2019s global development desk, has written a more in-depth explanation of why the first human transmission of coronavirus in Thailand could be a significant moment in the development of the outbreak. Thailand has recorded its first case of human to human transmission of coronavirus, after a taxi driver was infected by a passenger, heightening concern over the virus\u2019s potential to spread in what is the worst-hit country outside China, she reports. The taxi driver is among five new patients confirmed on Friday, bringing to 19 the total number of cases in Thailand. Thailand is among the most popular holiday destinations for Chinese people celebrating lunar new year, and officials have warned an outbreak in the country\u2019s tourism hotspots is possible. More than 25,000 people arrived in the country from Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak, and other affected Chinese cities, between 3-27 January, according to Reuters. Most of the Chinese visitors are believed to have returned home, though on Friday afternoon China\u2019s foreign ministry said it would send charter flights to Thailand and Malaysia to bring home residents of virus-affected regions who may have been left stranded after the sweeping travel restrictions were introduced across China last week. Thai officials have recently stepped up measures at airports and other tourist areas, following criticism that the government had failed to act quickly to stop the virus, and that tourism profits were being prioritised over public health. Screening for people working in the tourism industry, as well as all passengers travelling from China, has been introduced. In Bangkok\u2019s public transport system, and some of its big shopping malls, hand sanitiser is being handed out for free. On Tuesday, the Thai public health minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, told Sky News he expects the number of infections to rise, warning: \u201cWe are not able to stop the spread.\u201d Sarah Boseley, the Guardian\u2019s health editor, has written a full report on the two confirmed coronavirus cases detected overnight here in the UK. As airlines begin suspending their flights in and out of China as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, foreign nationals in the country are becoming increasingly anxious about whether they will be able to leave if they decide they want to. Reuters has compiled a list of airlines\u2019 responses to the crisis, which readers planning to travel to or from China might find useful.

Israel\u2019s health ministry said it would not allow flights from China to land at its airports. ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES: The African carrier on 30 January denied reports it had suspended all flights to China. The airline\u2019s statement contradicted its passenger call centre, which told Reuters earlier in the day that flights to China had been suspended. FINNAIR: Finland\u2019s Finnair said on 28 January it would suspend its flights to Nanjing and Beijing until the end of March after China suspended international group travel from the country. Finnair will suspend its three weekly flights between Helsinki and Beijing Daxing between 5 February and 29 March and its two weekly flights between Helsinki and Nanjing between 8 February and 29 March.

The cancellations will reduce the carrier\u2019s daily departures for mainland China and Hong Kong to four daily from 12. United had previously suspended 24 US flights to Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai between 1 February and 8 February because of a significant drop in demand. UNITED PARCEL SERVICE: UPS has cancelled 22 China flights, as a result of the Wuhan quarantines and normal manufacturing closures due to the lunar new year holiday, the UPS chief executive, David Abney, said on 30 January. He did not specify how many flight cancellations were due to the virus. VIRGIN ATLANTIC: Virgin Atlantic said on 30 January it would suspend its daily operations to Shanghai for two weeks from 2 February. It cited declining demand for flights and the safety of its customers and staff. A jump in infections in two Chinese cities flanking Wuhan, the centre of a rapidly spreading virus epidemic, is fuelling fears that new hot spots are emerging in a province where strict transport curbs have already brought most activity to a halt, Reuters reports. China\u2019s central province of Hubei has been the site of almost 60% of infections, as well as more than 95% of deaths. But the province\u2019s two cities of Huanggang and Xiaogan, with combined populations of more than 12 million, have racked up more than 11% of global infections and deaths. \u201cMedical supplies are in very short supply,\u201d the provincial governor, Wang Xiaodong, said. \u201cNot only are there shortages in Wuhan and surrounding cities, but they are generally severely deficient in other parts of the province.\u201d Conditions in Huanggang, which had reported 573 infections and 12 deaths, are particularly severe, he warned in remarks on Wednesday, urging every effort to keep the city from becoming a second Wuhan. Huanggang had insufficient screening procedures for suspected cases, slow testing processes and lack of testing personnel, inspectors from China\u2019s central government has found. By Wednesday, its tally of suspected cases exceeded 1,000. The Guardian\u2019s political correspondent Kate Proctor is tweeting more information about the two UK coronavirus patients announced this morning, gleaned from a Department for Health and Social Care briefing. PA Media has more details on the two UK\u2019s first two coronavirus patients. Two members of the same family have tested positive for coronavirus in England, the agency reports, adding that sources said they were being treated at a hospital in Newcastle. On Wednesday night, an apartment-hotel in Yorkshire was put on lockdown when a man, understood to be a Chinese national, was taken to hospital after falling ill. The man, who was a guest at the Staycity Hotel in the centre of York, was taken by medics to hospital, together with family members. Here are some more photos that have been passed to Michael Standaert, who is reporting from China on the coronavirus outbreak for the Guardian, showing nurses having to make their own surgical masks from spare cloth because of a lack of supplies. Those who have been following the story will know that only masks above a certain grade \u2013 the so-called N95 masks \u2013 are able to filter the particles that can lead to infection with coronavirus. Thailand has had its first case of human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus inside the country, Reuters reports. The first patient to contract the virus inside Thailand is a Thai taxi driver, said Tanarak Pipat, the deputy director general of the department of disease Control. \u201c(He) \u2026 does not have the record of traveling to China, and it is likely that he was infected (by) a sick traveller from China,\u201d Tanarak said. Authorities have conducted virus scans on 13 people, including three family members, with whom the taxi driver came into contact. They said initially none of them had tested positive. \u201cThe overall risk of infection in Thailand is still low, but people should take precautions to protect themselves,\u201d Tanarak said. The taxi driver is one of five new coronavirus cases confirmed in Thailand on Friday. Seven of the 19 cases have recovered and gone home while 12 are still being treated at hospitals. All but two of the cases are Chinese tourists visiting the country, the health authority said. Scientists have been giving their reactions to the first diagnoses of coronavirus in the UK. The general consensus appears to be that it is not a surprise and was only a matter of time until we saw the first cases appear on our shores. Prof Paul Hunter, Professor in Medicine, University of East Anglia, said: The report of the first two cases diagnosed positive for 2019-nCoV in the UK is not surprising and was almost inevitable. The chief medical officer\u2019s statement gives no information on where these two members of the same family acquired their infection. The two cases are members of the same family but no information has been released about whether both cases will have been infected simultaneously or whether one would have passed the infection to the other. The NHS is well able to nurse people with this novel coronavirus as it has successfully and safely managed a number of cases of both Sars and Mers in the past. With the information available it is not possible to judge what risk if any there may be of spread within the community. Prof John Edmunds, from the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said: This event, whilst unwelcome, is not surprising. However, the UK authorities have been preparing for this for some time, and it seems as if appropriate measures are being taken to limit onward spread. Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health, University of Southampton, said: The UK cases are unsurprising to see. Given the spread to other European and North American countries, it was really only a matter of time until the UK ended up with confirmed cases. Hopefully, as seen elsewhere, the case numbers will be very limited. The key concern will be if there is significant human to human transmission. A German military aircraft will shortly be departing for Wuhan to repatriate more than 100 German nationals. Announcing the plan on Friday, the foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said that none of the German evacuees are infected with the coronavirus or suspected of having contracted it. Maas said the plane would arrive in Germany on Saturday and the evacuees would be kept in quarantine for two weeks. This is where approximately 300 Indian students arriving back in their home country from Wuhan will be kept for the next couple of weeks. Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent, has some details on the international passengers on the British repatriation flight that took off from China this morning. The Spanish government said a flight carrying 19 Spanish citizens had left China in the early hours of Friday morning and was due to land outside London at 1.30pm local time. Spanish citizens will then be flown to Torrej\u00f3n military airport near Madrid. The plane is carrying 120 passengers, of whom 19 are Spanish, one is a Polish citizen resident in Spain, and one is a Chinese citizen married to a Spaniard. Two Danish couples and a Norwegian citizen will also be on the plane from the UK to Madrid. Also onboard are 83 British citizens. The Department of Health has declined to say where in England the patients were from but it is understood they are not in the Wirral area, where a special facility has been set up to quarantine Britons evacuated from Wuhan, in China. Here\u2019s more from Chris Whitty, emphasising that the NHS is well-prepared for a positive test: We can confirm that two patients in England, who are members of the same family, have tested positive for coronavirus. The patients are receiving specialist NHS care, and we are using tried and tested infection control procedures to prevent further spread of the virus. The NHS is extremely well-prepared and used to managing infections and we are already working rapidly to identify any contacts the patients had, to prevent further spread. We have been preparing for UK cases of novel coronavirus and we have robust infection control measures in place to respond immediately. We are continuing to work closely with the World Health Organization and the international community as the outbreak in China develops to ensure we are ready for all eventualities. Two patients in England, who are members of the same family, have tested positive for coronavirus, the chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, said. Bangladesh is preparing a flight to repatriate more than 340 Bangladeshi citizens in Wuhan, the New Age reports. According to the paper, a wide-body aircraft is to leave Dhaka for Wuhan on Friday evening, after Chinese authorities allotted it a slot to operate a special flight for Bangladeshis stuck in the locked-down city. Zahid Maleque, the health minister, said on Thursday Bangladesh was \u201cfully prepared\u201d to tackle coronavirus, that all passengers arriving in the country from China were being screened, and that so far none had been detected with coronavirus. An isolation unit has been prepared at Kurmitola General hospital, Maleque said. These pictures from one of the hospitals in Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, show medical workers resorting to wearing the plastic covers originally used to pack medical supplies because of a shortage of protective gear. They have been provided to the Guardian by a doctor working at Wuhan union hospital. The publication of the images come amid a row over emergency medical supplies not getting to the correct places. Michael Standaert, who is reporting for the Guardian from China, earlier reported how the Red Cross Society of Hubei has come under fire from Chinese netizens who say the charity is sending high-quality medical grade N95 filtration masks to hospitals that are not at the centre of the outbreak nor fever clinics in the greatest need of masks. The Red Cross subsequently released a statement saying their announcement was mislabelled and it should have said they were KN95 masks, not N95 masks, which is why those other hospitals got them and not the frontline treatment hospitals. But a chief executive of a company that makes high-quality face masks in China cast doubt on the claim. \u201cTo me that sounds like quite the excuse,\u201d he said. \u201cN95 and KN95 uses exactly the same standards. N95 is the CDC NIOSH standard, that\u2019s the US standard. The Chinese standard \u2013 the guobiao standard \u2013 is called the KN95. In Europe, it is FFP2, it is 94% [filtration] but it is the same standard. All of those standards require the masks to be able to filter out a rate of 95% of particles at peak breath rate.\u201d Students at Melbourne\u2019s Monash university have been told to stay away from campus until mid-March, in an effort by its administrators avoid the spread of coronavirus among its student community. The 83,000 students who study across Monash\u2019s six campuses had been expecting to return from their summer holidays on 2 March, but the beginning of term has been pushed back to 9 March, with the first week taught online via livestreamed lectures. Campus will not be opened for lectures and seminars until 16 March. In an email sent to students, seen by Australian newspaper The Age, the deputy vice-chancellor, Prof Susan Elliott, said: The novel coronavirus has created an unprecedented situation where some of our community of students and staff will not make it back in time from affected areas or isolation in time for the commencement of semester one, 2020. We have made these decisions to ensure the entire Monash student and staff body is able to begin the semester together with the highest regard for community wellbeing. A doctor has become the sixth patient diagnosed with coronavirus in France, the country\u2019s health chief J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon announced on Thursday night. The patient confined himself after first developing symptoms, and is currently in hospital in Paris, where is condition is said to be not a cause for concern, Le Parisien reports. The French health directorate says it is the first reported case of contamination on French soil. This is Damien Gayle taking over the live blog from London now, where it is morning. As usual, please send me any coronavirus-related information, tips, questions or stories that you think we should be covering and I\u2019ll do my best to get them in. You can reach me via email at damien.gayle@theguardian.com or via my Twitter profile, @damiengayle. The death toll stands at 213 inside China and confirmed infections are at nearly 9,100. Global infections are up to 130. The US has upgraded its travel advice to \u201cdo not travel\u201d to China. A flight carrying 83 Britons and 27 foreign nationals is on its way home from Wuhan, due to arrive in the UK at around 1pm local time. The World Health Organization has declared the virus outbreak a global emergency. South Korea evacuated more than 350 of its citizens from Wuhan on an plane and may schedule up to three more flights. It confirmed its seventh case of coronavirus on Friday. Italy confirms its first two cases of the virus. Japan has changed it\u2019s travel advice to China, urging citizens to avoid non-urgent trips. More international airlines have curtailed flights to China, including Virgin Atlantic and Kenya Airways. Here\u2019s more information on New Zealand\u2019s planned evacuation of its citizens from Wuhan. The NZ foreign affairs ministry says \u201cit may not be possible for New Zealand permanent residents, who are Chinese citizens, to be on the flight. It should be noted that some permanent residents from other countries on other assisted departure flights have been unable to board.\u201d There is no departure date set for the flight. New Zealand has offered to take Australians and Pacific Islands citizens on the flight, along with New Zealand citizens. \u201cAustralians aboard the plane would be picked up by their own government at the point of arrival in New Zealand,\u201d the ministry says. \u201cAny other nationalities aboard the plane would be placed in isolation in New Zealand before travel arrangements to return to their home country are made.\u201d New Zealand is yet to announce where the passengers will be held in isolation. A suspected case of coronavirus has been detected in New Zealand, the ministry of health said. A test had been ordered but the results would not be available until Saturday local time, said Dr Ashley Bloomfield, New Zealand\u2019s most senior medical officer. The patient is being held at Auckland hospital. So far no confirmed cases of the virus have been discovered in New Zealand, though authorities have repeatedly said it is only a matter of time. \u201cThe normal management of someone who is a suspected case of an infectious disease like this is that they have a special isolation room in the hospital\u201d Dr Bloomfield said. Planning is under way to get about 150 New Zealanders out of Wuhan, with the flight likely to happen over the weekend local time. They will be charged $500 for a seat on the flight. It was not yet known where the arrivals from Wuhan would be held, though it was likely somewhere in Auckland. \u201cWhat we\u2019re really interested in doing is identifying any suspected cases, confirming whether or not they are cases and then stopping any other transmission\u201d Bloomfield said. Two cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in Italy. The prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, said late on Thursday that two Chinese tourists were being treated at Rome\u2019s Lazzari Spallanzani national institute for infectious diseases. \u201cThe Spallanzani is the bible in this sector, there is no reason for panic or alarm,\u201d Conte said. He added that close checks were being carried out to trace the tourists\u2019 movements in Italy in order \u201cto absolutely avoid any additional risk\u201d. Flights between China and Italy have been stopped, Conte said. The couple are reported to be from Wuhan and arrived in Milan on 23 January. Meanwhile, tests carried out on two Chinese tourists onboard a cruise ship in the port city of Civitavecchia were negative, the cruise company, Costa Crociere, said in a statement on Thursday night. China\u2019s banks have put into place some emergency measures learned from the 2003 Sars outbreak ahead of when they reopen for business after the extended new year and virus-induced break on Monday, Reuters are reporting. While many workers are being told to stay at home and businesses are remaning closed for another week to contain the contagion, banks are deemed too important to remain closed so will trade again on Monday in the financial hub of Shanghai. Some staff will be allowed to work from home to minimise contact, Reuters says, but traders will have to go into their offices. A system of shifts deployed during the Sars epidemic will be used to provide enough cover. China Construction Bank (CCB), the country\u2019s second largest lender, and Hang Seng Bank are among those planning to split their trading teams and alternate their working days, according to three sources. HSBC is also considering a shift system for trading teams that have to be in the office, according to one source. CCB and HSBC did not respond to requests for comment specifically on their trading plans. Hang Seng bank confirmed it would arrange trading shifts and would tell other staff where possible to work from home. South Korea\u2019s health ministry said on Friday that the Korean staple dish of kimchi, made from fermented cabbage, chilli peppers and garlic, would provide no protection against the new type of coronavirus originating from China. The Associated Press reports that ministry\u2019s statement sought to correct misunderstandings about the illness and calm public fears. The ministry also said eating kimchi imported from China wouldn\u2019t necessarily put a person at greater risk of infection. The ministry says the best protection against the virus, which is spread through close personal contact and droplet infection, is to wash hands frequently. During the SARS epidemic of 2003, some South Korean researchers claimed that kimchi possibly explained the country\u2019s relatively low number of cases, saying that a type of bacteria created during the fermentation process would have been helpful in fighting off infections. While such claims reportedly led to a boost in kimchi sales across Asia, most experts saw the argument as dubious. Kenya Airways has suspended all flights to and from China until further notice. \u201cWe have temporarily suspended all flights to and from Guangzhou starting Friday until further notice,\u201d the airline said in a statement on its Twitter account. We\u2019ve reported over the past few days about the effort to build two brand new hospitals in Wuhan to accomodate coronavirus patients. The time-lapse footage below shows the monumental scale of the build. The Red Cross Society of Hubei has come under fire from Chinese netizens who say the charity is sending high quality medical grade N95 filtration masks to hospitals that are not at the epicentre of the outbreak nor fever clinics in the greatest need of masks, writes Michael Standaert. According to the first statistics released by the Hubei Red Cross on Thursday, the group released only 3,000 of the N95 masks to Wuhan Union Hospital, one of the hospitals most impacted by the outbreak and surge of patients. Those stats showed out of 36,000 of the medical-grade masks, 16,000 went to Wuhan Ren\u2019ai Hospital and 16,000 to Wuhan Tianyou Hospital, both private hospitals, with the rest to the other that people are saying is in the most need. Cover News has now reported that the Hubei Red Cross is investigating why the masks were distributed to those two hospitals. \u201cThats very funny because [everyone in Wuhan] knows it and they need to look into it?\u201d Jing Xian [nickname], a man from Wuhan currently stuck in the city during the lockdown, but who normally resides in Shenzhen. \u201cI\u2019m angry, it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d \u201cWhen I was a kid, we all know Ren\u2019ai is a hospital for women and it is a private hospital with a bad reputation,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many people are so helpless and hopeless.\u201d Posts from people expressing anger about the distribution of the masks to the two hospitals that appeared in the morning are now being censored with a message saying: The content is suspected of violating relevant rules State TV in China reported yesterday that the country\u2019s aviation authority had approved chartered flights to bring Wuhan residents home. Today the foreign ministry confirmed that saying, charter planes would be sent to bring citizens from virus-hit Hubei province who are overseas back \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. This is in view of \u201cpractical difficulties that Hubei citizens, especially those from Wuhan, have faced overseas\u201d, said ministry of foreign affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying. The ministry\u2019s comments come as a number of airlines announced they were halting or reducing flights to China as the country struggles to contain the spread of a deadly new virus. China has advised its citizens to postpone trips abroad and cancelled overseas group tours, while several countries including Germany, Britain and Canada have urged their citizens to avoid travel to China. The US upgraded its travel warning today to say \u201cdo not travel\u201d to China. Earlier I reported on a picture published of a man lying dead in the street in Wuhan. You can read our full story on the link below. On South Korea\u2019s evacuation of its citizens, 368 people were on the plane that arrived back at Gimpo airport near Seoul on Friday morning. It is planning up to three more flights. Reuters reports that the government says none of the evacuees had any symptoms before departure, but one person could not board the plane due to fever after a final check at Wuhan airport, while 18 were sent to hospitals immediately upon arrival. \u201cThere were different screening standards between China and us, and we conducted another check aboard the plane and put those who were showing symptoms in separate space on the second floor of the plane,\u201d vice health minister Kim Gang-lip said. The Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, told parliament on Friday the government has decided to raise its infectious disease advisory level for China, excluding Hubei province, to 2, urging citizens to avoid non-urgent trips to the country. The government is already telling its citizens not to take any trips to China\u2019s central province of Hubei. Wuhan, the epicentre of the newly-identified coronavirus outbreak, is located in Hubei. Fake news and conspiracy theories about the origin of the coronavirus have swiftly followed the outbreak around the world. From fake alerts over no-go suburbs to pro-Trump conspiracy theories, crackpot stories and dangerous advice have gone viral, reports the Guardian\u2019s Josh Taylor. Flight Radar shows the flight carrying the British evacuees from Wuhan are currently just over Ulaanbatar, the capital of Mongolia. Still a long way to go - about 8 hours until touchdown in Brize Norton, north-west of London. Trinidad has imposed a 14-day restrictions on travellers from China because of the coronavirus, according to the country\u2019s health minister. Tonga\u2019s prime minister has asked for assistance from Australia and New Zealand in evacuating and quarantining Tongan citizens from China. More than 50 Tongans, many of whom are teenagers, became trapped in China while travelling to the country as part of a China Aid sports program, reported Matangi Tonga. The members and officials of four Tongan sports teams \u2013 swimming, table tennis, weightlifting and boxing \u2013 were due to return to Tonga this week or next, but had flights cancelled. There are also Tongan students studying at universities in Wuhan. Matangi Tonga reports that Prime Minister Pohiva Tu\u2019i\u2019onetoa asked that the citizens be temporarily quarantined in Australia or New Zealand and that if they are found to have the virus, kept in Australia or New Zealand until they are well. New Zealand has said it will launch an independent rescue mission to evacuate its citizens from Wuhan, chartering an Air New Zealand plane. The foreign minister, Winston Peters, said the plane would carry 300 people to New Zealand and that any additional seats on the Air New Zealand flight would be allocated to Pacific Islanders and Australians \u201cas a matter of priority\u201d. There are currently 82 New Zealanders registered on Safetravel as being in Wuhan, and 57 of those have sought consular assistance. \u201cThe Government of Tonga are making all efforts to protect Tonga and its people from the virus, which has not been confirmed in Tonga.\u201d Here\u2019s some more on those Pakistani students stranded in Hubei from the Guardian\u2019s Ben Doherty. The BBC\u2019s China correspondent, Stephen McDonell has a good point re the figures being quoted for people who have recovered from the virus. At the moment the figure is 171, from more than 9,700 confirmed infections. He suggests maybe Chinese authorities are keeping people in hospital for longer or they are not monitoring recoveries very closely. There\u2019s certainly some anger on Twitter about Qantas continuing to fly to and from China. What\u2019s interesting is the degree to which countries\u2019 advice is varying on this coronavirus epidemic. In the past few hours, the US upgraded its travel advice to its highest level, Level 4 ... which says \u201cdo not travel\u201d to China. Earlier today Virgin Atlantic suspended its flights between Britain and China and Air Canada has suspended flights to China until 29 February. But Qantas will continue to fly to and from Australia, as will China Eastern, China Southern and Air China. In Australia this morning there was quite an animated press conference by the premier of Queensland, Annastacia Palaszczuk, who demanded more national co-ordination of the crisis: \u201cWe would have had a number of planes that have come in from mainland China over the last 10 days. Where are all those people?,\u201d she asked. You can read the full story here. Qantas has confirmed it will not be stopping direct flights between China and Australia. The Australian carrier, along with China Eastern, China Southern and Air China are still operating direct flights from a range of Chinese cities. On Friday, Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said it was not a recommendation to stop direct flights \u2013 as most passengers can still enter Australia via other airports. Qantas is also still standing by to provide the evacuation flight for Australians stranded in Wuhan and Hubei province \u2013 but it can\u2019t take passengers direct to Christmas Island. A spokesman told Guardian Australia the prospective plane \u2013 a Boeing 747 \u2013 can\u2019t land on the Christmas Island runway. This means Qantas will bring people to the Australian mainland first, and then the government will bear the responsibility of shuttling them to quarantine on Christmas Island. The federal government announced the move on Wednesday, but is still waiting for permission to conduct the airlift, and the logistics have not been sorted. The capacity of the evacuation plane is 371. On Wednesday, foreign minister, Marise Payne said there were an estimated 600 Australians in Wuhan and Hubei who want assistance, and priority would be given to the young, elderly and most vulnerable. Just while I\u2019m checking in on the Global Times, it is also reporting that the number of travellers returning to Beijing increased at Beijing West Railway Station, from about 100,000 on Wednesday January 29 to 119,000 on Thursday. According to the China State Railway, the country\u2019s rail sector will strengthen prevention and control measures to help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, it says. Interesting charts from the state-run tabloid the Global Times on the increase in coronavirus cases. This post doesn\u2019t need much explanation. In the US, the director of Human Rights Watch, Kenneth Roth, is questioning if Americans are safe from coronavirus, given the cuts to various government agencies by the Trump administration. International students trapped in Hubei province \u2013 from countries not evacuating their citizens \u2013 say they feel abandoned at the epicentre of the global coronavirus outbreak. As the US, Japan, South Korea and UK have flown citizens out of Hubei, followed by commitments from Australia, NZ, France, Indonesia, India and Afghanistan to also repatriate their citizens, students from countries such as Pakistan \u2013 which is not repatriating its citizens \u2013 have begged for government intervention. Husnain Chisti, a Pakistani student at the Hubei University of Science and Technology, said the university gates were locked and students were stranded on campus. \u201cThe coronavirus is spreading rapidly\u2026 our city is totally locked down, all public transport, markets, the railway stations, in fact our university gates are locked. We can\u2019t go outside.\u201d In a plea posted online, he said there were about 40 Pakistani students at his university, who were essentially confined to their rooms. \u201cOur classmates from Indonesia and India are getting evacuated from this city. The US and Japan have already evacuated their citizens, so I appeal to Pakistan government to please take\u2026 action and evacuate us from here by any means, because this virus is deadly and it is spreading day by day even [in a] city that is under lockdown. \u201cIt is my humble request to Pakistan government to evacuate us by any means, thank you.\u201d Another Pakistani national, who did not give her name, is a third year medical student at Hubei Polytechnic University near Wuhan in Hubei. She said students at the university were on lockdown and confined to the campus. They were sharing food and unsure for how long they would be locked down. \u201cWe are suffering \u2026 we depend on each other for meals \u2026 when we need food, we ask our friends or colleagues who have enough to share with us.\u201d Global infections of the coronavirus now stand at 129, across 22 countries, Reuters news agency is reporting. This is obviously a fairly difficult figure to keep track of as the numbers are constantly moving. There have been no deaths outside of China. South Korea has reported reported its seventh confirmed case of coronavirus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan. On Friday a Korean Air flight carrying more than 350 Koreans arrived from Wuhan. With the multiple reports of evacuations and infections of the coronavirus, it\u2019s worth remembering the very human cost of this outbreak. This picture below is from Wuhan on Thursday. It shows shows officials in protective suits checking on an elderly man wearing a face mask who collapsed and died on a street near a hospital in Wuhan. Journalists from Agence France-Presse saw the body on 30 January, not long before an emergency vehicle arrived carrying police and medical staff in full-body protective suits. We reported earlier that China\u2019s Shandong province has asked companies not to resume working before 10 February to help prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. Guangdong province has also done this, saying that most businesses should plan on starting up after 9 February. It is not clear how many British citizens remain in Wuhan after the departure of the evacuation flight. Just hours before the plane departed, there was a lack of clarity over who would be allowed to board, and how people would reach the airport given the ban on public transport and most private cars. Nick, who has dual British and US citizenship, and who has a wife and two children in Wuhan, is among those who did not board the plane. He was initially told there was no guarantee that his wife, who is Indonesian, would be able to fly. \u201cWe thought long and hard and decided to give up our seats and ensure that the plane left full,\u201d he said, adding that he believed it was safer to stay at home than to travel to the airport late at night, with no guarantee they would be able to board, when the city is under lockdown. Later, the family was called and told that the Chinese government had given verbal assurances that his wife would be able to leave. But by that point, the flight was just hours away and he had already given up his seat. \u201cA couple hours later they called again and asked if we were still planning on trying to get to the plane and offered help with transportation. When I told him how far we were from the airport [the man] said there was no chance of getting there in time. I again told him we had given up our seats to ensure the plane left full.\u201d The topsy-turvy reaction of the markets continues today with indices going up across Asia Pacific after a late rally on Wall Street on Thursday night. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan has edged up 0.4%, but was still down 3.8% on the week so far. Its 2.3% dive on Thursday had been the sharpest one-day loss in six months. Japan\u2019s Nikkei bounced 1.8%, recouping half of its weekly loss. In Sydney the ASX200 was up 0.3%. Things were also calmer in Taiwan, where the finance ministry had been mulling a market intervention from the national stabilisation fund after a 6% plunge in the TWSE index on Thursday. Finance minister Su Jain-rong said now is \u201cnot the time\u201d for government action but added: \u201cIf there are large outflow from foreign investors which cause disorder in the financial markets then the national stabilisation fund will hold an ad hoc meeting. It\u2019s on stand-by for any time.\u201d We are getting some more information on the Uk evacuations of its citizens from Wuhan. The Foreign Office (FCO) says the flight took off at 09.45 local time with 83 British and 27 foreign nationals. The charter flight is estimated to land at RAF Brize Norton at 13.00 (UK time). The airport is around 115km (70miles) north west of London. The FCO says a small number of medics were on the aircraft to provide support to passengers. The flight will continue on to Spain following the stopover in the UK, at which point EU nationals\u2019 home countries will take responsibility for them. The British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said: \u201cWe know how distressing the situation has been for those waiting to leave. We have been working round the clock to clear the way for a safe departure. The welfare of those trapped and public safety have been our overriding priorities.\u201d The US advice takes their travel warning to Level 4, its highest level. Do not travel to China due to novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China. On January 30, the World Health Organization has determined the rapidly spreading outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice. Commercial carriers have reduced or suspended routes to and from China. The advice also says those currently in China should consider departing using commercial means. The Department of State has also requested that all non-essential US government personnel defer travel to China in light of the novel coronavirus. The US State Department has increased its travel advisory for China. In a notice posted on its website, the State Department said: \u201cDo not travel to China due to novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China.\u201d We understand the British citizens being evacuated are on a Wamos Air 747 aircraft. According to Flightradar24, a Wamos Air 747 flew from Hanoi to Wuhan on 31 January, landing in Wuhan at 04.45 local time. We assume it\u2019s the same plane that are taking the British nationals out. I\u2019ll bring you more on that shortly. We have been closely following the departure of British citizens being evacuated from Wuhan. We are hearing from the Foreign Office in London that the flight carrying 110 passengers, including 83 Britons, has left Wuhan for the UK. For those of you joining the coronavirus blog for the first time, let\u2019s start by looking a look at the latest figures for deaths and infections. Each morning in China the National Health Commission provides updates. The total death toll in China now stands at 213. That\u2019s up from 170 announced at this time yesterday. That\u2019s an increase of 25%, which is slightly down on yesterday\u2019s increase (29%). Confirmed cases inside China are 9,096. That\u2019s up from the figure quoted at around this time yesterday of 7,711. It makes it an 18% rise in confirmed infections over the 24-hour period. Between Wednesday and Thursday the rise in confirmed cases was 29% by my calculations. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak, with me, Alison Rourke. Here\u2019s a short summary of what we know so far: The death toll stands at 213 inside China and confirmed infections are 9,096 Possible infections are at 12,167 inside China with recoveries listed as 163 The World Health organisation has declared a global public health emergency because of the spread of the virus outside China, describing it as an \u201cunprecedented outbreak\u201d. Cases outside China of the virus are increasing and is estimated to be over 100. Recent global updates include Italy (2), France (6), Germany (5), Australia (9). I will bring you a full country-by-country list shortly The US has confirmed its first person-to-person transmission Evacuations of foreign nationals are continuing, with 150 Britons expected to be flown out of Wuhan on Friday local time. You can read our guide to how you can help protect yourself and stop the spread of the virus here. As always, you can reach me at alison.rourke@theguardian.com or on Twitter at @alisonrourke",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Wamos Air Boeing 747 plane carrying the Britons to the UK from Wuhan landed at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire on Friday lunchtime.</p> \n<p>The evacuees then boarded coaches and were taken up to Wirral. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long it took but it felt like forever,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that point, we had been travelling for a day.

DoJ lawyer James Burnham told a DC federal judge that while it was the president\u2019s right to ignore the subpoenas, Congress had other powers, including impeachment, to hold the executive to account. </p> \n  <p>The news travelled to an outraged Adam Schiff, one of the House impeachment managers, on Thursday evening and drew derision and laughter from senators on the jury. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIn the category of you can\u2019t make this stuff up,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThe judge says if the Congress can\u2019t enforce its subpoenas in court, then what remedy is there? And the justice department lawyer\u2019s response is impeachment.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The justice department later issued a statement, attempting to clarify Burnham\u2019s remarks: \u201cThe point we made in court is simply that Congress has numerous political tools it can use in battles with the executive branch \u2013 appropriations, legislation, nominations and potentially in some circumstances even impeachment.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-01-31T15:52:58.833Z\">at 3.52pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e342c038f0811db2faeed52\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-01-31T13:31:47.894Z\">1.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Wall trouble</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b28ce42f0991327cdac4e31fe75649c526fdf34\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b28ce42f0991327cdac4e31fe75649c526fdf34/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A construction crew works on a fallen section of the US-Mexico border wall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A construction crew works on a fallen section of the US-Mexico border wall.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STR/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Yesterday we reported that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/30/trump-border-wall-between-us-and-mexico-blows-over-in-high-winds\">stretch of Trump\u2019s border wall</a> between the Californian town of Calexico and Mexicali in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/mexico\">Mexico</a> had blown over on the Mexican side during high winds. </p> \n  <p>Today things get worse for the wall, one of the president\u2019s landmark pledges in the 2016 election.

A former lawyer, he ran in the Republican presidential primaries in 1996 and 2000, with little success.</p> \n  <p>As a senator he has worked in a bipartisan fashion, notably on education reforms and on trying to find a compromise to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/7/17090800/trump-obamacare-fix-bill-congress\">shore up</a> Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare changes, under threat from Trump and other Republicans.

That is why the constitution requires a 2/3 vote of the Senate for conviction. Yet not one House Republican voted for these articles,\u201d he said.

Today Donald Trump could become the third US president to be acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial.</p> \n  <p>Senators will reconvene at around 1pm ET (6pm UK) for two more hours of debate on each side. </p> \n  <p>They will then vote on whether or not to call witnesses. A vote for witnesses would extend the impeachment trial and would probably lead to John Bolton being called. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser claims in his forthcoming book that the president directly linked a delay in military aid to Ukraine to a condition that the Ukrainian government investigate one of his Democratic rivals, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> \u2013 the issue at the heart of the impeachment proceedings. </p> \n  <p>Democrats need four Republicans to vote with them to call witnesses, and seem to have got the support of Mitt Romney and Susan Collins.

I believe that the constitution provides that the people should make that decision in the presidential election that begins in Iowa on Monday.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>That would leave the vote at a 50-50 tie. Chief Justice John Roberts could break the tie - but he may just allow the motion to fall, meaning no witnesses.</p> \n  <p>If that vote fails, Republicans will push for a swift vote on whether to convict Trump. Since 20 GOP senators would need to switch sides to do that, the president is almost certain to be acquitted. </p> \n  <p>Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, gave a hint last night that he hadn\u2019t quite given up hope, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/trump-impeachment-trial-01-30#schumer-hints-at-a-tactic-to-delay-votes-to-acquit-trump\">hinting</a> that his party could use some sort of delaying tactics to thwart Republicans\u2019 plans for a quick decision.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe minority has rights, and we will exercise those rights,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues in Monday\u2019s blog: Senators defeated a proposal to hear witnesses in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump. Only two Republicans \u2014 Mitt Romney and Susan Collins \u2014 voted with Democrats to consider additional evidence. Senate leaders negotiated a deal to hear closing arguments on Monday and take a final vote on acquittal on Wednesday. Senate Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly called the president before finalizing the plan. House Leader Nancy Pelosi said Republicans who voted against hearing testimony are \u201caccomplices to the president\u2019s cover-up\u201d. The Trump administration announced plans to expand its controversial travel ban to six additional countries. The administration declared a public health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak and announced it will temporarily bar people traveling from China to the US, unless they are American or immediately related to US citizens. As they headed out for the weekend, Democratic senators representing swing states indicated they\u2019re still weighing whether or not to acquit Donald Trump on Wednesday. \u201cI swear to God I won\u2019t know until I walk in,\u201d said Joe Manchin, a Democratic senator of West Virginia. He\u2019s \u201cback and forth\u201d, he said. Senator Doug Jones, a Democrat of Alabama is also mulling. \u201cI\u2019m still working on all of that,\u201d he said. What\u2019s next? Monday The Senate convenes at 11am with the chief justice, John Roberts, presiding. The prosecutors in the case, known as House managers, will make closing arguments, to be followed by Trump\u2019s defense, with two hours allotted to each side. The Senate would adjourn as a court of impeachment until Wednesday. Tuesday Speeches by the senators. For the first time in two weeks, Roberts will not be on hand. The president will deliver his State of the Union address on Tuesday night without the trial having concluded, a scenario he had hoped to avoid. But Trump\u2019s acquittal does not seem in doubt. Wednesday The Senate holds two afternoon votes, at 4pm, one on each article of impeachment. If a majority of senators votes to acquit Trump in each case \u2013 and any other result would be shocking \u2013 Trump is acquitted and he remains in office. With that, the impeachment process would be concluded. Trump would become the third president in US history to be impeached and then to escape removal at trial. Senator Lisa Murkowski told reporters she\u2019s \u201cjust gonna chill\u201d after a dramatic day at the Capitol. Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska who was initially undecided on the question of witnesses, announced this morning that she\u2019d be voting against considering new testimony and dashed any hopes that Democrats could secure the votes needed to subpoena John Bolton and other officials who might deliver damning new evidence in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump. Asked by reporters whether she\u2019ll vote to remove Trump from office, Murkowski responded: \u201cI\u2019ve had so much drama today, I\u2019m just gonna chill.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m at that point where I\u2019m frustrated and disappointed and angry at all sides,\u201d she added. Having breezed through the Democrats\u2019 amendments, the Senators are clearing out and Republicans have claimed victory. Senate leader Mitch McConnell reportedly ran his plan for the final days of the impeachment trial by the president, according to multiple reports. Both CNN and the New York Times are reporting that McConnell called Donald Trump and got the president\u2019s approval before presenting it to Senators for a vote. The Guardian has not independently confirmed these reports. The rules were approved, 53-47 along party lines, as proposed by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The trial is adjourned until 11am ET, on Monday February 3. Senators have voted to kill two more amendments proposed by the Democrats. The third amendment to subpoena John Bolton, spend one day on his deposition and one day on live testimony \u2014 both of which must occur within five days \u2014 was defeated 51-49, with Republicans Romney and Collins voting with the Democrats. And the fourth amendment, from Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, to require the Chief Justice to rule on motions to subpoena witnesses and documents was also voted down, 53-47 along party lines. The Senate is now voting on the rules for deliberating and voting on the articles of impeachments. The House leader, who opened and oversaw the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump, has delivered a harsh rebuke to the Senators who voted against hearing witnesses and considering new evidence. \u201cThe Senate Republicans\u2019 vote against calling witnesses and compelling documents in the impeachment proceedings makes them accomplices to the president\u2019s cover-up,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cIt is a sad day for America to see Senator McConnell require the chief justice of the United States to preside over a vote which rejected our nation\u2019s judicial norms, precedents and institutions to uphold the constitution and the rule of law,\u201d she said in a statement. Even if Trump is acquitted, she said, \u201che is impeached forever\u201d. \u201cThere can be no acquittal without a trial,\u201d she said. \u201c And there is no trial without witnesses, documents and evidence.\u201d Chuck Schumer\u2019s second amendment, to subpoena former national security adviser John Bolton, whose unpublished book reportedly contains shocking allegations that Donald Trump directly oversaw a pressure campaign in Ukraine. Senators voted it down, once again along on party line, though this time Republican senators Mitt Romney and Susan Collins voted with the 47 Democrats. The remaining two documents are also efforts to subpoena additional evidence and are also likely to be voted down. Senators have swiftly moved to vote on Chuck Schumer\u2019s first of four anticipated amendments, to subpoena Mick Mulvaney, John Bolton, Michael Duffey and Robert Blair as well as documents from White House, OMB and the Defense and State Department. The amendment was defeated by a party-line, 53-47. The Chief Justice John Roberts said it would be \u201cinappropriate for me, an unelected official from a different branch of government\u201d to break a 50-50 tie. If senators tie on any votes, the motion will fail, Roberts said. Roberts was responding to a question from the minority leader Chuck Schumer, who pointed out that the supreme court justice presiding over the impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson broke two ties. \u201cI do not regard those isolated episodes 150 years ago as sufficient to support a general authority to break ties,\u201d Roberts responded. Democrats will offer several amendments to the majority leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s resolution on how the trial will end. In a statement, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that a vote on whether to acquit Trump will happen on Wednesday, Feb 5th at 4pm ET. \u201cSen. McConnell and Republicans water to rush through an acquittal vote tonight. But Democrats wanted votes and witnesses and documents, for the House Managers to be able to make closing arguments, ample time for every member to speak, and to prevent GOP from rushing this through,\u201d he said. He continued: \u201cDemocrats will still oppose this McConnell resolution as it does not include witnesses and documents.\u201d This will be the first impeachment trial in the history of the Senate to have no witnesses. Senator Mitt Romney, one of two Republicans who voted for considering additional witnesses and documents, has been disinvited from the Conservative Political Action Conference in February. The chair of the American Conservative Union, the group that organizes the annual conference, announced that the Utah senator is no longer welcome. Even as conservatives piled on, Romney\u2019s fellow senator from Utah, Mike Lee, came to his defense. Republican senators Roy Blunt and John Barrasso say a deal has been reached to schedule the acquittal vote for Wednesday. Blunt said it was a \u201cdone deal\u201d. The plan is to consider a few amendments tonight, take the weekend off, hear floor speeches and closing arguments Monday through Wednesday, and take a final vote on Wednesday. It\u2019ll be a busy week in politics: The Iowa caucuses are on Monday, and Donald Trump is scheduled to deliver his State of the Union speech on Tuesday Presidential candidates, who\u2019ve been attending the impeachment trial rather than campaigning in Iowa along with their rivals, have reacted to the vote against witnesses. Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bennet may have to remain at the Capitol as the Iowa caucuses \u2013 the first primary election of 2020 \u2013 kicks off on Monday. They don\u2019t necessarily have to attend all the proceedings, so they could ostensibly pop over to Iowa for part of the day, as long as they return in time for closing arguments and the acquittal vote. Moments ago, the UK officially left the European Union. Follow the Guardian\u2019s live updates, from my colleagues across the the Atlantic. Hillary Clinton weighs in: \u201cRepublican senators have put the interests of one president over the interests of all Americans.\u201d The Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, said in a statement: \u201cSenators will now confer among ourselves, with the House managers, and with the president\u2019s counsel to determine next steps as we prepare to conclude the trial in the coming days.\u201d \u201cThere is no need for the Senate to re-open the investigation which the House Democratic majority chose to conclude and which the managers themselves continue to describe as \u2018overwhelming\u2019 and \u2018beyond any doubt\u2019,\u201d McConnell said. Democrats and Republicans are now gathering, separately, to strategize next steps. Reflecting on the vote against hearing witnesses, the minority leader Chuck Schumer lamented, \u201cIt\u2019s a perfidy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a grand tragedy, one of the worst tragedies that the Senate has ever overcome,\u201d he said. \u201cI will be now going up to my caucus to discuss what we\u2019re doing next.\u201d The senators cast their votes by roll call, with everyone voting as expected. The Senate voted 51-49 against calling additional documents and witnesses in the impeachment trial of Donald Trump. The Democrats and two Republicans \u2013 Mitt Romney and Susan Collins \u2013 voted to hear additional testimony. The remaining Republicans voted against the motion. The vote came after four hours of debate. \u201cThe facts will come out \u2013 in all of their horror, they will come out,\u201d the House manager Adam Schiff, in a last appeal to Republican senators who planned to vote against the motion. \u201cThe witnesses the president is concealing will tell their stories.\u201d The president\u2019s legal defense pushed back against having the Senate do \u201cinvestigatory work that the House didn\u2019t\u201d. Senators will now be taking a recess for an undefined amount of time. Voting on witnesses is underway... stay tuned. Moments ago, the Senate leader Mitch McConnell announced he had reached an agreement with the minority leader Chuck Schumer to vote on the witness question and then take a recess. Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to Ukraine who was a key witness in the impeachment inquiry, has retired from the state department, according to NPR. Yovanovitch testified that she was abruptly removed from her post in Ukraine after coming under attack from the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Guiliani. She was recalled based on \u201cunfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives\u201d, she said in her testimony to Congress. A recording from 2018, released last week, seemed to catch Donald Trump asking associates to \u201cget rid\u201d of her. Senators are continuing to huddle in groups, with Democrats and Republicans grouping together to discuss plans. Senator Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat of Arizona, was seen speaking with Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah. Chief Justice John Roberts spoke with Democratic senators Michael Bennet and Richard Blumenthal. And off to one corner, Senate leader Mitch McConnell convened with GOP senators John Thune (the majority whip), John Barrasso (Republican Conference chair), John Cornyn, Lamar Alexander, Ted Cruz, and Todd Young. Senators are huddling on the floor, and both Republican and Democratic leaders appear to be negotiating a plan for how and when the trial will end. Senate leader Mitch McConnell and Minority leader Chuck Schumer appear to be having a serious discussion, along with their top aides, possibly about what to do next. Lawmakers may consider pushing the final acquittal of Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial until next week, per multiple reports. Delaying the final vote would give each side more time to debate the charges against Trump. In his unpublished book, former national security adviser reportedly wrote that Trump asked him to help pressure Ukraine for damning evidence against the Democrats and gave the instruction in a meeting that included White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, the president\u2019s lawyer Rudolph Giuliani, and the White House counsel Pat Cipollone, who has lead Trump\u2019s impeachment defense. The senators are about to take the crucial vote on witness testimony in the impeachment trial, which is expected to fail. I\u2019m handing the blog over to my west coast colleague Maanvi Singh. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Republican senator Lisa Murkowski said she would vote against calling witnesses, virtually guaranteeing the Democratic proposal would fail. Several Republican senators said they would vote to acquit Trump even though they acknowledged his actions toward Ukraine were \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201cwrong.\u201d Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and minority leader Chuck Schumer appear to have reached a deal that would set up a final vote on acquittal for Wednesday. The Trump administration announced plans to expand its controversial travel ban to six additional countries. Health and human services secretary Alexander Azar declared coronvirus to be a public health emergency and announced plans to temporarily block foreign nationals who pose a threat of transmission from entering the country. Maanvi will provide updates on the witness vote once it gets underway, so stay tuned. Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff has finished speaking, concluding the debate on witnesses. The Senate now appears to be taking a quorum call, as majority leader Mitch McConnell and minority leader Chuck Schumer chat on the floor. Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff said Trump\u2019s legal team was abiding by \u201cthe Dershowitz principle\u201d, referring to one of the president\u2019s lawyers. Alan Dershowitz argued earlier this week that Trump was acting in the public interest by pushing for Ukrainian investigations of Democrats because the president considers his reelection to be in the public interest, a point that Dershowitz later walked back. Schiff summarized the position of the president\u2019s team in this way: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of calling witnesses if the president can do whatever he wants under Article II?\u201d Trump\u2019s legal team has concluded speaking for now, and the impeachment managers have 30 minutes to finish their arguments on calling witnesses. While Jay Sekulow was wrapping up for the president\u2019s team, Trump sent this tweet accusing Democrats of \u201cscamming America.\u201d In other non-impeachment news, health and human services secretary Alexander Azar announced at the White House that coronavirus is now a public health emergency. Azar said US citizens returning from China, where the outbreak began, would be subject to \u201cproactive entry health screening\u201d and up to 14 days of \u201cmonitored self-quarantine.\u201d Starting tomorrow, flights from the US to China will also be \u201cfunneled\u201d to seven major airports, and foreign nationals who pose a risk of transmission can be blocked from entering the country. As the impeachment trial nears its end, the Trump administration continues to carry out its aggressive immigration agenda, now announcing plans to expand its controversial travel ban. Reuters reports: The United States will suspend the issuance of visas that can lead to permanent residency for nationals of Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar and Nigeria, the acting homeland security secretary, Chad Wolf, said during a call with reporters on Friday. The targeted immigrant visas are distinct from non-immigrant visas typically issued to visitors, which will not be affected by the ban, Wolf said. The US government will also stop issuing \u2018diversity visas\u2019 to nationals of Sudan and Tanzania, Wolf said. The visas \u2013 which Trump has criticized in the past \u2013 are available by lottery for applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States. Wolf said the six countries failed to meet US security and information-sharing standards, which necessitated the new restrictions. The problems Wolf cited ranged from sub-par passport technology to a failure to sufficiently exchange information on terrorism suspects and criminals. The impeachment trial has resumed, and Trump\u2019s legal team will now have two hours to address the debate over calling witnesses to testify in the trial. Deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin has taken the podium to argue against witnesses, claiming the senators have heard enough testimony from the officials who participated in the public hearings of the House impeachment inquiry. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell was hosting some of his Republican colleagues in his office during the break, likely working through the logistics of the trial\u2019s conclusion, but he is now headed back to the chamber. Michael Bloomberg\u2019s campaign released a statement celebrating the new qualification requirements for the Feb. 19 debate, which could allow the billionaire presidential candidate to participate in the event. \u201cWe are thrilled that voters could soon have the chance to see Mike Bloomberg on the debate stage, hear his vision for the country, and see why he is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump and bring our country together,\u201d said campaign manager Kevin Sheekey. \u201cMike has run for office three times and never taken a dime from special interests, allowing him to act independently, on the merits, without having to do what donors expect. He is proud to be doing the same with this campaign.\u201d But some of the other Democratic presidential candidates are criticizing the new requirements, accusing the Democratic National Committee of bending the rules to benefit Bloomberg. It appears the proposal for the conclusion of the impeachment trial would include a weekend recess followed by proceedings on Monday and Tuesday, with a final vote on Wednesday. That proposal could affect the four Democratic senators running for president: Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bennet. The four candidates had likely planned for the trial to wrap up today or tomorrow, allowing them to be in Iowa for the Monday caucuses. But they may have to stay in Washington if the trial is still going on. As the impeachment trial remains in recess, here\u2019s a bit of election news: the Democratic National Committee has announced it is changing the qualifying requirements for the Feb. 19 debate. The new qualifications could allow billionaire Michael Bloomberg to participate in the debate. The AP reports: The party announced Friday three different ways for candidates to reach the debate stage that involve reaching certain polling thresholds or banking a convention delegate in the first two nominating contests held in Iowa and New Hampshire. All previous debates have included a fundraising element, and since September, candidates have had to reach both polling thresholds and grassroots fundraising marks. Bloomberg, a former New York City mayor, has not yet hit the polling marks, but he will have until Feb. 18, the day before the debate, to do so \u2014 a prospect that pleases some rivals and incenses others. Under the DNC rules, candidates have multiple paths to the stage: reach 10% support in some combination of four national polls or early state polls from Nevada or South Carolina; reach 12% support in two polls from Nevada or South Carolina or both; or bank a convention delegate in Iowa or New Hampshire, which host the first two nominating votes in early February. The announcement quickly sparked backlash, with Democratic advisers and strategists claiming the change would unfairly benefit Bloomberg. \u201cNow, at this late hour, to change the rules to accommodate a billionaire who wants to buy his way into the party would be unconscionable,\u201d said Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser to Bernie Sanders. \u201cNo one should be allowed to buy their way onto the debate stage or the nomination.\u201d A former executive director of the congressional progressive caucus argued the change was meant to harm the prospects of tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang: Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff has stepped off the floor, and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has called for a 15-minute recess in the trial. Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff warned that a dangerous precedent will be set if the impeachment trial does not include witnesses. Schiff predicted future judges or presidents facing impeachment would cite the trial of Trump to try to block witness testimony, which would \u201ceffectively nullify\u201d the congressional power of impeachment. \u201cOur government is no longer a government with three coequal branches,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThe president ... for all intents and purposes, becomes above the law.\u201d Schiff also cited John Kelly, Trump\u2019s former White House chief of staff who said an impeachment trial witout witnesses was only \u201chalf a trial.\u201d The lead manager said he disagreed with Kelly, adding, \u201cA trial without witnesses is no trial at all.\u201d Congressional officials told NBC News that Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and minority leader Chuck Schumer have agreed to a proposal that would wrap up the impeachment trial on Wednesday. If the Senate agrees to this proposal, it would mean Trump will not be acquitted in time for his State of the Union address on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re happy with an acquittal as soon as possible,\u201d a White House official told NBC News. \u201cWe sure would like Tuesday, but the Senate can only go as fast as it can.\u201d Former White House chief of staff John Kelly has once again weighed in on the impeachment proceedings, saying a trial without witnesses should be considered \u201chalf a trial.\u201d \u201cIn my view, they kind of leave themselves open to a lot of criticism,\u201d Kelly told NJ Advance Media. \u201cIt seems it was half a trial.\u201d Kelly attracted headlines earlier this week, when he expressed confidence in John Bolton, who reportedly claims in his forthcoming book that Trump directly tied Ukraine\u2019s military assistance to investigations of Democrats. \u201cIf John Bolton says that in the book, I believe John Bolton,\u201d Kelly said at a Florida event. \u201cEvery single time I was with him ... he always gave the president the unvarnished truth.\u201d The New York Times reported earlier today that Bolton\u2019s book also recounts a May meeting where Trump told the then-national security adviser to help with the pressure campaign on Ukraine. Senator Rob Portman echoed fellow Republican Marco Rubio in his own statement, claiming that removing Trump from office would only serve to further divide the country, even though the president\u2019s actions were \u201cwrong.\u201d \u201cI do not believe that additional witnesses are needed,\u201d Portman said. \u201cI have said consistently for the past four months, since the Zelensky transcript was first released, that I believe that some of the president\u2019s actions in this case \u2013 including asking a foreign country to investigate a potential political opponent and the delay of aid to Ukraine \u2013 were wrong and inappropriate. \u201cBut I do not believe that the president\u2019s actions rise to the level of removing a duly-elected president from office and taking him off the ballot in the middle of an election. ... Our country is already too deeply divided and we should be working to heal wounds, not create new ones. It is better to let the people decide.\u201d Senator Lamar Alexander, who announced yesterday that he would not support witnesses, said he believed Trump\u2019s \u201cinappropriate\u201d actions fell short of the consitutional standard for removal. \u201cI agree he did something inappropriate, but I don\u2019t agree he did anything akin to treason, bribery, high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d Alexander told NPR. \u201cI think there\u2019s a big gap there.\u201d More Republicans are now releasing statements explaining their votes on witness testimony and Trump\u2019s likely acquittal. Senator Marco Rubio, one of Trump\u2019s 2016 primary opponents, said in a statement that it was not in the nation\u2019s best interest to remove the president from office, even though his actions were inappropriate. \u201cJust because actions meet a standard of impeachment does not mean it is in the best interest of the country to remove a President from office,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cCan anyone doubt that at least half of the country would view his removal as illegitimate \u2014 as nothing short of a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat? It is difficult to conceive of any scheme [Vladimir] Putin could undertake that would undermine confidence in our democracy more than removal would.\u201d Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff opened his comments today by referencing the latest New York Times report on John Bolton\u2019s book, which recounts a May meeting during which Trump told the then-national security adviser to help with the pressure campaign on Ukraine. Bolton reportedly claims the president gave him this directive during a meeting with acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House counsel Pat Cipollone, who is currently leading Trump\u2019s defense team. \u201cThere\u2019s a new fact which indicates that Mr. Cipollone was among those who was in the loop,\u201d Schiff said. The lead manager argued the report underscored the need to call witnesses in the trial, even as it became clear that the witness vote was doomed to fail. \u201cThe facts will come out,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThey will continue to come out, and the question before you today is whether they will come out in time for you to make a complete and informed judgement as to the guilt or innocence of the president.\u201d Lisa Murkowski has released a statement explaining her decision to vote against calling witnesses, virtually guaranteeing the failure of the Democratic proposal. \u201cI carefully considered the need for additional witnesses and documents, to cure the shortcomings of its process, but ultimately decided that I will vote against considering motions to subpoena,\u201d the Republican senator said in the statement. Murkowski went on to deliver a condemnation of the entire impeachment process and of Congress itself. \u201cI have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate,\u201d Murkowski said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe the continuation of this process will change anything. It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed.\u201d Murkowski also implictly criticized her Democratic colleague Elizabeth Warren, who asked a question yesterday about whether Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts presiding over the impeachment trial contributed to a \u201closs of legitimacy\u201d for the highest court. \u201cSome of my colleagues intend to further politicize this process, and drag the Supreme Court into the fray, while attacking the Chief Justice,\u201d Murkowski said. \u201cI will not stand for nor support that effort.\u201d Senate chaplain Barry Black had quite a targeted opening prayer for today\u2019s proceedings as the impeachment trial nears an end. \u201cLord, help [senators] to remember that they can\u2019t ignore you and get away with it, for we always reap what we sow,\u201d Black said. A spokesperson for Lisa Murkowski has confirmed the Republican senator will vote against witness tesimony in the Senate trial. With Murkowski joining most of her Republican colleagues, the vote on witnesses is expected to fail by a vote of 49-51. Supreme Court chief justice John Roberts has taken his seat, and the impeachment trial has now officially resumed. Today\u2019s proceedings are expected to begin with four hours of debate on the Democratic proposal to call witnesses. Once the debate has concluded, the senators will hold a vote on witness testimony, which is widely expected to fail. Officials in Florida shot at an SUV that breached security checkpoints heading toward the main entrance of Mar-a-Lago, Trump\u2019s resort in Palm Beach. Two people are reportedly in custody in connection to the incident. Impeachment manager Jerry Nadler announced he will not be present for today\u2019s proceedings because he has returned to New York as his wife battles pancreatic cancer. In a statement to the New York Times, Trump denied that the meeting reportedly desribed by John Bolton in his forthcoming book ever took place. Bolton has reportedly claimed that Trump told him in early May to work with Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, on the campaign to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and the 2016 election. But Trump now says the described meeting \u201cnever happened.\u201d When Giuliani was questioned about the meeting described by Bolton, he said the national security adviser was \u201cmaking some of it up,\u201d but he then added, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call it making it up.\u201d The impeachment trial will resume in about 30 minutes with four hours of debate on the vote to call witnesses. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: The New York Times reported that John Bolton\u2019s book claims Trump told him to help with the pressure campaign on Ukraine in a May meeting with acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House counsel Pat Cipollone. The impeachment trial may now extend into early next week to allow time for closing arguments before the senators hold a final vote on the two articles of impeachment. The vote on witnesses will take place later today and is widely expected to fail after senator Lamar Alexander announced last night that he would vote against the proposal. The blog will have more coming up soon, so stay tuned. Before the beginning of last week\u2019s opening arguments in the Senate trial, the impeachment managers raised concerns that White House counsel Pat Cipollone could be a \u201cmaterial witness to the charges in both Articles of Impeachment.\u201d \u201cYou must disclose all facts and information as to which you have first-hand knowledge that will be at issue in connection with evidence you present or arguments you make in your role as the President\u2019s legal advocate so that the Senate and Chief Justice can be apprised of any potential ethical issues, conflicts, or biases,\u201d the managers wrote in a letter to Cipollone. The White House responded by dismissing the managers as an \u201cutter joke.\u201d \u201cThe idea that the Counsel to the President has to turn over protected documents and confidential information is ludicrous, and to imply he can\u2019t represent the President of the United States in an impeachment proceeding is completely absurd,\u201d deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said in a statement. Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, denied that Trump told John Bolton to help with the Ukraine pressure campaign. According to the New York Times, Giuliani was particularly adamant that Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, and Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel, were ever involved in meetings on Ukraine. \u201cIt is absolutely, categorically untrue,\u201d Giuliani told the Times. Cipollone has led Trump\u2019s legal team during the Senate trial and has repeatedly denied the allegations at the heart of the president\u2019s impeachment. The forthcoming book from John Bolton includes a claim that Trump told his then-national security adviser to help with the pressure campaign on Ukraine, according to the New York Times. The Times reports: Mr. Trump gave the instruction, Mr. Bolton wrote, during an Oval Office conversation in early May that included the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and the White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, who is now leading the president\u2019s impeachment defense. Mr. Trump told Mr. Bolton to call Volodymyr Zelensky, who had recently won election as president of Ukraine, to ensure Mr. Zelensky would meet with Mr. Giuliani, who was planning a trip to Ukraine to discuss the investigations that the president sought, in Mr. Bolton\u2019s account. Mr. Bolton never made the call, he wrote. The previously undisclosed directive that Mr. Bolton describes would be the earliest known instance of Mr. Trump seeking to harness the power of the United States government to advance his pressure campaign against Ukraine, as he later did on the July call with Mr. Zelensky that triggered a whistle-blower complaint and impeachment proceedings. The Times has previously reported that Bolton\u2019s book claims Trump directly tied Ukraine\u2019s military assistance to investigations of Democrats, which reinvigorated Democratic demands for administration officials to testify in the impeachment trial. At least one Senate Republican, Josh Hawley of Missouri, is pushing back against the proposal to extend the impeachment trial through early next week to allow time for closing arguments. As the impeachment trial appears to be drawing to a close, other congressional investigations of Trump are about to have their day in court. NBC News is reporting that the Supreme Court will hear arguments on the administration\u2019s challenges to three congressional subpoenas of the president\u2019s financial records on March 31. The White House has sought to block the subpoeanas from House Democrats, which seek documents from Trump\u2019s accounting firm and two banks with which he has done business. From the New York Times: The court\u2019s ruling, expected by June, could require disclosure of information the president has gone to extraordinary lengths to protect. Or the justices could rule that Mr. Trump\u2019s financial affairs are not legitimate subjects of inquiry so long as he remains in office. Either way, the court is now poised to produce a once-in-a-generation statement on presidential accountability. ... Mr. Trump asked the court to block three sets of subpoenas, and the justices agreed to decide his appeals in all three. At least one Republican senator, John Cornyn of Texas, is now saying that the impeachment trial may extend beyond tonight, even if the vote on witnesses fails. A senior Trump administration official echoed that prediction to the Washington Post: The administration official and a congressional official raised the possibility that the Senate could take up a new procedural resolution laying out rules for the trial\u2019s endgame \u2014 which could include time for closing arguments, private deliberations and public speeches by senators. The Senate passed such a supplemental resolution in the middle of the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. Even passing that resolution could be a lengthy process: When senators debated the initial rules resolution last week, it took more than 12 hours of floor time to process debate on Democratic amendments to the GOP proposal, which ultimately passed unamended just before 2 a.m. on Jan. 22. Should the Senate embark on this process, the senior administration official said, a final verdict could be delayed as late as Wednesday \u2014 after the Iowa caucuses on Monday and Trump\u2019s State of the Union address on Tuesday. If the trial does extend into early next week, it could affect the travel plans of the four Democratic senators who are running for president -- Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bennet. Holding a press conference on Capitol Hill, the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said Trump\u2019s expected acquittal will be \u201cmeaningless\u201d if senators do not vote to call witnesses in the impeachment trial. \u201cThe vote today is about whether the Senate will have a fair trial of the president of the United States,\u201d Schumer said. The Democratic leader said the result of the vote on witnesses is \u201cstill an open question\u201d, although the proposal is widely expected to fail. Schumer also pointed to Lamar Alexander\u2019s statement last night, in which the Republican senator said he would not vote for witnesses, as evidence that Republicans are aware that Trump is guilty. Alexander acknowledged in the statement that it was \u201cinappropriate for the president to ask a foreign leader to investigate his political opponent and to withhold United States aid to encourage that investigation\u201d. Schumer warned that, if more evidence is not heard, the impeachment trial will be remembered as the \u201cgreatest cover-up since Watergate\u201d. Democrat Dick Durbin, the Senate minority whip, predicted tonight\u2019s expected vote on whether to remove Trump from office would go into the \u201cdark of night\u201d. Entering the Capitol this morning, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said: \u201cI think we can all agree this is a big day.\u201d The Kentucky Republican also likely views it as a victorious day, considering the Democratic proposal for witness testimony in the impeachment trial faces little chance of success. Once the vote on witnesses is held, Senate Democrats will likely try to delay the final vote on the articles of impeachment with procedural motions, which means Trump\u2019s expected acquittal may not come until the early hours of tomorrow morning. Lindsey Graham, one of Trump\u2019s top Senate allies, praised Lamar Alexander after the Republican senator released a statement saying he would not vote for witness testimony in the impeachment trial. In his statement last night, Lamar said there was \u201cno need for more evidence\u201d in the trial, noting that the impeachment managers had proven Trump\u2019s actions toward Ukraine were \u201cinappropriate\u201d. \u201cWhen elected officials inappropriately interfere with such investigations, it undermines the principle of equal justice under the law,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cBut the constitution does not give the Senate the power to remove the president from office and ban him from this year\u2019s ballot simply for actions that are inappropriate. \u201cThe question then is not whether the president did it, but whether the United States Senate or the American people should decide what to do about what he did. I believe that the constitution provides that the people should make that decision in the presidential election that begins in Iowa on Monday.\u201d As yesterday\u2019s question-and-answer session was concluding, there was an awkward moment where lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff tried to prevent fellow manager Jerry Nadler from delivering the final word. Chief Justice John Roberts read the final question from Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar, and Nadler then strode to the podium to speak as Schiff tried to get his attention, repeatedly saying his name. Trump weighed in on the exchange this morning, tweeting: \u201cNadler ripped final argument away from Schiff, thinks Shifty did a terrible job. They are fighting big time!\u201d Tension between Nadler and Schiff has been visible at other points in the trial. After Roberts admonished Nadler and one of Trump\u2019s lawyers last week for attacking each other, a reporter tried to ask Nadler a question about the rebuke as the managers held a press conference. Nadler took a half step toward the mic before Schiff cut in: \u201cI\u2019m going to respond to the questions.\u201d Even though the impeachment trial is expected to wrap up soon if the witness vote fails, it will likely still be a long night before Trump is acquitted. If Senate Democrats cannot wrangle enough votes to secure witness testimony in the trial, they are expected to introduce a number of procedural motions to delay the final vote on the two articles of impeachment. Senators on both sides of the aisle are predicting the vote on acquittal will not take place until the early hours of tomorrow morning. A spokesperson for Mitt Romney has confirmed the Republican senator intends to vote in favor of calling witnesses in the impeachment trial. Senate Democrats were already counting Romney as a \u201cyes\u201d vote, given his repeated comments about wanting to hear from administration officials like John Bolton, the president\u2019s former national security adviser. However, the votes of Romney and Susan Collins, another Republican senator who has said she is in favor of witnesses, are not enough to get the Democratic proposal passed. If Romney and Collins are the only Republican senators who support calling witnesses, the final vote will likely be 51-49 against witness testimony. If Lisa Murkowski, another closely watched Republican in this vote, joins Romney and Collins, the final vote could be 50-50. Some Democratic senators have called on Chief Justice John Roberts to break the tie if the vote is 50-50, but it seems unlikely Roberts would take such a step. In that case, a tie vote will be a failed vote, and the trial will move toward a rapid end. The Senate trial will resume at 1pm ET, and it will kick off with two hours of debate from the impeachment managers and Trump\u2019s legal team. Senators are then expected to move on to a vote on calling witnesses, which is likely to fail after Republican Lamar Alexander announced last night he would not support the Democratic proposal. If the witness vote fails, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, could quickly move on to a final vote on the two articles of impeachment, abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. It\u2019s very possible that Trump will be acquitted of those charges tonight, more than four months after the House formally launched its impeachment inquiry. A new national poll has found Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden virtually tied in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, with just three days to go until the Iowa caucuses. According to the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, Sanders is attracting the support of 27% of Democrats acroos the country, while Biden stands at 26%. This marks the first time in the outlets\u2019 polling that Sanders has led the primary. Elizabeth Warren is in third place at 15%, and no other candidate makes it into the double digits. National polls are not very helpful for predicting the winner of the early voting states, but Sanders\u2019 national polling surge comes as a couple of recent surveys have also shown him narrowly pulling ahead in Iowa. Sanders is also the favorite to win the second voting state, New Hampshire, so the other candidates, namely Biden, will have to find a way to stop Sanders\u2019 momentum if they want a shot at the nomination. In another reminder of the stark contradictions and departures from past precedent this impeachment hearing has thrown up, lawyers for the Trump administration argued yesterday, in a separate legal proceeding, that a president can be impeached over failure to comply with subpoenas issued by the House of Representatives, reports Oliver Laughland. Of the two articles of impeachment Donald Trump is currently being tried on, one relates to obstruction of Congress due to his administration\u2019s decision to block witnesses and other evidence requested by the House. Trump\u2019s lawyers have argued repeatedly that the president cannot be impeached over this offense, suggesting the president has a right to protect the executive branch from requests from Congress. On Thursday, however, during entirely separate legal proceedings, a justice department (DoJ) lawyer argued in federal court that the president could be impeached over ignoring subpoenas. The proceedings related to the administration\u2019s handling of the 2020 census, an issue being probed by the Democratic-controlled House. In this case, too, the Trump administration is refusing to hand over certain evidence. DoJ lawyer James Burnham told a DC federal judge that while it was the president\u2019s right to ignore the subpoenas, Congress had other powers, including impeachment, to hold the executive to account. The news travelled to an outraged Adam Schiff, one of the House impeachment managers, on Thursday evening and drew derision and laughter from senators on the jury. \u201cIn the category of you can\u2019t make this stuff up,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThe judge says if the Congress can\u2019t enforce its subpoenas in court, then what remedy is there? And the justice department lawyer\u2019s response is impeachment.\u201d The justice department later issued a statement, attempting to clarify Burnham\u2019s remarks: \u201cThe point we made in court is simply that Congress has numerous political tools it can use in battles with the executive branch \u2013 appropriations, legislation, nominations and potentially in some circumstances even impeachment.\u201d Yesterday we reported that a stretch of Trump\u2019s border wall between the Californian town of Calexico and Mexicali in Mexico had blown over on the Mexican side during high winds. Today things get worse for the wall, one of the president\u2019s landmark pledges in the 2016 election. The Washington Post reports that US border officials and others say it will probably \u201crequire the installation of hundreds of storm gates to prevent flash floods from undermining or knocking it over, gates that must be left open for months every summer during \u2018monsoon season\u2019 in the desert\u201d. \u201cThe open, unmanned gates in remote areas already have allowed for the easy entry of smugglers and migrants into the United States,\u201d the paper adds. You can see a picture of the storm gates in the tweet below: One of the Democratic contenders has dropped out of the primary race ahead of the Iowa caucuses on Monday ... John Delaney, the former Maryland congressman who has been polling at about half a per cent. He told CNN he was clear he would not have got enough support in Iowa, and warned fellow Democrats against nominating Bernie Sanders, saying the leftwing senator\u2019s policies would make our job \u201cso much harder in terms of beating Donald Trump. And I also think that\u2019s not real governing.\u201d The Hill has more on the procedural tactics the Democrats could use to delay the final votes on the articles of impeachment: In a potential procedural snag, McConnell\u2019s request will be amendable on the floor, meaning Democrats could force vote after vote to try to slow down or delay Trump\u2019s acquittal. \u201cI suspect the Democrats if they want to can engage in any number of dilatory tactics to drag it out. ... I suspect they\u2019ll want to offer amendments,\u201d Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), the No. 2 Senate Republican, said of Friday\u2019s schedule. Democratic senators are reviewing their procedural options for forcing GOP senators to take a round of politically tough votes. Even after it became clear that Republicans had the votes to pass the rules resolution last week, Democrats forced an hours-long fight over amendments. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at all of our parliamentary options to try to force as many votes as we can to put Republicans on the record,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). Who is Lamar Alexander, the senator who seems to have sunk the chance of Democrats calling witnesses and opened the door to Donald Trump\u2019s swift acquittal? Alexander, who has represented Tennessee in the Senate since 2003, was seen by Democrats as a possible target in their hunt for four votes to enable them to call witnesses because he is a moderate and he is retiring this year, so he cannot suffer the sort of electoral damage Trump has often tried to mete out to his GOP enemies. But last night Alexander revealed his thinking, releasing a statement saying that he felt that senators needed to hear no further evidence, since Democrats had proved their case against Trump \u2013 but, crucially, that case \u201cdoes not meet the United States Constitution\u2019s high bar for an impeachable offense\u201d. The 79-year-old Alexander was education secretary under George HW Bush and governor of Tennessee from 1979 to 1987, making headlines during the 1978 election campaign when he walked 1,000 miles across the state. A former lawyer, he ran in the Republican presidential primaries in 1996 and 2000, with little success. As a senator he has worked in a bipartisan fashion, notably on education reforms and on trying to find a compromise to shore up Barack Obama\u2019s signature healthcare changes, under threat from Trump and other Republicans. His statement overnight made a point of showing his dissatisfaction with the lack of bipartisanship involved in Trump\u2019s impeachment. \u201cThe framers believed that there should never, ever be a partisan impeachment. That is why the constitution requires a 2/3 vote of the Senate for conviction. Yet not one House Republican voted for these articles,\u201d he said. The same statement revealed that he would not be joining the Democrats in either of the crucial votes expected to conclude Trump\u2019s impeachment. If today does turn out to be the end of the road for Trump\u2019s impeachment, there will surely be some soul-searching in the Democratic party about whether or not they made the right decision in triggering this process. Democratic leaders went into it knowing it was almost certain Trump would be acquitted, but they hoped to put his impeachment on the record for posterity, gum up his legislative agenda, and damage him ahead of this November\u2019s election. They seem to have succeeded on the first two counts, but the jury is probably out on the final point \u2013 and we won\u2019t be able to judge that for sure until election night. Certainly Trump and the Republicans have been forcefully making the case that the impeachment process was an attempt by the Democrats to overturn Americans\u2019 democratic choice in 2016, and take away their democratic choice this year. \u201cWashington Dems have spent the last 3 years trying to overturn the last election \u2013 and we will make sure they face another crushing defeat in the NEXT ELECTION,\u201d Trump tweeted overnight following a rally in Iowa. That argument may succeed in rallying support for Trump. But Democrats may feel that if even half a percentage point ends up being knocked off Trump\u2019s vote tally by impeachment, that\u2019s a success. Polling so far has been a bit inconclusive. More Americans have consistently supported putting him through the impeachment process than oppose it \u2013 although that support has never been higher than 52%. Support for removing him has been more flaky - after starting surprisingly strongly earlier this year, it dropped below opposition in December and at present the two are running neck and neck. Meanwhile Trump\u2019s approval rating remains pretty much where it has been since mid-2018, with around 52% disapproving of the president and 44% approving. None of the many dramas that have shaken Trump\u2019s presidency in the last 18 months have substantially shifted those figures. Good morning. Today Donald Trump could become the third US president to be acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial. Senators will reconvene at around 1pm ET (6pm UK) for two more hours of debate on each side. They will then vote on whether or not to call witnesses. A vote for witnesses would extend the impeachment trial and would probably lead to John Bolton being called. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser claims in his forthcoming book that the president directly linked a delay in military aid to Ukraine to a condition that the Ukrainian government investigate one of his Democratic rivals, Joe Biden \u2013 the issue at the heart of the impeachment proceedings. Democrats need four Republicans to vote with them to call witnesses, and seem to have got the support of Mitt Romney and Susan Collins. Another moderate, Lisa Murkowski, said she would sleep on it. But last night one of the other senators they have been targetting, Lamar Alexander, said that \u201cthere is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven and that does not meet the United States constitution\u2019s high bar for an impeachable offense\u201d. Although what Trump had done was \u201cinappropriate\u201d, Alexander said, the misconduct did \u201cnot meet the US constitution\u2019s high bar for an impeachable offense\u201d. He added: The question then is not whether the president did it, but whether the United States Senate or the American people should decide what to do about what he did. I believe that the constitution provides that the people should make that decision in the presidential election that begins in Iowa on Monday. That would leave the vote at a 50-50 tie. Chief Justice John Roberts could break the tie - but he may just allow the motion to fall, meaning no witnesses. If that vote fails, Republicans will push for a swift vote on whether to convict Trump. Since 20 GOP senators would need to switch sides to do that, the president is almost certain to be acquitted. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, gave a hint last night that he hadn\u2019t quite given up hope, hinting that his party could use some sort of delaying tactics to thwart Republicans\u2019 plans for a quick decision. \u201cThe minority has rights, and we will exercise those rights,\u201d he said. Asked for further details, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get into that here. Our focus right now is on getting the four.\u201d We\u2019ll have full coverage of the trial \u2013 and all other major developments in US politics \u2013 throughout the day. Meanwhile most of the Democrats running for president \u2013 except for those in the Senate \u2013 are in Iowa ahead of Monday\u2019s caucuses, which kick off the primary race in earnest. And the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, is in Ukraine \u2013 becoming the highest-ranking American official to visit Ukraine since the impeachment process began last year \u2013 where he will hold a joint press conference with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Here is some of our impeachment coverage from yesterday:",

The rising death toll in China from the virus, which has infected 17 people in Japan \u2013 including cases of human-to-human transmission \u2013 sparked claims online that the Olympics, which will be held from 24 July to 9 August, would be cancelled. False rumours that the 2020 Games would fall victim to the virus gained traction on social media after Deutsche Presse-Agentur, a German news outlet, ran a story about discussions between the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the World Health Organisation (WHO) that concluded that the outbreak \u201cmay have a significant impact on the Games\u201d. The story, which was picked up by the Japanese-language Buzzap! portal site, generated at least 50,000 tweets under the hashtag \u201cTokyo Olympics Cancelled\u201d. In response, Tokyo Olympic organisers insisted they were \u201cnot considering\u201d cancelling the Olympics and Paralympics. \u201cWe will work closely with the IOC and other concerned bodies to draw any countermeasures whenever necessary,\u201d they said.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s no coincidence that internet phenomena share a vocabulary with certain diseases. As fast as a viral pathogen can spread in a world connected by air travel, bad information can move even faster. Very few people outside of China have been infected with the new coronavirus that was first detected late last year and was declared a global health emergency this week. But millions have already been exposed to false information about the virus.</p> <p>And while we may not be able to measure the damage that misinformation poses to society in the same way that we can take a patient\u2019s temperature, it\u2019s undeniable that the damage is real.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/31/wuhan-city-coronavirus-china\">Wuhan, my hometown, is not a city of fear | Xiaoyu Lu</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recent outbreaks of measles in countries that had previously eradicated the disease, but then become <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/feb/01/facebook-youtube-anti-vaccination-misinformation-social-media\">centers of anti-vaxx conspiracy mongering</a>, are one concrete example of how disinformation can lead to concrete harm. </p> <p>Already, east Asians in Europe and the Americas are reporting incidents of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/27/coronavirus-panic-uk-hostile-environment-east-asians\">racist hostility</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/31/spate-of-anti-chinese-incidents-in-italy-amid-coronavirus-panic\">exclusion</a>. Such experiences will not be counted among the casualties of the disease, but will nevertheless leave a mark on their lives. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/janelytvynenko/coronavirus-disinformation-spread\">Disinformation experts</a> and fact-checkers are now working overtime to attempt to clean up the mess of honest misunderstandings, hoaxes and malicious lies that have spread across the internet. Naturally, attention has again turned to social media users and the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/facebook-is-taking-aim-at-coronavirus-misinformation-others-should-follow-suit/2020/01/31/d97f758a-445d-11ea-b503-2b077c436617_story.html\">social media companies</a> whose platforms have played an important role in accelerating the frictionless spread of falsehood.</p> <p>It\u2019s certainly fair to expect Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and TikTok, among others, to do everything they can to mitigate misinformation amid a global health emergency. Facebook and YouTube were incredibly negligent even as they grew into dominant providers of news and information, only agreeing to take proactive steps to address <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/21/youtube-florida-teenagers-actors-videos-conspiracy-theories-promotion-results\">conspiracy theories</a> about breaking news and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/feb/01/facebook-youtube-anti-vaccination-misinformation-social-media\">health disinformation</a> after facing considerable pressure from the press and politicians.</p> <p>But it\u2019s also important for the professional news media to acknowledge \u2013 and work to correct \u2013 its own role in disseminating disinformation. Half of the top 10 most shared English-language links about coronavirus on Facebook from the month of January were hyperbolic, fear-mongering and at times blatantly misleading articles from actual news outlets, according to a review of data from CrowdTangle. Among the blatantly misleading is an article by the Daily Mail suggesting that the coronavirus outbreak was caused by Chinese people eating \u201cbat soup\u201d that was shared more than 96,000 times on Facebook.</p> <p>The \u201cbat soup\u201d canard is a classic example of disinformation \u2013 and a potent one. Like much of the most persuasive disinformation, the story involves elements of truth taken out of context and repackaged in a way that seems true because it affirms a particular worldview. In this case, actual footage of a Chinese woman eating a bat in soup was ripped out of its <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-51271037\">actual context</a> (a travel blogger\u2019s video from a restaurant in Palau filmed in 2016) and spuriously linked to the fact that some coronaviruses originate from bats, in order to create a narrative that appealed to a western audience\u2019s racist fascination with Chinese appetites.</p> <p>\u201cRevolting footage shows Chinese woman eating a whole bat at a fancy restaurant as scientists link the deadly coronavirus to the flying mammals\u201d reads the Daily Mail\u2019s headline. It\u2019s not exactly false. But it\u2019s certainly not true. If I were to go to YouTube right now, I could pull up some truly revolting footage of British men eating black pudding and watch it just as the UK was officially leaving the EU. But that would not make a headline reading \u201cDisgusting footage shows Englishmen guzzling pigs blood as Europeans depart country in disgust\u201d accurate or responsible.</p> <p>The Daily Mail was not the originator of the \u201cbat soup\u201d disinformation, though its version of the story traveled the furthest on Facebook. It appears that another British tabloid, the Daily Star, was the first to link the years-old video to the coronavirus, with an <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200124180959/https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/world-news/scientists-blame-coronavirus-bats-pics-21337997\">article</a> on 22 January that treated base speculation as revelation. The Daily Star eventually published a correction on its article, but not before the story was picked up and repeated by the Mirror, the Sun, the Evening Standard, and the Mail Online. News outlets in the US, including the Providence Journal and a number of US radio stations owned by iHeartMedia, also repeated the story, as well as conservative US media influencers.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, articles debunking the story have not traveled nearly as far on social media as the original versions did, according to CrowdTangle data. And while the damage that this story did will likely never be measured, it will undoubtedly be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/31/spate-of-anti-chinese-incidents-in-italy-amid-coronavirus-panic\">felt by people of Asian descent</a> around the world, whether they are kids being picked on at lunchtime or adults treated with disrespect while doing their jobs. The viral infection won\u2019t kill us, but it will weaken us.</p> <p>Which makes it all the more disheartening that the agents of disinformation in this case were not Russian bots or QAnon trolls. They were journalists.</p> <h2>What I\u2019m reading \u2026</h2> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-29/health-records-company-pushed-opioids-to-doctors-in-secret-deal\">Health-Records Company Pushed Opioids to Doctors in Secret Deal With Drugmaker</a>, by Bloomberg\u2019s Emma Court.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/opinion/soros-facebook-zuckerberg.html\">Mark Zuckerberg should not be in control of Facebook</a>, by George Soros for the New York Times.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/elon-musk-cant-lose\">Elon Musk can\u2019t lose</a>, by BuzzFeed News\u2019 Ryan Mac.</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s no coincidence that internet phenomena share a vocabulary with certain diseases. As fast as a viral pathogen can spread in a world connected by air travel, bad information can move even faster. Very few people outside of China have been infected with the new coronavirus that was first detected late last year and was declared a global health emergency this week. But millions have already been exposed to false information about the virus. And while we may not be able to measure the damage that misinformation poses to society in the same way that we can take a patient\u2019s temperature, it\u2019s undeniable that the damage is real. Recent outbreaks of measles in countries that had previously eradicated the disease, but then become centers of anti-vaxx conspiracy mongering, are one concrete example of how disinformation can lead to concrete harm. Already, east Asians in Europe and the Americas are reporting incidents of racist hostility and exclusion. Such experiences will not be counted among the casualties of the disease, but will nevertheless leave a mark on their lives. Disinformation experts and fact-checkers are now working overtime to attempt to clean up the mess of honest misunderstandings, hoaxes and malicious lies that have spread across the internet. Naturally, attention has again turned to social media users and the social media companies whose platforms have played an important role in accelerating the frictionless spread of falsehood. It\u2019s certainly fair to expect Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and TikTok, among others, to do everything they can to mitigate misinformation amid a global health emergency. Facebook and YouTube were incredibly negligent even as they grew into dominant providers of news and information, only agreeing to take proactive steps to address conspiracy theories about breaking news and health disinformation after facing considerable pressure from the press and politicians. But it\u2019s also important for the professional news media to acknowledge \u2013 and work to correct \u2013 its own role in disseminating disinformation. Half of the top 10 most shared English-language links about coronavirus on Facebook from the month of January were hyperbolic, fear-mongering and at times blatantly misleading articles from actual news outlets, according to a review of data from CrowdTangle. Among the blatantly misleading is an article by the Daily Mail suggesting that the coronavirus outbreak was caused by Chinese people eating \u201cbat soup\u201d that was shared more than 96,000 times on Facebook. The \u201cbat soup\u201d canard is a classic example of disinformation \u2013 and a potent one. Like much of the most persuasive disinformation, the story involves elements of truth taken out of context and repackaged in a way that seems true because it affirms a particular worldview. In this case, actual footage of a Chinese woman eating a bat in soup was ripped out of its actual context (a travel blogger\u2019s video from a restaurant in Palau filmed in 2016) and spuriously linked to the fact that some coronaviruses originate from bats, in order to create a narrative that appealed to a western audience\u2019s racist fascination with Chinese appetites. \u201cRevolting footage shows Chinese woman eating a whole bat at a fancy restaurant as scientists link the deadly coronavirus to the flying mammals\u201d reads the Daily Mail\u2019s headline. It\u2019s not exactly false. But it\u2019s certainly not true. If I were to go to YouTube right now, I could pull up some truly revolting footage of British men eating black pudding and watch it just as the UK was officially leaving the EU. But that would not make a headline reading \u201cDisgusting footage shows Englishmen guzzling pigs blood as Europeans depart country in disgust\u201d accurate or responsible. The Daily Mail was not the originator of the \u201cbat soup\u201d disinformation, though its version of the story traveled the furthest on Facebook. It appears that another British tabloid, the Daily Star, was the first to link the years-old video to the coronavirus, with an article on 22 January that treated base speculation as revelation. The Daily Star eventually published a correction on its article, but not before the story was picked up and repeated by the Mirror, the Sun, the Evening Standard, and the Mail Online. News outlets in the US, including the Providence Journal and a number of US radio stations owned by iHeartMedia, also repeated the story, as well as conservative US media influencers. Unsurprisingly, articles debunking the story have not traveled nearly as far on social media as the original versions did, according to CrowdTangle data. And while the damage that this story did will likely never be measured, it will undoubtedly be felt by people of Asian descent around the world, whether they are kids being picked on at lunchtime or adults treated with disrespect while doing their jobs. The viral infection won\u2019t kill us, but it will weaken us. Which makes it all the more disheartening that the agents of disinformation in this case were not Russian bots or QAnon trolls. They were journalists. What I\u2019m reading \u2026 Health-Records Company Pushed Opioids to Doctors in Secret Deal With Drugmaker, by Bloomberg\u2019s Emma Court. Mark Zuckerberg should not be in control of Facebook, by George Soros for the New York Times. Elon Musk can\u2019t lose, by BuzzFeed News\u2019 Ryan Mac.",

The death toll from the virus rose by 46 overnight to 259 \u2013 all in China \u2013 with nearly 12,000 confirmed cases.

Singapore is banning entry to all Chinese visitors and foreigners with a recent history of travel to China, starting from Saturday. The ban \u2013 one of the most far-reaching moves to deter the fast-spreading virus \u2013 in effect shuts out the island\u2019s largest group of visitors and will also bar other travellers who have been to China in the past 14 days. Japan has repatriated hundreds of citizens from in around Wuhan \u2013 the capital of Hubei province \u2013 three of whom tested positive for the disease. The US\u2019s emergency measure were announced shortly before health authorities identified a seventh case in the US \u2013 a California man who became ill after traveling to China. About 60 million residents of Hubei province are subject to restrictions designed to slow the spread of the disease. But some people were leaving and entering the area by foot on a bridge over the Yangtze river, reports said, and infections have jumped in two cities near Wuhan. Robert Redfield, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the US travel restrictions had been imposed after the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency on Thursday. \u201cI want to emphasise that this is a serious health situation in China, but I want to emphasise that the risk to the American public is currently low,\u201d Redfield said. \u201cOur goal is to do all we can do to keep it that way.\u201d The US state department warned Americans on Thursday not to travel to China. Almost 200 Americans evacuated earlier this week from Wuhan have been placed under a mandatory 14-day quarantine on Friday.\u201d Matthew L McCoy, a theme park designer who lives in China, said he was \u201cvery relieved\u201d to have been quarantined. \u201cAll of us really want to stay here and make sure were all medically clear and the public safe,\u201d McCoy added. McCoy said he had been able to work in his room on the base and had hooked his computer up to the television screen. \u201cChildren are outside playing, and everyone is trying to make the experience as easy as possible for each other,\u201d he said. Another evacuee said he had been hoping to get out over the weekend but had accepted the quarantine order. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do, and I completely understand, and so do a lot of other people here on the base,\u201d said Jarred Evans, who moved to Wuhan several years ago to play in a Chinese football league. \u201cPeople want to go home. But its better than being stuck in the epidemic centre,\u201d he said.\u201d The US state department said it was in talks with Chinese authorities about further evacuations of hundreds of other US citizens who remain trapped in and around Wuhan. Most of the Americans who have been brought home are reportedly consular staff and their dependents. Dozens of British nationals and their Chinese dependents who arrived in the UK from Wuhan on Friday were spending their first night in quarantine at Arrowe Park hospital on the Wirral, in north-west England, as Britain confirmed its first two cases of the respiratory illness, said to be members of the same family. Britain has also stared withdrawing some staff from its embassy and consulates in China. \u201cAs of 31 January, some staff and dependents from the British embassy and consulates are being withdrawn from China. Essential staff needed to continue critical work will remain,\u201d a government statement said. \u201cIn the event that the situation deteriorates further, the ability of the British embassy and consulates to provide assistance to British nationals from within China may be limited.\u201d The outbreak has caused serious disruption to sports events, with several competitions that were due to take place in China this month either moved to other countries or postponed. On Saturday, the organisers of the Lingshui China Masters badminton tournament \u2013 part of the qualifying process for the Tokyo Olympics \u2013 said they had postponed the event, which was supposed to have been held in Hainan later this month, after several players withdrew. Several airlines have cancelled services to China, including British Airways and all three major US carriers. On Saturday, Qantas said it would suspend its two direct flight routes from Australia to mainland China from 9 February. Agencies contributed to this report",

Earlier, the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, had called on the federal government to halt all flights to Australia from China as the death toll from coronavirus rises.

Health authorities say she was not infectious en route and is recovering in isolation at home. On Friday, Palaszczuk accused the federal government of withholding information her government needed to contact travellers who had arrived in Queensland from China. She said officials had since begun handing over more data. A 44-year-old man and a 42-year-old woman from Hubei province who were confirmed to have the virus were recovering in a stable condition in Gold Coast University Hospital. Seven others in their travel group remained in quarantine. The Chinese Women\u2019s football team, which was in quarantine in the Westin Brisbane hotel, have not shown symptoms of the virus.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Nonetheless he is determined to maximise his shopping time at Bicester Village, which is the second most popular tourist attraction for Chinese visitors to the UK after Buckingham Palace.</p> \n<p>While Chinese tourists in masks is a common sight in normal times in popular tourist destinations, at Bicester Village this week there seems to be more Chinese visitors wearing them than not.</p> \n<p>Kyu Hee, a Korean national with a Chinese husband who lives in the UK, has placed masks adorned with cute cartoon characters over the mouths of both of her children. \u201cOf course I am worried,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is the Chinese new year, so many people are leaving the country and lots of them are coming here.

      "body": "<p>Until quite recently, many people fervently believed this day would never arrive. Just over three months ago, Brexit finally seemed to have pushed British politics to the brink of a nervous breakdown. There were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/26/tory-moderates-conservative-party\" title=\"\">tears and tantrums in parliament</a>. There were petitions and protests outside. A litany of lawsuits was waiting in the wings to derail the whole process. Ardent remainers felt they were tantalisingly close to stopping Brexit altogether. The future looked wide open.</p> <p>From a second referendum to a government of national unity, from toppling over the cliff edge to beating a full retreat, almost anything appeared possible. Yet here we are \u2013 one day after formally leaving, just as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-live-results-and-analysis\" title=\"\">British people decided</a> on 23 June 2016 \u2013 and all that is gone. What happened? Were the last four years a mirage?</p> <p>The emotions were real. It was the sense of possibility that was an illusion. In recent years, some surprising political outcomes have seemed to pass from being impossible to being inevitable without ever taking the time to be merely improbable. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s election as Labour leader was like that: what couldn\u2019t conceivably happen suddenly couldn\u2019t be stopped. Brexit has taken us on a much more circuitous journey.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/31/remainers-britain-eu-brexit\">We remainers must now aim for Britain to do well \u2013 and the EU even better | Timothy Garton Ash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before the referendum, plenty of people assumed that leaving the European Union was out of the question. Then, in the immediate aftermath of the vote, it looked like a fait accompli. Shocking though the result might have been, the choice was clear and we would all have to live with it \u2013 just like any other election result.</p> <p>Yet over the following months and then years, Brexit drifted back into the realms of the improbable. There were so many potential barriers in its way, and so many people determined to raise them, that what had seemed like a done deal gradually became an open question. Opposition, which might have been expected to dissipate over time, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/31/article-50-petition-to-cancel-brexit-passes-6m-signatures\" title=\"\">instead grew</a>. Rather than a result to which the losing side needed to reconcile itself, it became a historic injustice to be avenged.</p> <p>It was as though the Brexit referendum had torn a hole in the normal functioning of British politics. We had passed through a portal to somewhere strange \u2013 and the job was to find a way to return to the place we had left behind. The opponents of Brexit took heart from the fact that because the referendum had apparently upended the old political order \u2013 along with their own sense of order \u2013 it ought to be possible to upend Brexit. The way to undo the referendum was to treat it as a rupture in the political space-time continuum, and to repair the tear.</p> <p>This was a mistake. The Brexit referendum did not stand outside the normal run of British politics. It was a product of that politics. The illusion was to believe that direct democracy, in the form of a high-stakes referendum, had somehow derailed parliamentary democracy and that therefore the task was to get it back on track. But Brexit all made sense \u2013 and only made sense \u2013 as a product of parliamentary democracy. An elected government, enacting its will through parliament, made the referendum happen. Only an elected government, enacting its will through parliament, could deal with the consequences. The old rules still applied. Everything else was just for show.</p> <p>The show included the growing demands for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/28/remainers-eu-elections-second-brexit-referendum\" title=\"\">second referendum</a>. It was a passion play, full of its own heroic performances. This demand made total sense for anyone who believed that the first referendum was an outlandish event that needed to meet its match: having passed through the portal we required some equivalent way of passing back. But if you started from the premise that we had never left politics as usual, then pushing for a second referendum was always a quixotic enterprise.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7721a989d4ad14662e22f5a54dccd4afe630d5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7721a989d4ad14662e22f5a54dccd4afe630d5f/0_242_4356_2615/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A People\u2019s Vote march in London, October 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A People\u2019s Vote march in London, October 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was no way to get there. Parliament would have had to agree not only that it was a good idea, but also on the question to be asked, the rules under which it was to be held and the meaning of its outcome. This was obviously impossible in the existing parliament. But any parliament that could not agree on Brexit would not have been able to agree on a second referendum. And any parliament that can agree on Brexit doesn\u2019t need one.</p> <p>Why did the illusion take such a strong hold over so many people? As with much else in contemporary politics, there was a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/21/age-not-class-is-what-divides-british-voters-most\" title=\"\">generational divide</a>. Among older remainers, for whom the result of the referendum was wildly outside the bounds of what they understood as political normality, it seemed like it had to be countered in kind, with something equally abnormal. For younger remainers, especially those in their late teens or early 20s, the last few years had been the only politics they really knew. Wasn\u2019t this \u2013 the chaos, the emotion, the sense of possibility \u2013 how it worked? No. But it\u2019s easy to see why it would look like that if that\u2019s all you\u2019ve encountered.</p> <p>The general election of 2017 helped to perpetuate the illusion. Labour came very close to another enormous shock. It looked once again like anything might be possible. But Labour only managed to do as well as it did by parking the issue of Brexit. Both main parties went into that election promising to respect the result of the referendum.

Plenty of Brexiteers were deceived, too. Within the parliamentary Conservative party the despair was palpable during the nadir of May\u2019s government. The fear was real that not only might Brexit be lost, but the party itself might be wiped out. In last spring\u2019s European elections the Conservatives polled the lowest national vote share in their history, while Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/11/poll-surge-for-farage-panic-conservatives-and-labour\" title=\"\">riding high</a>. But the Tories have one great advantage at times like these. When no one knows what to do, Conservatives focus on their parliamentary survival. And since parliamentary survival is the name of the game in a parliamentary democracy \u2013 nothing about the Brexit referendum had changed that \u2013 it often works.</p> <p>The person who saw this most clearly was Dominic Cummings. At a low point in the fortunes of Boris Johnson\u2019s new government last autumn, when it had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/sep/24/boris-johnsons-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful-supreme-court-rules-prorogue\" title=\"\">defeated in the courts</a>, was being stymied in parliament and mocked in the press \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/05/bumbling-boriss-speech-at-police-academy-was-classic-dom\" title=\"\">Classic Dom!</a>\u201d \u2013 Cummings gave a rare public appearance in which he said that compared to winning the referendum itself, what he was going through as the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-49853524/dominic-cummings-this-is-a-walk-in-the-park\" title=\"\">a walk in the park</a>\u201d. It sounded shockingly arrogant. He can\u2019t have meant he knew he was going to win in the end \u2013 no one ever knows that. But it did mean that he knew the only way to win. He had no choice but to focus on the fact that the existing parliament would never agree on how to stop Brexit, and to get to a new parliament his opponents would have to give him a general election under circumstances that did not suit them. The rest was just noise.</p> <p>Cummings was convinced that the really hard part had been to win the referendum itself, given that the old rules still applied. He had needed to shock the existing system. Engineering a successful public vote to take Britain out of the EU in the face of establishment opposition \u2013 including in parliament, where most MPs were strongly opposed to the idea \u2013 was truly an outrageous achievement. But since the old rules still applied, turning the referendum result into reality through parliament was far more straightforward.</p> <p>All he had to do was reabsorb the shock back into the existing system. The status quo would take care of the rest. The iconoclast could safely reinvent himself, if only for a few months, as an upholder of the established order. Even the failed prorogation of parliament, which probably generated the most passion of all, was another distraction. Cummings wasn\u2019t really trying to get round parliament. He was just trying to get parliament to function like it used to.</p> <p>With hindsight, we can see that the illusion Brexit might be stopped made it easier for Brexit to happen in its current, harder form. Opportunities were missed to moderate it. If Labour MPs who were tempted to vote for May\u2019s deal early last year had actually done so, we would have had a softer Brexit than the one that is now looming. But hindsight creates its own illusions. May\u2019s deal became softer as she became weaker in parliament; her weakness in parliament made it much harder for Labour MPs to support her deal. Those who considered it were accused of \u201ccomplicity with Brexit\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"380f188f66b5748a36d203866598562e8ef01b36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/380f188f66b5748a36d203866598562e8ef01b36/0_32_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dominic Cummings\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dominic Cummings \u2018wasn\u2019t really trying to get round parliament.

If that happens, we will know who to blame.

      "bodyText": "Until quite recently, many people fervently believed this day would never arrive. Just over three months ago, Brexit finally seemed to have pushed British politics to the brink of a nervous breakdown. There were tears and tantrums in parliament. There were petitions and protests outside. A litany of lawsuits was waiting in the wings to derail the whole process. Ardent remainers felt they were tantalisingly close to stopping Brexit altogether. The future looked wide open. From a second referendum to a government of national unity, from toppling over the cliff edge to beating a full retreat, almost anything appeared possible. Yet here we are \u2013 one day after formally leaving, just as the British people decided on 23 June 2016 \u2013 and all that is gone. What happened? Were the last four years a mirage? The emotions were real. It was the sense of possibility that was an illusion. In recent years, some surprising political outcomes have seemed to pass from being impossible to being inevitable without ever taking the time to be merely improbable. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s election as Labour leader was like that: what couldn\u2019t conceivably happen suddenly couldn\u2019t be stopped. Brexit has taken us on a much more circuitous journey. Before the referendum, plenty of people assumed that leaving the European Union was out of the question. Then, in the immediate aftermath of the vote, it looked like a fait accompli. Shocking though the result might have been, the choice was clear and we would all have to live with it \u2013 just like any other election result. Yet over the following months and then years, Brexit drifted back into the realms of the improbable. There were so many potential barriers in its way, and so many people determined to raise them, that what had seemed like a done deal gradually became an open question. Opposition, which might have been expected to dissipate over time, instead grew. Rather than a result to which the losing side needed to reconcile itself, it became a historic injustice to be avenged. It was as though the Brexit referendum had torn a hole in the normal functioning of British politics. We had passed through a portal to somewhere strange \u2013 and the job was to find a way to return to the place we had left behind. The opponents of Brexit took heart from the fact that because the referendum had apparently upended the old political order \u2013 along with their own sense of order \u2013 it ought to be possible to upend Brexit. The way to undo the referendum was to treat it as a rupture in the political space-time continuum, and to repair the tear. This was a mistake. The Brexit referendum did not stand outside the normal run of British politics. It was a product of that politics. The illusion was to believe that direct democracy, in the form of a high-stakes referendum, had somehow derailed parliamentary democracy and that therefore the task was to get it back on track. But Brexit all made sense \u2013 and only made sense \u2013 as a product of parliamentary democracy. An elected government, enacting its will through parliament, made the referendum happen. Only an elected government, enacting its will through parliament, could deal with the consequences. The old rules still applied. Everything else was just for show.

This demand made total sense for anyone who believed that the first referendum was an outlandish event that needed to meet its match: having passed through the portal we required some equivalent way of passing back.

      "body": "<p>Last week, in the last few days of China\u2019s lunar new year holiday, the streets of Beijing were decorated with fairy lights and glowing red lanterns, but eerily empty. Normally busy restaurant and bar strips were dark. Residential compounds, often lax in their security, closed their gates, with guards ordering anyone entering to register and have their temperature taken. Public buses carried only a few passengers. Those restaurants that were open were mostly empty, with only small groups of diners. At Beijing Capital airport, staff, including some health workers in full hazmat suits, outnumbered passengers.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d said Li, 42, a teacher from Beijing who has remained in the city since the outbreak of the coronavirus. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Beijing. Beijing always has a lot of people. Right now the roads, restaurants and malls are all empty.\u201d She spends her days at home cooking and eating, occasionally going to the shop for supplies.</p> <p>Authorities are implementing \u201cgrid-style management\u201d \u2013 total coverage \u2013 to uncover infections in communities. Over the past week, neighbourhood committees have knocked on doors, asking residents whether anyone in their household <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/31/the-city-is-suffocating-diary-of-the-wuhan-coronavirus-lockdown\" title=\"\">has recently visited Wuhan,</a> the provincial capital where the virus is believed to have originated, or surrounding areas in Hubei province. Police have called to check on those in Beijing with Wuhan <em>hukou</em>, or household registrations.</p> <p>In a city that attracts millions of workers from across the vast country, paranoia about outsiders has increased. Districts outside Beijing have set up checkpoints, and some villages have created their own de facto quarantines, ordering residents not to leave and barring anyone from coming in. Before the end of the national holiday on Sunday, officials have tried to persuade local residents not to treat those returning for work or school with hostility.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65c422671aa74b972c58a18110cc00e2de90d8d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65c422671aa74b972c58a18110cc00e2de90d8d2/0_167_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Riding the subway in Beijing.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Riding the subway in Beijing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Schiefelbein/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs long as they have not been confirmed with the virus and there are no obvious signs of fever or cough, returnees should be allowed to freely enter and leave the community,\u201d Zhao Jigui, deputy director of the Beijing municipal civil affairs bureau, said last Friday, referring to the districts or neighbourhoods where residents live. \u201cEach district is a family and we must support each other,\u201d Zhao added.</p> <p>Across China, cities have turned into ghost towns as residents cloister themselves at home to avoid the new coronavirus, which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/31/a-man-lies-dead-in-the-street-the-image-that-captures-the-wuhan-coronavirus-crisis\" title=\"\">killed more than 300 people</a> and infected almost 14,000 as it has reached every province, territory and municipality in China, as well as 19 other countries.</p> <p>As the crisis, now declared a global health emergency, widens and more countries issue travel warnings for China, or cut off transport links, frustration and anxiety, as well as boredom, have grown.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been outside in a week,\u201d said Yang, 39, an entrepreneur based in Shanghai who lives with his wife and newborn child. \u201cI\u2019m on self-imposed house arrest. I just don\u2019t want to bring it back to the house.\u201d</p> <p>In Hubei province, the heart of the outbreak, where most of the deaths have occurred, residents live an even more isolated life. In a county near Huanggang, the worst-hit city after Wuhan, Li, 31, who works at a bank, has been at home with her parents for a week. The roads are shut.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Now, I dare not look at the news. Every day there are people dying</p> <footer> <cite>Li, 31, Hubei province</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Every day she hears a loudspeaker twice in the morning and twice in the afternoon advising residents not to go out. The neighbourhood committee visits residents every day to check on them. Two families in her neighbourhood \u2013 a couple who recently visited Wuhan and another who\u2019ve been to Huanggang, a city a few kilometres east \u2013 have signs on their doors advising other residents not to visit.</p> <p>Whenever a family member takes the rubbish out, one of the few times they leave, they are disinfected as soon as they return. Li is most anxious about the risks health workers are taking and the lack of supplies at hospitals. \u201cI dare not look at the news. Every day people are dying,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In the face of public anger over what many see as the government\u2019s slow and ham-fisted response to an outbreak first detected on 8 December, Chinese authorities have tried to appear decisive and transparent.</p> <p>After widespread traffic restrictions that put about 50 million people in Hubei province under lockdown, Chinese leader Xi Jinping described the coronavirus epidemic as a demon. \u201cWe cannot let this demon hide,\u201d he said on Tuesday, promising the \u201ctimely release of information\u201d domestically and internationally. Following a directive vowing to hold local officials accountable, a health official in Huanggang was fired.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"374fe225c465178eeda1354b32339e89e3b60812\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/374fe225c465178eeda1354b32339e89e3b60812/0_226_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An old man wearing a medical mask walks in the village at sunrise in Jianli county, Hubei province.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Walking in the village at sunrise in Jianli county, Hubei province.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liu Tao/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But criticism and mistrust have grown. Chinese internet users say officials are \u201ctossing the pot\u201d, or passing the buck, by blaming other departments or other officials for the crisis. Reports of desperate conditions in Hubei, where many residents have told of not being able to get help or reach hospitals where staff are overworked and undersupplied, have only increased public anger.</p> <p>China\u2019s Red Cross, in charge of all donations, has come under fire for distributing only an eighth of funds it has received, even as a doctor in Wuhan said that his hospital had run out of protective medical equipment. Photos posted online showed staff making protective gear out of garbage bags and bedsheets. A 17-year-old boy with cerebral palsy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/30/disabled-teenager-in-china-dies-at-home-alone-after-relatives-quarantined\" title=\"\">reportedly died from hunger </a>in Huanggang last week after his father and brother were quarantined.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001316?query=featured_home\" title=\"\">A study published on </a><a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001316?query=featured_home\" title=\"\">Wednesday</a> compounded the frustrations.

      "bodyText": "Last week, in the last few days of China\u2019s lunar new year holiday, the streets of Beijing were decorated with fairy lights and glowing red lanterns, but eerily empty. Normally busy restaurant and bar strips were dark. Residential compounds, often lax in their security, closed their gates, with guards ordering anyone entering to register and have their temperature taken. Public buses carried only a few passengers. Those restaurants that were open were mostly empty, with only small groups of diners. At Beijing Capital airport, staff, including some health workers in full hazmat suits, outnumbered passengers. \u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d said Li, 42, a teacher from Beijing who has remained in the city since the outbreak of the coronavirus. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Beijing. Beijing always has a lot of people. Right now the roads, restaurants and malls are all empty.\u201d She spends her days at home cooking and eating, occasionally going to the shop for supplies. Authorities are implementing \u201cgrid-style management\u201d \u2013 total coverage \u2013 to uncover infections in communities. Over the past week, neighbourhood committees have knocked on doors, asking residents whether anyone in their household has recently visited Wuhan, the provincial capital where the virus is believed to have originated, or surrounding areas in Hubei province. Police have called to check on those in Beijing with Wuhan hukou, or household registrations. In a city that attracts millions of workers from across the vast country, paranoia about outsiders has increased. Districts outside Beijing have set up checkpoints, and some villages have created their own de facto quarantines, ordering residents not to leave and barring anyone from coming in. Before the end of the national holiday on Sunday, officials have tried to persuade local residents not to treat those returning for work or school with hostility. \u201cAs long as they have not been confirmed with the virus and there are no obvious signs of fever or cough, returnees should be allowed to freely enter and leave the community,\u201d Zhao Jigui, deputy director of the Beijing municipal civil affairs bureau, said last Friday, referring to the districts or neighbourhoods where residents live. \u201cEach district is a family and we must support each other,\u201d Zhao added. Across China, cities have turned into ghost towns as residents cloister themselves at home to avoid the new coronavirus, which has killed more than 300 people and infected almost 14,000 as it has reached every province, territory and municipality in China, as well as 19 other countries. As the crisis, now declared a global health emergency, widens and more countries issue travel warnings for China, or cut off transport links, frustration and anxiety, as well as boredom, have grown. \u201cI haven\u2019t been outside in a week,\u201d said Yang, 39, an entrepreneur based in Shanghai who lives with his wife and newborn child. \u201cI\u2019m on self-imposed house arrest. I just don\u2019t want to bring it back to the house.\u201d In Hubei province, the heart of the outbreak, where most of the deaths have occurred, residents live an even more isolated life. In a county near Huanggang, the worst-hit city after Wuhan, Li, 31, who works at a bank, has been at home with her parents for a week. The roads are shut. Every day she hears a loudspeaker twice in the morning and twice in the afternoon advising residents not to go out. The neighbourhood committee visits residents every day to check on them. Two families in her neighbourhood \u2013 a couple who recently visited Wuhan and another who\u2019ve been to Huanggang, a city a few kilometres east \u2013 have signs on their doors advising other residents not to visit. Whenever a family member takes the rubbish out, one of the few times they leave, they are disinfected as soon as they return. Li is most anxious about the risks health workers are taking and the lack of supplies at hospitals. \u201cI dare not look at the news. Every day people are dying,\u201d she said. In the face of public anger over what many see as the government\u2019s slow and ham-fisted response to an outbreak first detected on 8 December, Chinese authorities have tried to appear decisive and transparent. After widespread traffic restrictions that put about 50 million people in Hubei province under lockdown, Chinese leader Xi Jinping described the coronavirus epidemic as a demon. \u201cWe cannot let this demon hide,\u201d he said on Tuesday, promising the \u201ctimely release of information\u201d domestically and internationally. Following a directive vowing to hold local officials accountable, a health official in Huanggang was fired. But criticism and mistrust have grown. Chinese internet users say officials are \u201ctossing the pot\u201d, or passing the buck, by blaming other departments or other officials for the crisis. Reports of desperate conditions in Hubei, where many residents have told of not being able to get help or reach hospitals where staff are overworked and undersupplied, have only increased public anger. China\u2019s Red Cross, in charge of all donations, has come under fire for distributing only an eighth of funds it has received, even as a doctor in Wuhan said that his hospital had run out of protective medical equipment. Photos posted online showed staff making protective gear out of garbage bags and bedsheets. A 17-year-old boy with cerebral palsy reportedly died from hunger in Huanggang last week after his father and brother were quarantined. A study published on Wednesday compounded the frustrations. The study in The New England Journal of Medicine used data from the first 425 cases in Wuhan and found evidence of human-to-human transmission in mid-December. Until 20 January, Chinese officials had insisted that there was no evidence the disease was transmissible by humans and that the virus was still manageable. \u201cWhat is the cost of being lied to? It\u2019s not that we will mistake lies for truth. The real danger is that if we listen to too many lies, we can no longer recognise facts,\u201d read one of the most popular comments in response to the study. \u201cWe don\u2019t care who the heroes are. All we want to know is whose fault this is.\u201d Additional reporting by Lillian Yang",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>At 6pm on Tuesday, the jumbo jet took off from Madrid\u2019s Barajas airport, bound for Hanoi where it would make a stopover.

The flight from Wuhan to Brize Norton took 11 hours and 40 minutes and was, according to the pilot, \u201cvery pleasant and rather beautiful\u201d because of the skies through which they were flying. \u201cThe crew were always checking to see if people were OK and calm, and whether there were any cases,\u201d he said. \u201cBut people were relaxed \u2013 like the worst was behind them. The Britons and the British medics got off at Brize Norton and the Spanish doctors came aboard there and we flew back to Torrej\u00f3n [air base, just outside Madrid]. All the passengers were really happy and excited to be back on their own soil, even though they knew they were going to be in quarantine for a while.\u201d Mart\u00ednez and his crew are on leave but have not been required to go into quarantine. While he is a little shocked by the fanfare, he is delighted that his team\u2019s efforts have been recognised. \u201cMy biggest memory of all this will be of a crew that worked together beautifully,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were more like a family than a crew. When I address a crew, I call them family. What started off as a flight crew, became a team and ended up being like a family.\u201d By Saturday lunchtime, the week\u2019s excitement was beginning to recede and the pilot had firmly entered the airspace of the familiar and the domestic. \u201cA friend jokingly told me I was a hero and I said, \u2018No, I was just doing my job\u2019. But I guess this goes beyond a job. Sometimes it\u2019s like being a priest or a firefighter. But anyway, it\u2019s back to normality now. I\u2019m going shopping and then I\u2019ll help my wife make lunch.\u201d",

Shares in Norwegian Cruise Line Holding, Royal Caribbean and Carnival were all at least 5% lower on the New York stock exchange following the Italian incident before recovering some of their losses on Friday. The consultancy S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence says the decision of regional governments to extend factory closures beyond 2 February to control the virus\u2019s spread will be a major blow to China\u2019s GDP. International companies are beginning to find ways of circumventing Chinese companies to obtain electronics parts, though US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross made it clear he thought most firms were unlikely to question strategic business relationships as a result of the outbreak. That said, Apple, General Motors, Ikea and Starbucks have closed much of their Chinese operations, as have many other foreign companies. Chris Rogers of S&amp;P says commitments to buy $33.4bn of US agricultural exports this year, made by Beijing as part of a truce in the trade war, might be difficult to meet. But he believes there will be an opportunity later in the year to make up for lost time. The expectation is that the coronavirus will soon be under control and the overall effect, even on the Chinese mainland, will be limited. The consultancy Oxford Economics has cut its forecast for global growth this year from 2.5% to 2.3%, which would be the lowest since the 2008 financial crash. \u201cConsidering the affected areas account for just over 50% of total Chinese output, we think this could lead China\u2019s annual GDP growth to slow to just 4% in the first quarter from our previous forecast of 6%,\u201d it said. Writing in Caijing magazine, Zhang Ming said the coronavirus\u2019s economic impact could be \u201csignificantly bigger\u201d than Sars, based on a forecast that the outbreak would peak in mid-February and end by April. That must be the hope of governments across the world; but with the virus already thought to be in thousands of people who have no idea they are infected, the fear must be that it claims more victims, ruins more businesses and depresses global growth by much more than so far estimated.",

actually changed, why Brexit is far from \u201cdone\u201d and what to expect over the coming months.</p> \n  <p>Here is a taste of his piece: </p> \n  <h2>Have we actually left, then?</h2> \n  <p>Yes. The UK has ceased to be a member of the EU. British citizens are no longer EU citizens; there are no British MEPs or commissioner; British ministers will play no further part in EU law-making; no British prime minister will now attend EU summits. The change is legal and constitutional.</p> \n  <h2>Why does it feel like nothing has changed?</h2> \n  <p>Because we have entered an 11-month transition period during which pretty much everything will stay as it was while the UK and the EU negotiate their future relationship. Until at least the end of December 2020, Britain will remain in the EU\u2019s single market and customs union and continue paying into its budget; people, goods, capital and services will continue to move freely across the bloc \u2013 including Britain \u2013 as before.

      "bodyText": "Afternoon summary It is now the afternoon after the night that was: Brexit day+1. The UK has now left the European Union, after 47 years inside the bloc. Here is a summary of the day\u2019s events: The EU will back Spain over its territorial claims to Gibraltar in the next phase of Brexit negotiations by giving Madrid the power to exclude the British overseas territory from any trade deal struck with Brussels. The Spanish government has insisted that the Rock be included in the EU\u2019s opening negotiating position, the Observer has learned. Boris Johnson intends to impose full customs checks on all goods coming into the UK from the EU in a break with previous government policy, according to reports. The government\u2019s policy had been to waive customs checks and tariffs on 87% of goods coming into the country and only impose limited checks on goods, reports Lisa O\u2019Carroll. Labour leadership contenders Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy have called on the country to accept Brexit and move on at a party hustings in Bristol. While rival candidate Emily Thornberry argued that the party should be led by a remain-backing leader who had been \u201con the right side of the argument all along\u201d. Yesterday, frontrunner Sir Keir Starmer said he would argue for the reintroduction of EU free movement after Brexit if he becomes the next Labour leader. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis said that he believes the UK can strike a trade deal with the EU by 2021. He told BBC Radio4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIt is going to be a fair race to do it right now because it was going to be 21 months, now it is only 11, but nevertheless it can be done in the time period.\u201d European leaders issued emotional farewells following the UK\u2019s EU departure. In tribute to the late Terry Jones, from comedy-troupe Monty Python, European council president Charles Michel tweeted: \u201cAlways look on the bright side of life.\u201d The European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, told the UK \u201cwork to ensure the EU is a project you\u2019ll want to be a part of again soon\u201d. Emmanuel Macron issued an open letter to the UK public calling for \u201ca new chapter\u201d between the UK and France based on \u201cthe strength of our unrivalled ties\u201d. The French president confirmed that he would visit London in June and vowed to protect the rights of Britons in France and French citizens in the UK. PA Media has this report on the Labour leadership hustings in Bristol this morning: Labour leadership hopefuls Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy have urged the party to accept Brexit and move on, during the first hustings since the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union. Long-Bailey and Nandy, who represent the leave-voting constituencies of Salford and Eccles, and Wigan respectively, said efforts should now be directed into ensuring a good trade deal is struck with Brussels. But the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, predicted the trade talks were unlikely to go smoothly and argued that Labour would need a remain-backing leader who had been \u201con the right side of the argument all along\u201d. Long-Bailey told supporters at a hustings in Bristol that the party could not campaign at the next general election, expected in 2024, with the message of \u201cwe told you so\u201d if the country\u2019s economic fortunes dipped after leaving the EU. She admitted it was \u201csad\u201d to see the UK\u2019s divorce from Brussels finalised this week but said the \u201cdebate is over\u201d. \u201cWe cannot spend the next four years waiting to tell our constituents \u2018We told you so\u2019 and that we knew it was going to be this bad all along,\u201d the shadow business secretary said. Instead, Labour had to make sure Boris Johnson negotiated the \u201cbest possible trade deal\u201d that could help \u201crebuild our communities\u201d. Nandy was critical of Labour\u2019s reaction to the referendum outcome, accusing the leadership under Jeremy Corbyn of looking \u201cbackwards\u201d after the result, rather than \u201clooking forward to the country we can be\u201d. \u201cWe completely missed the point of that political earthquake, which was a clamour for more power, more control and more agency across this country,\u201d she said. The former shadow energy secretary, who voted for Johnson\u2019s withdrawal agreement, admitted she had failed in her push for a Brexit deal that kept a close relationship with the EU. Thornberry took an opposing view to her two rivals and said she suspected the country would be \u201cback in no-deal territory by the summer\u201d. \u201cWhat do we do at that stage? We need to have someone leading the fight who was on the right side of the argument all along,\u201d said the Islington South and Finsbury MP, who is the only leadership contender not to have secured enough backing to advance to the final stage. The shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, one of the architects of Labour\u2019s second-referendum policy, said the divide between leave and remain voters must end, but accused the government of failing to address the \u201cunderlying reasons\u201d why the electorate voted to leave the EU. The Agence France-Presse correspondent Marc Burleigh has shared footage of the moment the UK\u2019s permanent representation to the EU had its name plate changed on Saturday. It is now called the British diplomatic mission. The union jack could be seen flying alone outside the building last night, after the European flag was taken down before Brexit. There was an increase in police clearances of Calais refugee camps in the days leading up to Brexit, PA Media reports. Clare Moseley, the founder of the aid organisation Care4Calais, said authorities were clearing people out of tents and fencing off larger areas in the French port town in recent weeks. Many people stay near the port and Eurotunnel stations in the hope of being able to cross to the UK, but Moseley described the last week as \u201chorrible\u201d. Before a visit to one of the sites on Saturday, she said: \u201cAs always the authorities\u2019 response here is always to do with security and deterrent, so in the run-up to Brexit we\u2019ve seen extra clearances, we\u2019ve seen more brutal attempts to get people out of here. \u201cTaking away their tents, moving people away from areas, fencing off even more of the areas where they stay. \u201cIt\u2019s been a horrible week, it\u2019s been very rough for a lot of the people here, spirits are very low and unfortunately that\u2019s always the political response.\u201d Care4Calais has provided for refugees in Calais and other towns across northern France and Belgium since 2016, the same year that the infamous \u201cjungle camp\u201d was evicted. As well as food and shelter, the charity tries to assist with mental wellbeing, to prevent suicide and self-harm. Moseley said she believed conditions could worsen, as the post-Brexit political climate will make authorities even keener to evict people from the areas. \u201cNow Brexit has arrived I can only see things getting worse. Not so much because of Brexit, because the agreements here between France and the UK are just direct agreements, but in the political climate that we\u2019re in now, all they want to do is get rid of the refugees. \u201cIt\u2019s the same policy they\u2019ve been following for the last 10 years. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work, but what they believe is that if they make conditions hard enough, people will stop coming, so that\u2019s what they do, they make it as hard as they possibly can.\u201d Moseley said the only way to solve the issues was to provide the means for people to cross to the UK safely. \u201cThe crux of the problem is that there is no safe and legal way for people to make an asylum claim in the UK. \u201cTo make an asylum claim in the UK, you have to physically be there, but there\u2019s no way to do that, so people have to keep trying illegally.\u201d Eddie Izzard has called for unity and to \u201cmake humanity great again\u201d following the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union. Shortly before 11pm on Friday, the comedian said in Twitter video that \u201cwe must now put divisions behind us\u201d. To this end, he also announced that he will attempt 28 marathons in 28 European countries over 28 days to raise money for charity. \u201cWe Europeans have achieved so much since the end of the second world war, no matter how governmental agreements have changed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve achieved peace, above all peace, trade, friendship, a sharing of our cultures without losing our identities.\u201d The EU will back Spain over its territorial claims to Gibraltar in the next phase of Brexit negotiations by giving Madrid the power to exclude the British overseas territory from any trade deal struck with Brussels. The Observer has learned that the Spanish government has insisted on reference to the Rock in the EU\u2019s opening negotiating position, which will be published in draft form on Monday. Boris Johnson will be presented with the choice of reaching agreement with the Spaniards about Gibraltar\u2019s future or exposing its citizens to economic peril by pushing it outside any EU-UK trade deal. Read the full story: Emmanuel Macron has said he would like to begin a new chapter between the UK and France based on \u201cthe strength of our unrivalled ties\u201d. In a letter published in The Times on Saturday, the French president vowed to protect the rights of British citizens in France and French citizens in the UK. He said it was in our \u201ccommon interest\u201d to have as \u201cclose and deep a partnership as possible\u201d in defence and security, and in police, judicial, environmental, scientific and cultural cooperation. But added that he must \u201cbe honest\u201d that ease of access to the EU market will depend on the UK\u2019s willingness to accept its rules. \u201cWe cannot allow any harmful competition to develop between us,\u201d he wrote. Macron urged both the UK and the EU to \u201clearn lessons\u201d from Brexit. One reason for UK political leaders\u2019 rejection of the EU was \u201cto avoid having to deal with their own failures\u201d, he said. Another was that Europe was \u201cseen as not effective enough, not protective enough, distant from the realities of daily life\u201d. The letter concludes: \u201cDear British friends, you are leaving the European Union but you are not leaving Europe. \u201cNor are you becoming detached from France or the friendship of its people. The channel has never managed to separate our destinies; Brexit will not do so, either. \u201cAt 11pm last night we did not say \u2018goodbye\u2019, but an early \u2018good morning\u2019.\u201d Boris Johnson intends to impose full customs checks on all goods coming into the UK from the EU, in a break with previous government policy, according to reports. \u201cWe are planning full checks on all EU imports \u2013 export declarations, security declarations, animal health checks and all supermarket goods to pass through border inspection posts,\u201d the Daily Telegraph reported a senior Whitehall source as saying. \u201cThis will double the practical challenge at the border in January 2021.\u201d The paper reports that businesses will be informed of the policy on 10 February. This would be a complete departure from Theresa May\u2019s policy. Last year in its no-deal planning, the government said it would waive customs checks and tariffs on 87% of the goods coming into the country and only impose limited checks on goods.

The change came into effect at one minute past midnight GMT on 1 February, just over an hour after the UK left the EU. The republic quit the Commonwealth in 2016 after being threatened with suspension over its human rights record and lack of progress on democratic reform. Read the full story: In other \u2013 non-Brexit-related \u2013 news, one of two people in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus has just been confirmed to be a University of York student. The university was continuing to operate as normal, a spokesman said. \u201cWe are monitoring the situation closely and we continue to provide as much advice, care and support as we can to our university community.\u201d You can follow all the latest developments on our separate live blog. The word \u201cthick\u201d is trending at No 1 on Twitter on the UK\u2019s first morning outside of the EU. Those lamenting Brexit are ridiculing the apparent ignorance displayed by leave voters who appeared in media reports from last night\u2019s celebrations. While those levelling accusations of stupidity are themselves being accused of self-righteousness. Tom Peck, the Independent\u2019s political sketch writer, describes the scenes at 11pm on Friday in Parliament Square as a \u201cknuckle dragging carnival of irredeemable stupidity\u201d. The LBC presenter James O\u2019Brien has said that the lack of knowledge being displayed should come as no surprise. Piers Morgan responded: The Joseph Rowntree Foundation\u2019s Helen Barnard, deputy director of policy and partnerships, has added: This has been a familiar refrain over the past three-and-a-half years \u2013 a sign of the huge task at hand in uniting a divided nation. \u2018The most pointless, masochistic ambition in our country\u2019s history\u2019 Ian McEwan paints a grim picture of what lies ahead now that Brexit is \u201cdone\u201d, writing: We sense damage and diminishment ahead. In a dangerous world crowded with loud-mouthed \u2018strongmen\u2019, the EU was our best hope for an open, tolerant, free and peaceful community of nations. Those hopes are already threatened as populist movements have swept across Europe. Our withdrawal will weaken resistance to the xenophobic tendency. The lesson of our nation\u2019s history these past centuries is plain: turmoil in continental Europe will draw us into bloody conflicts. Nationalism is rarely a project for peace. Nor does it care to counter climate change. It prefers to let tropical forests and the Australian bush burn. John le Carr\u00e9 reflects on how a lack of leadership today has allowed us to \u201csleepwalk\u201d into Brexit. Here is a taste of his piece: We Brits are all nationalists now. Or so Johnson would have us believe. But to be a nationalist you need enemies and the shabbiest trick in the Brexiteers\u2019 box was to make an enemy of Europe. \u201cTake back control!\u201d they cried, with the unspoken subtext: and hand it to Donald Trump, along with our foreign policy, our economic policy, our health service and, if they can get away with it, our BBC. The novelist this week won the Olof Palme prize for achievement in the spirit of the assassinated Swedish statesman. Brexit night passed in a largely peaceful manner, despite the at-times bitterly divided lengthy run-up to 31 January, PA Media reports. As people both celebrated and mourned the UK\u2019s departure from the EU at major events across the country, there were just a handful of arrests. Police dealt with five people in Whitehall in London, including one man who was charged with criminal damage, and being drunk and disorderly. Kevin Murphy, 52, of north London, was due to appear at Westminster magistrates court on Saturday, the Metropolitan police said. A 28-year-old was arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly, a 52-year-old was arrested for the same offence as well as obstructing a constable, and a 33-year-old was arrested under section 5 of the Public Order Act, and for failing to appear. All three men remain in custody. A 47-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of threatening behaviour but later released from custody and will not face any further action. In Glasgow, there was a heavy police presence in the city centre as groups for and against Brexit held events near each other. Pro-EU campaigners gathered at the Donald Dewar statue on Buchanan Street before the official departure time of 11pm. Police said one 25-year-old man was arrested for a minor disorder offence. Supt Mark Sutherland said: \u201cA proportionate policing response was in place to ensure public safety and minimise disruption to the wider city centre community. The events passed peacefully with only one arrest.\u201d The Police Service of Northern Ireland said there had been no arrests at a celebration in Belfast. The Green MEP Catherine Rowett marks her return from Brussels this morning with a \u201cEuropean breakfast\u201d. In case you missed it, here we answer all your questions about your post-Brexit rights. Welsh remainers mourning the UK\u2019s departure from the EU are set to hold a rally in Cardiff this morning. Former Labour leadership contender Jess Phillips on how she feels on the UK\u2019s first morning outside of the EU: This is from the BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming, who has been among the team presenting BBC\u2019s Brexitcast for more than two-and-a-half years. Parliament Square has returned to normal following the Brexit celebrations on Friday night. Little remained of the Leave Means Leave event other than some discarded union jacks and muddy footprints on the grass. Street cleaners were sweeping away the remnants of the party while staging used by speakers including Nigel Farage had been removed overnight. The European council president, Charles Michel, has responded to Brexit with a Monty Python reference, tweeting: \u201cAlways look on the bright side\u201d. Above a picture of the white cliffs of England\u2019s south coast, Michel said it was a \u201ctribute to the late Terry Jones\u201d, the Python star who directed Life Of Brian, the film featuring the song Always Look on the Bright Side of Life. In a message to Britons, the European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, said he would \u201cwork to ensure the EU is a project you\u2019ll want to be a part of again soon\u201d. Earlier on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, the former Brexit secretary David Davis said it would be a \u201cfair race\u201d to strike a trade deal with the EU by 2021 but that it \u201ccan be done\u201d. He said extensive work had already been completed when he was in the cabinet to analyse every free trade deal Brussels had previously struck with other third countries. Davis said: \u201cThere\u2019s the possibility of a trade deal taking pieces from all the other trade deals that the European Union has done and therefore cannot undermine the single market. \u201cIt is going to be a fair race to do it right now because it was going to be 21 months, now it is only 11, but nevertheless it can be done in the time period.\u201d On what more border and customs checks will mean for Northern Ireland, the Fine Gael senator Neale Richmond told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: Well certainly that responsibility is up to the British government. We have a situation whereby we will limit the checks as much as possible. But they would be between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. We want to work with the British government [and] our European partners to ensure they are limited. But if the British government do want to go for this very hard Brexit then it is the people of Northern Ireland that will be separated more greatly from Great Britain. Brexit becoming a reality is splashed across the papers this morning, but the front page treatments vary wildly. From \u201cRise and shine\u201d in the Daily Express to \u201cWhat next?\u201d in the i, here is our wrap of what the papers say about Britain leaving the EU. Keir Starmer said he would argue for the reintroduction of EU free movement after Brexit if he becomes Labour\u2019s next leader. The shadow Brexit secretary said his party must not be afraid to argue for free movement, and that EU citizens should receive \u201crights, not tolerance\u201d from the UK. \u201cWe need to make the wider case on immigration,\u201d he told a leadership event at Westminster Cathedral in London on Friday. \u201cWe welcome migrants, we don\u2019t scapegoat them. Low wages, poor housing, poor public services, are not the fault of people who come here: they\u2019re political failure. So we have to make the case for the benefits of migration; for the benefits of free movement.\u201d In 2016, the Guardian spoke to jubilant leave campaigners featured on the Daily Mail\u2019s front page the day after the referendum. Some of those in the photograph criticised David Cameron for his decision to quit as prime minister, expressed concern at racist attacks in the wake of the poll, and wondered whether anyone actually had a plan. Frances Perraudin and Matthew Weaver went back to ask for their reflections on one of the most turbulent periods in British political history. The Guardian\u2019s Brussels bureau chief spoke to the UK\u2019s nine surviving permanent representatives to the EU before Brexit. Spanning the premierships of Ted Heath to Boris Johnson, it\u2019s a fantastic insight into the often uneasy relationship Britain has had with the European Union. Nicola Sturgeon, meanwhile, has urged supporters of Scottish independence to stay \u201cfocused and united\u201d, while ruling out \u2013 for now \u2013 holding a consultative referendum that would inevitably be challenged in the courts. Two weeks after the prime minister formally rejected Sturgeon\u2019s request for the legal powers to hold a second referendum, and as a poll put support for independence in the lead \u2013 by 51-49 \u2013 for the first time since 2015, Sturgeon told an audience of Scottish National party politicians and activists in Edinburgh that she would not \u201cpretend that there are shortcuts or clever wheezes that can magically overcome the obstacles we face\u201d. Describing Brexit day as \u201cone of real and profound sadness \u2026 tinged with anger\u201d, Scotland\u2019s first minister said: \u201cWhat we in the independence movement must not do is allow a sense of frustration \u2013 understandable though it is \u2013 to take us down dead ends or weaken our sense of purpose.\u201d Jon Henley has written a good explainer on what has actually changed, why Brexit is far from \u201cdone\u201d and what to expect over the coming months. Here is a taste of his piece: Have we actually left, then? Yes. The UK has ceased to be a member of the EU. British citizens are no longer EU citizens; there are no British MEPs or commissioner; British ministers will play no further part in EU law-making; no British prime minister will now attend EU summits. The change is legal and constitutional. Why does it feel like nothing has changed? Because we have entered an 11-month transition period during which pretty much everything will stay as it was while the UK and the EU negotiate their future relationship. Until at least the end of December 2020, Britain will remain in the EU\u2019s single market and customs union and continue paying into its budget; people, goods, capital and services will continue to move freely across the bloc \u2013 including Britain \u2013 as before. In their daily lives, most people will not notice any difference. Is there a timetable for the year? The political declaration, part of the withdrawal agreement, provides for a June summit to allow both sides to assess how the talks are progressing. By 1 July Britain must decide whether it wants to ask for an extension. A deal on fisheries is also required by the end of June. Beyond that, the EU has said late November is the last date by which an agreement can be concluded if it is to be checked, translated, approved and ratified by the end of the year. In reality, this leaves only about six months of actual negotiating time. Here is the full piece: Welcome to our live coverage of Brexit day +1. It\u2019s the morning after the UK has left the European Union. Britain is now formally no longer a member of the EU but everyday life will remain the same and the UK will remain in the single market and the customs union until the end of the year as part of transition arrangements. We know little of the UK\u2019s plans for the negotiations of the future relationship but EU leaders have told Britain to expect tough trade talks. On the eve of Brexit, Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, said she wished Britons well, but vowed to fight for the EU\u2019s interests in the coming negotiations over the future relationship. The Guardian\u2019s economics editor, Larry Elliott, has written an analysis, saying Brexit is a chance to fix the British economy\u2019s long-term problems. You can read it here:",

      "bodyText": "The Department of Health said 203 people had been tested in the UK as of 2pm on Saturday, with 201 results coming back negative and two positive. One of the two people who has tested positive for coronavirus is a student at the University of York. The student infected is not thought to have come into contact with anyone on campus while showing symptoms, Public Health England said, but investigations are ongoing to fully establish this. The University of York said it has been advised that the risk of the infection being passed to other people on campus is low. The Foreign Office said it is withdrawing staff from China after it flew dozens of UK nationals home from coronavirus-hit Wuhan. Essential staff will remain to continue \u201ccritical work\u201d but the FCO has warned its ability to provide help to Britons in the country may be limited. More than 100 Germans and family members landed in Frankfurt today after being evacuated from Wuhan. None of the people on the aircraft had shown any symptoms of the virus, German Health Minister Jens Spahn said. The Russian military will evacuate Russian citizens from China on Monday and Tuesday. Vietnam has suspended all China flights, its civil aviation authority said. Qatar Airways has suspended flights to mainland China from 3 February due to \u201csignificant operational challenges caused by entry restrictions imposed by several countries\u201d. Delta Airlines says its last China-bound flight will leave today and the last return flight will be on Sunday. My colleague Lucy Campbell is at The University of York and says students have been milling about, going to the gym or library as normal. Kate Bunting, a second year biology student, said it was \u201cquite scary\u201d to learn they had been staying at the Staycity hotel in York as it is right next to where she lives. Kate added she and her friends felt some of the media coverage was scaremongering. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s as scary as it sounds, the fact that there\u2019s a low risk of further contamination gives me some security and it\u2019s only because it\u2019s here that people find it a bit scary. \u201cBut nobody I know is changing their behaviour because of it and the uni\u2019s done a good job of updating us throughout the week. \u201cIt\u2019s just been a normal day on campus, but quiet, but then it always is on a Saturday.\u201d Three Philippines airlines have cancelled flights to China after health officials confirmed the country\u2019s first case of coronavirus. A 38-year-old Chinese woman who arrived from Wuhan, China, tested positive for the virus on Thursday. Delta Airlines says its last China-bound flight will leave today and the last return flight will be on Sunday. Delta had previously planned to suspended all flights to China by Thursday. More than 100 Germans and family members landed in Frankfurt today after being evacuated from Wuhan. None of the people on the aircraft had shown any symptoms of the virus, German Health Minister Jens Spahn told reporters. \u201cAll those returning are currently healthy but to protect them, their personal environment and society at large, it is important that we ensure that nobody is infected,\u201d Spahn said. Spahn also warned against hysteria and hostility towards those in quarantine. \u201cI am most concerned about conspiracy theories of all sorts that circulate in the social media, which only have one goal, to spread uncertainty.\u201d Germany confirmed a seventh case of the coronavirus on Friday. The IndiGo carrier has said it will suspend flights on the Kolkata-Guangzhou route from February 6 to February 25. Authorities have detected the first suspected case of coronavirus in Tunisia, according to local reports. The passenger is male and was returning to Tunis Airport via Qatar from China. A summary of what other countries are doing to address the outbreak: The Russian military will evacuate Russian citizens from China on Monday and Tuesday. Vietnam has suspended all China flights, its civil aviation authority said. Qatar Airways has suspended flights to mainland China from 3 February due to \u201csignificant operational challenges caused by entry restrictions imposed by several countries\u201d. Iraq\u2019s Basra International A airport said it was denying entry to passengers of any nationality travelling to Iraq from China. Turkmenistan Airlines has suspended flights to and from Beijing. The government of Uzbekistan has instructed the state airline to suspend flights to and from China. The evacuation of Thai nationals from the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak in China could take place \u201cin a matter of days\u201d, Thailand\u2019s government said. The Russian military will evacuate Russian citizens from China next week due to the coronavirus outbreak, news agencies have reported. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the evacuation would take place in regions that had been most affected by the outbreak. Peskov initially said that evacuation will start on Saturday but later corrected himself, saying it will be carried out on Monday and Tuesday. The Russian defence ministry plans to use five aeroplanes to evacuate people from China. Samara Jones, the president of the University of York Students\u2019 Union, has released a statement after the news that one of two people who have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK was a student at the university. She said:\u201cOur thoughts are with the family affected. \u201cThe student community at York is a tight-knit, global community and we will continue to support one another at this time. \u201cWe would encourage students with any questions to keep an eye on the university\u2019s website. The dedicated helpline will remain open over the weekend.\u201d The University of York\u2019s vice chancellor, Prof Charlie Jeffrey, has said he wants to reassure students and staff that the university is working with Public Health England and other agencies to manage the situation at a briefing outside the university. The risk of the virus being transmitted on campus was low and the university would open as normal, he said. He said the university, which is home to students and staff from more than 140 countries, is \u201cvery much an international community\u201d. China\u2019s Hubei provincial government has extended the lunar new year holiday break to 13 February as it seeks to curb the coronavirus outbreak that emerged from its capital, Wuhan, the Hubei Daily reported. The University of Derby has confirmed that \u201ca very small number\u201d of students who came back from Wuhan before travel restrictions were put in place are self-isolating for 14 days. A spokeswoman for the university said all the students were fit and well. The Department of Health said 203 people had been tested in the UK as of 2pm on Saturday, with 201 results coming back negative and two positive. Horseman Coaches, which repatriated 83 Britons yesterday from RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire following the flight from Wuhan, has issued a statement on the safety of its drivers and passengers. The company said: Horseman Coaches had provided PPE (personal protective equipment) equipment for all drivers involved. Military medics and government officials told drivers that PPE equipment was not necessary due to the precautions already taken by the Department of Health and Public Health England. Government officials confirmed drivers wearing PPE while driving posed a greater risk to the safety of passengers. This was a governmental decision based on a risk assessment conducted by the Department of Health and Public Health England. An individual photographed wearing a PPE suit was in direct contact with each of the 83 Britons, and so needed to wear protective clothing. The individuals repatriated have not had direct contact with any drivers, and officials from PHE have been present to supervise and manage the situation at all times. PHE has confirmed all drivers may return to work immediately, however Horseman Coaches has asked all drivers to remain at home on full pay and benefits for the next 10 working days under quarantine conditions as an additional precautionary measure. James Horseman, the company\u2019s director, added: \u201cWe wish to reassure our customers that every recommendation made by the deputy chief medical officer for Public Health England has been correctly followed and implemented. \u201cThe five coaches used, out of 62 in our fleet, will remain locked in a secure facility for a minimum of 10 working days after a military-grade cleansing process has been completed as an additional precautionary measure. \u201cPHE has confirmed that there will be no risk to any future passengers.\u201d The government has said it will send another plane to Wuhan to rescue British citizens if needed. The Foreign Office is working with EU countries to add British passengers to any rescue flights they may charter back from the city, according to PA Media. The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, said another plane will be sent to Wuhan if necessary. China has exempted US imports from tariffs as it tries to tackle the coronavirus epidemic. Beijing announced that US imports that can be used in its fight against the new virus will be exempted from retaliatory tariffs imposed in the trade war. The US and China have been engaged in a trade conflict for around two years, although both sides came to a ceasefire last month as Beijing agreed to buy a further $200bn of US products in a partial trade deal. China has now announced it will \u201cimplement more preferential import tariff measures from January to March 2020, to step up support for prevention and control of the (ongoing) epidemic\u201d. Authorities said any tariffs levied on goods used in the fight against the virus could be refunded. Beijing said it would relax its rules on tariff exemptions and this would extend to goods such as disinfectants, protective supplies and emergency command vehicles. The UN on the coronavirus outbreak. The outbreak has infected more than 11,900 people globally. China has had 11,791 cases on the mainland. In addition, Hong Kong has 12 cases and Macau has five. Most of the 259 deaths have been in central Hubei province, where illnesses from the new type of coronavirus were first detected in December. Here are the other cases: Thailand: 19 Japan: 20 Singapore: 18 South Korea: 12 Taiwan: 10 Malaysia: 8 Australia: 7 Germany: 6 United States: 6 France: 6 Vietnam: 6 Canada: 4 United Arab Emirates: 4 Russia: 2 Italy: 2 United Kingdom: 2 Cambodia: 1 Finland: 1 India: 1 Philippines: 1 Nepal: 1 Sri Lanka: 1 Sweden: 1 Spain: 1 Vietnam has suspended all China flights as part of \u201cstrengthening measures\u201d against the coronavirus outbreak, its civil aviation authority said. The decision applies to all airlines \u201cwhich have routes between Vietnam and China\u201d and includes Hong Kong and Macau, the directive posted on its website said. An earlier version included Taiwan but references to the island have since been removed. Russia\u2019s aerospace forces, part of the armed forces, will start evacuating Russian citizens from China today due to the coronavirus outbreak. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters the evacuation would take place in regions that had been most affected by the outbreak. Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister, Tatiana Golikova, said on Friday that Russia planned to evacuate more than 600 of its citizens now in Wuhan and Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak in China, and they will be quarantined for 14 days. Russia has already reported its first two cases of coronavirus and restricted direct flights to China. A British man who has remained in Wuhan to be with his wife and family is worried he will be forgotten by the UK government. The Foreign Office (FCO) said it would have limited ability to help Britons in China after it made the decision to withdraw all but essential staff from the country due to the coronavirus outbreak. Chris Hill, 38, is one of the Britons who has chosen to remain in the country where he lives with his wife, Caitlyn Gao, and daughter, Renee Gao, who are both Chinese citizens. He told the PA news agency: \u201cMy only worry now is, after everybody pulls out, the FCO will forget about those who are staying and not give any support for us.\u201d Hill, who is from Sunderland, added: \u201cFor British nationals that are staying in Wuhan, but also in China, to have the consulate and embassy evacuating, it\u2019s not a good sight to see really, is it? \u201cMy concerns would basically be that they\u2019re going to completely write off China in the long run. Even though they say that they are trying, it\u2019s also a fear that with pulling all the staff out, they\u2019re just going to go \u2018out of sight, out of mind\u2019.\u201d Hill said he received a call from the FCO today saying he, his wife and daughter would be able to get on an evacuation plane bound for France. But his wife is unable to leave because she works as a nurse at a hospital and is also unwilling to abandon her parents. Public Health England has said it is making good progress in tracing people who have come into close contact with the two Chinese nationals diagnosed with the new strain of coronavirus in the UK. Those who have been in close contact \u2013 within two metres of those infected for at least 15 minutes \u2013 will receive advice. The pair, who are related, were confirmed as having coronavirus after being taken ill at a hotel in York on Friday. It has since emerged that one of them is a student at the University of York. Here is the statement from the University of York. The University of York said it has been advised by Public Health England (PHE) that the risk of the infection being passed to other people on campus is low, after it was confirmed that one of two people who have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK was a student at the university. A spokesman for the university said: \u201cWe understand this development will cause concern and anxiety among our students, staff, and the wider community. \u201cPHE has advised us that the risk of infection being passed to others on campus is low. \u201cCurrent information from PHE suggests that the student did not come into contact with anybody on campus whilst they had symptoms, but investigations are ongoing to fully establish this. \u201cOur immediate concerns are for the affected student and family, along with the health and continued wellbeing of our staff, students and visitors.\u201d Qatar Airways has announced it has suspended flights to mainland China from 3 February due to \u201csignificant operational challenges caused by entry restrictions imposed by several countries\u201d. Public Health England has said the University of York student confirmed as infected with coronavirus did not come in contact with anyone on campus while showing the coronavirus symptoms, Sky News is reporting. Vietnam has declared a public health emergency over the coronavirus epidemic and said it would stop all flights to and from China. The government said it would also stop issuing visas for foreign visitors who had been in China in the past two weeks. All permits granted for flights between Vietnam and China, including Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau, have been revoked until further notice, the government said. Budget carrier Vietjet Air and the national firm, Vietnam Airlines, earlier said they would suspend all flights to and from China from today. One of the two people who has tested positive for coronavirus is a student at the University of York, a university spokesman said. He said the university continues to operate normally. The spokesman added: \u201cWe are monitoring the situation closely and we continue to provide as much advice, care and support as we can to our university community. \u201cIf people have any concerns about their health in relation to suspected coronavirus we ask that they follow current PHE advice and contact NHS 111. \u201cThe University has set up a call centre over the weekend for anyone who has any further concerns or inquiries. The telephone number is 01904 809571.\u201d Three Chinese citizens were denied entry to Erbil International airport, in the semiautonomous Kurdistan region of Iraq, over fears about the coronavirus outbreak in China, authorities said. The three passengers were sent back to Dubai, from where they had flown to Erbil, a statement from Kurdistan\u2019s airport authority said. Iraq\u2019s Basra International airport said on Friday it was denying entry to passengers of any nationality travelling to Iraq from China. Turkmenistan Airlines has suspended flights to and from Beijing. The move was aimed at preventing the spread of the coronavirus, the company said in a statement. The government of Uzbekistan has also instructed the state airline to suspend flights to and from China. Charter flights will bring back Uzbek citizens if they wish to return, except from Wuhan, it said. The World Health Organization has advised that it is safe to receive a letter or a package from China. Eighty-three Britons evacuated from China will spend their first full day in quarantine today. They will spend 14 days in two apartment blocks normally used to house nurses, who have been moved to local hotels, in Wirral. The UK evacuees have been put up in fully furnished rooms, including kitchens, and provided with food and laundry facilities. Families are being kept together with toys and baby equipment available. They will have access to a team of medical staff who will closely monitor their condition. An English teacher, speaking from his room at Arrowe Park Hospital, Wirral, told The Guardian: \u201cIt\u2019s like being in a crap hotel or a student halls of residence. \u201cI haven\u2019t actually asked but I suspect I\u2019m not really supposed to come out here in the next 14 days. \u201cIt\u2019s alright though. It will be OK.\u201d Matt Raw, one of those in quarantine, said he and his family \u201cwere extremely glad to be here\u201d and they are feeling fine. He told the BBC that he, his wife and his mother were staying in a four-bedroom apartment, along with another woman and her daughter. Raw stressed they had \u201can army of people looking after them\u201d. He added there was a contained area outside where they were able to get some fresh air, adding they were \u201callowed contact with anybody within the facility, as long as we\u2019re wearing face masks\u201d. Officials are attempting to trace people who had close contact with two Chinese nationals diagnosed with the new strain of coronavirus in the UK. The pair, who are related, were taken ill while staying at a hotel in York on Friday. Public Health England (PHE) said anyone who had close contact \u2013 defined as being within two metres of those infected for at least 15 minutes \u2013 will receive health advice. Professor Sharon Peacock, director of the national infection service at PHE, said: \u201cPublic Health England is contacting people who had close contact with the confirmed cases. \u201cClose contacts will be given health advice about symptoms and emergency contact details to use if they become unwell in the 14 days after contact with the confirmed cases.\u201d Here is the latest advice from the Department of Health and Social Care. The Department of Health and Social Care has just published its latest advice for the public. It has confirmed that two patients in England have tested positive for coronavirus. If more cases are confirmed in the UK, it will be announced as soon as possible by the relevant chief medical officer. \u201cBased on the World Health Organization\u2019s declaration that this is a public health emergency of international concern, the UK chief medical officers have raised the risk to the public from low to moderate,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis permits the government to plan for all eventualities. \u201cThe risk to individuals in the UK has not changed at this stage. Our advice for travellers from Wuhan and Hubei province remains unchanged from the below and we have added further advice for travellers from elsewhere in China. \u201cAs of 31 January, a total of 177 UK tests have concluded, of which 175 were confirmed negative and 2 positive. \u201cSome 1,466 passengers and 95 staff arrived in the UK on direct flights from Wuhan between 10 and 24 January. 162 of the passengers have already left the UK. 53 of the crew have already left the UK. 866 are now outside of the incubation period.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Beijing bureau chief, Lily Kuo, has tweeted about new restrictions in the second worst-hit city in China, Huanggang. China\u2019s premier, Li Keqiang, has asked the EU to facilitate China\u2019s urgent procurement of medical supplies from member countries, the Chinese government said. The Foreign Office is withdrawing staff from China hours after flying dozens of UK nationals home from coronavirus-hit Wuhan, PA Media reports. Essential staff will remain to continue \u201ccritical work\u201d but the FCO has warned that its ability to provide help to Britons in the country may be limited. The rescued UK nationals were taken to Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral in a convoy of six coaches on Friday. They will spend the next 14 days in quarantine. Here is our latest news report by Justin McCurry, which lays out Beijing\u2019s anger at the US announcing a ban on foreign arrivals from China. The evacuation of Thai nationals from the centre of the coronavirus outbreak in China could take place \u201cin a matter of days\u201d, Thailand\u2019s government said on Saturday. Three officials from the Thai embassy in Beijing were expected to reach Wuhan, the capital of the central province of Hubei where the outbreak began, on Sunday to help with the evacuation, government spokeswoman Narumon Pinyosinwat said. \u201cWe have an increase from 161 to now 182 Thais in the area who have registered with us, and we are verifying their documents,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cThe evacuation will be in a matter of days, likely after February 2,\u201d she said. Apple will close its stores in China \u201cdue to recent public health and prevention concerns\u201d until 9 February, a statement on the company\u2019s Chinese website says. Agence France-Presse has details on China\u2019s operation to fly its citizens back home to Hubei from overseas. A Xiamen Air charter flight from Bangkok touched down late on Friday in Wuhan, where the infection originated, possibly in a market that sold wild animals. Health authorities in full-body, white protective gear stood by the cabin door as the plane\u2019s 73 passengers disembarked, smiling through face masks and waving to news photographers. A second Xiamen flight landed soon afterwards, carrying Hubei residents from Kota Kinabalu, a popular coastal tourist destination in Malaysia. China\u2019s foreign ministry said earlier on Friday that the country would bring Wuhan residents back from overseas \u201cas soon as possible\u201d due to \u201cthe practical difficulties that Chinese citizens from Hubei, especially Wuhan, have faced overseas\u201d. The number of confirmed deaths from China\u2019s coronavirus outbreak has risen to 259, as authorities in hardest-hit Hubei province reported 45 new fatalities. Cases of infection in China now stand at more than 11,790. Both the US and Australia have announced travel bans for anyone coming from mainland China, except for citizens and residents. Citizens travelling from China will be subject to a two-week quarantine. The Trump administration has declared a public health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak. Multiple airlines have also suspended flights to mainland China until 29 March, including Australian airline Qantas, which has cancelled flights to Shanghai and Beijing, and Air New Zealand which has suspended flights to Shanghai. Australia now has 10 reported cases of coronavirus. The UK government is withdrawing staff from embassies across China. Two patients in England, who are members of the same family, have tested positive for coronavirus. They are being treated in Newcastle. India has reported its first case of coronavirus, a student in Kerala who had studied at Wuhan University, while Russia has also reported its first two cases. The plane carrying 83 Britons to the UK from Wuhan in China landed at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire and the evacuees were driven to a facility in Wirral, where they will stay in quarantine for the next 14 days. The UK government has promised to send another plane to evacuate any \u201cfrustrated\u201d Britons who could not get on the first flight. Britain is withdrawing some staff from its embassy and consulates in China due to the coronavirus, the UK government said in a statement on Saturday. \u201cAs of 31 January, some staff and dependants from the British embassy and consulates are being withdrawn from China. Essential staff needed to continue critical work will remain. In the event that the situation deteriorates further, the ability of the British embassy and consulates to provide assistance to British nationals from within China may be limited.\u201d Speaking at a press conference, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison announced that no one travelling from mainland China would be allowed into Australia unless they are Australian citizens or residents. Entry will be denied to anyone who has left or transited through mainland China from 1 February. Morrison also announced that the Australian government had raised the travel advice warning to level four, recommending that no Australian travel to anywhere in mainland China, following the spread of coronavirus beyond Hubei province. Australian citizens returning from China will have to be quarantined for two weeks, said Morrison. Half a million masks will also be provided for those coming off flights from China, while thermometers and special screening arrangements will be set up at airports. In India, 324 Indians evacuated from Wuhan arrived in Delhi this morning and have been taken to two quarantine centres. Six people were held back from taking the flight after they reported high fevers. India has so far reported one cases of coronavirus in the country, a student in Kerala who had studied at Wuhan university. Beijing has criticised the US government\u2019s decision to raise their travel warning advisory on China to the highest level of risk. The Chinese foreign ministry said that the US travel alert levels were not a \u201cgesture of goodwill\u201d. The World Health Organization opposes the introduction of travel restrictions to China. Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for China\u2019s foreign ministry, said on Friday in an online statement: \u201cJust as the WHO recommended against travel restrictions, the United States rushed to go in the opposite way. Certainly it\u2019s not a gesture of goodwill.\u201d Air New Zealand has now suspended all daily flights to Shanghai amid coronavirus outbreak. \u201cOur teams are currently putting in place alternative travel options for customers impacted by the suspension and they will be contacted directly over the coming week,\u201d said Air New Zealand\u2019s chief David Morgan. According to a Reuters report, coronavirus has led to a damaging drop in tourism for beach resorts in Thailand which are hugely popular with Chinese tourists. Reduced travel from China alone could result in 50 billion baht ($1.52 billion) of lost tourism revenue, the Thai Tourism Ministry estimated. In Phuket, which is usually thriving with Chinese tourists who travel over for the new year holiday, the streets were empty. \u201cThe impact is tremendous,\u201d said shop owner 45-year old Ausana Akaradachakul. \u201cOnly a few days after the news broke about the virus, the Chinese tourists were visibly few. I think about 70% of them are gone.\u201d The airline has announced the suspension of mainland China services from 9 February. Here\u2019s the statement: Qantas will suspend its two direct services to mainland China (Sydney-Beijing and Sydney-Shanghai) from 9 February until 29 March 2020. This follows entry restrictions imposed by countries including Singapore and the United States, which impact the movement of crew who work across the Qantas International network. These entry restrictions pose significant logistical challenges for rostering crew to operate mainland China services, leading to the need to temporarily suspend these flights. Images of the first group of Chinese residents to arrive back in Wuhan have emerged. Agence France-Presse reports that China\u2019s virus outbreak has forced the country\u2019s first badminton tournament of the 2020 world tour season to be postponed, organisers said Saturday. The six-day China Masters was due to start on 25 February at Lingshui, in China\u2019s southern Hainan island. But organisers \u201cconsidered all necessary health, safety and logistical risks and... believe it is sensible to postpone the tournament at this time, said a statement from the Badminton World Federation. Several players had already withdrawn from the competition, the BWF added. We\u2019ve got a bit more on Australia\u2019s reaction to the virus, after the Queensland state premier called on the government to stop flights from China. A spokesman for Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, said national security officials would hear from the chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, in Sydney on Saturday. Morrison is then due to give a press conference at 3pm. Here is a quick breakdown of where we are up to: The number of confirmed deaths from China\u2019s coronavirus outbreak has risen to 259, as authorities in hardest-hit Hubei province reported 45 new fatalities. Cases of infection in China now stand at more than 11,790. The Trump administration has declared a public health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak. It has also announced it will temporarily bar entry to the US for people travelling from China unless they are Americans or immediately related to US citizens. Two patients in England, who are members of the same family, have tested positive for coronavirus. They are being treated in Newcastle. The Foreign Office said it was \u2018aware of frustrations\u2019 of Brits who had wanted to leave Wuhan but proved unable to board the evacuation plane. Michael Gove told Sky News the government would send another plane to Wuhan to evacuate British nationals if needed. Russia has reported its first two cases of coronavirus. Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister Tatiana Golikova told reporters the infected people were Chinese citizens who had been isolated. Australia now has 10 cases. The premier of Queensland has called on the government to stop planes arriving from China. The plane carrying 83 Britons to the UK from Wuhan in China landed at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire and the evacuees were driven to a facility on the Wirral where they will stay in quarantine for the next 14 days. Thailand has recorded its first human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus after a taxi driver was apparently infected by a traveller. The Trump administration has declared a public health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak. It has also announced it will temporarily bar entry to the US for people traveling from China. A plan to evacuate Australians stranded in China is likely to go ahead over the weekend, the AAP news agency is reporting. Agence France-Presse reports that African countries are scrambling to avert an outbreak of the rapidly spreading coronavirus strain, as health officials warn that the poorest countries are ill-equipped to combat the deadly disease. Across the continent, governments have stationed nurses at airports to check for feverish passengers and have suspended Chinese entry visas, while ordinary people grow increasingly nervous. There have been no verified infections in Africa to date, but deep trade links with China and often overstretched healthcare systems are raising concerns about the capacity to respond to an outbreak. More from Annastacia Palaszczuk\u2019s press conference: \u201cThe community needs to be calm. There are only two confirmed cases but the number of cases in Australia is the same as in the United States.\u201d \u201cWhatever action the federal government can take I implore them to take that action.\u201d \u201cWe need to take some immediate short-term measures.\u201d Annastacia Palaszczuk, the Queensland premier, has called for more regular updates from the federal government. \u201cWe do need more clear messaging to reassure Australians.\u201d She also wants a ban on incoming flights from China. \u201cI believe that the recommendations in relation to no more incoming flights until the virus is contained.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t usually agree with Donald Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do agree with the US authorities on this occasion that I think we should take every measure possible to combat this virus.\u201d In Australia, the Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is giving a press conference about the virus. She has urged people not to discriminate against the Chinese community. \u201cDo the right thing and show respect,\u201d she said. She said she had been briefed by the chief health officer and Australia must contain the virus in the same way that the US is. \u201cAll people returning from China need to self-isolate.\u201d Here is more information about the latest case in the Australian state of Victoria: The Australian Associated Press reports that the woman aged in her 20s became ill two days after returning from Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, last Saturday. She was not infectious on her flight back to Victoria and is recovering at home in isolation, as authorities wait for 13 other test results for the respiratory illness. There are reports from the state of Victoria that Australia has confirmed its 10th case of coronavirus. The Associated Press report that Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden has criticized President Donald Trump for reducing US oversight of global health issues before the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cWe have, right now, a crisis with the coronavirus,\u201d said Biden. \u201cThis is no time for Donald Trump\u2019s record of hysteria and xenophobia - hysterical xenophobia - and fearmongering to lead the way instead of science.\u201d Biden said Trump had rolled back progress on global health oversight that occurred when he was vice president from 2009 to 2017. In particular, he cited \u201cdraconian cuts\u201d the White House proposed to the budgets of \u201cthe very agencies that we need to fight this outbreak,\u201d including the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). A spokesman for Trump\u2019s re-election campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Global Times, China\u2019s Communist party-controlled tabloid, has tweeted out a video that purports to show drones telling people who are out in public without a face mask to go home and wash their hands. It is quite the dystopian vision. There has been a lot of misinformation about the coronavirus circulating online. We have debunked a lot of it here. The latest unfounded rumour is that the 2020 Tokyo Olympics have been called off as a result of the virus, according to Japanese news site Mainichi. The next round of talks on a global biodiversity treaty due to be held in the Chinese city of Kunming on 24 February will be moved to Rome as a result of a coronavirus outbreak, the United Nations announced. The UN\u2019s Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity said it had reached the decision after consultations with the Chinese government. Kunming is still set to host the main round of global biodiversity talks in October this year. China\u2019s National Health Commission has said in its daily update that number of infections has risen by 2,102 to 11,791. Most British papers lead today on the nation leaving the European Union, but the Daily Mail has chosen to splash on coronavirus: The Associated Press has spoken to some of the 200 Americans evacuated from Wuhan, one of whom said they were \u201cvery relieved\u2019 to be quarantined at a military base in Southern California for two weeks. \u201cAll of us really want to stay here and make sure were all medically clear and the public safe\u201d, said Matthew L. McCoy, a theme park designer who lives in China. So far there\u2019s been no sign of illness among the group. \u201cWe understand this action may seem drastic. We would rather be remembered for overreacting than underreacting,\u201d said Dr Nancy Messonnier of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. My colleague Nicola Slawson has spoken to an English teacher who has lived in Wuhan for the last four years. He described his long journey back to the UK after being evacuated on Friday. Speaking from his room at Arrowe Park Hospital, Wirral, where he and 82 other Britons will be quarantined for two weeks in NHS staff accommodation, he said he was \u201cvery tired\u201d after a 30 hour journey but grateful to have been evacuated. The 32-year-old man, who asked not to be named, described the facilities where he was staying: \u201cIt\u2019s like being in a crap hotel or a student halls of residence. I haven\u2019t actually asked but I suspect I\u2019m not really supposed to come out here in the next 14 days. It\u2019s alright though. It will be OK.\u201d Here is the full story: Reuters is reporting that the northern Chinese city of Tianjin has ordered schools and non-essential companies to remain closed until further notice to curb the spread of the coronavirus that has already infected thousands in the country, a local government-run newspaper said. Tianjin Daily, said the date when work and school could resume would be announced at a later stage, citing a local government committee responsible for controlling the epidemic. Tianjin, which has a population of around 15 million and borders capital Beijing, had 32 confirmed cases of coronavirus as of 10pm local time on 31 January. Hello and welcome to our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. Here is a quick summary of where we are up to: The number of confirmed deaths from China\u2019s coronavirus outbreak has risen to 258, as authorities in hardest-hit Hubei province reported 45 new fatalities.

      "bodyText": "Life appeared to continue as usual at the University of York yesterday, with students scurrying to the library, supermarket and bar, despite the campus having become the focal point of the unfolding coronavirus outbreak in the UK. Public Health England confirmed that a student at the university and a relative of theirs had tested positive for the UK\u2019s first cases of the virus. Joseph, a second-year English student, said he had no serious concerns after hearing the news: \u201cI think the university\u2019s done a really good job of helping people stay calm and giving out the official advice. None of my friends are that concerned either \u2013 they\u2019ve even been making jokes, including some puns about corona being a beer. So no, I\u2019m not worried: it seems to have been contained.\u201d Others felt more apprehensive. \u201cEveryone feels a bit unsettled,\u201d said law student Daniel Williams. \u201cIn my house group chat, everyone is legitimately concerned. I live with a few European citizens who aren\u2019t registered with a GP and they are seriously thinking about whether they should go to lectures.\u201d He added that another student with a weakened immune system went straight home because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to take the risk\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Dr Zhou* had just arrived at Gatwick airport last week when a British couple physically recoiled as she entered a lift. \u201cThe woman looked at me, quickly turned to her husband and told him \u2018they should wear their masks\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cThey assumed I didn\u2019t understand English, that I was \u2018fresh off the boat\u2019 and that I probably had coronavirus.\u201d Humiliated, Zhou \u2013 a scientist who was travelling from London to Slovenia \u2013 stood in uncomfortable silence.</p> <p>\u201cI give people the benefit of doubt because they\u2019re scared, but why can\u2019t they give me the benefit of doubt? Fear is no reason to be racist. Statistically, as a British citizen who hasn\u2019t been to China in two years, I have the same risk level as a white person.\u201d</p> <p>Coronavirus has spread to at least 16 countries including Japan, Thailand, Australia, France, the US and the UK. Hostility and racism directed by some people towards east Asians seems to be spreading faster still. </p> <p>Jess Kerntiff, who works in PR, said she was stunned when a friend sent her a viral Instagram post of \u201cbat soup\u201d falsely purporting to be a Chinese dish while making bogus claims that Chinese culture is to blame for coronavirus. \u201cShe kept asking me if I\u2019d eaten it, what was the weirdest thing I\u2019d eaten and so on. When I said, \u2018I don\u2019t know, crab or something\u2019, she kept asking me what weird things people eat in Malaysia, which is where my family are from.\u201d</p> <p>Kerntiff said she couldn\u2019t quite articulate at the time why it was upsetting. \u201cIt bothered me though, she\u2019s a really good friend and I explained to her after a couple of days and then she got it, but posts like that deliberately dehumanise Chinese people. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being paranoid but there doesn\u2019t seem to be much sympathy for people who have lost their lives and are going through this trauma, the narrative is as if it\u2019s deserved. There is no compassion.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The French media have already called it yellow peril \u2013 as if there isn\u2019t a bigger  threat from parents who won\u2019t vaccinate their kids</p> <footer> <cite>British-Chinese woman</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>London\u2019s Chinatown was uncharacteristically quiet last week, with businesses reporting a slump in trade. \u201cThe restaurants are less busy than normal,\u201d confirmed one manager. \u201cYou think, maybe it is the weather and people think it\u2019s too cold and rainy to come out.

      "bodyText": "Dr Zhou* had just arrived at Gatwick airport last week when a British couple physically recoiled as she entered a lift. \u201cThe woman looked at me, quickly turned to her husband and told him \u2018they should wear their masks\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cThey assumed I didn\u2019t understand English, that I was \u2018fresh off the boat\u2019 and that I probably had coronavirus.\u201d Humiliated, Zhou \u2013 a scientist who was travelling from London to Slovenia \u2013 stood in uncomfortable silence. \u201cI give people the benefit of doubt because they\u2019re scared, but why can\u2019t they give me the benefit of doubt? Fear is no reason to be racist. Statistically, as a British citizen who hasn\u2019t been to China in two years, I have the same risk level as a white person.\u201d Coronavirus has spread to at least 16 countries including Japan, Thailand, Australia, France, the US and the UK. Hostility and racism directed by some people towards east Asians seems to be spreading faster still. Jess Kerntiff, who works in PR, said she was stunned when a friend sent her a viral Instagram post of \u201cbat soup\u201d falsely purporting to be a Chinese dish while making bogus claims that Chinese culture is to blame for coronavirus. \u201cShe kept asking me if I\u2019d eaten it, what was the weirdest thing I\u2019d eaten and so on. When I said, \u2018I don\u2019t know, crab or something\u2019, she kept asking me what weird things people eat in Malaysia, which is where my family are from.\u201d Kerntiff said she couldn\u2019t quite articulate at the time why it was upsetting. \u201cIt bothered me though, she\u2019s a really good friend and I explained to her after a couple of days and then she got it, but posts like that deliberately dehumanise Chinese people. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being paranoid but there doesn\u2019t seem to be much sympathy for people who have lost their lives and are going through this trauma, the narrative is as if it\u2019s deserved. There is no compassion.\u201d London\u2019s Chinatown was uncharacteristically quiet last week, with businesses reporting a slump in trade. \u201cThe restaurants are less busy than normal,\u201d confirmed one manager. \u201cYou think, maybe it is the weather and people think it\u2019s too cold and rainy to come out. But maybe it\u2019s because people believe fake news and are scared [of] eating Asian food.\u201d One British-Chinese woman, who didn\u2019t want to give her name, said she felt anxious travelling on public transport. \u201cPeople have openly moved away from me on the train. Fear for me is having half my family in quarantine in Wuhan \u2013 the hysterical fear that many in western countries have is quite insulting to me.\u201d She was in daily contact with relatives in the Hubei province, who reported feeling well. \u201cMy parents here are not as panicked as some of the people I\u2019ve encountered on Twitter and in real life,\u201d she said. \u201cThe virus is being weaponised as a way to be openly racist \u2013 the French media have already called it \u201cyellow peril\u201d \u2013 as if there isn\u2019t a bigger health threat from parents who won\u2019t vaccinate their kids.\u201d The number of Chinese students at UK universities dwarfs those from other countries; in the 2016-17 academic year, there were 95,090 Chinese undergraduates and postgraduates in Britain.

The university said the student is not believed to have come into contact with anyone on campus while they had symptoms. </p> \n<p>Authorities are trying to trace people who had \u201cclose contact\u201d with the pair \u2013 which is defined as spending at least 15 minutes within two metres of the infected person.</p> \n<p>In total, 203 people have been tested for the disease in Britain, and only two results have been positive. The vast majority of infections and all deaths are still inside China, and concentrated in Hubei province. By Saturday, 13,968 cases and 304 deaths had been confirmed, 45 of them overnight in Hubei province. But the rapid spread of the virus beyond Chinese borders has raised fears that other countries could face large-scale outbreaks, and many governments are taking increasingly strong measures to prevent an epidemic on their territory.</p> \n<p>On Saturday, Australia followed the US by imposing a ban on entry to most travellers from China. Canberra said citizens, residents or relatives would still be allowed in. Countries including Uzbekistan and Vietnam cancelled flights from China altogether.</p> \n<p>Dozens of commercial carriers have cut back or halted flights to China, and several hotel chains have said they will allow cancellations by Chinese travellers. Major companies such as Google and Facebook have banned travel to the country, while international retailers such as Starbucks and Apple have shut stores.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5eda1fb38572e0d2c252dd25f6f1f82e9206a1a5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5eda1fb38572e0d2c252dd25f6f1f82e9206a1a5/0_133_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The convoy transporting British nationals who had arrived from Wuhan to the Wirral on Friday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The convoy transporting British nationals who had arrived from Wuhan to the Wirral on Friday</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cpl Tim Laurence HANDOUT/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In Hong Kong, where there are strong memories of the impact of the 2003 Sars outbreak, thousands of hospital staff went on strike, demanding that authorities close the border.</p> \n<p>Britain has not yet brought in similar bans, but precautions are being increased.

All are currently well.</p> \n<p>A UK-wide public health campaign is to be launched on Sunday urging people to use tissues and wash their hands regularly to help stop the spread of the virus. The message will be in adverts in newspapers and on radio and online forums known to be used by Chinese nationals living here.</p> \n<p>Cases of human-to-human transmission, which has driven the fast rise in infections inside China, have been detected in Germany, Thailand, Taiwan, France, Japan and the US.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe real issue now for the world is what happens outside China,\u201d Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, told the BBC. \u201cWhat we need to look out for now is when does [it] start to spread \u2013 if it spreads \u2013 in the community or between people outside China itself.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus.

      "bodyText": "The growing coronavirus epidemic is isolating China, as other countries, trying to ward off infection or contain their own smaller outbreaks, bar entry to travellers from China, and companies including Apple scale down travel and business there. The UK announced on Saturday it had withdrawn all but essential staff from embassies and consulates in China, as authorities at home dealt with fallout from the first two cases confirmed in Britain \u2013 a student at the University of York and a visiting relative. The university\u2019s vice-chancellor, Charlie Jeffery, said that although he understood the diagnoses would \u201ccause concern and anxiety\u201d, it would not disrupt studies. \u201cWe\u2019re working closely with the lead agency, Public Health England, and other agencies to manage this situation,\u201d he said. The two patients are now under quarantine in Newcastle, and the York hotel room they had been staying in has been disinfected. The university said the student is not believed to have come into contact with anyone on campus while they had symptoms. Authorities are trying to trace people who had \u201cclose contact\u201d with the pair \u2013 which is defined as spending at least 15 minutes within two metres of the infected person. In total, 203 people have been tested for the disease in Britain, and only two results have been positive. The vast majority of infections and all deaths are still inside China, and concentrated in Hubei province. By Saturday, 13,968 cases and 304 deaths had been confirmed, 45 of them overnight in Hubei province. But the rapid spread of the virus beyond Chinese borders has raised fears that other countries could face large-scale outbreaks, and many governments are taking increasingly strong measures to prevent an epidemic on their territory. On Saturday, Australia followed the US by imposing a ban on entry to most travellers from China. Canberra said citizens, residents or relatives would still be allowed in. Countries including Uzbekistan and Vietnam cancelled flights from China altogether. Dozens of commercial carriers have cut back or halted flights to China, and several hotel chains have said they will allow cancellations by Chinese travellers. Major companies such as Google and Facebook have banned travel to the country, while international retailers such as Starbucks and Apple have shut stores. In Hong Kong, where there are strong memories of the impact of the 2003 Sars outbreak, thousands of hospital staff went on strike, demanding that authorities close the border. Britain has not yet brought in similar bans, but precautions are being increased. Eighty-three British nationals flown out of Wuhan on Friday spent their second night of two weeks in quarantine at Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral yesterday. The University of Derby also asked a \u201cvery small number\u201d of students who left Wuhan before restrictions were imposed to self-isolate for 14 days. All are currently well. A UK-wide public health campaign is to be launched on Sunday urging people to use tissues and wash their hands regularly to help stop the spread of the virus. The message will be in adverts in newspapers and on radio and online forums known to be used by Chinese nationals living here. Cases of human-to-human transmission, which has driven the fast rise in infections inside China, have been detected in Germany, Thailand, Taiwan, France, Japan and the US. \u201cThe real issue now for the world is what happens outside China,\u201d Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, told the BBC. \u201cWhat we need to look out for now is when does [it] start to spread \u2013 if it spreads \u2013 in the community or between people outside China itself. And that will be the signal that actually other countries may suffer from the same sorts of issues we see in China.\u201d He said the severity of any wider outbreak could lie anywhere between something like seasonal winter flu and \u201csomething akin to what we are seeing in China at the moment\u201d. \u201cThe uncertainty at the moment means we cannot be sure which pathway this epidemic is going to take,\u201d Farrar added. Modelling published in the Lancet suggested more than 75,000 people could have been infected in Wuhan a week ago, about 50 times higher than the official worldwide total of cases at the time. If the transmissibility of the disease was \u201csimilar everywhere\u201d, the paper said, epidemics could already be \u201cgrowing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about one to two weeks\u201d.Inside China, quarantine rules that have put around 50 million people on lockdown are being tightened in some places. Huanggang, the second-worst-affected city, with over 700 infections and 14 deaths, has effectively confined almost everyone to their homes. One person from each family will be allowed out to get food every two days, although there are exceptions for medical workers, sick people seeking treatment, and those staffing supermarkets and hospitals. Elsewhere, local governments have pushed back the end of the lunar new year break; schools and universities will not resume classes this week as planned, and in some places factories have been told to delay restarting work. People have been urged to delay weddings, particularly the large numbers planned for today, 2 February \u2013 a popular date because, written as a sequence of numbers, it is a palindrome: \u201c02 02 2020\u201d. Even funerals are under pressure, with families asked to keep mourning \u201csimple and expeditious\u201d to avoid gatherings. Bodies of coronavirus victims are to be cremated as soon as possible.",
