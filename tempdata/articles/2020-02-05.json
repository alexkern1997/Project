      "bodyText": "A plane carrying almost 200 evacuees from the centre of the coronavirus outbreak in China has touched down in Auckland. Just before 7am this morning 190 passengers from New Zealand, Australia, Britain and several Pacific nations boarded the flight, as well as two paramedics, a doctor and staff from the New Zealand ministry of foreign affairs and the ministry of health. It landed in Auckland shortly after 6pm. No passengers on the plane were reported to be sick or showing any symptoms of the virus but one passenger was barred from boarding by Chinese authorities after pre-flight health screenings. The ministry of foreign affairs said there were 54 New Zealand citizens, 44 New Zealand permanent residents on Chinese passports, 23 Australian citizens and 12 Australian permanent residents on Chinese passports, eight Britons, 17 people from Timor Leste, 17 from Papua New Guinea, five Samoans, four Tongans, two Fijians, and four of other nationalities. Some 60 passengers who had registered for flight did not arrive in time to catch it, the ministry said, and others had taken themselves off the flight manifest earlier in the day. After landing, the New Zealanders and all other nationalities besides Australians will be transferred to Whangaparaoa air base north of Auckland where they will be held in isolation for two weeks. Wi-fi would be provided to allow some people to work remotely, while tutors would be provided for school-age children because it was important to establish a \u201csense of normality\u201d as quickly as possible, the ministry said. Ministry of foreign affairs and ministry of health staff onboard the evacuation flight will also go into quarantine. The Australian passengers will be transferred directly to a plane bound for Christmas Island, a journey of 7,500km taking at least nine hours, where they will be quarantined. New Zealand foreign minister Winston Peters said New Zealand was happy to help its neighbour out, but did not want to divert the Auckland-bound flight via Christmas Island. \u201cIn every other respect it\u2019s been a total picture of cooperation.\u201d So far no cases of coronavirus have been reported in New Zealand though a number of people have been held in isolation and tested for it. New Zealand followed the United States, Australia, and eight other countries in completely barring foreign travellers from China, despite the World Health Organisation \u2013 and Chinese officials \u2013 decrying such restrictions. \u201cWe have been advised by health officials that while there are still a range of unknowns in the way the virus is being transmitted, we should take a precautionary approach and temporarily stop travel into New Zealand from mainland China,\u201d Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, told reporters. The travel ban will be in place for 14 days and will be reviewed every 48 hours. The New Zealand Human Right\u2019s Commission say they are aware of rising racism against Chinese people since the outbreak of the virus, although no officials complaints have been made to the watchdog yet. \u201cAnxiety and fear should never be a reason to vilify any group,\u201d the commission said in a Twitter post. \u201cWe caution all New Zealanders \u2013 do not let your fears turn into racism.\u201d",

Above all, it asks how the UN\u2019s international health diplomacy, confronted with a potential pandemic where a timely and accurate flow of information is crucial, should interact with one of the world\u2019s most powerful, and controlling, states. Looming above all else is the fact that China is a country whose trajectory under Xi Jinping has been to become more, not less, authoritarian, marked by mass internment camps for Uighurs, a growing internet crackdown and its harsh response to street protests in Hong Kong. There seems little doubt either that China\u2019s bureaucratic culture of control and secrecy, including the local government\u2019s efforts to clamp down on the information emerging about the disease in the first weeks of the epidemic, contributed to its initial spread in December and the first weeks of January. It is also true that after admitting the scale of the problem, China has shared much information internationally, in line with its commitments, about the nature and spread of the virus, and deployed unprecedented and costly national efforts in a bid to contain the outbreak, even as it has employed what many would see as draconian restrictions. Interposed into the midst of all this has been the WHO \u2013 and Tedros \u2013 a relationship complicated by the fact that China is a major donor to the world health body. The mix of health and international politics has been underlined by the exclusion of Taiwan from discussions even after the coronavirus spread there. The argument about how the WHO has negotiated the complexities boils down to several key questions. The first is whether the organisation should have pushed harder for Beijing to be more forthcoming when evidence of a new form of coronavirus first emerged, but before the scale of the outbreak was fully acknowledged. And whether the head of the UN body should have been so warm in praising the response of a country that unsettles so many for its secrecy and rights violations. In particular, the fraught politics of the WHO declaring the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) has once again come under the spotlight in the same way it did during the Ebola crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Some of those most critical have parsed Xi\u2019s meeting with Tedros \u2013 and Xi\u2019s declared hope that the UN body would assess the \u201cepidemic situation in an objective, just, calm and reasonable way\u201d \u2013 as pressure from Beijing to ensure WHO would refrain from designating the epidemic a global health emergency to protect China\u2019s economy. Although that didn\u2019t happen, the WHO\u2019s advice \u2013 contrary to that of many governments \u2013 is that it still \u201cadvises against the application of any restrictions of international traffic based on the information currently available on this event\u201d. And on this front some are pointing to a startling contradiction: how the UN body has praised the extreme internal travel restrictions in China while criticising other countries for implementing their own travel measures. Sources familiar with the politics at the top of the organisation, and the decision over declaring the outbreak a PHEIC, insist that WHO have had to balance very difficult issues. With China\u2019s well-known history of extreme sensitivity to criticism, the argument goes, a conscious decision was made to prioritise diplomacy that would encourage China to be as open as possible in sharing information with international researchers and health bodies even at the risk of drawing inevitable criticism. \u201cChina was very quick to let the WHO know what was happening on 31 December,\u201d said one close observer. \u201cThe organisation\u2019s goal was to get as much information about what was happening in China to inform what the rest of the world would need to do. \u201cIt\u2019s clear there were two options: to keep pressing behind the scenes, or to go public and say at a press conference we didn\u2019t get such and such at this time and for the Chinese to lose face and slam the door.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was among other Democrats who declined altogether to attend. Fred Guttenberg,<strong> </strong>the father of a girl who was killed in the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, was escorted out of the House chamber after he voiced protest to Trump\u2019s pledge to protect about gun rights.

The Senate will hold its final vote on the two articles of impeachment against Trump this afternoon US time.

In fact, in 2019 it was named as one of Europe\u2019s top 10 carbon emitters. The ads claim that Ryanair has the \u201clowest carbon emissions of any major airline\u201d based on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions per passenger per kilometre flown. But it used figures dating back to 2011, which the ad watchdog said was \u201cof little value as substantiation for a comparison made in 2019\u201d.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Overdose lifesaver \u2013 </strong>A pilot scheme in the north-east of England is to bring to the streets a life-saving medication that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/05/reduce-uk-drug-deaths-by-funding-treatment-services-experts-urge\">reverses the effects of an overdose</a>. Under the pilot, a team of people with lived experience of drug issues teach opioid users <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/05/i-have-a-purpose-ex-addicts-working-to-save-lives-redcar-naloxone-drugs\">how to administer the medication naloxone</a>, which reverses the effects of overdose and costs \u00a318 per kit. But the drug and alcohol charity Addaction says drug-related deaths will not fall from record levels unless the government invests in treatment services. The most recent official figures show that 4,359 deaths from drug poisoning were recorded in England and Wales in 2018, the highest number since records began in 1993, with around two-thirds attributed to misuse.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Jackass in a suit \u2013 </strong>The call of the jackass penguin, which sounds like a donkey in distress, shares traits of human languages, scientists have found. More frequently used sounds within its call tend to be shorter, while the longer the call, the shorter the sounds within it. It is the first time this pattern has been shown outside primates. Prof Stuart Semple of the University of Roehampton said the new study adds weight to the idea that animals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/05/jackass-penguin-call-shares-traits-of-human-speech-scientists-say\">tend to convey information in the most efficient way</a>. Such an approach is known as \u201ccompression\u201d and is also seen in systems such as morse code where the most commonly used letters have the simplest and shortest sounds \u2013 either a dot or a dash.</p> \n<h2>Today in Focus podcast: Varadkar on the ropes?</h2> \n<p>Leo Varadkar rose to the top of Irish politics without winning an election as leader of Fine Gael.

I\u2019m Warren Murray presenting the right stories at the right time. Nancy Pelosi, the US House speaker, has dramatically torn up her copy of Donald Trump\u2019s speech after the president delivered his State of the Union address to a joint sitting of Congress. Earlier, as Trump came up to the podium, Pelosi had offered him a handshake that the president failed to accept. An emboldened Trump bragged in his address about the \u201cgreat American comeback\u201d and an economy with unemployment at 3.5% \u2013 the lowest in more than 50 years. Democrats begged to differ, with Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib among those staging a walkout of the House chamber during the speech. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was among other Democrats who declined altogether to attend. Fred Guttenberg, the father of a girl who was killed in the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, was escorted out of the House chamber after he voiced protest to Trump\u2019s pledge to protect about gun rights. Trump used the occasion to award the controversial rightwing radio host Rush Limbaugh with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, asking Melania Trump to bestow it while Democrats in the chamber said \u201cNo!\u201d. After being criticised by the White House for tearing up the speech, Pelosi offered a great American comeback of her own \u2013 quipping that it had been the \u201ccourteous thing to do considering the alternative\u201d. The Senate will hold its final vote on the two articles of impeachment against Trump this afternoon US time. Trump is virtually guaranteed to be acquitted by the Republican-controlled chamber. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; Latest figures show 490 people have died in mainland China from coronavirus with 24,292 confirmed cases there. All British nationals have been advised to leave China if they can. Ten people on a cruise ship being held off Yokohama have tested positive, according to Japan, with others showing symptoms \u2013 hundreds more of the 3,700 passengers and crew on the Diamond Princess were being tested. &gt; A survey of local authorities has revealed 97% will put council tax up again in April to cope with a growing financial crisis. The same proportion will raise charges for services from parking to social care. One in 10 said they were in danger of being unable to meet their legal obligation to deliver statutory services. &gt; Twitter is to add warning labels to, or remove, \u201cdeepfakes\u201d \u2013 doctored photos, audio clips and videos that are designed to mislead, like the notorious slow-motion footage of a speech by Nancy Pelosi. Those deemed harmful will be removed, it says. &gt; Big UK firms have been accused of dragging their feet on diversity targets. Only 53 FTSE 100 firms have at least one director from an ethnic minority, a small increase from the 49 that met the target in 2017 when it was first assessed. &gt; A police bodyguard has been suspended, Scotland Yard has said, amid reports David Cameron\u2019s passport and a loaded gun were found in the toilets of a British Airways flight from New York to Heathrow. An investigation was under way, the Met said. * * * Lie in the sky \u2013 Ryanair has been accused of greenwashing over a now-banned advert claiming it has the lowest carbon emissions of Europe\u2019s major airlines. In fact, in 2019 it was named as one of Europe\u2019s top 10 carbon emitters. The ads claim that Ryanair has the \u201clowest carbon emissions of any major airline\u201d based on CO2 emissions per passenger per kilometre flown. But it used figures dating back to 2011, which the ad watchdog said was \u201cof little value as substantiation for a comparison made in 2019\u201d. * * * Overdose lifesaver \u2013 A pilot scheme in the north-east of England is to bring to the streets a life-saving medication that reverses the effects of an overdose. Under the pilot, a team of people with lived experience of drug issues teach opioid users how to administer the medication naloxone, which reverses the effects of overdose and costs \u00a318 per kit. But the drug and alcohol charity Addaction says drug-related deaths will not fall from record levels unless the government invests in treatment services. The most recent official figures show that 4,359 deaths from drug poisoning were recorded in England and Wales in 2018, the highest number since records began in 1993, with around two-thirds attributed to misuse. * * * Jackass in a suit \u2013 The call of the jackass penguin, which sounds like a donkey in distress, shares traits of human languages, scientists have found. More frequently used sounds within its call tend to be shorter, while the longer the call, the shorter the sounds within it. It is the first time this pattern has been shown outside primates. Prof Stuart Semple of the University of Roehampton said the new study adds weight to the idea that animals tend to convey information in the most efficient way. Such an approach is known as \u201ccompression\u201d and is also seen in systems such as morse code where the most commonly used letters have the simplest and shortest sounds \u2013 either a dot or a dash. Today in Focus podcast: Varadkar on the ropes? Leo Varadkar rose to the top of Irish politics without winning an election as leader of Fine Gael. Now he faces voters at a time when many appear to be in the mood for change. Rory Carroll joins the taoiseach on the campaign trail and looks at what the election means for Ireland. Plus: Gaby Hinsliff on the war between Downing Street and the political journalists who cover it. Lunchtime read: Ending a pregnancy because of no paid leave \u201cDespite my job at a prestigious college and my husband\u2019s job at a grocery store, neither of us would get paid parental leave. So we made a difficult choice \u2026\u201d Charlotte XC Sullivan tells her story of a bitter decision as part of the Guardian US series Feminist Economics. \u201cThe realisation that motherhood, in America, is not really a right but a privilege triggered a tectonic shift in my perspective that I am still struggling to understand.\u201d Sport Barcelona have been plunged into crisis after the captain Lionel Messi publicly called out the sporting director Eric Abidal, challenging him to name names and accusing him of tarnishing the players\u2019 reputation. An own goal from Shrewsbury\u2019s Ro-Shaun Williams gave Liverpool\u2019s youngsters a 1-0 win at Anfield that sent them through to the fifth round of the FA Cup. Newcastle were 2-0 up against Oxford but were pegged back to 2-2 in the 90th minute before their French winger Allan Saint-Maximin made it 3-2 to set up a tie at West Brom, while Wayne Rooney faces a fifth-round reunion with Manchester United after Derby overcame Northampton 4-2. Eddie Jones has again stirred the Six Nations pre\u2011match broth by calling Scotland a \u201cniggly\u201d team who \u201cgoad\u201d opponents into losing their cool. Wales are pondering their midfield options ahead of Saturday\u2019s game against a confident Ireland, with Nick Tompkins a contender to start and Owen Watkin available again after injury. Israel Folau has admitted he is grateful for the opportunity to resurrect his career with Catalans Dragons as Super League clubs prepare for an explosive discussion on Wednesday regarding his controversial return to rugby league. Quinton de Kock scored a century and Temba Bavuma 98 as South Africa eased to a seven-wicket victory over England in the first ODI. The Premier League will resist moves to ban clubs from having their shirts sponsored by betting companies as part of the government\u2019s promised review of gambling legislation. And Margaret Court says it is \u201cvery sad\u201d the way Tennis Australia has treated her, claiming the peak body has discriminated against her because of her views on same-sex marriage. Business United Airlines and American Airlines have suspended all flights in and out of Hong Kong as businesses continue to be impacted by the spread of coronavirus. Hyundai, the carmaker, suspended production in its factories in South Korea because it is running out of parts it receives from China. On Asian markets, stocks rose for a second day in a row helped by a healthy rise on Wall Street where Tesla shares soared 40% on predictions the company could soon be worth $1.3tn. The FTSE100 is poised for a 0.4% drop this morning. The pound is on $1.302 and \u20ac1.179. The papers The Express is in a state of \u201cOutrage over free TV licence betrayal\u201d as pensioners are offered an instalment scheme instead of a freebie. The i reports that \u201cLicence fee dodgers will be let off\u201d \u2013 the government is launching a consultation on decriminalisation.

Big thank yous all round as usual to Mike Bowers, Sarah Martin, Katharine Murphy and Paul Karp, as well as the rest of the Guardian brainstrust for their help in all things federal politics/keep Amy\u2019s fingers making sense. We will be back early tomorrow morning and we hope to see you \u2013 I truly enjoy your company and your comments (even the ones who disagree with me) and you know you can keep the conversation going on twitter or instagram if you feel the need. Thank you again for today. We couldn\u2019t do it without you. And please \u2013 take care of you. Constitutional expert Anne Twomey who has questioned the constitutionality of the sports grants funding, has also previously questioned the constitutionality of \u2018Stronger Communities\u2019 grants (which is what the Cronulla Sailing Club was awarded its BBQ through, in the post with Scott Morrison\u2019s PA) From AAP: Labor has failed to force the Morrison government to establish a national integrity commission before reviving a union-busting bill in the Senate. The opposition also wanted the recommendations of the banking and aged care royal commissions implemented before the government\u2019s \u201censuring integrity\u201d laws are debated. The three lofty conditions were designed to ward off a vote on the legislation, which would make it easier to deregister unions and ban officials. The Morrison government suffered a humiliating defeat last year when One Nation made the shock decision to shoot the bill down in the Senate in December. But Labor frontbencher Katy Gallagher\u2019s motion was voted down 36 votes to 31 on Wednesday, with minor parties One Nation and Centre Alliance opposed. Labor\u2019s motion would have erected a parliamentary roadblock until: * legislation to establish a national integrity commission receives royal assent * all recommendations from the banking royal commission are legislated * the interim recommendations of the aged care royal commission are legislated. Tasmanian independent Jacqui Lambie, who looms as the crucial senator on the union bill, abstained from the vote. The government has flagged it will have another crack at trying to pass the legislation, arguing the reforms would clamp down on unions repeatedly breaking the law This is being handed down next Tuesday Say it with me: Police debunked the arsonist claim Fire authorities repeatedly said their window to carryout hazard reduction burns was shortened by warmer seasons Just because something is eligible, doesn\u2019t mean it is all OK Oh this is going swimmingly well Thank you, but your application was extremely, extremely well written. And its not me who gives you money, it\u2019s ScoMo. So vote Liberal, otherwise I won\u2019t have a job!\u201d That\u2019s the whole quote from Scott Morrison\u2019s personal assistant, who is announced as the person who helped the Cronulla Sailing Club with its successful application in the grant connect round * *Not Bridget McKenzie\u2019s sport grants program The Senate is whipping through the motions for documents: Mehreen Faruqi\u2019s motion to order the release of Bridget McKenzie\u2019s emails relating to her $156k hobby report into recreational shooting just passed: This also passed: This is one way to paint the town red: Mike Bowers was in the chamber for question time. Here is some of what he saw: Malcolm Roberts is once again displaying his complete inability to understand the difference between the weather and the climate in the Senate. Labor has just won a vote in the Senate (37 votes to 33) to set up an inquiry into lessons to be learned from the bushfire season. The full terms are: Senator Watt: To move\u2014That the following matter be referred to the Finance and Public Administration References Committee for inquiry and report by the last sitting day in 2021: Lessons to be learned in relation to the preparation and planning for, response to and recovery efforts following the 2019-20 Australian bushfire season, with particular reference to: (a) advice provided to the federal government, prior to the bushfires, about the level of bushfire risk this fire season, how and why those risks differed from historical norms, and measures that should be taken to reduce that risk in the future; (b) the respective roles and responsibilities of different levels of government, and agencies within government, in relation to bushfire planning, mitigation, response, and recovery; (c) the federal government\u2019s response to recommendations from previous bushfire royal commissions and inquiries; (d) the adequacy of the federal government\u2019s existing measures and policies to reduce future bushfire risk, including in relation to assessing, mitigating and adapting to expected climate change impacts, land use planning and management, hazard reduction, Indigenous fire practices, support for firefighters and other disaster mitigation measures; (e) best practice funding models and policy measures to reduce future bushfire risk, both within Australia and internationally; (f) existing structures, measures and policies implemented by the Federal Government, charities and others to assist communities to recover from the 2019-20 bushfires, including the performance of the National Bushfire Recovery Agency; (g) the role and process of advising government and the federal parliament of scientific advice; (h) an examination of the physical and mental health impacts of bushfires on the population, and the federal government\u2019s response to those impacts; and (i) any related matters. From AAP: A powerful parliamentary committee will not consider whether Energy Minister Angus Taylor misled parliament over his use of a fake document to criticise Sydney\u2019s mayor. Manager of opposition business Tony Burke asked Speaker Tony Smith last December to look at whether Mr Taylor had misled parliament and should be referred to the privileges committee. If found to have misled parliament it would constitute being in contempt of parliament. Mr Burke had pointed to six statements Mr Taylor made to parliament, where he said his office had used travel figures downloaded from the City of Sydney\u2019s website. The figures used by Mr Taylor to attack Clover Moore cited travel spending of more than $15 million, when the council had spent about $6000. Slapping down the referral to the privileges committee, Mr Smith said there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to show Mr Taylor had misled parliament. \u201cI understand this matter is surrounded by differing views,\u201d he told parliament. \u201cHowever, the matter of misleading the House is a very serious one and, rightly, there should be prima facie evidence that the House has been misled, and that the misleading has been deliberate.\u201d A NSW police investigation into the fake travel figures has been referred to the Australian Federal Police. Before I run screaming from the room, here is what the police said about those arson figures in January: From the police: Victoria police say there is no evidence any of the devastating bushfires in the state were caused by arson, contrary to the spread of global disinformation exaggerating arsonist arrests during the current crisis. A misleading figure suggesting 183 arsonists have been arrested \u201csince the start of the bushfire season\u201d spread across the globe on Wednesday, after initial reports in News Corp were picked up by Donald Trump Jr, US far-right websites and popular alt-right personalities. The figure included statistics from some states covering the entirety of 2019, rather than just the current bushfire season, which began in September. Peter Dutton continues: Obviously, as we\u2019ve all pointed out, we\u2019re experiencing hotter weather, longer summers, but did the bushfires start in some of these regions because of climate change? No. It started because somebody lit a match. There are 250 people as I understand it or more that have been charged with arson. That\u2019s not climate change. Pulled up by Patricia Karvelas that the most common start to the fires were lightning strikes, not arson, Dutton says: Nobody\u2019s disputing that. There\u2019s been lightning strikes for as long as there have been bushfires in this country. I\u2019m happy to accept the involvement of climate change but your point was about the views in our party room. I think the views in our party room say that we want action on climate change. Yes, we\u2019ve got that climate change action now happening. And we\u2019re responding to it. Equally let\u2019s be honest about the role that the fuel load played in some of these forests. I just think it\u2019s, I think it\u2019s completely disingenuous if people aren\u2019t recognising the different elements. There\u2019s three elements, including people who have started fires in significant numbers. Some fires that have been put out and then restarted by people. I think all that\u2019s happening in our party room is that people are saying we want recognition of those three elements so that we don\u2019t have the same intensity of the bushfires next season, but because the work of our firefighters, of people in my own department, and many other people across the commonwealth including scores of volunteers, we should pay tribute to them because I think thousands of more homes would have been lost. Hundreds more lives would have been lost and I think the response has been quite remarkable from every element of our society. I think we should be very proud of the way in which we\u2019ve responded as a society to deal with the bushfires and to respond in the aftermath. Peter Dutton on the \u2018non-existent\u2019 debate on climate change within the Coalition party room. Please make sure your eyes remain in your head and your jaw stays within catching distance: Look, I\u2019ve been following this debate for a long time and I\u2019ve been in parliament for 18 years. I don\u2019t see huge points of difference in our party room. I think the way in which the PM went through all of that which we\u2019re doing, the targets we\u2019re exceeding, the uptake of renewable energy, our investment in to new technologies, when you look at what he had to say the other day, I think that is absolutely reflective of the view that\u2019s in the party room. I think the point that is made frankly by some which maybe it\u2019s a matter of interpretation or ways in which people want to massage this according to their own interpretation, I think people in our party room are saying we want action on climate change but in relation to the bushfires we absolutely believe that a large number of the bushfires were more intense because of the fact there hadn\u2019t been back-burning. Peter Dutton is apparently now #teamsourdough Here he is on Michael McCormack: I trust Michael McCormack\u2019s judgement completely. I\u2019ve got to say. I watch him in Cabinet in the NSC [national security committee] and leadership group and he has a very sound common sense decency about him. Patricia Karvelas asks Peter Dutton about David Littleproud\u2019s comments on 7.30 last night. As a reminder, here they are from Paul Karp\u2019s report: Asked if it was right for the former sports minister to hand grants out according to a spreadsheet colour-coded by the party holding the electorate in which it was located, Littleproud replied: \u201cWell, obviously I don\u2019t think that necessarily getting as partisan as that is the best way to do it.\u201d Dutton claims that Littleproud, who said the comments directly in his own words, in response to a question, which he answered, using his own mouth, was \u201cmisrepresented\u201d. I didn\u2019t see those comments from him. I was in a conversation with him this morning where it was quite clear he had been misrepresented in what he said. But the general point is that recommendations were made in relation to sporting grants, all of the projects, those that were awarded and those that were recommended but not awarded are all worthy projects. Peter Dutton is talking about the border force response to coronavirus on the ABC. It includes this exchange between himself and Patricia Karvelas: PK: China says it wasn\u2019t given enough warning about the travel ban. Do you know when they were notified of it? Dutton: Obviously it\u2019s on DFAT\u2019s side of the ledger. We\u2019ve been very positive about the way in which China is engaged with the foreign affairs department. But our staff in China and the ambassador there. We\u2019ve had very productive engagement. All of us are reacting very quickly to changing circumstances, the health advice changes. We need to be malleable in terms of the way in which we respond as well. There are decisions we\u2019ll make which are in our country\u2019s best interest but we\u2019ll have a very short lead time. We gave notice to the Chinese. We worked with them very closely around the uplift of these people and in particular in terms of the announcements that we make otherwise. It\u2019s important to point out that [Queensland] Premier [Annastacia] Palaszczuk, having heard the recommendation from the expert medical committee, where her chief medical officer in Queensland was part of the discussion, knew that recommendation was coming to the PM and went out there gratuitously, calling for us to stop incoming flights from China, knowing frankly that was probably the decision we were going to make. So we need to move quickly, particularly when there\u2019s been that sort of breach, pretty agregious breach of the committee\u2019s work and Premier Palaszczuk still hasn\u2019t apologised for that. PK: [Are you alleging] Queensland premier gaming the system, using confidential information to try and get political capital out of it? Dutton: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any allegation. It\u2019s what happened. That\u2019s exactly what happened. I think the premier of Queensland has got a lot of explaining to do, to be honest. All of these factors will lead into those decisions. Just for context - the Queensland election is in October. Paul Karp has the terms of reference for that inquiry: That a select committee, to be known as the Select Committee on Administration of Sports Grants, be established to inquire into and report on the administration and award of funding under the Community Sport Infrastructure Grant Program, with particular reference to: (a) program design and guidelines; (b) requirements placed on applicants for funding; (c) management and assessment processes; (d) adherence to published assessment processes and program criteria; (e) the role of the offices of the Minister, the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, and any external parties, in determining which grants would be awarded and who would announce the successful grants; and (f) any related programs or matters. (2) That the committee present its final report on or before Tuesday 24 March 2020. (3) That the committee consist of 5 senators, as follows: (a) 2 nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate; (b) 2 nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate; and (c) 1 nominated by the Leader of the Australian Greens. The Labor [and Greens] motion to establish a Senate inquiry into the sport grant affair has passed the Senate \u2013 and in the end, the opposition did not need the crossbench. It seems like not even the government senators (of which Bridget McKenzie leads the Nationals in that chamber) opposed it. Joe Hockey will be the 7.30 guest tonight. I assume he will be wearing a shirt (see his instagram if you need the context) For those who want to see all the MPI, you can watch parliament live, here. Anthony Albanese has the matter of public importance today. It\u2019s on \u2018the failure of the government to provide leadership\u2019. Albanese: Everyone knows that this has been a summer of disaster. For the prime minister and this government though, it has been a summer of complacency. It has been one whereby their arrogance and their hubris has been on full display before the Australian people. One in which the prime minister refuses to ever admit that he made a mistake. One in which facts are twisted to suit the prime minister\u2019s own political position. One in which he has been exposed as an ad-man without a plan. On the matter of deliberately misleading the house, Tony Smith says there is not a prima facie case that he did. Therefore, it will not be referred to the privileges committee. Tony Smith is dealing with the issue Tony Burke raised in the last sitting year of whether or not Angus Taylor deliberately misled the House. There is one last question on the new veterans commission and the first question time of the year is done. Here is where Scott Morrison says \u201chazard reduction is important, if not more important, than emissions reduction when it comes to protecting people from fire and hotter, drier, longer summers in the future\u201d. But given the window to complete hazard reduction burns is rapidly shortening because of those \u201chotter, drier, longer\u201d summers \u2013 when are we supposed to do the hazard reduction burns safely? And that\u2019s a point which has been raised by the current fire chiefs Morrison says he listens to, not just the former fire chiefs. Exactly And it\u2019s back: Matt Canavan has been allowed to speak in the Senate: We are at the swap chamber sides of the motion death gurgle. Richard Marles manages to get out \u201ccorrupt sports rorts\u201d (which he repeats) before he is shut down (he doesn\u2019t care, he said what he wanted). While the MPs are moving around the motion of not passing motions, the new Greens leader, Adam Bandt, has taken the time to tweet and delete: From AAP: A man has been arrested, the bomb squad are attending the scene and multiple busy streets in Melbourne\u2019s CBD have been locked down. Police shut down the Flinders and William streets intersection on Wednesday afternoon following the arrest. The closed-off area was expanded to include parts of King, William, Market and Queensbridge streets. Trams are being delayed because of the arrest, but trains have resumed after initially being told to stop. Scott Morrison, who has repeatedly said he won\u2019t be told how to govern by the people on Twitter, is now doing tweet threads (or some poor person in his office is): Christian Porter has moved that Anthony Albanese will no longer be heard, which will win, and then a second Labor MP will attempt to move the motion. Then that will be shut down. The first motion from Anthony Albanese: That this House one, notes the prime minister: a) has repeatedly refused to admit his failings in handling the ongoing bushfire crisis. b) has tried to cover up his failings with a series of false claims. c) is ignoring the damning report of the independent auditor general concerning his corrupt sports rorts scheme, and is instead relying on a secret report by his former chief of staff. d) refuses to give straight answers to simple questions. e) has no plan for this country, only a marketing plan for himself. And two, therefore calls on the prime minister to stop acting in his own interest and start acting in the national interest. While we go through the motions of not having a motion, David Littleproud and Michael McCormack are looking very concerned over some document in their hand. I assume it is not a hardcopy of the blog. There\u2019s an app for that. Leave is not granted. We move on to the next part (which will also not be granted). Anthony Albanese is seeking leave to suspend standing orders to move a motion on the prime minister being terrible (my take of what Albanese is saying). This will fail. I was just about to do a post on this, but now I don\u2019t have to (my boss is always a million steps ahead of me): Sarah Martin, who is in the chamber, tells me a protester stood up to yell \u201cwhat would it take for the prime minister to declare a climate emergency\u201d, which received applause from others in the public gallery. He was removed. The member for Solomon, Luke Gosling, was asked to withdraw an unparliamentary remark. \u201cWhich one,\u201d he quips, before withdrawing. Scott Morrison continues that answer (which shows you how under pressure the government feels on this): So the minister who had the authority to make those decisions made those decisions and as she made very clear in her own statements at the time, she was seeking to make those decisions in the best interests of that program, what it was seeking to do. The point I was making is that the commonwealth government rules and grants rules and guidelines are there to ensure that where a minister may take a view about what she believes is a project with greater merit, there\u2019s a process for setting out how it\u2019s different to the recommendations received. The auditor general report did not find that elected members of this House, it did not find that ministers should not be making decisions about the expenditure of public monies to suit the programs that have been established. The process is to ensure you get good advice, and you can consider that advice, but ministers must make decisions. If those opposite think that ministers should be audit takers from public officials, that\u2019s for them to say. I believe that each member advocates for the needs of their community. And these members advocated for the needs of their community. And the minister made decisions, all eligible projects, and made the final decision as was her authority under the program as it was established. Where there are improvements to be made to that program in the future, they have been accepted. Tony Burke to Scott Morrison: In his previous answer, the prime minister failed to endorse decisions made by his own government to reject projects that were assessed above 90 out of 100 for merit. Were the projects that received money under the Community Sport Infrastructure scheme the ones that had the most merit? Morrison: As the member knows, the program was set up that gave total authority to the minister, to make decisions ... ... I\u2019m only referring to the findings of the auditor general\u2019s report. That report articulated, Mr Speaker, that the authority to make those decisions was by the minister, Mr Speaker, and the auditor general\u2019s report made a very important recommendation, which the government accepts. And that recommendation was recommendation four, which deals with the issue of the application of the commonwealth grant rules and guidelines, Mr Speaker. Now, as the auditor general\u2019s report outlines, which we accept, it says that those guidelines should be applied in the future, by organisations such as Sport Australia. The government has accepted that recommendation and we believe that will assist these ... Burke interjects: The question does not go to future programs. The question goes to decisions made by this government and whether or not the prime minister believes those decisions were made on merit. Tony Smith allows Morrison to go on: The point I was seeking to make, the minister made the decisions about where the projects should be supported, Mr Speaker. Based on her assessment, based or her assessment that what would be the projects of greatest support and merit in the community. She had the authority to do that. Pat Conroy to Scott Morrison: Are the projects that received money under the Community Sport Infrastructure scheme the ones that had the most merit? Morrison: I believe funding community sports infrastructure always has merit. As much merit as most on the frontbench, I would say. Peter Dutton makes an appearance to tell you how safe you are from coronavirus. As safe as the government can make you. He is missing his usual Dutton-ness. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Will the prime minister fund all projects recommended by Sport Australia under the Community Sport Infrastructure scheme, but not funded by this government? Morrison: Funding these important infrastructure projects is and has been a priority of this government. We have \u2013 the program received applications for some $400m, $400m, Mr Speaker. And we allocated $100m. As I said last week, we think this infrastructure is important to local communities. And I did say, at the press club last week, I\u2019ll be working with the treasurer as we prepare for this year\u2019s budget to see how we can provide further support for this important infrastructure that brings communities together. He is asked for relevance, but he has concluded his answer. Sidenote: we are getting a few more mentions of the \u201cMorrison-McCormack government\u201d today, a phrase which was previously only trotted out when Michael McCormack was being asked a question. Seems like this is one of the bones the Liberals are throwing to McCormack, as they try to remind people he exists. Joel Fitzgibbon, who was being touted as the perfect leader of the Nationals yesterday, has a question for Michael McCormack: My question is to the deputy prime minister. Why is it that yesterday when the rest of the parliament was focused only on memorialising bushfire victims, National party ministers and members were more focused on fighting amongst themselves? It is ruled out of order, but not because it would bring McCormack back to the dispatch box. Only the prime minister can answer questions about everything. Other ministers only have to answer on their portfolios. We\u2019ll get through coronavirus, says Greg Hunt. Richard Marles to Scott Morrison: Can the prime minister explain how his entire office found time to attend a marketing seminar run by adman Russel Howcroft on a catastrophic fire day in December? Why did he refuse to meet with the 23 former fire chiefs pleading for the government to take this bushfire season seriously? Morrison: Well, Mr Speaker, the meeting you refer to was not a meeting that I attended. Mr Speaker ... The meeting that you also said was requested and was well publicised, related to former fire chiefs. I engage with current fire chiefs, Mr Speaker. And the current fire chiefs have provided the advice going into this fire season was the same fire advice that was provided by Emergency Management Australia, when I asked Emergency Management Australia to come and brief cabinet well, well before the fire season, Mr Speaker. Last year, to advise us what was necessary and to ensure we were compliant and we were taking action to ensure the commonwealth\u2019s position was in the best position it could be to support state and territory authorities as they moved through this devastating fire season. That included the additional funding that we announced that I referred to earlier in response to the member for Gilmore\u2019s question, to provide the additional support for the aerial bombers. It ensured in November the government undertook a trial program for the compulsory callout of reserves to ensure in the event we would move to that situation it would be done seamlessly. This has been one of the most significant responses of the government to ensure we went from a situation of around 895 defence force personnel on the ground in December, to 6,500 and more on the ground in January. That changed because the government changed the disposition of the commonwealth\u2019s deployment of defence forces on the ground. Not to respond to requests, but to take this to the extreme of the constitutionality, Mr Speaker. The extreme of constitutionality to respond, Mr Speaker, to the situation that emerged that week, where on the Thursday it was the first day the national state of disaster was declared in Victoria. That hadn\u2019t occurred before. That happened on the Thursday. There was the compulsory callout on the Saturday and the preparations for that compulsory callout were already under way when Victoria made that declaration. Mr Speaker, those opposite in the questions today are seeking to politicise this disaster and it\u2019s very disappointing. The second set of Labor questions in Senate question time is again to Richard Colbeck on sports rorts \u2013 and the auditor general\u2019s finding that funding went to target marginal seats. At first, Colbeck deploys the reverse-pork barrelling defence that Bridget McKenzie\u2019s intervention lifted the proportion of projects in Labor electorates from 26% to 34%. Then, he quoted a 2010 auditor general\u2019s report that found an aspect of Labor\u2019s fiscal stimulus program \u201cdisproportionately favoured ALP held seats\u201d. Anthony Albanese defended the program at the time by noting: \u201cThe allocation of funding across federal electorates was in line with the political makeup of the House of Representatives. Put simply, Labor MPs held 55.3% of the electorates and their local councils secured 56.7% of the funding from the program\u2019s Strategic Projects component.\u201d Just a bit more on what Scott Morrison said in answer to Zali Steggall (and why, no matter how they brand it, or what words they choose to market it, or if they even decide to appoint a minister to directly deal with it, \u2018climate action now\u2019 is just hollow doublespeak that won\u2019t lead to any actual changes): Of course, Australia must continue to table the actions if we are to meet and beat our emissions reductions target, which have already seen us reduce emissions, Mr Speaker, by 12.8% since 2005. We have a reduction target we took to the Australian people out to 2030 that will see emissions per capita fall by half. We are ahead of countries like New Zealand, ahead of countries like Canada in meeting and beating our targets, some 411m tonnes we will have beat our Kyoto emissions target. At the same time, our renewable energy, Mr Speaker, per capita is half what it\u2019s been \u2013 is double, I should say, more than double what\u2019s being achieved in Germany, and in many other countries around the world and we have one of the highest levels of investments in renewable energy anywhere in the world. In the developed world. We have one of the highest \u2013 in fact, we have the highest target of emissions reduction now to 2030 in Asia compared to those nations. Emissions reduction is important. We\u2019re acting on that reduction. I can tell you also resilience to climate is also important. Hazard reduction is important, if not more important, than emissions reduction when it comes to protecting people from fire and hotter, drier, longer summers in the future. Also, in a country ravaged by drought, and the impacts that we have experienced, and that drought continues, building dams is climate action now. There you go. Burning the trees that help to create clean air and create rainfall, is EVEN MORE IMPORTANT in protecting you from the longer, hotter, drier summers than emissions reduction. The next dixer is on why the budget might be looking a little sad, because of the summer \u2013 plus drought, plus coronavirus, plus those pesky global headwinds. \u201cUnprecedented\u201d is being thrown around again. It\u2019s almost like surprises can happen that you can\u2019t prepare for \u2013 like the global financial crisis \u2013 which impact your bottom line. Sidenote: Josh Frydenberg still hasn\u2019t worked out how microphones work. Pro tip: they amplify your voice so you DON\u2019T HAVE TO YELL. The member for Gilmore, Fiona Phillips, to Scott Morrison: Why does the prime minister claim he always acted on the advice of fire commissioners when he ignored for two years their advice to provide a permanent boost to Australia\u2019s aerial firefighting capability? Morrison: I thank the member for her question. And can I, through her, pass on again my sincere condolences and sympathies and support to all those members in her electorate. I have members of my own family who live in your electorate. I want to thank you for the work that you have done, as all members have done, over the course of this bushfire season in supporting their local communities. I would be grateful if you could do that, if you have the opportunity. The member has raised the matter of the recommendations that were made through fire chiefs regarding the aerial firefighting assets. And what the government had done was respond to that, with two separate tranches of funding, which matched what they originally asked for. I dealt with this matter during the course of the bushfire season, but in addition to those two funding allocations of $11m, on top of that we announced a further $20m. That was over and above the $15m that was being provided each and every year as part of the arrangement that we had. We were pleased to do that. I also noted that the ongoing funding, which was being sought, would be addressed in this year\u2019s budget. \u201cBuild back better\u201d is not a personality. Labor\u2019s Josh Burns becomes the second MP thrown out this year. Lucky him. The sentient sourdough loaf serving as the deputy prime minister is doing his best to string words together about resilience and regional Australia, but it\u2019s hard when you are still fermenting. Keith Pitt inflicts Michael McCormack on us for the first question time of 2020 \u2013 almost a sure sign that he is in the ministry. And maybe his biggest sin so far. Labor\u2019s Terri Butler becomes the first MP to be kicked out for 2020. Zali Steggall asks about what the government is doing about emissions reduction and the answer is so depressing (you have heard it all before \u2013 Australia is doing amazing, sweetie) and I want to stab myself in the face with a fork. Oh \u2013 and also hazard reduction and \u201cbuilding dams is climate action now\u201d, according to Scott Morrison. You can build all the holes in the ground you want. It won\u2019t make it forking rain. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: I refer to his previous answer where he suggested that it was necessary to have a Liberal party authorisation on his ad which had a Liberal party donation button attached to it. Isn\u2019t it a fact that only electoral matter requires party authorisation and there is long precedent for government information which is not party political to not require such an authorisation? The only reason why it was authorised by the Liberal party is because it was so political. Morrison: The video presentation was posted on my Facebook page, Mr Speaker. And that requires an authorisation and that is the advice that is provided to me. That is the same as is practiced by the leader of the opposition and I table, Mr Speaker, his tweet that says: \u201cListening to people, respecting people, putting forward practical suggestions that would make a difference \u2013 that\u2019s what I have been focused on. That is what I will continue to do. Authorised by Anthony Albanese, ALP, Canberra.\u201d I have followed the practice in communicating with the Australian people. To the Labor party, to characterise it in the way they have is simply false and a misrepresentation by a Labor party leader who wants to politicise the bushfires. Except one is from an opposition leader and one was about the Australian government response to a national emergency. Which was not on behalf of the Liberal party, but at the behest of the Australian government, using Australian resources. But you can see where this is going. The sport minister, Richard Colbeck, has been asked about the sports rorts program \u2013 specifically whether he has seen the colour-coded spreadsheet from which former minister Bridget McKenzie selected projects. At first, Colbeck takes the chance to \u201cextol the virtues of the program\u201d that gave $100m to 684 sports clubs in the form of grants. After numerous points of order, Colbeck finally answers that he hasn\u2019t \u201cseen that document because the ABC hasn\u2019t published it\u201d \u2013 he has only seen excerpts of the spreadsheet. Asked about a probe into whether the health department of Sport Australia was the source of the leak, Colbeck replies there is \u201cno issue\u201d with the department, it is confident it was not the source of the leak. But he has not received advice from Sport Australia, which had \u201calready commenced a process to satisfy themselves\u201d before Colbeck asked. Next dixer is on the government\u2019s new commission into veterans\u2019 suicides and mental health. \u2022 For information and support in Australia call Lifeline on 13 11 14, Mensline on 1300 789 978 or Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636 Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister regret using his official resources to create and launch a party political advertisement on a catastrophic day at the height of bushfire crisis, which included defence imagery, a jingle and a link to a Liberal party donation button? Morrison: The leader of the opposition has come to that dispatch box and told a complete falsehood. The government and the members opposite know ... (INTERJECTIONS) ... on any ... I note the constant interjections on matters of bushfires, Mr Speaker, from those opposite. But on every piece of communication that you provide in video, the advice is that that material must be authorised, Mr Speaker, and I have noted that the leader of the opposition ... (Tony Smith tells the house to settle down) Morrison: Those communications require an authorisation to be compliant, and that\u2019s what the government has done. That\u2019s what the leader of the opposition has done, Mr Speaker, with his video communications on these types of issues. Mr Speaker, the only people trying to politicise the response to the bushfire crisis is the leader of the opposition. Except this was an Australian government announcement, which was authorised by Scott Morrison of the Liberal party, not the Australian government, and it did, when first launched, go to the Liberal party site, where it asked for donations to the Liberal party. The first dixer is on how amazing the government\u2019s bushfire response was. Biggest take away \u2013 Scott Morrison really, really wants to be able to brand the past few months \u2018Black summer\u2019. It\u2019s up to you if you let him. Just a reminder that Scott Morrison put out what was basically a Liberal party ad as the climate fires reached their zenith \u2013 but is now accusing the opposition of politicising the bushfires. Anthony Albanese kicks off the first question time of the year with a question on why Scott Morrison didn\u2019t call together Coag when the fire emergency began in November: Why did the prime minister summarily dismiss Labor\u2019s constructive proposals by rejecting a national approach to the crisis saying, \u201cCoag might meet later\u201d, quote, \u201cshould the need arise\u201d. Morrison: I am sure the House won\u2019t be surprised that I don\u2019t accept the leader of the opposition\u2019s characterisation of these issues. What I can tell the House ... I can tell the House is that government\u2019s response to the national bushfire emergency over this black summer has been, Mr Speaker, unprecedented. Unprecedented with the compulsory callout of the defence force reserves, which is the first time, Mr Speaker, the first time that has occurred in the response to a national disaster of this kind. (Kevin Rudd called in the reserves, but it was not compulsory.) In addition to that, Mr Speaker, we moved quickly to establish the National Bushfire Recovery Agency and to appoint Andrew Colvin, the former head of the Australian federal police, which I thought those opposite supported these measures, but they come in here on the first question of the day, and seek to politicise the bushfire response. Now I find that disappointing. I\u2019m happy to inform the member that we not only provided additional support for aerial firefighting assets. That is the waterbombers. But we actually provided a further $20m ... Albanese interjects on relevance, but Morrison is allowed to go on. Morrison: We provided the additional funding for those waterbombers and then we provided additional funding on top of that in response to the requests from the fire chiefs, who had sought that additional support. They sought one extra. We provided four extra, Mr Speaker. I note the constant interjecting from the leader of the opposition. And he\u2019s been very chatty on this issue today. ... I would have thought he would be supporting these measures. If he wants to politicise bushfires, that reflects more on him than it does on the government. We might see Peter Dutton for the first time since the summer began. First we have a few condolence motions to get through. Question time is due to begin. Labor, led by Kristina Keneally on this, has responded to Christian Porter\u2019s announcement the commonwealth parental leave scheme (12 months unpaid leave) will now include premature and stillborn babies \u2013 but it is hoping the private sector gets on board. Parents of stillborn babies already have the same access to paid parental leave under the commonwealth scheme. These changes mean parents who devastatingly lose a child due to stillbirth or infant death will be entitled to a maximum of 12 months unpaid leave. However \u2013 whilst there has been some progress \u2013 too many private companies have yet to make both these changes. The bipartisan Senate Stillbirth Inquiry recommended changes to both the Fair Work Act and the National Employment Standards to provide consistency across all employers and employees in Australia. Labor looks forward to the government making these amendments. Last year the Senate also passed a motion calling for the equalisation of bereavement payments for parents who experience a stillbirth. Currently, parents are only eligible for this payment if a baby\u2019s heart beats after birth. If it beats once, you receive a payment, if your baby is born without a heartbeat, you don\u2019t. It\u2019s only fair that the bereavement payment for parents of stillborn children is equal. Likewise, it is only fair for subsequent stillborn baby payments for subsequent stillbirths to be equal. We look forward to the government making these announcements in the near future. Stillbirth is the biggest cause of infant death in our country today and the rate of death from stillbirth is higher than the national road toll. We must do everything to support families through the devastation of such heartbreak. Labor\u2019s social team has been hard at work this morning It is just before question time, where MPs make 90-second statements. Every single Labor MP is speaking on the sports grants affair. All of them. I missed this, this morning \u2013 but it\u2019s a new contender for favourite quote of the day. Michael McCormack was asked about how close the leadership spill vote count was yesterday (11-10 if you believe Barnaby Joyce\u2019s camp, 15-6 if you believe McCormack\u2019s, with the truth, as always, probably somewhere in the middle) and he had this to say: Just how close I am not sure. It is National party convention not to reveal the votes and at the end of the day, the votes do not count. What counts, for me, is regional Australians. At the end of the day, the VOTES DO NOT COUNT. Mate. The votes obviously count, because they are the whole reason you are still in your fricking job. Ladies and gentlemen: Australia\u2019s deputy (and sometimes acting) prime minister. Long may he beige. It seems John Alexander has learned a few things since last year when he said this about our pacific neighbours (this is not a criticism, merely noting that he has actually moved on this issue and that\u2019s a good thing): Speaking at a forum last week, Alexander reportedly noted Frank Bainimarama\u2019s repeated call for Australia to stop burning coal and developing new coalmines but said the priority should be to help people to move their settlements to higher ground. According to Nine newspapers, he said: \u2018It\u2019s very much like your house is on fire, your children are in the house \u2013 should you call the fire brigade and get the children out of the house?\u2019 The Bennelong MP later told ABC radio his point was that adaptation was a priority but \u2018we must also act to prevent further damage to our planet\u2019. For those who missed the speech: Pretty sure David Littleproud doesn\u2019t have a degree in agriculture or emergency services either, and yet he managed to accept those concepts pretty easily. Bushfires and drought are weighing on an already sluggish Australian economy, while the coronavirus epidemic may inflict further pain, the Reserve Bank governor says. Speaking to the National Press Club in Sydney, Philip Lowe also defended the bank\u2019s decision to cut official interest rates to a historic low of 0.75% against charges that it has spooked consumers into closing their wallets. Instead, Australians were adapting to a period of consistently low wages growth, high household debt and a fall in home prices by paying down their mortgages instead of going to the shops, he said. He said the economy was going through \u201ca gentle turning point for the better\u201d, predicting modest increases in growth and consumer spending over the coming two years. The RBA expects the ongoing drought to cut 0.25 percentage points from growth this year. Lowe said the economic impact on bushfire areas was \u201cvery large\u201d due to the \u201clarge-scale destruction of homes, farms and businesses as well as public infrastructure\u201d. He said that, taking into account the expected rebuilding effort, government grants and insurance payouts, the fires would not affect economic growth across the whole year. However, the fires would cut economic growth by about 0.2 percentage points in the December quarter and the current quarter. He said the effect of the coronavirus outbreak on the Australian economy could be worse than that of the 2003 Sars epidemic because \u201cChina is a larger part of the global economy and it is more closely integrated, including with Australia\u201d. Labor has just called for a quorum in the house of representatives. There are not enough government MPs in the house. It is a very busy week for Philip Lowe. If you are following the coronavirus story, you may have already seen this, but it seems not just China is annoyed at Australia now: The New Zealand foreign minister, Winston Peters, said Australian officials did not ask to use Auckland base for quarantining. We didn\u2019t make the offer because the Australians had already said what they wanted us to do. We\u2019re a small country doing the best we can with lesser resources than big countries have. John Alexander was making his condolence speech on the fires (the leftover ones have moved to the federation chamber). Here is what he had to say: The elephant in the room, of course, is climate change. Today is a day for commemoration, not politics. But one thing I would like to say is the need to recognise that these fires are not a warning about climate change \u2013 they are climate change. The leader of the opposition said that \u2018this is not normal\u2019. I fear this is actually the new normal. In focusing on saving this country for our grandchildren, we risk forgetting we need to save our neighbours. We must obviously mitigate future risks and change our ways, but we also must adapt because these longer, hotter summers will be our new normal. If we are to be a mature nation, we must be proactive in adapting our local infrastructure and the way we live, lest we risk succumbing to this new normal. Let\u2019s remember Alexander is saying this at the same time the prime minister isn\u2019t budging on anything other than \u201cnot being bullied\u201d into something no one is bullying him on, and Barnaby Joyce \u2013 one of the most vocal members of the Coalition party room \u2013 is dumping all over wind power, because windmills look bad. Maybe JA should have another chat to his leader, given this was Scott Morrison on the Nine Network this morning: And it\u2019s important to listen to everybody but take people forward on practical, balanced action that doesn\u2019t go and write people\u2019s jobs off, or industries off; that doesn\u2019t go and put taxes on people. I mean, action on climate change does not mean taxing people. It\u2019s about technology, not taxation. So we won\u2019t be bullied into higher taxes or higher electricity prices. What we\u2019ll do is take practical action that deals with these challenges. And that challenge is living in a hotter, drier and longer summer where these risk of these bushfires we need to be more resilient to. So I\u2019m going to focus on the stuff that works \u2013 the stuff that actually reduces risk and the stuff that ensures that people can be safer in summer. Who on Lizzo\u2019s green earth is bullying the prime minister into higher taxes? The man has been part of a government which has been in power since 2013. He was literally in charge of the treasury decisions for a decent chunk of that. He now leads the government and decides its policies, including taxes. Which he cut. It\u2019s like saying Grandpa Joe was actually bedridden. Liberal MP John Alexander was just in the federation chamber (where speeches go to die) talking about climate change. This is noteworthy, because he was speaking about how the bushfires are actually climate change in action and present the danger of Australia\u2019s \u201cnew normal\u201d if action isn\u2019t taken. Meanwhile, in the Coalition party room, there are many, many members still arguing about how climate change isn\u2019t an issue in their electorates. And then we get to the truly Barnaby: We have to recognise that the public acceptance of wind towers on the hill in front of their veranda is gone, and the public dissonance on that issue is as strong as any other environmental subject. We have to understand that there is no sure thing in a political debate. If zero emissions are the goal then surely nuclear energy should be supported, but it is not. If wind towers are a moral good and environmentally inoffensive, why can\u2019t we have them just off the beach at Bondi so we can feel good about ourselves while going for a surf? It would cause a riot. Do you want a 3,000ha solar farm next door to you? Lots of glass and aluminium neatly in rows pointing at the sun. I am not sure others will want to buy that view off you when you go to sell your house! The weather has determined the political climate and everyone is manipulating the recent calamitous events to push their own particular barrow. Whether there is unanimity of people\u2019s political views on the fire ground or feeding stock in drought as to what we can do to change the weather is as unlikely as to unanimity to their favourite song. When politicians do stand behind a global climate policy, the only certainty is that it will be the policy that has the least direct effect on them. Wind farms are for your backyard not mine, zero emission nuclear is for France, only support banning coal mines if the coal mines aren\u2019t in your electorate, and try not to get caught on a sticky question of what replaces our nation\u2019s largest export. There is a desire for intermittent power generation such as solar but an inability to afford the pump hydro to make it dispatchable. Simple answers are generally wrong. So 2020 has started with quite some colour politically and tragedy nationally. The art form of politics will be the cogent response that the parliament can show the Australian people in two years\u2019 time. Barnaby Joyce goes on: Now, my first attentions go back to where they were before this week: the New England, drought, fires and now the threat of coronavirus. We arrive now at the period two years prior to the next election. This period is vital in setting the agenda that the Australian people will make their judgement on as to whether we remain with the reigns of the nation in two years\u2019 time after the next election. There is difficulty in standing behind a promise; it is so much easier to stand beside delivery if you want to get re-elected. I have disdain when the term \u201clearnings\u201d is used. Leaning is a verb, knowledge is a noun and \u201clearnings\u201d is nonsense. The knowledge we have attained from the bushfires and drought has to further develop our policy of building resilience into the future. As a government we have to deliver on what we have learnt from these natural disasters and be standing beside them by the time of the next election. For fires, better access to reliable water supplies to fight fires, clearing of road corridors to get access in and out safely to the fire grounds, communication facilities that can stand the challenge of fires, hazard reduction and upgrade of fire trails. This is to name but a few. If you want a macro climate policy to show the world our leadership on reducing carbon emissions then we must bring in nuclear power and development of the most efficient coal power technology that uses the least units of coal for the greatest output of power. Wanting to develop the most efficient coal fired power technology in the world is not disavowing the realities of climate change, it is actually something that could be provided to substantially curtail emissions. Michael McCormack in the SMH and the Age today: I didn\u2019t get blasted out. You always take learnings. I\u2019ll take on board what my colleagues said [but] I don\u2019t agree necessarily with everything the media has written about this latest attempt. Barnaby Joyce has a few things to say on Facebook: Firstly I would like to congratulate Michael McCormack on winning the leadership ballot and by so doing acknowledge the re-endorsement of his position as leader of the Nationals party. It is appropriate that if a political issue needs resolving to put aside contentions held by some, a process is there to allow the clearing of the air. That process has been followed and the issue is finalised. Our nation does not have a president nor are we cursed with a tyrant. We have a free media, transparency in government and as recent events have shown, problems don\u2019t happen with such things as sports grants that you will not later hear of in the public forum. One of the conditions of this freedom in our nation is the capacity for members of parliament to challenge their political office holders, if so desired, in the party room. For the Nationals this process was made as brief as possible, prior to the first sitting of parliament for the year. There was a spill of positions, I stood and I lost. I respect and support the vote of the room and will strive for the re-election of a Morrison McCormack government. (You may remember Michael McCormack hit out at the media yesterday, in his \u201ceverything is fine, I\u2019m not angry, you\u2019re angry\u201d press conference immediately after the spill.) Scott Morrison on why he has set up a permanent commission looking into veterans\u2019 mental health and not a royal commission: There were many issues to consider. I didn\u2019t think a one-off review into the past informs enough, because the challenge we have is ongoing, each and every single day. A royal commission that looked into those past cases was not enough. Because, sadly, we know there will be more. We needed a solution. We needed a response that was ongoing. If you go to any RSL around the country, you will see the plaque \u2018the price of peace is eternal vigilance\u2019. We must be eternally vigilant about the welfare and care of those who\u2019ve served in uniform, even more so when they leave their service and they leave the protection and supports that often exist within our defence forces and they go on to the next phase of their life. And let me stress this: those men and women go off to lead successful, vibrant, positive, major-contributing lives. Let\u2019s not for a second conflate the issue and the tragedy of the terrible outcomes of veterans\u2019 suicide with the suggestion that veterans are broken. They\u2019re not. They\u2019re champions. They\u2019re heroes. But some struggle. Some are in a daily battle. And they\u2019re the veterans that we have in mind here in the announcements that we\u2019re making today. Anthony Albanese: You don\u2019t get to say that you\u2019re drawing a line under an issue just because you say it\u2019s over. This government is shambolic. It\u2019s moving from one mess to another, whether it\u2019s the challenge yesterday of Barnaby Joyce to the deputy prime minister\u2019s leadership, and then a ballot for deputy leader of the National party on a day that we were supposed to be devoting to the bushfire crisis. That underlined what is an ongoing theme of this government \u2013 that it\u2019s all concerned about itself and politics and not concerned about the national interest. This morning I attempted to move in the parliament a debate which would see those organisations where volunteers spent hundreds of hours putting in applications in good faith, thinking that there was a level playing field, thinking that there was a fair umpire and that umpire was called Sports Australia, under the legislation in which this $100m was allocated, and finding out something very different. Finding out this was a match that was fixed from the beginning. Match fixing that went to not just Bridget McKenzie, who has been thrown under the bus. They had the prime minister\u2019s office staff sitting in Bridget McKenzie\u2019s office. They had emails that clearly link the prime minister\u2019s office to the decisions asking that grants be given to clubs that didn\u2019t get as high a score as those clubs which received. I mean, here you have quite a farce. Don Farrell: I\u2019m here with the leader today to report to you the decision by Bridget McKenzie to resign doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the end of the sports rorts scandal that we\u2019ve seen over the January period. Our intention this afternoon is to move in the Senate for an inquiry into what\u2019s gone on here. We wish to investigate what the minister did, the relationship between her office and that of the prime minister, and to find out why there was no accountability and no transparency in the awarding of these grants. Thousands of clubs made applications to what they thought was a dinky-di process, an on-the-level process. What they found was that it was nothing of the sort, and they had no chance right from the start of getting any of the money. We believe we\u2019ve got the support of the crossbench for the Senate inquiry, and one way or another, we\u2019ll get to the bottom of what\u2019s happened here and we\u2019ll get some accountability, some transparency into this grants process, to make sure that this never happens again. Labor is also calling for the clubs who missed out on grants to get the money (which doesn\u2019t actually fix the problem). Don Farrell is trying very hard to lead a press conference and, well, there may be a reason why Don Farrell doesn\u2019t get to lead press conferences very often. On the failed division Labor called on the sports grants affair, all the independents voted with the opposition (except for Bob Katter, who was not in the chamber, because it is a day ending in y and there are enemies to be slain somewhere, or something). I mean, is that something a prime minister actually has to learn? Really? TO ALWAYS SHOW UP? FFS. What has Scott Morrison learned about leadership over the summer? Always to listen, always show up and always put Australians first. And Gladys Liu is officially out of the freezer, with a special mention from the prime minister. Scott Morrison: I want to say thank you to the Australian Chinese community. I want to say in particular thank you to Gladys Liu, who has been a leader in getting information to people on this issue and providing them support in her community down there in Box Hill. I know that\u2019s being done by other members. We then get some damage control in terms of China, which yesterday, quite publicly, said it was annoyed at Australia\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak (shutting the borders). Scott Morrison: Can I say thank you to the Australian Chinese community \u2013 you are magnificent. The way you have supported each other, the way you have acted in such a responsible fashion, on occasions with great provocation, which I\u2019ve found reprehensible. You are observing and taking so seriously your responsibilities, together with all Australians, to ensure that we\u2019ve been so far quite successfully able to contain the impact of the coronavirus within Australia. We have 13 confirmed cases, three of which have now left hospital and gone about their lives. So we\u2019ve actually seen a net reduction in recent times of those cases, so I say to the Chinese community in Australia: thank you, thank you for the way that you have engaged. The whole point of the quite proactive decisions that the government has taken in relation to containing the coronavirus \u2013 and we moved so much more before many other countries \u2013 was to ensure that Australians could go about their daily lives, and going about your daily lives means going where you\u2019d normally go, because Australians are taking the necessary precautions, and that includes our Chinese community. On the question of Australia going carbon neutral, Scott Morrison says: I\u2019ll give you the same response I gave you at the Press Club a week ago. That\u2019s a matter \u2013 the 2050 request that we undertook to look at in our commitment through the PIF process, and that\u2019s what I intend to do. What I said was I would never make a commitment like that if I couldn\u2019t tell the Australian people what it would cost them. And I wouldn\u2019t make a commitment like that if I couldn\u2019t tell them what it would cost them. I don\u2019t believe the action you need to take in this area is about putting taxes on people, putting their electricity prices up or driving industries out of regional areas ... That\u2019s what I took to the last election, that\u2019s what Australians endorsed, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do as prime minister. My daily correspondence with the AFP has been completed \u2013 it has still not decided whether or not to investigate Angus Taylor. Scott Morrison\u2019s press conference is back on. It\u2019s on the new commission on veteran suicide prevention. It was Stuart Robert who shut down that motion, fyi. I think we can all guess what Labor\u2019s 90-second statements will be on. If you want to know where question time will go (apart from the climate fires), here is what Anthony Albanese managed to get out before his motion was shut down by the government: I move that so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the leader of the opposition from moving the following motion \u2013 that the House calls on the government to fund all projects recommended by Sport Australia under the community sport infrastructure program but not funded by the Morrison government. The Sports rorts saga characterises everything that\u2019s wrong about this government. A government [that] doesn\u2019t represent the Australian people. A government that\u2019s obsessed just by representing its own interests. This is a corrupt scandal that goes to the very top. This is a win \u2013 and a bipartisan one at that. Kristina Keneally made this one of her big priorities when entering the Senate, and I am glad to see the change. From Christian Porter\u2019s release: The Morrison government will improve parental leave entitlements to help support families dealing with traumatic situations such as stillbirths, infant deaths and premature births. \u2018The government understands how devastating losing a child can be and recognises that the current entitlement to just six weeks of guaranteed unpaid parental leave is insufficient for many parents who need more time before they return to work,\u2019 attorney general and minister for industrial relations, Christian Porter, said. \u2018That is why we want to increase the entitlement for those who\u2019ve experienced a stillbirth or infant death to a maximum of 12 months \u2013 the same amount of unpaid leave parents of healthy babies can access. \u2018While not all parents will want to use the full 12 months, it is important that the option is available to them should they need it.\u2019 For parents of premature babies, or babies that experience birth-related complications that result in immediate hospitalisation, the government will also remove the barrier that currently prevents parents from going back to work and restarting their leave when their baby is ready to go home ... Parents will be allowed to use up to 30 days (six weeks) of their 12-month unpaid leave entitlement flexibly, up to the child\u2019s second birthday. During this time, they will also be able to choose to claim part of their 18-week paid leave entitlement. While employers and employees will remain free to agree on arrangements that suit their specific circumstances, these changes will provide Australian families with an improved minimum safety net that offers greater certainty during times of tragedy and more choices about how to structure work and family arrangements. Legislation to enact the changes to unpaid parental leave will be consulted on in the coming weeks ahead of its expected introduction to parliament in the autumn sitting period. These divisions are reminding me why I hear the lambs screaming in my sleep. A division has postponed the prime minister\u2019s press conference \u2013 it\u2019s a motion to suspend standing orders over the sports grants. It will fail. Anthony Albanese will hold a press conference at 11.30. It\u2019s with Don Farrell (the shadow minister for sport \u2013 who knew?) so I think we can guess what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s early, but my favourite quote of the day so far is this from Scott Morrison on the Nine Network today: And we\u2019ve got back straight on the job as we never departed from, as in the government. Because yes, war is peace. And if you want to keep a secret, best to also hide it from yourself. The prime minister will hold a press conference on the new commission at 10.30. Scott Morrison has announced an independent commissioner will look into the mental health of veterans. It will have some of the powers of a royal commission, but it\u2019s not a royal commission. From the release: The Morrison government will establish a permanent national commissioner for defence and veteran suicide prevention. The national commissioner will have the enduring power, scope and resources to investigate suicides and related issues as they arise, rather than being restricted by a one-off review looking at past practices. The national commissioner for defence and veteran suicide prevention will be empowered to perform two roles: The commissioner will be an independent and permanent public accountability body, with the same powers of a royal commission to compel the production of evidence and summon witnesses, and make findings and recommendations to government. The commissioner will also provide an ongoing investigative function of individual cases of suicide, working with each state and territory coronial office, making recommendations to government. The government will invest an initial $40m to support the commissioner\u2019s work and this will be expanded to ensure they have whatever resources they need. The government will also establish an immediate, independent review of historical veteran suicide cases, conducted by the commissioner, focusing on the impact of military service and veterans\u2019 post-service experience. An interim report will be delivered within 12 months. Families will be engaged in this process if they wish, with an opportunity to participate and tell their stories openly and safely. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care, along with coronial and legal experts, will provide technical expertise in support of this work. Thank you to AAP for this summary: WHAT IS HAPPENING IN FEDERAL POLITICS? Scott Morrison has announced an inquiry into veteran suicide with the powers of a royal commission. The prime minister has promised a national inquiry into the bushfire season will be finished by August. Nationals MPs Darren Chester and Keith Pitt are expected to be elevated to cabinet in a ministerial reshuffle. The junior coalition partner is also trying to move on from a failed coup against Michael McCormack launched by former leader Barnaby Joyce. Legislation is being debated in both houses of parliament for the first time this year, after Tuesday was taken up with tributes to bushfire victims. Labor is expected to pursue the sports rorts scandal during question time on Wednesday. The government is also expected to cop questions over its response to the bushfires. Climate protesters continue their action outside Parliament House. It\u2019s been announced Indonesian president Joko Widodo will address parliament next week. Given that we are going to hear \u201cmeet and beat\u201d a lot in terms of emissions targets, it is worth having a listen to this Full Story podcast from Adam Morton: Is the Australian government really \u2018meeting and beating\u2019 its emissions reduction targets? Scott Morrison regularly claims Australia is \u2018meeting and beating\u2019 its emissions reduction targets. But is that true? In this episode of Full Story, environment editor Adam Morton explains why we should focus less on targets and more on emissions. So what can we expect today, given that parliament is officially back and the climate fires have been acknowledged? Well, probably an end to what has been described as the \u201csombre bipartisanship\u201d between Labor and the Coalition. Awwwwww. I bet he still believes in Santa Claus, the tooth fairy and that the Great Barrier Reef can be saved too! Here\u2019s Scott Morrison on Barnaby Joyce and the Nationals on the Nine Network this morning: Morrison: I was happy to see the Nationals deal with these matters as quickly as possible, as they did, so we could get the focus very quickly back on to the importance of yesterday, which was to honour certainly, and firstly, those who lost their lives in these terrible fires. And many of the families of those who\u2019d fallen in Australia\u2019s name were able to be there and get that comfort and support. But also to honour all of those who certainly continue to serve to this day, that Michael McCormack has made it clear this morning that he, you know, he\u2019s apologised, that there was that event yesterday morning, but they dealt with it quickly. And we\u2019ve got back straight on the job as we never departed from, as in the government. Host: I mean, it was an ugly distraction yesterday. Prime minister, you know he\u2019ll be back. Morrison: No, he said he\u2019s not challenging again. So I think that issues - Host: Because that never happens in politics. Morrison: Well, look, the media might want to talk about it, but I think Barnaby ruled a line under that pretty clearly yesterday. So we just get on with the job, which is what Australians expect us to do. An Air New Zealand evacuation flight has left Wuhan carrying a total of 193 passengers: 100 New Zealand citizens and permanent residents, 23 Australian citizens and 70 foreign nationals, predominantly from Pacific Island countries including Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Kiribati, Tonga, Fiji and the Federated States of Micronesia. On board the flight is one doctor and two paramedics from St John. When the flight arrives in Auckland at 6.30pm today, the Australian passengers will be directly transferred to a flight bound to Australia, while the New Zealanders and other nationalities will be quarantined for two weeks at Whangaparaoa airbase. The bells are ringing. May Lizzo have mercy on my decaffeinated soul. When I say Australia is wayyyyyyyyy behind on the climate conversation, I mean really, really behind. Like Warwick Capper-runs-for-politics levels of behind. Here is Boris Johnson overnight: I hope that we can as a planet and as a community of nations get to net zero within decades,\u201d Johnson said at the COP 26 launch on Tuesday. We\u2019re going to do it by 2050, we\u2019re setting the pace, I hope everybody will come with us. Let\u2019s make this year the moment when we come together with the courage and the technological ambition to solve man-made climate change and to choose a cleaner and greener future for all our children and grandchildren. He worked out it was a parody account. Still, I appreciate the wholesomeness. Still on Michael McCormack, who is desperately attempting to go from whitebread to at least sourdough in an attempt to keep his job beyond the next six months \u2013 he was asked about his new deputy David Littleproud\u2019s comments on 7.30 last night regarding Bridget McKenzie and the sports grants affair. As Paul Karp reported: Asked if it was right for the former sports minister to hand grants out according to a spreadsheet colour-coded by the party holding the electorate in which it was located, Littleproud replied: \u201cWell, obviously I don\u2019t think that necessarily getting as partisan as that is the best way to do it.\u201d McCormack, though, is sticking to the report which cleared it \u2013 the PM&amp;C report written by Scott Morrison\u2019s former chief of staff Phil Gaetjens (who was also Peter Costello\u2019s former chief of staff), despite the independent auditor general\u2019s report raising some very serious questions over the process. Added bonus \u2013 we don\u2019t get to see the Gaetjen\u2019s report, because it is cabinet-in-confidence, and as such will be locked up for 20 years. So we only have what the prime minister says it said, and we are told that is enough and every Coalition MP is using that as a get-out-of-jail-free card. Again, don\u2019t you worry about that. Anyway, it is all fine, says McCormack, because every one of the clubs which got money was eligible: We can take learnings from what the report has decreed. Phil Gaetjens has also said, the secretary, that there was no bias towards targeted or marginal seats. He has said that. And yes, we can take learnings from what the ANAO report has said, and from Mr Gaetjens and what he\u2019s also found \u2013 no bias. All projects eligible, and I\u2019m proud of the fact that we\u2019ve got a set of books which are balanced, which are coming into surplus, and which provide the ability for the government, through the expenditure review process, through the budget process, to be able to fund even more rounds of these programs. Particularly important for regional Australia. And let me tell you, when you\u2019re out in regional Australia and you\u2019re a young woman and you\u2019re wanting to play netball or AFLW or soccer or whatever the case may be, you shouldn\u2019t have to be getting dressed behind a car. You shouldn\u2019t have to be getting dressed behind a tree. You should be able to have the same sorts of facilities that the boys have always enjoyed. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m particularly pleased about with this program. Well done to Bridget McKenzie for doing just that. Reminder: we have no idea what Gaetjens has said. The spreadsheet was colour-coded according to party. It targeted marginal seats and those the Coalition wanted. And talking points are not policy. Mike Bowers has just walked into the building. I\u2019ve sent him for coffee. I mean, even putting aside BlackRock\u2019s announcement it was getting out of thermal coal investment \u2013 which, as the largest fund manager in the world is a pretty big deal \u2013 because you know that\u2019s absolutely a financial decision, let\u2019s remember that we seem to be the only democracy in the world still arguing over this stuff. Everyone else has moved on. And yet our politics still has us mired in the muck of \u201cbut the jobs\u201d, which is exactly the same argument which has been used in every single other massive change (tobacco advertising bans anyone?) and the country has not only survived \u2013 new industries have created new jobs. We are seeing it all over the world. Except for here. Much like someone who mistakes loud tropical shirts as a personality, Michael McCormack has decided that talking VERY LOUDLY about coal will substitute for policy and solutions. In response to questions from Michael Rowland on ABC Breakfast about Anglo American (a massive mining company) chief executive Mark Cutifani\u2019s comments about climate change as well as his announcement he wants out of thermal coal in the next five years (which is also an economic decision, let\u2019s be real), McCormack said: Fantastic, good on him. And he\u2019s probably done very nicely, thank you very much, out of the coal industry. Very, very nicely, and \u2013 but coal is providing for two-thirds of Australia\u2019s energy needs, power needs, it\u2019s providing for $62bn of exports, it\u2019s providing 55,000 jobs. We are a government which is looking at all forms of technology to be able to power this country. I\u2019m glad that we have just gone into an agreement with New South Wales. We need to use more gas, we need to actually get more gas and put it into the system. I know that Angus Taylor and others are doing very hard \u2013 working very hard to make sure that we bring power prices down for Australians, that\u2019s one of the most important things for them \u2013 is their energy bill and making sure that it\u2019s affordable. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. Samantha Maiden of the New Daily has an update on Scott Morrison\u2019s Hawaiian holiday \u2013 you\u2019ll never learn how much it cost taxpayers. Voters will never be told the taxpayer cost of the Scott Morrison\u2019s private holidays to Fiji and Hawaii, including flying AFP officers overseas to guard his family, after a freedom of information request was dismissed on the grounds it was not in the public interest and could harm international relations. The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet has exempted all documents relating to the controversial trip that Mr Morrison took to Hawaii as bushfires raged across Australia, effectively slapping a suppression order on the taxpayer cost. While the prime minister paid for the flights privately, there was a taxpayer cost incurred in flying security guards overseas for the family trip, a highly unusual act by a national leader. You can read that report, here. Michael McCormack was on Sky this morning, promising his party will focus on its constituents from now on. You know \u2013 those people who are among the poorest in the country, and have suffered through one of the worst droughts this nation has seen, as well as the climate fires, and water issues, and continued simmering trade tensions in an already shaky economy. Those constituents. I appreciate that yesterday was probably necessary to take place, it has taken place. Barnaby has pledged his loyalty, he said he won\u2019t re-challenge. We now need to draw a line under it and move on and make sure as members of the National party we concentrate on the people who matter most, and that\u2019s the people we serve. Pretty sure we have heard that before. Parliament is due to start at 9.30am this morning. As promised in the government talking points, we have legislation \u2013 the government will be putting through a treasury laws amendment (to ensure the bushfire assistance is tax-free) as well as two more bills related to the banking royal commission, which was handed down about a year ago. It\u2019s the first official day of parliamentary proceedings \u2013 which you can tell, because every politician and their dog has been on the breakfast TV shows this morning, telling us it is a brand new year. Let\u2019s try and forget for a moment that the ridiculous drama of yesterday was entirely brought on by the National party itself, and had nothing to do with anyone or anything else \u2013 you don\u2019t get to \u201cdraw a line\u201d under something just because you decide it\u2019s over. Scott Morrison has been out this morning talking about the new frontbench coming \u2013 as well as the independent commissioner into veteran suicides. Darren Chester will be returning to the cabinet \u2013 that much is sure. Keith Pitt will probably get a guernsey as well \u2013 he is steady, hasn\u2019t screwed up his media appearances, and well, Michael McCormack owes him. Michelle Landry is also in line for a promotion \u2013 she was a steadfast McCormack supporter since his leadership emergence two years ago, and didn\u2019t budget. David Littleproud will also most likely get what he wants. But all of that doesn\u2019t change that the government doesn\u2019t get to \u201cdraw a line\u201d under the summer \u2013 and what\u2019s happened since they got back \u2013 just because they want to. The sports grants affair, the Nationals, the coming audits, Angus Taylor, the response to the climate fires, water, the economy \u2013 all of that doesn\u2019t go away, just because someone wants to get a stick out and draw a line under something. You have one-coffee Amy (hence the crankiness), Sarah Martin and Paul Karp with you today \u2013 with Katharine Murphy and Mike Bowers working off-site. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

company\u2019s earnings given Australia\u2019s still-strong domestic economy and our view that it has a smaller cash flow exposure to the outbreak than the firms operating in Macau and Singapore.\u201d</p> <p>These include Melco, which runs casinos in the former Portuguese colony of Macau, and is currently embroiled in controversy over its attempts to buy 20% of Crown that are to be

      "bodyText": "More than 4,000 international students have signed a petition to delay the start of the university semester due to the government\u2019s ongoing travel ban on people travelling through China. Classes at a range of Australian universities are due to start in February, despite the government\u2019s announcement that any foreign nationals who have travelled through China since 1 February will be banned from entering Australia for 14 days. On Tuesday, the petition started by the general secretary of the University of Sydney\u2019s student representative council, Abbey Shi, gathered more than 4,000 signatures, reported the student newspaper, Honi Soit. The petition asks for classes at Sydney University, scheduled to start on 24 February, to be pushed back to 9 March. In a statement, the president of the student representative council, Liam Donohoe, said the ban would unfairly disadvantage international students returning for the start of the year. \u201cThis travel ban will significantly disrupt the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, who are central to student communities at the University of Sydney and beyond,\u201d he said. \u201cMany of these students are losing out on learning, work, relationships, and communities, and may never return.\u201d Nearly 100,000 Chinese international students with valid student visas are currently outside of Australia, according to the latest figures from the department of home affairs. Currently, 58,797 Chinese international students are within Australia. Monash University in Melbourne announced on Friday it would delay its semester by one week, until 9 March. The president of the National Union of Students, Molly Willmott, told Guardian Australia she supported the delay. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the petition itself, but I think there are wider issues with the travel ban.

Are there support services in place to support them in that? It is an incredibly stressful and literally isolating time for students. We have to make sure our student services and counselling services are fully funded and have the right resources.\u201d Donohoe said that many of the students who had been blocked \u201chaven\u2019t been to Wuhan or other affected areas\u201d, which made the restrictions \u201cparticularly callous\u201d. On Tuesday, it was reported that 70 international students, some of whom had already been en route to Australia when the travel ban was announced, had been detained upon arrival at Sydney airport. The University of Sydney student union, along with the New South Wales branch of the National Tertiary Education Union are organising a protest calling for a \u201chealth-based policy response to the coronavirus\u201d, rather than \u201can approach based on fear and sinophobia\u201d. A University of Sydney spokeswoman told the Sydney Morning Herald the university had no plans to delay semester but was \u201caware of the petition and understand the anxiety and concern\u201d of students. The university has however extended the period that students can enrol by two weeks \u2013 until 9 March \u2013 and will let affected international students defer their studies for the semester. The University of Melbourne also said it would not delay semester, but would \u201cconsider special arrangements for students\u201d. The two universities, and many others, are also offering online replacements for classes. The chair of Universities Australia, Prof Deborah Terry, said in a statement that universities were \u201cworking round the clock\u201d and would \u201cextend the greatest flexibility possible\u201d. \u201cWe want to ensure as little disruption as possible to your studies \u2013 so please keep in touch with your university here in Australia as we keep you updated,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are a vital part of our vibrant, warm, global community of students and scholars.\u201d The president of the University of Melbourne\u2019s student union, Hannah Buchan, said it was important that \u201cno student should be disadvantaged by this travel ban\u201d. \u201cI believe that universities need to provide more support for students who are affected by the ban, such as extending special consideration, providing online materials for the beginning of the semester for all courses, and providing advocacy and counselling services in different languages,\u201d she said.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A total of 94 UK nationals and family members have already been evacuated to Britain from Wuhan on two flights, which arrived on Friday and Sunday.</p> \n<p>One passenger was taken to hospital in Oxford after telling medics he had a cough and a cold, while the rest of those who came back are in quarantine at Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral.</p> \n<p>The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said on Tuesday night that the final flight would have space for all British nationals and their dependants remaining in Hubei to leave.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/coronavirus_charts_5_feb/giv-3902h1xyAxaviQLd/\" data-alt=\"Graph\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/02/coronavirus_charts_5_feb/giv-3902h1xyAxaviQLd/\">Graph</a> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cWe have been working round the clock to help British nationals leave Hubei province on UK, French and New Zealand flights,\u201d he said. \u201cI encourage all British nationals in Hubei to register with our teams if they want to leave on this flight.\u201d</p> \n<p>New Zealanders, Australians, Britons and people from several Pacific nations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/05/new-zealand-plane-carrying-coronavirus-evacuees-from-wuhan-lands-in-auckland\">landed in Auckland from Wuhan</a> on Wednesday.

      "body": "<p>Here\u2019s one anniversary I won\u2019t be celebrating: 10 years ago this week, the Lancet retracted an article published in 1998 that linked the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/feb/02/lancet-retracts-mmr-paper\" title=\"\">measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism</a>. The retraction followed a General Medical Council (GMC) ruling that lead author <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/andrew-wakefield\" title=\"\">Andrew Wakefield</a> had been dishonest.</p> <p>After the original paper, and despite the immediate objections raised by the medical community, there was a significant drop in MMR rates in the UK. In my GP surgery, rational people expressed concerns along the lines of \u201cThere\u2019s no smoke without fire\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ll wait until my child is older so that I can be sure they\u2019re not autistic\u201d, \u201cMy friend\u2019s child was diagnosed with autism a few months after his MMR\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll get the jabs done privately so they can be given separately\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Shaming or forcing people to do something that they are scared of is never a good idea</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The success of vaccination programmes means that we get complacent and forget that these childhood infections can kill. Parents of babies born today in the UK are unlikely to ever come across measles or meningitis, and there hasn\u2019t been a naturally occurring case of polio in the UK <a href=\"https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/polio\" title=\"\">since 1984</a>. A mother told me recently that she was against vaccination and didn\u2019t believe the illnesses were a threat nowadays. She\u2019s right \u2013 because most of the other children in her baby\u2019s cohort will be vaccinated, hers is likely to be safe because of herd immunity. I sent her some links and asked her to reconsider. As GPs we\u2019re not supposed to get cross so I didn\u2019t say what I really thought.</p> <p>On the whole, MMR rates have improved over the past 10 years although they remain just below the WHO recommended coverage of <a href=\"https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/nhs-immunisation-statistics/england-2018-19\" title=\"\">95% or more</a>. At its lowest ebb, in 2003-04, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/sep/24/society.politics\" title=\"\">only 80%</a> of under-twos in the UK were given MMR. Reasons for the improvement in uptake probably include the passage of time, detailed rebuttals of Wakefield\u2019s work, the discovery of his possible conflicts of interest and the absence of further studies to validate his claims. The public appears to have recognised that sometimes there is smoke without fire.</p> <p>Fear has also played a part in improving uptake. There have been measles outbreaks in Orthodox Jewish communities in the US and Europe. Local rabbis have responded by urging their followers to vaccinate their kids and there is some evidence that this has been effective.</p> <p>But on a global scale, attitudes and wariness of officialdom can be harder to shift. The WHO is concerned that there were more cases of measles in <a href=\"https://www.who.int/immunization/newsroom/new-measles-data-august-2019/en/\" title=\"\">2019 than in any year since 2006</a> and that multiple countries have declared outbreaks.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s one anniversary I won\u2019t be celebrating: 10 years ago this week, the Lancet retracted an article published in 1998 that linked the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism. The retraction followed a General Medical Council (GMC) ruling that lead author Andrew Wakefield had been dishonest. After the original paper, and despite the immediate objections raised by the medical community, there was a significant drop in MMR rates in the UK. In my GP surgery, rational people expressed concerns along the lines of \u201cThere\u2019s no smoke without fire\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ll wait until my child is older so that I can be sure they\u2019re not autistic\u201d, \u201cMy friend\u2019s child was diagnosed with autism a few months after his MMR\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll get the jabs done privately so they can be given separately\u201d. The success of vaccination programmes means that we get complacent and forget that these childhood infections can kill. Parents of babies born today in the UK are unlikely to ever come across measles or meningitis, and there hasn\u2019t been a naturally occurring case of polio in the UK since 1984. A mother told me recently that she was against vaccination and didn\u2019t believe the illnesses were a threat nowadays. She\u2019s right \u2013 because most of the other children in her baby\u2019s cohort will be vaccinated, hers is likely to be safe because of herd immunity. I sent her some links and asked her to reconsider. As GPs we\u2019re not supposed to get cross so I didn\u2019t say what I really thought. On the whole, MMR rates have improved over the past 10 years although they remain just below the WHO recommended coverage of 95% or more. At its lowest ebb, in 2003-04, only 80% of under-twos in the UK were given MMR. Reasons for the improvement in uptake probably include the passage of time, detailed rebuttals of Wakefield\u2019s work, the discovery of his possible conflicts of interest and the absence of further studies to validate his claims. The public appears to have recognised that sometimes there is smoke without fire. Fear has also played a part in improving uptake. There have been measles outbreaks in Orthodox Jewish communities in the US and Europe. Local rabbis have responded by urging their followers to vaccinate their kids and there is some evidence that this has been effective. But on a global scale, attitudes and wariness of officialdom can be harder to shift. The WHO is concerned that there were more cases of measles in 2019 than in any year since 2006 and that multiple countries have declared outbreaks. Inevitably, children in the lowest-income countries are most at risk. A measles outbreak late last year killed more than 6,000 people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo alone. But measles isn\u2019t Sars or a new coronavirus, so the deaths attracted relatively little international attention. We live in paradoxical times. We buy more unproven, expensive \u201chealthcare\u201d products and treatments than ever before. Wellness products, such as those seen in Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s Goop Lab on Netflix, enjoy enormous success, even as they are criticised by figures like the head of the NHS. Many seem willing, even happy, to suspend disbelief to buy into fake science. But among the enthusiasm for unproven therapies rests a profound scepticism to orthodox, evidence-based healthcare. Committed anti-vaxxers sometimes display a sort of religious zealotry that makes attempts at dialogue deeply frustrating. But there is no reason to dismiss the concerns of parents and caregivers who worry about autism, the effects of vaccines and the interventions of the medical profession. Putting pressure on people, shaming them or forcing them to do something that they are scared of is never a good idea.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, I\u2019m Tim Walker with today\u2019s essential stories. Trump brags of \u2018great American comeback\u2019 amid walkouts Hours before his near-inevitable acquittal by the US Senate, Donald Trump on Tuesday delivered a State of the Union address so divisive and bullish that it prompted House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, to tear up the text, saying she could not find \u201cone page with truth on it\u201d. Having snubbed Pelosi\u2019s handshake before the speech, Trump bragged of a \u201cgreat American comeback\u201d, touting the economy and fanning the flames of the culture wars, to which Democrats responded with heckles and walkouts. Rush Limbaugh. Trump awarded the controversial conservative \u201cshock jock\u201d the Presidential Medal of Freedom during his address, a day after Limbaugh announced he had advanced lung cancer. Rhetorical flourish? In the absence of facts, says Richard Wolffe, Trump\u2019s speechwriters turned to nonsensical rhetorical flourishes, such as \u201cFreedom unifies the soul\u201d. What? Susan Collins says she will vote for president\u2019s acquittal Any lingering hope that Trump might yet be convicted in his impeachment trial was all but dashed on Tuesday when Susan Collins, the Republican senator from Maine who had last week voted in vain to hear from witnesses, said she would choose to acquit the president on both articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of congress. Senators continued making speeches on the matter before a final vote scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. Past presidents. Trump looks set to be the third president to remain in office following an impeachment trial. Tom McCarthy looks back to the previous examples for signs of what the near future might hold. Buttigieg claims victory in Iowa as partial results released Pete Buttigieg, the previously little-known 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, held a narrow lead over Bernie Sanders in the Iowa Democratic caucuses on Tuesday night, with 71% of precincts reporting. The partial results put Elizabeth Warren in third place, trailed by the erstwhile frontrunner, Joe Biden. The chaos of this year\u2019s caucus, apparently caused by a smartphone app, could see Iowa lose its long-held position as the nation\u2019s first primary state \u2013 and the outsize political influence that comes with it. Tech mishaps. In fact, Iowa is far from the first state to see its election day disrupted by untested new technology and administrative incompetence, as Andrew Gumbel reports. Cruise ship carrying quarantined in Japan over coronavirus A cruise ship carrying more than 3,700 passengers and crew has been quarantined off the coast of Japan after 10 people onboard tested positive for the coronavirus. In Hong Kong, anyone arriving from mainland China faces compulsory quarantine amid efforts to prevent the further spread of the outbreak, which has killed 490 people in China and infected more than 23,000. On Wednesday morning, markets and oil prices jumped following unconfirmed reports of an effective treatment for the virus. Escape from Wuhan. Australian Daniel Ou Yang shares his experience of being onboard an evacuation flight out of Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the outbreak. Cheat sheet At least 138 Salvadoran migrants and asylum seekers have been murdered and dozens more raped and tortured after being deported back to El Salvador by the US between 2013 and 2019, according to a report by Human Rights Watch. The number of homeless public school students in the US has gone up by 15% in the past three years, with more than 1.5 million students reported experiencing homelessness during the 2017-18 school year \u2013 the highest number in a decade. Twitter has said it will start to label and even remove doctored or manipulated content designed to mislead people, amid fears that partisan so-called \u201cdeepfake\u201d videos could be used to interfere with the 2020 election. Police in the Indian metropolis of Mumbai, describing their city as \u201cthe honking capital of the world\u201d, are trialling a new traffic light system designed to encourage patient driving by resetting the lights to red if the noise from car horns tops 85 decibels. Must-reads The obstacles US women face under capitalism For the Guardian\u2019s new series, Feminist Economics, Charlotte XC Sullivan explains how she made the difficult decision to give up a pregnancy for lack of paid parental leave, while Sophie Stuber finds out what happened when one firm chose radical transparency in an effort to close the pay gap. Making federal buildings \u2018beautiful again\u2019 The Trump administration has drafted an executive order mandating future federal buildings be designed in \u201cthe classical architectural style\u201d. But, as Martin Pengelly reports, that goes against longstanding government guidelines \u2013 not to mention the principles of 21st century liberal democracy. New York\u2019s Amazon workers condemn warehouse conditions Amazon has signed a deal to expand its New York warehouse space by 450,000 sq ft. But employees are unhappy about their working conditions at the city\u2019s existing warehouse sites, which, they tell Michael Sainato, are both unfair and unsafe. The unsettling art of the American deep south A landmark exhibition in Margate, England, collects the esoteric art of Alabama and its near neighbours in the US deep south to tell a secret history of black America, writes Lanre Bakare. Opinion The World Health Organization is facing criticism for how it allowed China to handle the early days and weeks of the coronavirus outbreak. But health diplomacy with an increasingly authoritarian Beijing is a difficult business, writes Peter Beaumont. [The coronavirus outbreak] asks how the UN\u2019s international health diplomacy, confronted with a potential pandemic where a timely and accurate flow of information is crucial, should interact with one of the world\u2019s most powerful, and controlling, states. Sport The Jacksonville Jaguars are to play two \u201chome\u201d games in London next year, potentially strengthening links with the UK as the franchise looks for ways to increase its revenue to compete with traditionally richer NFL sides. Barcelona is facing a crisis after Lionel Messi publicly called out the Catalan soccer giant\u2019s sporting director, his former teammate Eric Abidal, accusing him of tarnishing reputations by blaming players for the recent sacking of the team\u2019s coach, Ernesto Valverde.

      "body": "<p>\u201cWhat is the news from China?\u201d are the words that open the 1900 book World-Crisis in China, though they could equally apply to coverage of coronavirus. The short account of an anti-Christian uprising towards the end of China\u2019s Qing dynasty, written by the journalist Allen Sinclair Will, documented \u201ca startling succession of events that seem destined to shake the world\u201d. Today, a different crisis is unfolding across the country. An outbreak that began in the city of Wuhan, capital of China\u2019s Hubei province, has infected more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/04/what-is-coronavirus-china-wuhan-symptoms\" title=\"\">20,000 people</a>.

In a matter of days, the Communist party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/04/new-1000-bed-wuhan-hospital-takes-its-first-coronavirus-patients\" title=\"\">erected a hospital</a> that would take months to build elsewhere.

China\u2019s railway operator is using big data to <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/2020/01/30/china-railway-corporation-using-big-data-to-trace-potential-virus-carriers\" title=\"\">track down passengers</a> who were in the same carriage as those who contracted the virus. International coverage of China\u2019s response has tempered expressions of concern about the country\u2019s authoritarian politics with awe. Yes, Xi Jinping is an autocrat, the thinking seems to be, but he\u2019s also a pragmatist. \u201cLogistically, it\u2019s stunning,\u201d the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/world/asia/coronavirus-wuhan-china-hubei.html\" title=\"\">US public health expert William Schaffner said</a> of the Wuhan quarantine. \u201cIt was done so quickly.\u201d</p> <p>This wonder at China\u2019s logistical prowess is symptomatic of a recurrent trope among western commentators. We might call it the \u201cif we could just be China for a day\u201d view. For free-market economies such as Britain and the US, where the private sector has replaced state-run enterprises and public investment in infrastructure has shrunk over decades, China can seem like a miracle. The GDP of its state-controlled economy has <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=CN\" title=\"\">more than doubled in the past decade</a>, while its technology companies rival the giants of Silicon Valley. The journalist Thomas Friedman, for example, periodically claims that although he wouldn\u2019t want to see China\u2019s political model become an international standard, he enjoys fantasising about how <a href=\"https://www.mrc.org/articles/friedman-again-hails-communist-chinas-one-party-autocracy-superior-american-democracy\" title=\"\">dramatically his country\u2019s infrastructure could be improved</a> were Beijing\u2019s engineer-leaders free to work their magic.</p> <p>But when it comes to a public health epidemic, there are worrying limits to the Chinese Communist party\u2019s control. To maintain authority, the Chinese Communist party (CCP) must convince the public that everything is going to plan. This hampers its ability to respond to epidemics. Although the first case of coronavirus was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/51245373\" title=\"\">reported on 8 December</a>, the Wuhan health authorities took more than three weeks to issue a notice. As New York Times reporters Chris Buckley and Steven Lee Myers have found, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html\" title=\"\">doctor Li Wenliang warned an online chat group on 30 December</a> of a mysterious illness in the city, but was subsequently required to sign a police statement that his warning constituted \u201cillegal behaviour\u201d.

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhat is the news from China?\u201d are the words that open the 1900 book World-Crisis in China, though they could equally apply to coverage of coronavirus. The short account of an anti-Christian uprising towards the end of China\u2019s Qing dynasty, written by the journalist Allen Sinclair Will, documented \u201ca startling succession of events that seem destined to shake the world\u201d. Today, a different crisis is unfolding across the country. An outbreak that began in the city of Wuhan, capital of China\u2019s Hubei province, has infected more than 20,000 people. The World Health Organization has declared it a \u201cglobal health emergency\u201d. Coronavirus has thrown light on the sheer logistical power of the Chinese state. In a matter of days, the Communist party erected a hospital that would take months to build elsewhere. It has used drones equipped with speakers to force citizens to wear face masks and shut down 16 cities across the country, quarantining an estimated 50 million people. China\u2019s railway operator is using big data to track down passengers who were in the same carriage as those who contracted the virus. International coverage of China\u2019s response has tempered expressions of concern about the country\u2019s authoritarian politics with awe. Yes, Xi Jinping is an autocrat, the thinking seems to be, but he\u2019s also a pragmatist. \u201cLogistically, it\u2019s stunning,\u201d the US public health expert William Schaffner said of the Wuhan quarantine. \u201cIt was done so quickly.\u201d This wonder at China\u2019s logistical prowess is symptomatic of a recurrent trope among western commentators. We might call it the \u201cif we could just be China for a day\u201d view. For free-market economies such as Britain and the US, where the private sector has replaced state-run enterprises and public investment in infrastructure has shrunk over decades, China can seem like a miracle. The GDP of its state-controlled economy has more than doubled in the past decade, while its technology companies rival the giants of Silicon Valley. The journalist Thomas Friedman, for example, periodically claims that although he wouldn\u2019t want to see China\u2019s political model become an international standard, he enjoys fantasising about how dramatically his country\u2019s infrastructure could be improved were Beijing\u2019s engineer-leaders free to work their magic. But when it comes to a public health epidemic, there are worrying limits to the Chinese Communist party\u2019s control. To maintain authority, the Chinese Communist party (CCP) must convince the public that everything is going to plan. This hampers its ability to respond to epidemics. Although the first case of coronavirus was reported on 8 December, the Wuhan health authorities took more than three weeks to issue a notice. As New York Times reporters Chris Buckley and Steven Lee Myers have found, the doctor Li Wenliang warned an online chat group on 30 December of a mysterious illness in the city, but was subsequently required to sign a police statement that his warning constituted \u201cillegal behaviour\u201d. In a statement published the following day on its website, the Wuhan health authority announced that 27 people were affected by pneumonia \u2013 and said the disease was \u201cpreventable and controllable\u201d. The Sars disease rippled across the world in 2003, helped in part by the Communist party\u2019s attempts to conceal its spread for months. During the Sars outbreak, Hong Kong had greater press freedom than mainland China. This helped accurate information come to light there, mitigating some of the damage of China\u2019s attempts at an official cover-up. The Chinese government\u2019s grip over the internet, media and civil society has tightened dramatically since the Sars outbreak. Under Xi\u2019s rule, the party has taken an increasingly hardline stance towards Hong Kong, attempting to crush democratic protests and bring the territory under tighter control, while its censors have worked diligently to scrub the internet across the mainland of anything that diverges from the party\u2019s line. Articles and comments about coronavirus continue to be deleted online and the government has issued warnings against spreading \u201crumours\u201d. While the party claims to be learning everything it can from the Sars crisis, it seems blind to important lessons. That Beijing is determined to prevent Taiwan from joining the World Health Organization is another glaring example of how party ideologies have trumped pragmatism. Taiwan has long functioned as a self-governing country, but the CCP insists it is part of Chinese territory.

China has also shut virtually all of its cinemas in a move that is expected to result in a $1bn-plus hit to the global box office this year in the world\u2019s second-biggest movie market after the US.

      "bodyText": "It appears that investors think the worst of the coronavirus outbreak is well and truly priced in on stock markets, with a new record high for the tech-focused Nasdaq in the US. Strong US data has also added to a more positive mood, thanks in part to ADP jobs numbers beating expectations spectacularly. IHS Markit\u2019s services purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) recorded the strongest expansion in 10 months. A revised reading of 53.4 in January up from 52.8 in Decembe, above the 50 expansion mark. The oil price has surged, initially aided by a report of a coronavirus treatment that was played down by the World Health Organisation. Brent crude futures were up by almost $2 a barrel to $55.8 \u2013 a gain of 3.4% today. The US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, saw similar gains. In Europe markets have gained more than 1% in many of the major markets. Germany\u2019s Dax, which is particularly export-sensitive, rose by 1.4%. The UK\u2019s FTSE 100 has gained 0.8% to reach 7,496 points with under two hours of trading left. The FTSE 250 has gained 0.6%. Thanks for reading today, and join us tomorrow for more economics, business and markets. JJ And it\u2019s a record high for the Nasdaq, even amid a global public health emergency. Investor sentiment was buoyed earlier in the day by a Chinese TV report that an effective treatment had been found. The World Health Organisation quickly played this down, but the gains in stock and oil prices were nevertheless sustained. Confidence was also aided by the ADP jobs number, which suggested that the US private sector added twice as many jobs as expected. The US dollar has now gained 0.5% against the British pound, which fell below $1.30. Confirmed: a strong open in New York. The S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones both rose by 1%, while the Nasdaq increased by 1.1%. US stock futures are pointing to a strong open on Wall Street. S&amp;P 500 futures suggest a 0.8% bump at the opening bell, while the Dow Jones industrial average will gain about the same. Improved investor sentiment around the effects of the coronavirus (however warranted) appear to be one of the factors explaining the increase, while the ADP jobs numbers have added momentum for market bulls. Notable trade figures from the US: the trade deficit has fallen for the first time in six years in 2019 as the White House\u2019s trade war with China curbed the import bill. The US Commerce Department said on Wednesday the trade deficit fell 1.7% to $616.8bn last year, the first drop since 2013. The news does not quite fit the agenda of Trump, who also wants to make trading partners accept more \u201cmade in the USA\u201d products, theoretically boosting the regions with a high concentration of manufacturing jobs that backed him in 2016. Tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods imports from China (and the retaliation) appeared to weigh on trade. From Reuters: Goods imports tumbled 1.7% last year, with exports decreasing 1.3%, showing that the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda decreased the flow of goods. An interesting reading from the US ADP private payrolls number \u2013 it\u2019s an absolute blowout, the highest since 2015. The ADP number is often seen as a sneak preview of the crucial non-farm payrolls, the key US labour market indicator. That\u2019s due on Friday. ADP reported that the US private sector added 291,000 jobs in January \u2013 almost double the 156,000 expected by economists, and a big increase from the revised reading of 199,000 in December. Stock futures and the US dollar have both risen in the aftermath of the data. Music streaming service Spotify has reported that it added a record number of subscribers at the end of 2019, but it made an operating loss as it spent on promotions. The number of paying users rose by 11m in the final quarter of 2019 thanks to free trials. At the end of 2019 Spotify\u2019s number of monthly active users, including free users, had grown to 271 million, a 31% increase from a year earlier 2020 will be an \u201cinvestment year\u201d, Spotify said. *This post has been corrected: Spotify made an operating loss during the last quarter of 2019, not a loss. Mike Lynch, the man once hailed as Britain\u2019s Bill Gates, has submitted himself for arrest as he prepares to fight extradition to the US, where he faces fraud charges. Lynch has been involved in a long-running civil trial in the UK, where he has been accused of fraudulently inflating the value of Autonomy, the tech firm he founded and sold to Hewlett-Packard in 2011. Lynch denied all of the allegations. Representatives for the British businessman said the arrest is a formality, required as part of the extradition process initiated by the US Department of Justice. Lynch is contesting the extradition. In a statement Lynch\u2019s lawyers, Chris Morvillo and Reid Weingarten, said: Since HP first raised these allegations more than seven years ago, Dr Lynch has steadfastly denied them and has worked hard to properly respond and set the record straight. The UK SFO previously investigated and did not pursue the allegations. Dr Lynch has now answered HP\u2019s claims in the appropriate forum, the High Court in London, where he attended court every day of the 10-month trial. During that trial, Dr Lynch testified about all of these allegations for more than 20 days. He has not hidden, nor has he shied away from defending his conduct. Having patiently and diligently defended the case in England for several years, he awaits the civil trial judgment. The US DOJ should not have commenced extradition proceedings prior to the judgment of the English High Court. Dr Lynch vigorously rejects all the allegations against him and is determined to continue to fight these charges. Just after midday the FTSE has retreated slightly, for a gain of 0.6%. Sterling is up by 0.2% against the US dollar at $1.3056, and by 0.4% against the euro at \u20ac1.1844. Brent crude oil futures prices have also fallen back from the day\u2019s highs, but are still up by 2.3% today. Here\u2019s some lunchtime reading (for GMT readers at least): FTSE 100 firms including Tui, British Airways owner IAG and the London Stock Exchange Group have been accused of dragging their feet on diversity targets ahead of a looming 2021 deadline. Amazon employees under pressure to work faster have called on retail giant to improve conditions \u2013 and take their complaints seriously. Boris Johnson should consider setting targets to level up the UK\u2019s weakest regions to tackle widespread inequality, said a Bank of England official. An aside in the still extraordinary tale of Tesla in the last few days: even one of the investors responsible for the \u201cBig Short\u201d has had his fingers burned. Steve Eisman made a big bet against the housing sector before the financial crisis, earning him a portrayal by Steve Carell in the (excellent) Big Short film. But today he said that he has moved to cover his short (closing at least part of the position) in an interview with Bloomberg TV. There\u2019s only so far short sellers can hold on when shares surge, he acknowledged. Short sellers\u2019 potential losses are theoretically infinite as they must buy back the shares they have borrowed and sold on, even if the price has risen exponentially. In Tesla\u2019s case that has happened, with prices doubling in the course of 2020. Well let\u2019s see what the market reaction is to this: a World Health Organisation spokesman says there is no known treatment for coronavirus. The spokesman in Geneva said, via Reuters: \u201cThere are no known effective therapeutics.\u201d Markets have responded with extraordinary vigour to an unconfirmed report from Chinese television that an effective treatment had been found. So far oil prices and stock markets have sustained those gains. Expectations of larger central bank stimulus efforts may also have played into the gains, which came after prices dipped at the start of London\u2019s trading day. Vodafone is to remove Huawei equipment from the sensitive, core parts of its mobile networks across Europe at a cost of \u20ac200m (\u00a3169m) over the next five years. The group, which has 111 million customers across Europe, has taken the decision after the UK government\u2019s move last week to limit the use of Huawei equipment in the country\u2019s 5G network, writes the Guardian\u2019s Mark Sweney. Read the full story here: A quick stock market stock take: the FTSE 100 is up by 0.76%, flirting with the 7,500 point mark after the unconfirmed report of a coronavirus treatment buoyed investor sentiment. The Euro Stoxx 600 index has gained 1%, with Germany\u2019s export-sensitive Dax up by 1.2% and France\u2019s Cac 40 up by 0.9%. Oil prices have held on to most of their gains, with Brent crude futures still up by 2.8%. Some further reading on the implications of the coronavirus outbreak for you is here: And you can follow all the latest news on the outbreak more generally here: Protestors have blocked access to BP\u2019s head office in London to mark the first day for its new chief executive, Bernard Looney. More than 100 Greenpeace activists attempted to place 500 solar panels in front of the building in St James\u2019 Square, blocking the entrances with oil barrels, the group said in a statement. Police reportedly arrested nine activist, Reuters reported. Several activists chained themselves to the oil barrels. BP responded, via Reuters: Looney, who was visiting staff in Germany on Wednesday, shares the \u201cdeep concerns\u201d of the climate protesters, BP said in a statement. He will set out his vision for BP\u2019s response to the low carbon energy transition in a speech next week. BP said Looney \u201chopes that what he has to say then will give people a sense that we get it and are very serious about working to address the problem.\u201d Across the Channel, PMI readings suggest that the Eurozone economy also expanded faster than expected thanks to services \u2013 despite really weak retail sales. The PMI composite reading for the Eurozone was also stronger than flash data, at 51.3 points in January versus an earlier 50.9 expansion, IHS Markit said. (50 is the expansion mark.) Bert Colijn, senior Eurozone economist at ING, said: The final services PMI in January were better than expected. This indicates that recent service sector activity has been decent, despite the sharp decline in retail sales in December. December retail sales fell by 1.6%, bringing it down to its lowest reading since February 2019. Some reactions on the services PMI data. Pantheon Macroeconomics sugggests that the 16-month-high means the Bank of England\u2019s growth forecasts for the first quarter may be too low. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy, said that it was \u201canother encouraging sign that the post-election recovery in the economy is gathering momentum\u201d. He added It\u2019s clear responses received later in the month were much stronger than those at the start, consistent with the idea that the recovery is strengthening. Simon French, chief economist at stockbroker Panmure Gordon, injects a note of caution about volatility in the data, but adds that it seems there was an election bounce: Breaking off momentarily from coronavirus and PMI, new car sales in the UK fell by 7.3% in the first month of 2020, according to figures published today by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The lobby group blamed continued confusion surrounding diesel and clean air zones and ongoing weak consumer and business confidence for the declines. The industry is under serious pressure from the government\u2019s plans to bring forward a ban on all hybrid and other fossil fuelled cars to 2035. Some 149,279 vehicles left showrooms in January, with diesel sales down by more than a third and petrol sales also falling by a tenth. However, the rapid rise of battery electric sales continued, with sales tripling year-on-year. Sterling has risen against the euro and the US dollar in the wake of the services PMI reading. Against the euro the pound is up by 0.4% for the day at \u20ac1.1853, while it gained 0.25% against the US dollar to reach $1.3063. Yields on UK government bonds, gilts, rose to the highest in almost two weeks as investor demand for safe-haven debt diminished slightly. The 10-year gilt yield rose by four basis points to 0.606%. The election, and the consequent narrowing of Brexit possibilities, appeared to help UK business and consumer spending, IHS Markit said. Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit, said: January\u2019s PMI surveys give a clear signal that the UK economy has picked up since the general election, as a diminishing headwind from political uncertainty translated into rising business and consumer spending. Signs of greater willingness to spend and renewed positivity about the domestic economic outlook has helped lift service providers\u2019 growth projections to the highest for just under five years. The strongest reading for the UK services PMI in 16 months came because of increased confidence among businesses and consumers, according to IHS Markit. The reading is consistent with UK GDP rising by approximately 0.2% in the first quarter of 2020, the data company said. Survey respondents noted that the headwind from delayed decision-making had lifted since the general election and helped to deliver a return to business activity growth in January. This was also reflected in a robust improvement in order intakes, with the rate of new business expansion accelerating to its strongest since June 2018. However, the data were compiled before 23 January, when the outlook on the coronavirus outbreak worsened. The British services sector expanded faster than previously thought in January, according to IHS Markit\u2019s purchasing managers\u2019 index. The final reading for the closely followed index was 53.3 points, representing a stronger expansion than the 52.9 indicated by early data. That oil price reversal is gaining momentum: Brent crude futures prices are up by 3% at the time of writing at $55.60 per barrel \u2013 having started the day just above $54. US stock market futures have gained as well after the unconfirmed reports of an effective treatment from Chinese media. The price of futures tracking the S&amp;P 500 index of major US stocks have risen by 0.55% today, while the equivalent futures for the Dow Jones industrial average point to a gain of 0.7% for the blue-chip index. Oil prices, weighed down by concerns on coronavirus\u2019s impact on demand, have gained a dollar after the unconfirmed Chinese TV reports of a treatment. Brent crude oil futures prices jumped from a low of $54.12 per barrel just after 8am to over $55.1 an hour later. They are now up by 2.2% for the day. Stock markets have staged a rapid reversal in the last few minutes, apparently after a report of an effective treatment for coronavirus. The reports remain unconfirmed. The FTSE 100 is now up by 0.5% at about 7,477 points, having previously been down by 0.3%. The Euro Stoxx 600 index, which measures large companies across Europe, is now up by 0.5% for the day, having previously dipped. Reuters reports that traders have cited a Chinese TV report that a research team at Zhejiang University has found an effective drug to treat people with the new coronavirus. Here\u2019s the FTSE 100 performance: The biggest faller on the FTSE 100 is Imperial Brands, the tobacco maker, which fell by 9% after it warned that profits will be hit because of regulation on vaping products in the US. The company, whose brands include Davidoff, Gauloises and Lambert and Butler, on Wednesday said profits in the first half of the year will fall by 10% and cautioned on full-year earnings because of the ban on some flavours of cartridge-based vapour devices and weaker consumer demand, Reuters reported. Vaping was once hailed as the future for cigarette makers as users turned towards products they deem to be less likely to harm them, but they are suffering a backlash after a spate of deaths and lung injuries associated with their use. Imperial, whose main vaping brand is called Blu, said: Regulatory uncertainty and adverse news flow continues to affect demand in the US and Europe. European markets have dipped mildly at the open, with the FTSE 100 down by 0.3% and the FTSE 250 flat. France\u2019s Cac 40 index has fallen by 0.2%, while Germany\u2019s Dax is down by 0.26% in the first half hour of trading. It came after Asian markets rebounded again, following a delayed reaction on markets when investors returned from an extended lunar new year holiday. Bethel Loh, a macro strategist at forex trading platform ThinkMarkets, said: The truth of the matter is that [coronavirus\u2019s] impact remains significant and unknown, and still demands immediate interest from most affected economies. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The coronavirus outbreak remains the dominant theme across the business world, with supply chains disrupted in a crucial manufacturing region, widespread travel issues, and market volatility as investors try to work out longer-term effects. Airbus today became the latest company to warn of serious disruption. It said that its Tianjin final assembly line facility near Beijing is currently closed, and that travel restrictions inside China were causing logistical challenges. The Tianjin facility manufactures some of the company\u2019s A320 planes, which recently overtook Boeing\u2019s 737 as the bestselling family of aircraft ever. In a statement on Wednesday morning the European manufacturing giant said: Airbus is constantly evaluating the situation and monitoring any potential knock on effects to production and deliveries and will try to mitigate via alternative plans where necessary. Hong Kong\u2019s Cathay Pacific Airways has asked all its 27,000 employees to take three weeks of unpaid leave in coming months as it battles a fall in demand caused by the virus outbreak, the company said on Wednesday. Cruise operator Royal Caribbean yesterday warned that the virus would knock its earnings as it cancelled holidays in China and said that passengers from the region would be denied boarding. And US sportswear retailer Nike warned of a financial impact after it closed about half its own stores in China and cut operating hours at the rest. German rivals Adidas and Puma (founded by brothers) could also come under pressure, analysts warned. However, Asian markets rose on Wednesday, after previously sustaining heavy losses. Analysts at Deutsche Bank led by Craig Nicol said it may be slightly more positive news on the virus epidemiology that has improved market sentiment. The fact that there appears to be a slowing in independent incidents in countries outside of China and a slowing in the rate of transmission in cases outside of Wuhan province appear to be making investors more comfortable for now. It all comes at a time when the Chinese economy appeared to be slowing, as data this morning appeared to illustrate. Growth in China\u2019s services sector slowed for a second month in January, a traditionally busy sales season, hitting a three-month low as companies cut prices and new orders dipped, according to the Caixin purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI). The reading, which is unlikely to have felt the main effects of the outbreak because of the survey\u2019s timing, slowed to 51.8 last month, from 52.5 in December, but was still higher than an 8-month low hit in October, Reuters reported. The agenda 9am GMT: Eurozone services purchasing managers\u2019 index (PMI) (January) 9:30am GMT: UK services PMI (January) 10am GMT: Eurozone retail sales (December) 11:30am GMT: European Central Bank speech by Philip Lane, chief economist 12:15pm GMT: ECB speech by Christine Lagarde, president 1:30pm GMT: US balance of trade (December)",

If visitors booked and travelled to China before the virus became a \u201cknown event\u201d, it is likely they are still covered for medical expenses, although not all insurers will cover against cutting a trip short. Some insurers are referencing 21 January as the day it became a known event as this was the day China confirmed human-to-human transmission. Other insurers have said that cover will still be valid for any trips booked and taken up to the day after the FCO changed its advice (28 January).</p> <p>Direct Line says cancellation or curtailment of a trip will be covered for anyone travelling (or currently in China) in the next 28 days, if they booked before 29 January.

If people want to return early, it suggests contacting tour operators and travel agents for assistance and refunds in the first instance, but says if a trip was booked before the FCO advice changed, travellers will be covered for curtailment and helped with additional costs of returning home early. If travellers decide to change dates or routes for future trips to China, Alpha will amend policies without a fee.</p> <p>Similarly, Allianz Partners suggests contacting travel providers and airlines to obtain a refund in the first instance. Otherwise, travellers should check the T&amp;Cs of their policy for travel and transport cancellation cover, which varies between policies. As the World Health Organisation has not officially called the outbreak an epidemic or pandemic, it said most of its policies would not cover for curtailment. In support of the FCO advice, fees will be waived for changing the date or location of future single-trip policies and refunds issued for cancelling a future policy.</p>",

Tour operators have said they are cancelling trips due to depart in the next few months and are offering refunds, alternative dates or rerouting. Wendy Wu Tours, one of the UK\u2019s leading specialist tour operators to China, said it did not have any customers in China, and anyone due to travel in February had been contacted with alternative options. Those travelling in March, April or May have the option to choose a later date or an alternative tour, without an amendment fee \u2013 although cancellation fees apply. The company is confident there will not be any long-term impact on business, after seeing increased interest after the 2002\u201304 Sars outbreak. Asia specialist the Dragon Trip, which launched in 2011 offering group holidays in China, said it doesn\u2019thave any clients in China at the moment, and trips departing before 15 April have been cancelled, with a full refund, or the opportunity to change to a later date or alternative location. Japan and South Korea are proving popular alternatives. The company is confident that once the virus is under control and the FCO downgrades advice, tourism will bounce back. G Adventures has cancelled all departures to China up to and including 31 March, giving travellers the option to postpone, transfer to an alterative tour, or cancel and receive a full refund. Trailfinders has cancelled all trips until 30 April, is supporting those already in the country and is offering anyone with tours already booked alternative tours without amendment fees. Other tour operators, including Rickshaw and STA, advise travellers with trips booked to contact them for options to reroute on a case-by-case basis. What about insurance? In instances where tour operators do not offer a full refund, some travel policies may cover cancellation or curtailment \u2013 but many exclude outbreaks of viruses. However, the large number of cancelled flights, combined with restrictions in and out of affected areas, means some travel policies could still pay out. Cover is likely to depend on the date the policy was activated. If visitors booked and travelled to China before the virus became a \u201cknown event\u201d, it is likely they are still covered for medical expenses, although not all insurers will cover against cutting a trip short. Some insurers are referencing 21 January as the day it became a known event as this was the day China confirmed human-to-human transmission. Other insurers have said that cover will still be valid for any trips booked and taken up to the day after the FCO changed its advice (28 January). Direct Line says cancellation or curtailment of a trip will be covered for anyone travelling (or currently in China) in the next 28 days, if they booked before 29 January. Those wanting to continue their holiday would be covered for medical expenses subject to standard T&amp;Cs. Alpha Insurance has also said that any holidaymakers currently in China will continue to be covered, as long as they had arrived before the FCO advice changed. If people want to return early, it suggests contacting tour operators and travel agents for assistance and refunds in the first instance, but says if a trip was booked before the FCO advice changed, travellers will be covered for curtailment and helped with additional costs of returning home early. If travellers decide to change dates or routes for future trips to China, Alpha will amend policies without a fee. Similarly, Allianz Partners suggests contacting travel providers and airlines to obtain a refund in the first instance. Otherwise, travellers should check the T&amp;Cs of their policy for travel and transport cancellation cover, which varies between policies. As the World Health Organisation has not officially called the outbreak an epidemic or pandemic, it said most of its policies would not cover for curtailment. In support of the FCO advice, fees will be waived for changing the date or location of future single-trip policies and refunds issued for cancelling a future policy.",

That is a good way of showing that last year the economy was performing poorly; however, any measure that suggests last year was a recession, but the GFC was not, is a failure. We could also look at the private domestic economy \u2013 in effect GDP minus government spending and exports \u2013 to give us private sector \u201cgross national expenditure\u201d. This measure suggests we had a recession in 2001, 2009, 2014 and have also been in one since the end of 2018. That again highlights just how poorly the economy is currently performing, but perhaps suffers from the bar of a \u201crecession\u201d being set too low. It also means we are discounting exports which is not particularly useful when wishing to examine the entire economy. All these measures also suffer from a time lag. We will only find out the GDP growth of the March quarter on 3 June, and for the following quarter on 2 September. Thus we might be in a recession now, but will only have it confirmed in seven months time. The Grattan Institute\u2019s Matt Cowgill and a number of other commenters on Twitter suggested using a measure devised by an economist from the US Federal Reserve, Claudia Sahm. Her measure focuses purely on unemployment. This has the benefit of looking at the measure we most care about (do we give a damn if GDP shrinks, but unemployment doesn\u2019t rise?), and because unemployment figures come out each month, it is faster than GDP. She suggests comparing a rolling three month average of the unemployment rate with the lowest rate in the past 12 months. She argues when this goes above 0.5% pts, we are in a recession. Therefore, if the current three month average of the unemployment rate is 5.6%, and at some point in the past 12 months the rate was 5%, that would mean a gap of 0.6% pts and indicate a recession. This measure is similar to my ready guide of looking at the 12 months change in the unemployment rate. Indeed both measures have very similar \u201cpeaks\u201d, and both would indicate that we had recessions in 2001, during the GFC, and also went close to one from 2013-2015. You could quibble and argue a 0.5% pt change is too small for a recession, but the reality is most times when the gap goes above 0.5% pt, it then rises to 1% pt. We could also measure instead underutilisation and suggest a 1% pt increase is a recession. In that case we also did have a recession in 2014 and 2015. And what the Sahm measure also highlights is that when a recession occurs, it occurs quickly. On average the unemployment rate does not move at all each month \u2013 a 0.1% pt move one month will be cancelled out soon after by a 0.1% pt move in the opposite direction. But in the months before we hit a recession, the move is up, and up fast. This is again why relying on GDP to decide if we are in a recession is silly \u2013 not only does it miss out on the important aspects of the economy, it comes too late for policy maker to do anything about it. The good news is the current \u201cSahm rule\u201d measure of recession is just 0.22% pts, and it has improved recently. The bad news is things can change very quickly. This is why rather than waiting for the GDP to tell us if the bushfires and coronavirus have put us into a recession we, the government and the RBA should be watching the unemployment rate. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

Belgium\u2019s health agency announced on Tuesday that a Belgian woman was found to be carrying the virus after travelling back from Wuhan on a French repatriation flight on Sunday. Confirmation of the case has caused concerned among a group of 11 British residents who were on the flight with her and are now in quarantine in Arrowe Park in Wirral. They said they had not been given any information about it from the UK authorities. Jeff Siddle, his wife, Sindy, and their nine-year-old daughter, Jasmine, read about the Belgian case in media reports. Speaking to the Guardian, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s given us concern again.

The French chartered flight, which included evacuees from 30 different countries, landed at a military airbase in Istres, southern France. The non-French evacuees were then flown to their respective countries. Twenty evacuees presented some coronavirus symptoms and stayed at the military airbase to allow tests to be carried out. None of the 83 British people and 27 foreign nationals onboard the first UK-chartered evacuation flight, which left last Friday, have since been tested positive. Siddle believes that confirmation of the positive test for one of the passengers on the second flight may make treatment more complicated for the 11 UK evacuees who were onboard. He said: \u201cThe staff here know this is going to add an extra dimension on us compared to the first flight in terms of medical tests and screening and things, but we don\u2019t know exact details on that yet, it\u2019s still to be decided.\u201d A spokesman for the Foreign Office said it was aware that a Belgian woman on the flight had since tested positive.

He says the economic damage caused by coronavirus will play out over time.</p> <p>The crisis, he says, began with a sudden economic shock to Wuhan and the surrounding area. Factories were closed and travel restrictions imposed. In the next phase, plants were closed in the rest of China and more extensive restrictions of the movement of people came into force, first national and then cross-border.</p> <p>This is happening at a time when the global economy looks particularly vulnerable. Growth has slowed but a prolonged period of low interest rates has encouraged investors to take ever bigger risks, much as they did in the run-up to the financial crisis of 2007-08, when the feeling was that the good times would go on for ever.</p> <p>So could coronavirus prove to be the equivalent of the collapse of the US sub-prime mortgage market: a black swan? Those of a cautious bent, like El-Erian, think it could.</p> <p>A black swan event has a number of characteristics. It has to come as a complete surprise. It has to have profound consequences. And, once the dust has settled, people who never saw the crisis coming say that it was glaringly obvious that there was trouble ahead.</p> <p>The coronavirus outbreak would seem to tick all three boxes.</p>",

Even if coronavirus is contained as quickly as Sars, there will be a more marked impact. Third, if coronavirus does prove to be more serious than Sars, central banks will do whatever it takes to prevent a global stock market meltdown. Yet of all the world\u2019s major central banks, only the US Federal Reserve has much scope for cutting the cost of borrowing. Interest rates elsewhere \u2013 in the eurozone, Japan, and the UK \u2013 are at, or close to, rock bottom. For the past decade, financial markets have been conditioned to pile in every time share prices fall for fear that they are missing out on a buying opportunity. Sooner or later, that optimistic view of the world is going to be proved wrong. Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic adviser to the insurance company Allianz, thinks that moment may have arrived. He says the economic damage caused by coronavirus will play out over time. The crisis, he says, began with a sudden economic shock to Wuhan and the surrounding area. Factories were closed and travel restrictions imposed. In the next phase, plants were closed in the rest of China and more extensive restrictions of the movement of people came into force, first national and then cross-border. This is happening at a time when the global economy looks particularly vulnerable. Growth has slowed but a prolonged period of low interest rates has encouraged investors to take ever bigger risks, much as they did in the run-up to the financial crisis of 2007-08, when the feeling was that the good times would go on for ever. So could coronavirus prove to be the equivalent of the collapse of the US sub-prime mortgage market: a black swan? Those of a cautious bent, like El-Erian, think it could. A black swan event has a number of characteristics. It has to come as a complete surprise. It has to have profound consequences. And, once the dust has settled, people who never saw the crisis coming say that it was glaringly obvious that there was trouble ahead. The coronavirus outbreak would seem to tick all three boxes.",

Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine.

In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There have been no deaths from the virus in Japan, but it has the largest number of infections \u2013 33 \u2013 outside China.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus.

It was wrong to imply that the whole of China had an outbreak on the same scale as that in Wuhan in Hubei province, where it began and where most of the cases and deaths are still occurring, said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \u201cConsidering China as if the problem was the same in all provinces could be wrong \u2013 and it is wrong,\u201d said Tedros. \u201cFor instance, 80% of cases in China are in Hubei province, so that blanket approach may not help. \u201cWe are concerned that all countries make their decisions based on evidence. Even in China there are provinces with very few cases, like other countries in the neighbourhood and beyond.\u201d There have been 24,363 cases of the new coronavirus confirmed in China and 490 deaths, he said at a briefing in Geneva. In the previous 24 hours the largest number of cases were reported in a day since the outbreak began. Outside China, there were 191 cases in 24 countries and one death, in the Philippines.

The WHO was monitoring all the measures that countries outside China were taking and would be sharing its findings with other member states \u201cto try to bring some cohesion and order\u201d to countries\u2019 responses to the crisis. The new advice to British nationals in China came out of the blue on Tuesday in a statement from foreign secretary Dominic Raab: \u201cWe now advise British nationals in China to leave the country if they can, to minimise their risk of exposure to the virus.\u201d The advice came just a few days after the WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern, but urged countries not to impose travel or trade restrictions on China.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 6 February. Top stories Hazard reduction burning had little to no effect in slowing severe fires that devastated more than 5m hectares across NSW this summer, research from forest scientists has found. Scott Morrison told parliament on Wednesday that hazard reduction was at least as important as reducing greenhouse gas emissions in protecting Australians from future fires, but given the size of fires prescribed burning did not \u201cseem to have done much at all\u201d, the lead author Patrick Baker said. Meanwhile, a group of 31 former fire and emergency bosses will write to the prime minister on Thursday arguing that any royal commission into the bushfires will be a waste of time and money if it fails to examine the role of climate change in exacerbating them. A $165,000 Liberal party donation from a close friend of Scott Morrison who is also vying for a $1bn government contract has been slammed by Labor as \u201cfishy\u201d, with the party first confirming on Monday it had received the money \u2013 before the company director Scott Briggs and a Liberal spokesman both subsequently called that disclosure a mistake. A confidant of Morrison and former colleague of the immigration minister, David Coleman, Briggs heads a consortium that leads a bid to privatise Australia\u2019s visa processing system. It\u2019s not clear how the party came to accidentally declare the donation from a political consultancy business he founded. Labor\u2019s Andrew Giles has called for a \u201cfull and proper explanation\u201d. The global death toll from the coronavirus is approaching 500, with a newborn baby diagnosed with the virus just 30 hours after birth, the youngest of 24,500 confirmed cases. In Australia, there have been 14 confirmed cases. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, on Wednesday suggested Australians being evacuated from Wuhan could be sent to isolated mining camps should Christmas Island reach capacity. Near Japan, thousands of people, including up to 200 Australians, face the next fortnight trapped on the luxury cruise ship the Diamond Princess after 10 passengers on board tested positive. The cruise company says two Australians are among the confirmed cases. Australia A landmark inquiry into potentially illegal strip searches conducted on minors by police in NSW has been cut short, after the government sacked the commissioner responsible for overseeing the investigation. The government has called for a national expansion of the cashless welfare card despite claims by Indigenous and welfare organisations that the program is discriminatory. Luke Henrique-Gomes answers key questions about the card, while Nijole Naujokas explains how demeaning the experience can be for welfare recipients. The former Australian cricket captain Darren Lehmann will undergo heart bypass surgery at the weekend after being admitted to hospital on the Gold Coast with chest pains. Lehmann has told fans he\u2019s confident he\u2019ll be back on his feet soon. The world The Iowa Democratic party has released an incomplete tally from Tuesday\u2019s bungled count that has Pete Buttigieg with a leading percentage of delegates with 26.8%, ahead of Bernie Sanders (25.2%), Elizabeth Warren (18.4%) and Joe Biden (15.4%). Nearly 30% of the count remains to be confirmed. More than half a million Syrians have fled Idlib province after weeks of aerial bombardment from Bashar al-Assad\u2019s and Russian forces. Turkish troops have clashed with Syrian government fighters killing at least 20, amid fears of further escalations. Benjamin Netanyahu has backtracked on an immediate annexation of large parts of the West Bank, angering settlers who were led to believe that Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cvision for peace\u201d would fast-track their hopes. Early signs of cancer can appear years \u2013 even decades \u2013 before diagnosis, extensive research based on more than 2,500 tumour samples and 38 different types of cancer has suggested. Recommended reads There have been more than 10,000 nominations since the first Oscars ceremony in 1929. With the 92nd Academy Awards taking place on Sunday and gender representation once again in the spotlight, Guardian\u2019s data team have crunched the numbers. There\u2019s nothing so compelling as watching things go wrong \u2013 especially in the self-important world of broadcast news, writes James Colley. Like \u201cthe kind of fiasco you\u2019d usually associate with a school theatre production\u201d, from being bitten live on air by a pelican to fishing segments going horribly wrong, you can\u2019t beat bloopers.

Sport Super League bosses have voted unanimously to allow clubs a future veto over controversial signings in a response to the French club Catalan Dragons\u2019s signing of Israel Folau. The Catalans owner, Bernard Guasch, was absent from the meeting. AFLW footy is back. But after a bruising off-season filled with shock retirements and ongoing dissatisfaction over the competition schedule, Kirby Fenwick writes, none of the off-field conversations are quietening down. Media roundup More than 50,000 people are on hospital waitlists across Victoria, a blowout of 27% in the past six months, the Herald Sun reports, with some hospitals experiencing an increase of nearly 100%. Sales of electric cars have more than tripled in Australia in 2019, with industry figures encouraging Australia to follow the UK\u2019s lead and ban internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. And heavy rain is predicted for parts of drought-ravaged NSW, the ABC says, but rainfalls could be so significant on the mid-north coast that flash flooding could occur. Coming up The British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, will visit Canberra and meet officials. It is Raab\u2019s first overseas trip since the UK left the EU. Nicola Gobbo, the gangland barrister turned informer dubbed Lawyer X, will continue to give evidence at a royal commission into police use of informers. And if you\u2019ve read this far \u2026 A couple who won \u00a31m in the UK national lottery have decided what to spend it on: a pair of new knees. Fifty-year-old pub landlady Bev Dixon has been in constant pain, her husband, Malcolm, said. The couple initially thought they\u2019d won \u00a31,000, saying Bev was \u201cabsolutely over the moon\u201d \u2013 and that was before they realised their mistake.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Three people from mainland China on the ship between 19 and 24 January had been found to have contracted the virus.

It is not clear whether more tests would be carried out. None of the 10 infected people \u2013 three each from Japan and Hong Kong, two Australians, one American and one Filipino crew member \u2013 had severe symptoms, public broadcaster NHK said. Separately, health checks began on 1,800 passengers and crew on a second cruise ship docked in Hong Kong, after 30 staff members reported symptoms including fever, according to Reuters. Three people from mainland China on the ship between 19 and 24 January had been found to have contracted the virus. No passengers have been able to leave the World Dream ship, operated by Dream Cruises, without permission. Hong Kong\u2019s two cruise terminals, including the one where the World Dream ship is currently under quarantine, will also be closed, Lam announced. Countries have continued to heighten prevention measures, including Italy, which has begun taking the temperatures of all arriving passengers at its airports. On Tuesday, the UK government announced that all British nationals in China should leave \u201cif they can\u201d to reduce risk of exposure to the virus. The death toll in China has now risen to 490, according to the latest figures from the country\u2019s National Health Commission (NHC). An evacuation flight sent by the British government to Wuhan is expected to leave in the early hours of Sunday morning local time, and land at RAF Brize Norton. A total of 165 Britons and their dependents remain in the wider Hubei province. The US state department has said it may be staging additional evacuation flights on Thursday, while Japan said it would send a fourth chartered flight to bring back about 200 passengers. On Wednesday, charter planes sent by Thailand and New Zealand both returned home, while Russia and Uzbekistan also evacuated hundreds of people. On the Diamond Princess, passengers were told on Wednesday morning to remain in their rooms. Even before the announcement, most people had been staying isolated, said David Abel, a British passenger who has been on the ship for more than two weeks with his wife. \u201cIt was like a ghost ship. There were a few passengers at the bars having a drink, but it really was empty compared to how it had been over the past few days,\u201d he said. Now, he added, people were not permitted to open their doors to the corridor. \u201cThey bring food to us - it\u2019s a knock on the door. For the first time ever, the crew are masked up,\u201d added Abel. The couple were due to fly home to the UK on Monday, but had to cancel their flight after they were forbidden from leaving the ship. The 10 people who have tested positive, who are reportedly aged in their 50s to their 80s, were being removed from the Diamond Princess ship by the coastguard and taken to local hospitals. About half of the 2,666 passengers on board are from Japan, but there are also 223 Australians on the vessel. Photographs and video posted on Twitter by a Japanese passenger showed masked workers in blue plastic gowns walking down empty corridors on the ship, along with shots of deserted lounges and a barren deck. The passenger has also been tweeting announcements in English and Japanese, including Wednesday morning\u2019s confirmation that 10 people had tested positive. \u201cA lot of people on board are anxious about what happens next,\u201d the passenger wrote. \u201cI want to know what possible measures will be taken from now on. Will we spend the next 14 days stuck on the boat? Or 10 days? What will happen to the foreign passengers? Will even those who test negative have to stay? I want to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d Kato said the remaining passengers and crew \u2013 of 56 different nationalities \u2013 would be required to stay on the vessel for 14 days. Princess Cruises said that \u201cfood, provisions, and other supplies will be brought on board\u201d.",
