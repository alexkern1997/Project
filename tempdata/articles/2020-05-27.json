Police spotted the 76-year-old head of state in the outside dining area of the Vienna restaurant shortly after midnight on Sunday.

The country\u2019s Federal Association for Sexual Services has issued a statement insisting sex workers are not \u201csuper spreaders\u201d of the virus and proposing a three-step programme to reopen brothels, sex clubs and tabledance bars. The umbrella group argues that in most such establishments the \u201cworking situation\u201d is one of one-on-one contacts and thus comparable to hair salons or massage parlors. A cross-party group of 16 Bundestag MPs had last week proposed a long-term shutdown of all forms of prostitution in the wake of the pandemic: \u201cProstitution has the effect of a virus super spreader\u201d, the group said in an open letter. \u201cSexual acts are generally non-negotiable with social distancing.\u201d </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T09:50:48.308Z\">at 10.50am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eccdd598f0864e579f17c31\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T09:13:13.418Z\">10.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Indonesia </strong>has today reported 415 new confirmed cases of Covid-19, and 27 deaths.

In the meantime, these are the main developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Confirmed cases worldwide near 5.5m. </strong>According to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker, infections worldwide number at least 5,495,061. The death toll stands at 346,232. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting.</li> \n   <li><strong>WHO warns of \u2018second peak\u2019 in areas where Covid-19 is declining. </strong>Countries where coronavirus infections are declining could still face an \u201cimmediate second peak\u201d if they let up too soon on measures to contain the outbreak, the World Health Organization said on Monday. The WHO emergencies chief, Dr Mike Ryan, told an online briefing: \u201cWe cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave. We may get a second peak in this wave.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>Mexico City records thousands more deaths than usual, amid doubt over official Covid-19 toll. </strong>This year, Mexico City has issued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/mexico-city-records-thousands-more-deaths-than-usual-amid-doubt-over-official-covid-19-toll\">8,072 more death certificates than the average</a> for the same period in the past four years, according to a study that suggests the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll could be significantly higher than the official figure of nearly 7,400. The report\u2019s authors found 37% more death certificates were issued in April 2020 than that month\u2019s average during the previous four years. By the end of May they estimated the number may grow to 120%.</li> \n   <li><strong>White House brings forward Brazil travel restrictions by two days. </strong>The US has amended the timing of its Brazil travel ban to come into force at 11.59pm Washington time on Tuesday. It came as Brazil recorded a daily death toll higher than the US for the first time (807 versus 620). Brazil has the world\u2019s second highest number of infections. In its original announcement, the White House said the travel restrictions would come into force on 28 May.</li> \n   <li><strong>Dutch PM Mark Rutte did not visit dying mother due to Covid-19 restrictions. </strong>The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, was unable to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/dutch-pm-mark-rutte-did-not-visit-dying-mother-due-to-covid-19-restrictions\">visit his dying mother</a> in her final weeks because he obeyed coronavirus restrictions against visiting care homes, his office has said.

Bans on domestic travel, holding prayers in mosques, and workplace attendance in both the government and private sector will be lifted, starting 31 May, the statement added. For Mecca, the curfew time will be adjusted to 3pm-6pm and prayers will be allowed to be held in mosques from 21 June.</li> \n   <li><strong>Iceland eases national alert. </strong>Iceland eased its national alert against the coronavirus on Monday, allowing for public gatherings of up to 200 people and night clubs and gyms to reopen as the country nears complete recovery from the outbreak. Iceland, which limited the virus spread through a meticulous test-and-trace strategy and a full lockdown, has confirmed 1,804 infections and 10 deaths. But there have been only five reported new cases in May, and more than 99% of infected persons have recovered.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance-26-may\">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T06:22:11.474Z\">at 7.22am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecca31d8f0864e579f17a87\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T05:56:05.986Z\">6.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Global report: 'disaster' looms for millions of children as WHO warns of second peak</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The coronavirus pandemic will have a \u201cdisastrous\u201d impact on children\u2019s rights worldwide, making them more vulnerable to forced labour and underage marriage, a rights group has said, as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a> warned of an \u201cimmediate second peak\u201d in cases if restrictions were lifted too soon.</p> \n  <p>Millions of children would fall into extreme poverty because of the outbreak, which has left governments short of money for health and education for the young, Dutch NGO KidsRights said.</p> \n  <p>The NGO\u2019s warning came as the WHO emergencies head, Dr Mike Ryan, spoke of a potential second wave of infections at any time, especially if measures to halt the first wave were lifted too soon.</p> \n  <p>He said: \u201cWe cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave.

Matt Hancock told the No 10 daily press briefing the ability to tighten restrictions in individual regions would be part of the NHS test, track and trace system, which is due to expand on 1 June. According to the government\u2019s road map for easing lockdown restrictions, this could lead to local schools, businesses or workplaces being closed in areas with high prevalence of infection. Hancock said: \u201cWe will have local lockdowns in future where there are flare-ups and we have a system we are putting in place with a combination of Public Health England and the new joint biosecurity centre, along with the local directors of public health who play an absolutely crucial role in the decision-making in the system, to make sure if there is a local flare-up there is a local lockdown. \u201cAnd so local lockdowns will be part of the future system that we put in place as part of the NHS test-and-trace system.\u201d The government\u2019s road map for easing lockdown restrictions has set out how the joint biosecurity centre would have a \u201cresponse function\u201d that could address local spikes in infections, in partnership with local public health agencies, and impose restrictions. The Trump campaign has responded to Twitter adding fact checks to the president\u2019s false tweets about mail-in voting. \u201cWe always knew that Silicon Valley would pull out all the stops to obstruct and interfere with President Trump getting his message through to voters,\u201d Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale said. \u201cThere are many reasons the Trump campaign pulled all our advertising from Twitter months ago, and their clear political bias is one of them.\u201c It is important to note here that Twitter Inc. banned political ads in October 2019 \u2014 necessitating that the Trump campaign pull all its advertising from Twitter months ago. Here is the full story on Twitter labelling Trump\u2019s false claims with a warning for the first time. The Guardian\u2019s Julia Carrie Wong reports from San Francisco with Sam Levine in New York: Twitter for the first time took action against a series of tweets by Donald Trump, labeling them with a warning sign and providing a link to further information. Since ascending to the US presidency, Trump has used his Twitter account to threaten a world leader with war, amplify racist misinformation by British hate figures and, as recently as Tuesday morning, spread a lie about the 2001 death of a congressional aide in order to smear a cable news pundit. Throughout it all, Twitter has remained steadfast in its refusal to censor the head of state, even going so far as to write a new policy to allow itself to leave up tweets by \u201cworld leaders\u201d that violate its rules. The company\u2019s decision on Tuesday afternoon to affix labels to a series of Trump tweets about California\u2019s election planning is a result of a new policy debuted on 11 May. They were applied \u2013 hours after the tweets initially went out \u2013 because Trump\u2019s tweets violated Twitter\u2019s \u201ccivic integrity policy\u201d, a company spokeswoman confirmed, which bars users from \u201cmanipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes\u201d, such as by posting misleading information that could dissuade people from participating in an election. Twitter has added a fact-check warning to the bottom of a tweet by US President Donald Trump. Trump tweeted: \u201cThere is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged &amp; even illegally printed out &amp; fraudulently signed. The Governor of California is sending Ballots to millions of people, anyone.....\u201d Bellow the tweet there is now a link with the warning text \u201cGet the facts about mail-in ballots\u201d: On Sunday Trump suggested that supporters of mail-in voting were using the coronavirus outbreak to pull off a \u201cscam\u201d. Dan McGarry in Port Vila and Tess Newton Cain have this briefing for the Guardian on how the coronavirus has developed in the Pacific this week: The total number of cases of Covid-19 infection across the region stands at 292, an increase of 15 since last week, the majority of which were in Guam. The economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic looms larger and larger in the region as fears of widespread infection subside.

Brazilian nurse Rusia Goes gave birth while unconscious and breathing through a ventilator tube in April as she suffered severe Covid-19 symptoms. It would be nearly a month before the 42-year-old was reunited with her newborn daughter. She has told Reuters: Only God knows how much I missed that little one, who had been inside me, and all of a sudden was taken out because of all of this. Goes is one of at least 374,000 Brazilians infected by the virus, now the world\u2019s second-biggest outbreak after the United States. Over 23,000 people have died. While she normally works as a nurse in a neonatal intensive care unit, Goes stayed home once the pandemic started. But her husband Ednaldo Goes suspects he may have transmitted the virus to her as he continued to go out to work and shop for the family. When Rusia Goes checked into a Rio de Janeiro hospital with shortness of breath and other Covid-19 symptoms, she was just beginning the eighth month of her pregnancy. Doctors recommended a premature birth by cesarean section to better treat the mother\u2019s condition. The baby tested negative for the virus and was isolated from Goes, who was transferred to another hospital as her condition worsened. She said the battle with the respiratory disease was hard and \u201cvery painful,\u201d but slowly she was able to recover. She first met her daughter Luisa virtually, via a video link to her husband and the baby in another hospital. Goes was finally released from the hospital after two weeks and first met her daughter in person on 20 May \u2013 some 26 days after giving birth. Masked medical staff gathered with balloons and applauded as Goes left the hospital with her baby in her arms. \u201cTo hold her to my chest was so emotional,\u201d she said. Michigan\u2019s governor Gretchen Whitmer has come under fire as allegations arise that her husband has been trying to flout her strict shutdown rules \u2013 in what she says was a \u201cfailed attempt at humour\u201d. Affectionately nicknamed \u201cBig Gretch\u201d, Whitmer was thrust into the spotlight this year as her state battled one of the highest Covid-19 rates with one of the strictest lockdown policies in the country. But while Whitmer\u2019s strict stay-at-home order has been effective at flattening the curve in Michigan, it has also drawn strong criticism from conservatives and Democrats alike. The UK prime minister Boris Johnson has discussed the pandemic with the UN\u2019s secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and the director of the World Health Organization Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Downing Street says. On both calls, the prime minister set out the UK\u2019s support for the international effort to defeat coronavirus and for the work of the UN and WHO in helping to coordinate the global response. The prime minister and Dr Tedros agreed on the importance of an independent investigation into the origins of the coronavirus outbreak, so we can learn lessons to prevent future pandemics. The prime minister also confirmed he will participate via video message in the UN\u2019s upcoming Financing For Development in the Era of Covid-19 event to map out an equitable, green recovery from this crisis. Both Dr Tedros and Secretary-General Guterres reiterated their support for the UK-hosted Global Vaccine Summit on 4 June, which will raise vital funds to save the lives of millions of children worldwide. Officials have discovered dozens of unlicensed retirement homes in northern Mexico, raising fears that so far undetected coronavirus clusters may emerge in the thinly regulated sector. Reuters reports that the country\u2019s health department began investigating the industry after outbreaks in three registered private facilities in the state of Nuevo Leon. Officials closed 40 unregistered homes in and around the city of Monterrey. As of 25 May, there had been 88 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the three homes in Nuevo Leon, the department said on Monday. One person tested positive in a fourth home. Officials have not said if they have found evidence of outbreaks in the unregistered facilities, but said families should take home their elderly relatives. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest events: Confirmed cases worldwide exceed 5.5m. According to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker, known infections worldwide number at least 5,550,399. The known death toll stands at 348,302. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting. The WHO says the Americas are the new epicentre of the disease. The World Health Organization\u2019s regional director Dr Carissa Etienne said outbreaks were accelerating in countries such as Brazil, where the number of deaths reported in the last week was the highest in the world for a seven-day period since the coronavirus pandemic began. The number of coronavirus infections to accelerate in Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, she said. The UN refugee agency said Covid-19 had pushed its humanitarian work to near \u201cbreaking point\u201d in Yemen, a country devastated by five years of war. It said a growing number of families were resorting to begging, child labour and marrying of children to survive. A separate UN agency said it had only received around 15% of the funding required for the $3.38bn (\u20ac3bn) aid package for Yemen this year. Spain has declared 10 days of mourning starting on Wednesday for the nearly 27,000 people who have died from coronavirus in the country. Flags will be hoisted to half-staff in more than 14,000 public buildings across the country and on Spanish naval vessels until 5 June. It marks the longest official mourning period in Spain\u2019s four-decade-old democracy. The UK death toll passed 47,000, according to new figures from the country\u2019s Office for National Statistics. This figure is higher than the latest figure given by the UK government \u2013 nearly 37,000 \u2013 because it includes deaths in which Covid-19 is given as a \u201csuspected\u201d cause. The UK government figure only includes deaths of patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus. Russia reports record one-day rise in deaths. Russia has announced that 174 people with coronavirus have died in the past 24 hours, a record one-day amount that has pushed the nationwide death toll to 3,807. Officials reported 8,915 new cases, pushing its overall case tally to 362,342 \u2013 but Vladimir Putin said the country has \u201cpassed the peak\u201d of the virus. Mexico City records thousands more deaths than usual, amid doubt over the official Covid-19 toll. This year, Mexico City has issued 8,072 more death certificates than the average for the same period in the past four years, according to a study that suggests the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll could be significantly higher than the official figure of nearly 7,400. The report\u2019s authors found 37% more death certificates were issued in April 2020 than that month\u2019s average during the previous four years. By the end of May they estimated the number may grow to 120%. Bosses at a UK hospital that has temporarily stopped accepting new patients due to the high number already being treated there with Covid-19 have said there is an \u201cemerging picture of asymptomatic staff testing positive for the virus\u201d. Weston General Hospital in Weston-super-Mare, in Somerset, stopped taking new admissions, including into its A&amp;E department, from 8am on Monday \u201cto maintain patient and staff safety\u201d. In an update on Tuesday evening, Dr William Oldfield, the medical director at the University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust, said: There are currently a high number of patients with coronavirus in the hospital. We have tested all inpatients and will undertake retesting in line with national guidance, and we have appropriate segregation in place for patient care. Testing for symptomatic staff and household contacts has been offered across the trust since the beginning of April. In addition, there is an emerging picture of asymptomatic staff testing positive for the virus. Any members of staff who have tested positive have self-isolated in line with national guidance. We are also in the process of testing all staff in clinical areas at the hospital who may have had some patient contact. Appropriate levels of personal protective equipment (PPE) are available and this is being used in line with Public Health England guidance, and there have been significant efforts to minimise unnecessary staff movements across the hospital. The final weekend of June should have seen 200,000 revellers descend on Somerset for the 50th anniversary of the Glastonbury festival. With the event cancelled owing to the pandemic, the BBC has announced extensive broadcast plans celebrating the British music institution from 25-29 June. David Bowie\u2019s headline set, from the year 2000, will be shown in full for the first time ever as part of the coverage across BBC Two, BBC Four and iPlayer. The coverage will also feature full headline performances from Jay-Z, Beyonc\u00e9, Adele and Coldplay. The Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli has said that he caught the virus but had fully recovered by March. After attending hospital to donate blood to Covid-19 research, the singer posted on Facebook, writing: The pandemic which has shaken the world has also affected \u2013 albeit mildly \u2013 me and certain members of my family. Out of respect for those for whom contracting the virus has had more serious consequences, I decided it would be best not to share the news. I certainly didn\u2019t want to unnecessarily alarm my fans and also wished to protect my family\u2019s privacy. We were fortunate enough to have a swift and full recovery by the end of March. Given the chance to donate blood to help find a cure for Covid, my response was an immediate \u2018yes\u2019. A modest \u2013 but fundamental \u2013 gesture, through which I am playing my small part. Saudi public sector employees will start returning to work gradually as of Sunday 31 May after more than two months of suspension, Reuters reports. Public sector workers will eventually resume work as normal as of 14 June, the Saudi minister of human resources Ahmed al-Rajhi has said. Saudi Arabia suspended work in all government sectors except health and security on 16 March. The government said on Monday it will begin easing restrictions on movement and travel this week. Restrictions will be lifted in three phases, culminating in the curfew completely ending from 21 June, with the exception of the holy city of Mecca, the state news agency reported. Environmental campaigners have reacted with outrage after a provincial energy minister in Canada said restrictions on public gatherings make it a \u201cgreat time\u201d to push on with a contentious pipeline project. During a podcast hosted by the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors, Alberta\u2019s energy minister Sonya Savage was asked about the Trans Mountain expansion project, which is under construction despite fierce opposition from environmentalists and some Indigenous groups. Now is a great time to be building a pipeline because you can\u2019t have protests of more than 15 people. People are not going to have tolerance and patience for protests that get in the way of people working. People need jobs and those types of ideological protests that get in the way are not going to be tolerated by ordinary Canadians. Her comments prompted disbelief and indignation among environmentalists. Walking Eagle News, an Indigenous satire news site, tweeted: \u201cWe didn\u2019t write this one. But holy shit, do we wish we had.\u201d After months of protest, the prime minister Justin Trudeau announced in May 2018 that his government would buy the $3.45bn (\u00a32.79bn) project from Texas-based Kinder Morgan to ensure it was completed. Canada\u2019s finance minister at the time described the Trans Mountain expansion as a \u201cvital interest\u201d for the country. Trudeau\u2019s government has also said it is keen to sell the project to investors \u2013 including First Nations business coalitions. But continuing protests and court battles have slowed the project, much to the frustration of the current conservative government in Alberta, which is eager to see the project completed. In February, the government introduced controversial legislation that would levy heavy fines \u2013 and even jail time \u2013 for protesters who looking to disrupt energy infrastructure projects. The bill has passed and needs royal assent to come into force. The Guardian has published its editorial on the UK government\u2019s continued refusal to sack Dominic Cummings over his lockdown breaches. The government\u2019s serious mistakes in this crisis, contributing to the highest death toll in Europe, have already imperilled public trust in its stewardship. A new study at the weekend confirmed a truth already settled in the public mind \u2013 that unnecessary delay in locking down cost lives. People believe, with good reason, that the safety of residents in care homes was culpably neglected. The move from \u201cstay at home\u201d to \u201cstay alert\u201d has been muddled and confusing. The unique social contract agreed in March must hold if the country is to stick together in the months to come, but it currently feels fragile. The failure to remove Mr Cummings risks undermining it still further. I\u2019m handing over to my esteemed colleague Kevin Rawlinson shortly, so I\u2019ll leave you with a summary of today\u2019s main global developments on the coronavirus pandemic: Confirmed cases worldwide exceed 5.5m. According to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker, infections worldwide number at least 5,543,439. The death toll stands at 347,836. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting. The WHO says the Americas are the new epicentre of the disease. The World Health Organisation\u2019s regional director Dr Carissa Etienne said outbreaks were accelerating in countries such as Brazil, where the number of deaths reported in the last week was the highest in the world for a seven-day period since the coronavirus pandemic began. The number of coronavirus infections to accelerate in Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, she said. The UN refugee agency said Covid-19 had pushed its humanitarian work to near \u201cbreaking point\u201d in Yemen, a country devastated by five years of war. It said a growing number of families were resorting to begging, child labour and marrying of children to survive. A separate UN agency said it had only received around 15% of the funding required for the $3.38bn (\u20ac3bn) aid package for Yemen this year. Spain has has declared 10 days of mourning starting on Wednesday for the nearly 27,000 people who have died from coronavirus in the country. Flags will be hoisted to half-staff in more than 14,000 public buildings across the country and on Spanish naval vessels until 5 June. It marks the longest official mourning period in Spain\u2019s four-decade-old democracy. The UK death toll passed 47,000, according to new figures from the country\u2019s Office for National Statistics. This figure is higher than the latest figure given by the UK government \u2013 nearly 37,000 \u2013 because it includes deaths in which Covid-19 is given as a \u201csuspected\u201d cause. The UK government figure only includes deaths of patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus. Russia reports record one-day rise in deaths. Russia has announced that 174 people with coronavirus have died in the past 24 hours, a record one-day amount that has pushed the nationwide death toll to 3,807. Officials reported 8,915 new cases, pushing its overall case tally to 362,342 \u2013 but Vladimir Putin said the country has \u201cpassed the peak\u201d of the virus. Mexico City records thousands more deaths than usual, amid doubt over official Covid-19 toll. This year, Mexico City has issued 8,072 more death certificates than the average for the same period in the past four years, according to a study that suggests the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll could be significantly higher than the official figure of nearly 7,400. The report\u2019s authors found 37% more death certificates were issued in April 2020 than that month\u2019s average during the previous four years. By the end of May they estimated the number may grow to 120%. A diplomatic rift has broken out between Tanzania and the US. The East African nation said it had summoned the top official at the US embassy to object to an advisory that warned of \u201cexponential growth\u201d of Covid-19 cases in the country. Tanzania\u2019s divisive leader John Magufuli has repeatedly played down the gravity of the coronavirus pandemic, appearing to model his response on the early approach taken by Donald Trump in the US. The US embassy\u2019s advisory, published earlier this month, reported that \u201cmany hospitals\u201d in Dar es Salaam, the economic capital, \u201chave been overwhelmed in recent weeks\u201d \u2013 a claim the Tanzanian government has hotly denied. On Tuesday it emerged that the US embassy\u2019s charge d\u2019affaires, Inmi Patterson, had been summoned by Wilbert Ibuge, permanent secretary at the foreign ministry, who \u2013 according to the AFP news agency \u2013 reminded Patterson about the two countries\u2019 \u201chistorical cooperation\u201d. A diplomatic ticking off, in other words. My colleague Peter Beaumont reported last week on how Magufuli had said the economy was \u201cmore important than the threat posed by coronavirus\u201d and that the country was preparing to reopen for tourism \u2013 despite warnings that Africa could face the next wave of the disease. France\u2019s coronavirus death toll has risen by 73 to 28,530, a similar rate of increase as the day before despite health authorities having resumed taking into account nursing home data after a four-day interruption. In a statement, the health ministry said the number of fatalities was up 83 in hospitals, to 18,195. But the death toll in nursing homes has been revised to 10,335, 10 fewer than the last time it was published, Reuters reports. Here\u2019s a dispatch from Wilfredo Miranda Aburta, a journalist in Managua in Nicaragua: Amid a wave of criticism for his government\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic, Nicaragua\u2019s president Daniel Ortega has claimed that the country has instead offered an example to the world. Ortega has been widely blamed for downplaying the threat of Covid-19 and covering up data on its impact in Nicaragua, but in a \u201cwhite paper\u201d published on Monday, the Sandinista leader claimed his government had come up with an \u201cexcellent\u201d strategy to survive the pandemic. \u201cNicaragua and Sweden represent alternatives to the total lockdown in developing and developed countries,\u201d claimed the document, which was launched by Ortega\u2019s wife and vice-president Rosario Murillo - and addressed \u201cto the Nicaraguan people and the world.\u201d The government document was published on the same day that the Pan-American Health Organization announced that community spread of the coronavirus had been confirmed in Nicaragua. Healthcare workers in the country have described hospitals overwhelmed with patients and morgues overflowing with dead bodies. Doctors have reported a surge of deaths from lung problems associated with Coronavirus, and many patients are being buried in the dead of night. These \u201cexpress burials\u201d involve sealed caskets and bodies wrapped in plastic \u2013 as recommended by the country\u2019s health ministry in coronavirus deaths \u2013 but the dead are not included in the official Covid-19 death toll. But far from recognizing the gravity of the situation, the document defends the \u201csuccess\u201d of the government\u2019s policies and claims that the country has seen just 17 deaths and 279 cases of Covid-19 - far below independent estimates of at least 2,000 cases. The document also fails to answer how many Covid-19 tests have been undertaken in the country, and does not explain a sudden surge in registered deaths which the country has seen in the past three weeks. Ortega \u2013 who two years ago survived a popular uprising during which more than 300 people were killed \u2013 has accused the political opposition of exaggerating the scale of the outbreak in order to undermine him. \u201cThe coup-plotting opposition are hoping that the pandemic brings them a chance to weaken the government and the national economy,\u201d the document said. Staying on Brazil for a moment, a University of Washington study published yesterday warned that the country\u2019s death toll could climb five-fold to 125,000 by early August, adding to fears it has become a new hot spot in the pandemic. The forecast from the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), was released as Brazil\u2019s daily death toll climbed past that of the United States. Its health ministry announced 807 deaths in the last 24 hours compared to 620 in the US, according to Reuters. Dr Christopher Murray, director of the IHME, said: Brazil must follow the lead of Wuhan, China, as well as Italy, Spain, and New York by enforcing mandates and measures to gain control of a fast-moving epidemic and reduce transmission of the coronavirus. Without such measures, he said Brazil\u2019s daily death toll could keep climbing to until mid-July, driving shortages of critical hospital resources. Some of Brazil\u2019s top news organisations are to suspend reporting from outside the presidential residence in the latest sign of deteriorating press freedoms under the country\u2019s media-bashing president, Jair Bolsonaro. My colleague Tom Phillips reports from Rio de Janeiro that the decision follows months of verbal attacks on reporters outside the Pal\u00e1cio da Alvorada in Bras\u00edlia by hardcore supporters of the far-right president. The harassment reached new heights on Monday as journalists were subjected to a vicious torrent of abuse from Bolsonaristas, with footage showing reporters being called scum, rats, extortionists, rogues, crooks and sons of bitches. The World Health Organization (WHO) says the Americas are the new epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, highlighting in particular the rapid growth of cases in Central and South America. In a videoconference, the WHO regional director Dr Carissa Etienne said outbreaks were accelerating in countries such as Brazil, where the number of deaths reported in the last week was the highest in the world for a seven-day period since the coronavirus pandemic began. Etienne said she expected the number of coronavirus infections to accelerate in Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua and that now was not the time for countries to be relaxing restrictions. Is this the future of cinema? My colleague Philip Oltermann shares this picture of a theatre in Berlin. One thing that strikes me is just how close to each other the seats used to be. Spain\u2019s health ministry has said a total of 27,119 people have died from the coronavirus since the beginning of the outbreak. This is up 285 from the 26,834 total calculated by the John Hopkins University on Monday. Confirmed cases of the virus in Spain have reached 236,259, the ministry said. On Monday the government revised down the country\u2019s cumulative death toll by nearly 2,000 after checking data provided by regions, a move which drew sharp criticism from politica opponents. Lebanon\u2019s government says it will on Friday introduce fines of 50,000 Lebanese Lira ($12) for anyone caught without wearing a face mask in public. The move comes as officials say they have sourced one million masks, which will be distributed among citizens. At the same time, the country\u2019s health minister said the fragile Mediterranean State was moving towards re-opening more of its economy, which has been largely shuttered throughout the Covid-19 crisis. Pubs and cafes were allowed to open two weeks ago, but then shut down again for four days after a spike in infections, many of them detected in repatriated expats. Bars and cafes are again open this week, and concerns persist over lax social distancing standards. Malls, swimming pools, gyms and the country\u2019s only international airport remain closed. The Spanish government has declared 10 days of mourning starting on Wednesday for the nearly 27,000 people who have died from coronavirus in Spain, the longest official mourning period in the country\u2019s four-decade-old democracy. Flags will be hoisted to half-staff in more than 14,000 public buildings across the country and on Spanish naval vessels until 5 June, reports Associated Press. King Felipe VI, as Spain\u2019s head of state, will preside over a solemn memorial ceremony once the country emerges from the lockdown imposed two and a half months ago, the government said. Syrian authorities have loosened coronavirus lockdown restrictions by cancelling a night-time curfew, allowing travel between provinces and announcing a reopening of mosques, state media said. The government said on Monday it would end nighttime curfews starting today, allow travel between provinces and allow shops and malls to open from 8am to 7pm (0500 GMT and 1600 GMT) during summer, state news agency SANA said. The country\u2019s endowments ministry said mosques would be allowed to reopen fully from tomorrow after a temporary ban on public prayers because of Covid-19, according to SANA. Syria\u2019s borders, however, remain closed. The decision comes as the war-torn country grapples with a crippling economic crisis and official cases of Covid-19 continue to rise. Vladimir Putin said Russia has passed its peak of coronavirus infections, on the same day the country recorded its highest daily death toll. After peaking in mid-May at more than 11,000 new cases per day, the number of daily infections in Russia has dropped below 9,000. On Tuesday, the country recorded its highest daily death toll of 174 \u2013 a number still far lower than in countries with similar rates of infections. Speaking on Russian television, Putin said \u201caccording to experts, the peak can be considered passed\u201d, according to the AFP news agency. The Russian president also ordered a second world war victory parade postponed by the pandemic to be held on 26 June. Here\u2019s an update from Leyland Cecco in Toronto, Canada: Nearly half of Canadians believe their government isn\u2019t providing the whole truth about Covid-19, according to a poll released on Tuesday. The online survey, conducted by Leger and the Association for Canadian Studies, sampled 1,510 adults and found 50% suspected governments were deliberately withholding information about the coronavirus pandemic. Canada has recorded 85,711 cases of Covid-19 and nearly 6,600 deaths. \u201cIt\u2019s staggering, in a period where I believe trust has never been as high,\u201d Leger\u2019s vice-president, Christian Bourque, told the Canadian Press, referring to findings in the poll that suggested residents largely supported the government response to date \u2013 but are nonetheless sceptical of government honesty. Nearly 70% said they were satisfied with their local government\u2019s action against the virus. Three-quarters of respondents said they support federal government\u2019s response and 78% supported their respective provinces. Respondents also expressed scepticism towards government messaging and disclosure of information. Mistrust was greatest in Quebec \u2013 the country\u2019s centre of Covid-19 cases\u2014 where 60% of those polled believe governments are keeping secrets about the virus. Respondents were also asked if they agree with certain fringe and conspiracy theory about the virus. Almost 20% of respondents believed the number of deaths attributed to Covid-19 is inflated. One-third said they believe the virus was created in a lab, or by the Chinese government. The poll also found that half of Canadians believed masks should be necessary and 88% worried about a second wave of the pandemic arriving in the autumn. Hungary aims to lift a state of emergency introduced to tackle the coronavirus crisis on 20 June, its justice minister has said, potentially bring to an end Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s controversial power to rule by decree. In late March, Hungary\u2019s parliament gave Orban, the country\u2019s rightwing nationalist prime minister, the right to rule by decree indefinitely as part of a package of measures aimed at fighting coronavirus. The law was heavily criticised for failing to set a clear time limit on the state of emergency, and for introducing potential jail sentences for people who spread false information. Earlier this month, this led to raids on individuals criticising the government on Facebook. Orban had said that parliament could at any time cancel the special powers, which he said were necessary to curb the coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout. Today a government spokesman, Zolt\u00e1n Kov\u00e1cs, confirmed that these special powers would also end on 20 June alongside the state of emergency, Reuters reports. Kovacs said the two \u201cby definition go hand in hand\u201d. The coronavirus pandemic will no doubt change many of our lives in different ways. If you live in the Chinese city of Hangzhou, that could soon mean having a personalised health passport on your smartphone at all times. The city was one of many in China that introduced a health-tracking app that displays a person\u2019s virus status, which can then be used to determine the extent to which they can move about. Authorities in Hangzhou say they\u2019re now planning to make this app a permanent fixture for its 10 million citizens, reports my colleague Helen Davidson: In the proposed app an individual\u2019s status would be colour-coded and scored out of 100 based on medical records, physical test results, levels of activity and other lifestyle choices such as smoking. Screenshots of the proposed app showed a numeral and colour bar indicating the relative health of the user, and the tracking of factors that contribute to the score, including the number of cigarettes smoked that day, steps taken, or hours slept. Control over Germany\u2019s lockdown measures is increasingly slipping from Angela Merkel\u2019s grasp as more federal states announced unilateral steps to loosen restrictions, creating a patchwork of wildly varying rules on social distancing within the country. Winfried Kretschmann, the premier of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, announced on Tuesday his state would from 1 June allow seated public events with up to 100 people, adding that there were no plans for further plans to hold the video conferences in which the leaders of Germany\u2019s 16 L\u00e4nder had until now coordinated their handling of the pandemic. Other states simultaneously announced they would loosen restrictions around different parts of public life: the mayor of Hamburg, for example, said the city state would over the coming days reopen cinemas, open-air swimming pools and gyms. On Monday, Merkel\u2019s government had postponed a meeting of its \u201ccorona cabinet\u201d after the premier of Thuringia announced plans to end both the obligatory wearing of face coverings and the limit on the number of people allowed to gather within the next two weeks. Leftwing state premier Bodo Ramelow said on Tuesday that mandatory mask-wearing on public transport, as well as the required 1.5-metre safety distance, would remain in place for now. On Wednesday, Merkel\u2019s cabinet will vote on a motion to lift the current travel warning on 31 European countries by 15 June, thus potentially allowing German tourists to travel abroad for their summer holidays this year. Under the proposal, the general travel warning that has been in place since 17 March would be replaced by individual travel advice tailored to the spread of the pandemic in each country. Devi Sridhar, professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh, has criticised the UK\u2019s decision to focus on the lockdown over other mitigation methods like contact tracing, saying she \u201cdoesn\u2019t really understand what the point of the lockdown has been\u201d. Speaking at the online iteration of the Hay festival, Sridhar said it was \u201cnot clear\u201d to her that the UK was in a better position now than it was when the lockdown started nine weeks ago, on 23 March. She said: You want to enter and exit [lockdown] as fast as possible, not stay in lockdown longer than you need to be \u2026 we still have no border checks in place, until those come into place in June. Cases are exploding in Brazil, India, Russia, the US, countries in South America are taking off, and we have no checks on people coming from any countries while people are locked at home, suffering the economic and social consequences. I think it is frustrating, it has been a very expensive time, but I don\u2019t really understand what the point of it has been. It has helped build NHS capacity but beyond that, lockdown is not a good option.\u201d She added: \u201cIn the UK and the US, we\u2019re hearing it is a capacity issue and I think, it can\u2019t be a capacity issue because I\u2019ve seen this done in war-torn Congo for Ebola, in Vietnam, in Thailand, in states in India, in incredibly poor contexts. To say it is a capacity issue does not fit with the reality of being one of the richest countries in the world\u201d. Sridhar went on to praise New Zealand, South Korea, Greece and Senegal\u2019s handing of the pandemic. The Faroe Islands are looking splendid today. This is from Kristina H\u00e1foss, an MP on the remote island, who says the country will \u201cprobably\u201d demand that visitors are tested for Covid-19 before being allowed on the territory. Hello again. Josh Halliday again here to steer you through the next few hours. Global airlines have urged governments to keep politics out of coronavirus border controls after Britain and France revealed reciprocal quarantine rules. France has signalled it will impose equivalent measures after Britain announced a 14-day quarantine for people arriving from mainland Europe, including France, from 8 June. Alexandre de Juniac, director general of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), said any border restrictions related to the epidemic should be driven purely by science. \u201cTit-for-tat quarantine measures unacceptable,\u201d he told an online weekly news conference. He added later that IATA would not comment on the actions of individual states. Spain will seek the highest amount possible in transfers from the European Union\u2019s coronavirus emergency funds, government spokeswoman Maria Jesus Montero has said. \u201cWe will keep fighting so that the transfers are the largest possible and so it doesn\u2019t mean debt for Spain\u2019s government,\u201d she told a news conference following the weekly cabinet meeting. The European commission will propose on Wednesday its blueprint for the 27-nation bloc\u2019s budget, known as the Multiannual Financial Framework and worth around a trillion euros, and the accompanying coronavirus Recovery Fund. Hungary\u2019s government expects to end a state of emergency on 20 June, the justice minister, Judit Varga, said on her Facebook page, as the government prepares to submit a bill ending its emergency powers, such as the power to rule by decree. The emergency powers were granted to the government earlier this year in a bill that contained no end clause. Cambodia\u2019s strongman premier Hun Sen will be glorified as a \u201chandsome hero\u201d in a soon-to-be-published book chronicling the decisions he has made during the Covid-19 pandemic. The book\u2019s translated English title is Hun Sen: The Handsome Hero Who Went Against the Current to Fight Covid-19, and will be available by late June or early July. Penned by Hun Sen\u2019s advisers and members of the Khmer Writers Association (KWA), the 270-page book will detail the bombastic leader\u2019s unconventional decisions, and will include his speeches. Pov Sok, an advisor to the premier and member of the KWA, told AFP: We want to show in history that Cambodia fought against the deadly disease and that it controlled the situation better than others. We compiled this book as a history for humanity. Hun Sen drew headlines in early February for travelling to Beijing in a show of solidarity as China struggled to contain the virus. He also allowed a US cruise ship to dock after it had been turned away from several ports over fears its passengers could be carrying the coronavirus. \u201cSome people criticised the government but they do not understand about the art of leadership,\u201d Pov Sok said. A staunch ally of China, Hun Sen has moved even closer to Beijing in recent years as Cambodia has received billions of dollars in soft loans and investment. He is also one the world\u2019s longest-serving leaders, maintaining a 35-year grip on power in ways critics say include jailing political opponents and activists. Human Rights Watch last month accused authorities of using the pandemic as a pretext to arrest opposition supporters and critics who had questioned the government\u2019s handling of coronavirus. Cambodia has reported just 124 coronavirus cases and no deaths, although sceptics say the low numbers are due to a lack of testing and contact tracing within the country. Iran further eased restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19 Tuesday by allowing restaurants to accept customers, as it announced another 57 deaths from the virus. Since the first cases of the virus appeared on its soil in mid-February, the Islamic republic has sought to halt the spread of the virus without imposing lockdowns. \u201cRestaurants which before this decree were only allowed to distribute food will be allowed to accept customers from today,\u201d deputy health minister Mohsen Farhadi told state television. Farhadi called on restaurants to respect health protocols to ensure distancing of two metres, a measure he said would reduce client numbers by 50%. Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour reported 57 additional Covid-19 deaths in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of fatalities in the country to 7,508. Jahanpour said 1,787 new cases of infection over the same period brought the Islamic republic\u2019s caseload to 139,511. \u201cWe are seeing a stable process in the majority of provinces,\u201d Jahanpour said, adding that the southwestern province of Khuzestan was still classified \u201cred\u201d, although the number of infected cases was declining. Red is the highest level on the country\u2019s colour-coded scale of risk in relation to its coronavirus outbreak - the deadliest in the Middle East. Experts both at home and abroad have voiced scepticism about Iran\u2019s official figures, saying the real toll could be much higher. London\u2019s Tate - a collection of four art museums in the UK - has cancelled this year\u2019s Turner Prize because of the coronavirus and said it will award \u00a310,000 grants to 10 deserving British artists instead. Judges would have traditionally announced a short-list for the prestigious competition this month and revealed the winner - and awarded an accompanying \u00a325,000 ($30,800, \u20ac28,100) prize - in December. But Tate Britain said \u201cthe tight timetable for preparing the annual exhibition would not have been achievable under the present restrictions\u201d. \u201cThe decision was made to help support a larger selection of artists through this period of profound disruption and uncertainty,\u201d the museum said in a statement. The 10 joint winners will be selected at the end of June. Tate Britain director Alex Farquharson said lockdowns aimed at fighting the spread of the virus were causing enormous stress for artists because most galleries have been closed for months. \u201cWe have decided to help support even more artists during this exceptionally difficult time,\u201d he said. An interesting glimpse of the future of air travel from Hamad international airport in Qatar. Staff are using advanced thermal screening helmets, which enable contactless temperature checks to screen staff and travellers. Disinfectant robots are roaming the corridors, emitting concentrated UV-C light \u201cknown to be effective in eliminating majority of infectious microorganisms\u201d, the airport said on Twitter. All passengers will be provided with hand sanitisers readily available at key locations and the airport will continue to maintain 1.5m social distancing, with every other seat in waiting areas cordoned off. JK Rowling will publish a fairy tale called The Ickabog free online so that children can read it in lockdown, with the first chapter to be published at 3pm (BST). \u201cOver 10 years ago, I wrote a stand-alone fairy tale called The Ickabog,\u201d Rowling said. \u201cUntil very recently, the only people who\u2019d heard the story of The Ickabog were my two younger children.\u201d The Harry Potter author said the mostly handwritten manuscript had been stored in her attic until a few weeks ago and she had done some rewriting in recent weeks. She said: I\u2019ve decided to publish The Ickabog for free online, so children on lockdown, or even those back at school during these strange, unsettling times, can read it or have it read to them. We\u2019ll be publishing a chapter (or 2 or 3) every weekday, starting at 3.00pm today and ending on July 10th. You don\u2019t need to register to access the story. You can read it for free on a new website we\u2019ll be launching shortly. She is also launching a competition for children to send in pictures which will be used to illustrate the book when it is officially published in November. All author royalties from the books will be to donated to \u201cprojects and organisations helping the groups most impacted by Covid-19\u201d, Rowling said. \u201cTHIS IS NOT A HARRY POTTER SPIN-OFF,\u201d she emphasised on Twitter, to head off \u201cone possible source of confusion\u201d. Russia will hold its postponed second world war Victory Day military parade on 24 June, president Vladimir Putin has said. \u201cAccording to experts, the peak can be considered passed,\u201d Putin told the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, ordering him to begin preparations for the parade marking 75 years since the defeat of Nazi Germany. \u201cWe will do it on 24 June, the day the legendary historic victors\u2019 parade took place in 1945,\u201d Putin said. Putin had been forced to postpone the massive 9 May parade because of risks from the coronavirus pandemic. The Russian president said that the situation was stabilising but stressed that all precautions should be taken to hold the annual Red Square parade next month. Another popular event usually held on 9 May - the Immortal Regiment processions that see Russians across the country carry portraits of relatives who died in World War II - will be held on 26 July, Putin said. Russian naval bases will also hold traditional naval parades that day, Putin said. The postponement of the Victory Day parade was a blow to the 67-year-old Russian president, who had hoped to gather world leaders to watch thousands of troops march on Red Square. The UK Foreign Office (FCO) is currently advising against all but essential international travel for an indefinite period. However, countries across Europe have begun to ease lockdown measures and border restrictions and prepare for the return of domestic and international tourists. Reciprocal travel deals \u2013 as proposed in a leaked European commission document on 12 May \u2013 may be struck between countries with similar coronavirus risk profiles. For example, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have formed a \u201ctravel bubble\u201d allowing movement between those countries. A similar idea was proposed by the UK\u2019s transport secretary Grant Shapps on 18 May, whereby travel would be allowed to and from countries with an R-number \u2013 a key measure of transmission \u2013 below one to try to boost confidence in aviation travel. The so-called \u201cair bridges\u201d would permit re-entry without quarantine. At the UK border, all arrivals must self-isolate for 14 days, or face a \u00a31,000 fine. Arrivals must also provide contact and accommodation information, and the authorities have said they will carry out spot checks. A list of exemptions is still to be confirmed, but currently includes passengers arriving from Ireland. The UK government has rowed back on the idea of exempting travellers from France. This is our latest round-up of lockdown easing measures and travel restrictions country-by-country: Hi everyone, this is Jessica Murray, I\u2019ll be steering the blog for the next hour. If you want to get in touch with stories or comments, please feel to do so Email: jessica.murray@theguardian.com Twitter: @journojess_ I\u2019ll shortly be handing over to a colleague for the next hour. In the meantime, here is a summary of the latest global developments on Covid-19: Confirmed cases worldwide exceed 5.5m. According to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker, infections worldwide number at least 5,518,905. The death toll stands at 346,700. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting. WHO warns of \u2018second peak\u2019 in areas where Covid-19 is declining. Countries where coronavirus infections are declining could still face an \u201cimmediate second peak\u201d if they let up too soon on measures to contain the outbreak, the World Health Organization said on Monday. The WHO emergencies chief, Dr Mike Ryan, told an online briefing: \u201cWe cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave. We may get a second peak in this wave.\u201d The UN refugee agency said Covid-19 had pushed its humanitarian work to near \u201cbreaking point\u201d in Yemen, a country devastated by five years of war. It said a growing number of families were resorting to begging, child labour and marrying of children to survive. A separate UN agency said it had only received around 15% of the funding required for the $3.38bn (\u20ac3bn) aid package for Yemen this year. Mexico City records thousands more deaths than usual, amid doubt over official Covid-19 toll. This year, Mexico City has issued 8,072 more death certificates than the average for the same period in the past four years, according to a study that suggests the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll could be significantly higher than the official figure of nearly 7,400. The report\u2019s authors found 37% more death certificates were issued in April 2020 than that month\u2019s average during the previous four years. By the end of May they estimated the number may grow to 120%. The UK death toll passed 47,000, according to new figures from the country\u2019s Office for National Statistics. This figure is higher than the latest figure given by the UK government \u2013 nearly 37,000 \u2013 because it includes deaths in which Covid-19 is given as a \u201csuspected\u201d cause. The UK government figure only includes deaths of patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus. Russia reports record one-day rise in deaths. Russia has announced that 174 people with coronavirus have died in the past 24 hours, a record one-day amount that has pushed the nationwide death toll to 3,807. Officials reported 8,915 new cases, pushing its overall case tally to 362,342. White House brings forward Brazil travel restrictions by two days. The US has amended the timing of its Brazil travel ban to come into force at 11.59pm Washington time on Tuesday. It came as Brazil recorded a daily death toll higher than the US for the first time (807 versus 620). Brazil has the world\u2019s second highest number of infections. In its original announcement, the White House said the travel restrictions would come into force on 28 May. Dutch PM Mark Rutte did not visit dying mother due to Covid-19 restrictions. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, was unable to visit his dying mother in her final weeks because he obeyed coronavirus restrictions against visiting care homes, his office has said. His mother did not die of Covid-19, although there had earlier been an outbreak of the disease in the home where she was living, Dutch media reported. UK PM\u2019s aid refuses to apologise or resign over lockdown breach. The British prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has refused to apologise or resign for breaching lockdown rules. Cummings drove 264 miles from London to his parents\u2019 estate in Durham, despite suspecting that both he and his wife had coronavirus. Cummings also admitted to having taken a second trip, to a beauty spot 30 miles from Durham, which he claimed was necessary to check his eyesight was good enough for the longer drive back to London. WHO suspends hydroxychloroquine trial. The World Health Organization has suspended testing the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients due to safety concerns. The WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, cited a paper published last week in the Lancet that showed people taking hydroxychloroquine were at higher risk of death and heart problems than those who were not taking it. In light of the study, he said, the organisation would pause the hydroxychloroquine arm of its solidarity global clinical trial. Coronavirus has prevented the scheduled return home of hundreds of Irish troops who have served on UN peacekeeping duties in southern Lebanon. Around 360 soldiers from the Irish Defence Forces will not see their families until the end of June even though some have been serving in the zone between Israel and their Hezbollah enemies since last December. The UN has granted special permission to the 115th Irish battalion of United Nations Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL) special dispensation to return to Dublin in two groups on 21 and 29 June. But one member of the Irish parliament and leader of the Aontu party has criticised the delay in bringing the troops back to Dublin. Dail deputy Peadar Toibin said the soldiers and their families had been \u201cseparated for far too long and endured too much \u2013 exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic.\u201d Toibin contrasted the troops\u2019 situation with the decision to allow hundreds of foreign workers to fly into Dublin during the coronavirus crisis in order to pick fruit on Irish farms. When the blue beret peacekeepers finally arrive back in Ireland they will have to self-isolate for 14 days. Their replacement battalion will also be put into 14-day isolation away from their families before they fly out to Beirut to begin their six month peacekeeping duties in the Lebanese southern border area. Political leaders in Bavaria, one of the German states hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic, have said they will guarantee that people with symptoms can get a virus test within 24 hours. State premier Markus S\u00f6der said people would know after 48 hours at the latest if they are infected. In a press conference in Munich, he said those without symptoms would be guaranteed a test within 48 hours and could expect a result within a week. My colleague, Kate Connolly, reported yesterday that the German government\u2019s attempts to take a nationwide approach to relaxing lockdown measures appeared to be in disarray after one state leader announced it was going it alone. Bavaria has recorded 353 coronavirus infections per 100,000 people, the highest rate in Germany, while neighbouring Thuringia \u2013 whose leader has unilaterally announced the lifting of some measures in the state \u2013 has one of the lowest coronavirus rates: 133 infections per 100,000 people. As European countries gradually lift their lockdowns, Spain today urged other European Union countries to establish some common rules, including potential health checks for passengers, to open borders and to re-establish freedom of travel in the Shengen Area. Foreign minister Arancha Gonzalez told Cadena Ser radio station that countries should \u201cdefine the common rules that will allow us retake freedom of movement on European territory,\u201d reports the Reuters news agency. Reuters says it has seen a \u201cdiscussion paper\u201d submitted by Spain to a Future of Europe consultation process between EU nations. The news agency says say the paper calls for the monitoring of tourists\u2019 health via individual checks as part of a common EU-wide procedure. According to Reuters, the paper says: It would be appropriate to consider, in coordination with UNWTO and WHO, options for health checks, either upon the purchase of tickets or at the airport itself, should the results of those checks be available within a reasonable timeframe. The definition of a safe and operational passenger transit system is key to restoring the normality of tourist flows in a sustainable manner. A humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding in Yemen, a country ravaged by five years of war that finds itself uniquely vulnerable to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. In a virtual briefing today, the UN\u2019s refugee agency, UNHCR, said it was seeing a \u201cgrowing number of families resorting to harmful coping mechanism\u201d such as begging, child labour and marrying of children to survive. UNHCR spokesman Charlie Yaxley said: \u201cWe are reaching a potential breaking point in our programmes where if we don\u2019t receive further funding soon, many of our programmes and particularly our cash assistance programmes to internally displaced Yemenis may have to stop.\u201d At the same briefing, the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs said it had only received around 15% of the funding required for the $3.38bn (\u20ac3bn) aid package for Yemen this year, with the US the top donor. About 80% of Yemen\u2019s population already relies on humanitarian help but the World Food Programme said it expects Covid-19 to \u201cpush many more children in Yemen into acute malnutrition\u201d. Britain will provide the anti-viral drug remdesivir to some Covid-19 patients after clinical trials found that it could shorten the recovery period by four days. The UK government said it was working with the manufacturer, Gilead Sciences, to test the drug on an unspecified number of patients for whom it could provide the greatest benefit. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) last week said that data from its trial of remdesivir showed that the drug offers the most benefit for coronavirus patients who need extra oxygen but do not require mechanical ventilation. The researchers also said that \u201cgiven high mortality despite the use of remdesivir,\u201d it is likely that the anti-viral drug would be more effective in combination with other treatments. This comes after the news that the World Health Organization had suspended its trial of a different drug, hydroxychloroquine \u2013 the malaria drug Donald Trump said he is taking as a precaution \u2014 from its global study after safety concerns. The WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the decision was taken in light of a paper published last week in the Lancet that showed people taking hydroxychloroquine were at higher risk of death and heart problems than those who were not. Hello. It\u2019s Josh Halliday here in Manchester, England. I\u2019ll be providing you with all the latest developments from around the globe on the coronavirus pandemic until the end of the day. As ever, we really value your contributions so please do feel free to contact me through the channels below. If there\u2019s something you think we should be looking into, get in touch. Email: josh.halliday@theguardian.com Twitter: @JoshHalliday That\u2019s all from me, Simon Burnton, for today. Josh Halliday will be taking over from here. I leave you with news of the Czech Tennis Association\u2019s charity tournament to raise funds for those affected by Covid-19, which started this morning in Prague. Competitors include Karolina Pliskova, the world No3, and the 2011 and 2014 Wimbledon winner Petra Kvitova. Ball boys and ball girls are clad in masks and gloves: Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, has announced that the pledging marathon led by her organisation to raise funds for the development of a vaccine has raised \u20ac9.5bn from governments, institutions, foundations and individuals since 4 May: Saudi Arabia has announced that it will end its nationwide coronavirus curfew from 21 June, except in the holy city of Mecca, after more than two months of stringent curbs, reports AFP. Prayers will also be allowed to resume in all mosques outside Mecca from 31 May, the interior ministry said in a series of measures announced on state media. A phased lifting of restrictions will start this week, with the curfew relaxed between 6am and 3pm between Thursday and Saturday. From Sunday until 20 June the curfew will be further eased until 8pm, the ministry added, with the lockdown to be lifted entirely from 21 June. \u201cStarting from Thursday, the kingdom will enter a new phase and will gradually return to normal based on the rules of social distancing,\u201d health minister Tawfiq Al-Rabiah said on Monday. Emmanuel Akinwotu, the Guardian\u2019s west Africa correspondent, has filed this report on test kit shortages in the area: As coronavirus lockdowns adopted in Africa ease and urban populations become more mobile, the low supply of test kits to measure outbreaks of Covid-19 is of increasingly urgent concern, public health experts have warned. Countries on the continent have adopted a range of testing strategies, but fierce international competition for test kits and a lack of global coordination of resources have meant many African countries are testing with significantly limited reach. More than half of African countries are experiencing community transmission as lockdown measures relax. Kate Dooley, the director for west Africa at the Tony Blair Institute, said many states were running low on supplies at a critical time. \u201cMost governments are currently rationing their use of test kits given limited supplies. We are aware of some cases where African governments who placed orders in early March are still yet to receive the supply, six to eight weeks later,\u201d he said. More here: The number of deaths involving Covid-19 in the UK has topped 47,000, according to the latest available data. The total includes new figures published on Tuesday by the Office for National Statistics that show that 42,173 deaths involving coronavirus occurred in England and Wales up to 15 May (and had been registered up to 23 May). Meanwhile, the latest figures from the National Records of Scotland, published last week, showed 3,546 deaths involving Covid-19 had been registered in Scotland up to 17 May. And the latest figures from the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, also published last week, showed 664 deaths involving Covid-19 had been registered in Northern Ireland up to 20 May. Together these figures mean that so far 47,343 deaths have been registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, including suspected cases. Reuters has field a report from Mumbai on the spread of coronavirus to India\u2019s rural areas as migrant labourers leave the big cities: Indian states witnessing millions of migrant labourers returning from the big cities are recording rising coronavirus infections, officials said on Tuesday, fearing that the pandemic could spread through villages where medical care is basic at best. Officials from the home and railway ministries said at least 4.5 million workers had migrated home from economic hubs in the two months since prime minister Narendra Modi declared a lockdown. On Tuesday, India had recorded a total 145,380 infections and a death toll of 4,167, low figures for the world\u2019s second-most populous country when compared with some countries in Europe. But the eastern state of Bihar registered more than 160 infections on Monday, its highest one-day rise, taking its tally to more than 2,700 cases. In the past 36 hours, more than 75 people tested positive in Odisha and 35 in three isolation homes in the desert state of Rajasthan. The latest cases have forced authorities to stretch limited testing resources. \u201cDozens of labourers who travelled from New Delhi have tested positive. We are ensuring that no one enters their village with this infection,\u201d said Gaurav Sinha, a senior health official in Bihar\u2019s capital, Patna. The Guardian\u2019s Daniel Hurst in Canberra reports on the actual origins of the splash in Australia\u2019s Daily Telegraph, which purported to reveal that Covid-19 originated in a Wuhan laboratory: Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Sydney tabloid, the Daily Telegraph, went big with a Saturday morning splash and six pages of reporting attributed to \u201ca dossier prepared by concerned western governments\u201d \u2013 and the story was quickly amplified and exaggerated by Trump\u2019s media backers in the United States. It gathered steam in subsequent reporting as something even more weighty: the New York Post called it \u201ca damning dossier leaked from the \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 intelligence alliance\u201d while Fox News host Tucker Carlson asked why it was so hard for some people to accept \u201cobjectively that the evidence suggests [coronavirus] came from a lab\u201d in Wuhan, China. Carlson\u2019s program contained a graphic that claimed: \u201cDossier was compiled by intel agencies of the US, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand.\u201d But there was a problem: the document at the heart of the reporting did not contain any genuinely new information, it did not outline any direct evidence of the lab leakage theory, and it wasn\u2019t culled from intelligence gathered by the Five Eyes network. More here: The British government has lost its first minister as a result of the Dominic Cummings affair, with Douglas Ross, the MP for Moray, announcing today that he is stepping down as a Scotland Office minister, saying he accepted Cummings felt he had acted in the best interests of his family but these were \u201cdecisions others felt were not available to them\u201d. From my colleague Philip Oltermann in Berlin: It\u2019s not just in Britain that political figures have come under the spotlight for breaching lockdown laws. In Austria, president Alexander Van der Bellen has apologised for staying in the garden of an Italian restaurant beyond the 11pm curfew. Police spotted the 76-year-old head of state in the outside dining area of the Vienna restaurant shortly after midnight on Sunday. Van der Bellen has said he lost track of time during his first restaurant visit since the start of the pandemic, and said he would shoulder any fine issued on the restaurant. In Germany, meanwhile, one sector of the economy feels they are being unfairly left out of the latest wave of social distancing relaxations. The country\u2019s Federal Association for Sexual Services has issued a statement insisting sex workers are not \u201csuper spreaders\u201d of the virus and proposing a three-step programme to reopen brothels, sex clubs and tabledance bars. The umbrella group argues that in most such establishments the \u201cworking situation\u201d is one of one-on-one contacts and thus comparable to hair salons or massage parlors. A cross-party group of 16 Bundestag MPs had last week proposed a long-term shutdown of all forms of prostitution in the wake of the pandemic: \u201cProstitution has the effect of a virus super spreader\u201d, the group said in an open letter. \u201cSexual acts are generally non-negotiable with social distancing.\u201d Indonesia has today reported 415 new confirmed cases of Covid-19, and 27 deaths. This brings its total number of infections to 23,165, with 1,418 fatalities. Malaysia today reported 187 new coronavirus cases, and no new fatalities. As of a few minutes ago, the total number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 worldwide now stands at 5,508,904, according to Johns Hopkins University\u2019s coronavirus tracker. The number of deaths worldwide as a result of the coronavirus stands at 346,326. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected under-reporting. The controversial French doctor Didier Raoult has dismissed a study suggesting the drug he hails as a miracle treatment for the coronavirus is ineffective at best and possibly life-threatening at worst. Raoult, who is regarded as either a saviour or a charlatan in France, remains convinced the anti-viral drug hydroxychloroquine can help treat patients with Covid-19. The scientist said the latest study suggesting otherwise was \u201cmessy\u201d and dismissed it as done with \u201cbig data\u201d by \u201cpeople who have not seen any patients\u201d. The study, published in the Lancet, looked at the records of 96,000 patients in hundreds of hospitals. It found giving coronavirus patients hydroxychloroquine increased the risk of them dying. Raoult says his hands-on experience at a hospital in Marseille shows otherwise. \u201cWe\u2019ve had 3,600 come through our hospital. You don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to change because there are people who do \u2018big data\u2019, which is a form of delusional fantasy \u2026 Nothing will change what I have seen with my own eyes,\u201d he said in a video on his hospital website. The World Health Organization has announced it is suspending trials of the drug on Covid-19 patients over safety concerns. French president Emmanuel Macron met Raoult at his hospital in April but insisted the visit was not formal \u201crecognition\u201d of the doctor\u2019s methods. \u201cI\u2019ve no idea if elsewhere, hydroxychloroquine kills, but here it\u2019s saving people,\u201d Raoult added in the video. The Philippine health ministry has reported 13 deaths and 350 new cases of Covid-19 today, the largest single-day increase in infections in seven weeks. The total number of confirmed cases now stands at 14,669 and deaths have reached 886. The president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, said late last night that he will not allow students to go back to school until a vaccine is available. Children were due to return to school at the end of August after classes for more than 25 million primary and secondary students were shut down in March. But Duterte said he believed the risk was too great, even if it held students back academically. \u201cUnless I am sure that they are really safe it\u2019s useless to be talking about opening of classes,\u201d the president said. \u201cFor me, vaccine first. If the vaccine is already there, then it\u2019s OK. If no one graduates, then so be it.\u201d The first ward has been completed at the temporary field hospital being set up at the Cape Town International Convention Centre in South Africa. The hospital will eventually have 850 beds. I\u2019m getting plenty of mail about Dominic Cummings, from some of the many people who were apparently unconvinced many by his eye-test driving yarn. Our UK coronavirus blog is live now and focusing on this issue: This is from Elias Visontay and AAP in Australia: A Covid-19-infected live export ship was apparently cleared by a federal department to dock at Fremantle port, where local workers went on board. The Al Kuwait arrived on Friday after sailing from the United Arab Emirates and six of the 48 multinational crew on board have since tested positive to the virus. On Tuesday Western Australian police commissioner Chris Dawson said half a dozen Fremantle port workers went on to the ship and authorities knew who they were but he was not aware if they had been placed in quarantine. The WA premier, Mark McGowan, said he had been advised the federal Department of Agriculture was told crew members had a fever but didn\u2019t pass that information on to Fremantle Port Authority before the vessel berthed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to point fingers at this point in time,\u201d McGowan said on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to find out exactly what has gone on. Obviously we\u2019re very concerned and to a degree, disappointed.\u201d More here: Russia has announced that 174 people with coronavirus have died in the past 24 hours, a record one-day amount that has pushed the nationwide death toll to 3,807. Officials reported 8,915 new cases, pushing its overall case tally to 362,342. Singapore\u2019s ministry of health has today confirmed an additional 383 cases of Covid-19, adding that \u201cthe vast majority are work permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories\u201d. This is along similar lines to yesterday\u2019s tally of 344, though they make clear that \u201cthe lower number of cases is partly due to fewer tests being conducted\u201d. The day before Germany\u2019s 16 state premiers will discuss with Angela Merkel the country\u2019s potential continued route out of lockdown, Bild is reporting this morning that the chancellor has agreed to bring forward the date social distancing should be relaxed from 5 July to 29 June. Bild said meetings in public places would be limited to a maximum of 10 people or members of two households. While there would be no limit on the number of visitors allowed to visit people in their homes, there would have to be space for everyone to keep their distance and have enough fresh air, it said. Meanwhile, the DPA (Deutsche Presse-Agentur) news agency is reporting that Germany will lift a travel warning for 31 European states from 15 June, provided the coronavirus situation allows. This would include the other 26 EU member states as well as Britain, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. The Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem has reopened to the public today after nearly three months. The Palestinian prime minister, Mohammad Shtayyeh, said yesterday that mosques, churches and businesses would be allowed to reopen today in an easing of anti-pandemic curbs, given the slow pace of infections. \u201cThe birth of our Lord Jesus Christ gave hope to people more than 2,000 years ago, and opening the church today will, I think, give hope to the whole world that hopefully this pandemic will end \u2013 not only in Palestine but in the whole world,\u201d Palestinian tourism minister Rula Ma\u2019ayah told Reuters. Here\u2019s some footage of protests in Ecuador yesterday against the leadership of president Lenin Moreno: Morning/evening/whatever-it-is-where-you-are everyone. This is Simon Burnton taking on the live blog for the next few hours. If you have seen any stories that deserve our attention, or if you have any tips, comments or suggestions for our coverage then please let me know by sending me a message either to @Simon_Burnton on Twitter or via email. Thanks! That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan, for today. Huge thanks to those of you who got in touch via Twitter and email. See you all tomorrow! My colleague Simon Burnton will take it from here. In the meantime, these are the main developments from the last few hours: Confirmed cases worldwide near 5.5m. According to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker, infections worldwide number at least 5,495,061. The death toll stands at 346,232. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting. WHO warns of \u2018second peak\u2019 in areas where Covid-19 is declining. Countries where coronavirus infections are declining could still face an \u201cimmediate second peak\u201d if they let up too soon on measures to contain the outbreak, the World Health Organization said on Monday. The WHO emergencies chief, Dr Mike Ryan, told an online briefing: \u201cWe cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave. We may get a second peak in this wave.\u201d Mexico City records thousands more deaths than usual, amid doubt over official Covid-19 toll. This year, Mexico City has issued 8,072 more death certificates than the average for the same period in the past four years, according to a study that suggests the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll could be significantly higher than the official figure of nearly 7,400. The report\u2019s authors found 37% more death certificates were issued in April 2020 than that month\u2019s average during the previous four years. By the end of May they estimated the number may grow to 120%. White House brings forward Brazil travel restrictions by two days. The US has amended the timing of its Brazil travel ban to come into force at 11.59pm Washington time on Tuesday. It came as Brazil recorded a daily death toll higher than the US for the first time (807 versus 620). Brazil has the world\u2019s second highest number of infections. In its original announcement, the White House said the travel restrictions would come into force on 28 May. Dutch PM Mark Rutte did not visit dying mother due to Covid-19 restrictions. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, was unable to visit his dying mother in her final weeks because he obeyed coronavirus restrictions against visiting care homes, his office has said. His mother did not die of Covid-19, although there had earlier been an outbreak of the disease in the home where she was living, Dutch media reported. UK PM\u2019s aid refuses to apologise or resign over lockdown breach. The British prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has refused to apologise or resign for breaching lockdown rules. Cummings drove 264 miles from London to his parents\u2019 estate in Durham, despite suspecting that both he and his wife had coronavirus. Cummings also admitted to having taken a second trip, to a beauty spot 30 miles from Durham, which he claimed was necessary to check his eyesight was good enough for the longer drive back to London. WHO suspends hydroxychloroquine trial. The World Health Organization has suspended testing the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients due to safety concerns. The WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, cited a paper published last week in the Lancet that showed people taking hydroxychloroquine were at higher risk of death and heart problems than those who were not taking it. In light of the study, he said, the organisation would pause the hydroxychloroquine arm of its solidarity global clinical trial. Coronavirus measures \u2018disastrous\u2019 for children, says Dutch watchdog. The coronavirus pandemic will have a \u201cdisastrous\u201d impact on children\u2019s rights worldwide, making them more vulnerable to forced labour and underage marriage, a rights group said on Tuesday. School closures left boys and girls more vulnerable to child labour, early marriage and teenage pregnancy, while millions would fall into extreme poverty because of the coronavirus outbreak, the NGO KidsRights said. Australia will not open the country\u2019s borders \u2018anytime soon\u2019. Australia will not open the country\u2019s borders \u201canytime soon\u201d, the PM, Scott Morrison, said on Tuesday, but added the country would continue its discussions with neighbouring New Zealand about a trans-Tasman safe travel zone. \u201cI was speaking with Prime Minister Ardern this morning, and we\u2019ll continue to have our discussions about the trans-Tasman safe travel zone,\u201d Morrison told the National Press Club in Canberra. Masks too dangerous for children under two, Japan medical group says. Children under the age of two shouldn\u2019t wear masks because they can make breathing difficult and increase the risk of choking, a Japan medical group has said, launching an urgent appeal to parents as the country reopens from the coronavirus crisis. Saudi Arabia to revise curfew times. Saudi Arabia will revise curfew times this week, and lift them entirely across the kingdom with the exception of the holy city of Mecca, starting on 21 June, state news agency reported in a statement early on Tuesday. Bans on domestic travel, holding prayers in mosques, and workplace attendance in both the government and private sector will be lifted, starting 31 May, the statement added. For Mecca, the curfew time will be adjusted to 3pm-6pm and prayers will be allowed to be held in mosques from 21 June. Iceland eases national alert. Iceland eased its national alert against the coronavirus on Monday, allowing for public gatherings of up to 200 people and night clubs and gyms to reopen as the country nears complete recovery from the outbreak. Iceland, which limited the virus spread through a meticulous test-and-trace strategy and a full lockdown, has confirmed 1,804 infections and 10 deaths. But there have been only five reported new cases in May, and more than 99% of infected persons have recovered. The coronavirus pandemic will have a \u201cdisastrous\u201d impact on children\u2019s rights worldwide, making them more vulnerable to forced labour and underage marriage, a rights group has said, as the World Health Organization warned of an \u201cimmediate second peak\u201d in cases if restrictions were lifted too soon. Millions of children would fall into extreme poverty because of the outbreak, which has left governments short of money for health and education for the young, Dutch NGO KidsRights said. The NGO\u2019s warning came as the WHO emergencies head, Dr Mike Ryan, spoke of a potential second wave of infections at any time, especially if measures to halt the first wave were lifted too soon. He said: \u201cWe cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave. We may get a second peak in this wave.\u201d Calls for vigilance were echoed as restrictions eased across Europe, Japan lifted its state of emergency, and people in the US marked the start of summer with Memorial Day weekend getaways. Singapore\u2019s embattled economy could shrink by as much as 7% this year, which would be the worst reading since independence, with the government saying on Tuesday the coronavirus pandemic had throttled the key export sector, AFP reports. The city-state is seen as a bellwether of the global economy and the historic contraction highlights the extreme pain being wrought on countries by the killer disease. The warning also came hours before Singapore\u2019s deputy prime minister is expected to unveil another stimulus package for the troubled city, which has been crippled by months of lockdowns around the world. The trade ministry\u2019s forecast \u2013 which was a downgrade from the 4% contraction predicted in March \u2013 came as official data showed the economy shrank 0.7% year-on-year in the first three months of the year, while it reduced 4.7% from the previous quarter. The financial hub is one of the world\u2019s most open economies, and is usually hit hardest and earliest during any global shock. The ministry said the new estimate was made \u201cin view of the deterioration in the external demand outlook\u201d and the partial lockdown imposed domestically. A contraction of 7% would be the worst since the city\u2019s independence in 1965. \u2018Stay elite\u2019: what the papers say about Dominic Cummings\u2019 refusal to quit Any hopes in Downing Street that Dominic Cummings\u2019 TV appearance would draw a line under his Durham trip have been dashed if today\u2019s front pages are anything to go by. \u201cNo regrets\u201d features prominently on several, with the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror using the same phrases, but in reverse order. \u201cNo apology, no regrets\u201d says the Mail, about Cummings\u2019 \u201crose garden roasting\u201d, referring to his TV appearance in No 10\u2019s garden. \u201cBoris\u2019s defiant svengali refuses to quit\u201d the Mail says over his trip to Durham, and asks: \u201cSo how CAN he survive?\u201d \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t regret what I did\u2019: Cummings refuses to quit,\u201d is the Guardian\u2019s headline, describing his TV appearance as \u201cextraordinary\u201d. His justification for driving to Durham to self-isolate was so complex, writes the Guardian\u2019s political editor, Heather Stewart, \u201cit might have helped if he had had a whiteboard to sketch it out on\u201d. Here are the other front pages from around the country: And the rest of the front pages in our story here: Doctors and medical professionals from around the globe have called on world leaders to ensure a green recovery from the coronavirus crisis that takes account of air pollution and climate breakdown. More than 200 organisations representing at least 40 million health workers \u2013 making up about half of the global medical workforce \u2013 have signed an open letter to the G20 leaders and their chief medical advisers, pointing to the 7 million premature deaths to which air pollution contributes each year around the world. Chief medical officers and chief scientific advisers must be directly involved in designing the stimulus packages now under way, the letter urges, in order to ensure they include considerations of public health and environmental concerns. They say public health systems should be strengthened, and they warn of how environmental degradation could help to unleash future diseases. The signatories also want reforms to fossil fuel subsidies, with public support shifted towards renewable energy, which they say would make for cleaner air, cut greenhouse gas emissions and help to spur economic growth of nearly $100tn in the next three decades. Leo Varadkar, Ireland\u2019s taoiseach, has defended having a picnic with friends in a Dublin park in defiance of a recommendation from a senior government official. A spokesperson for Varadkar issued a statement on Monday night saying he \u201cbroke no laws, breached no regulations and observed public health guidance\u201d while picnicking in the Phoenix Park on Sunday. The comment came after images appeared on social media showing the taoiseach with his partner, Matthew Barrett, and two friends near the park\u2019s Wellington monument. Varadkar was in shorts and shirtless. The outing appeared to contradict advice given in a media briefing last week by Liz Canavan, assistant secretary of the Department of the Taoiseach. She said: \u201cIf you\u2019re visiting a public amenity try not to stay too long at the site or have picnics. Please do your exercise and then go home.\u201d The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 432 to 179,002, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Tuesday. The reported death toll rose by 45 to 8,302, the tally showed. On Monday, negotiations in Germany over a nationwide approach to relaxing lockdown measures were said to be in disarray after the state of Thuringia announced it was going it alone, my colleague Kate Connolly reported: Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. There are almost 5.5m cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins university coronavirus tracker, which has counted a total of 5,495,061 confirmed infections. The death toll stands at 346,232. WHO warns of \u201csecond peak\u201d in areas where Covid-19 declining. Countries where coronavirus infections are declining could still face an \u201cimmediate second peak\u201d if they let up too soon on measures to halt the outbreak, the World Health Organization said on Monday.

The White House announced Sunday it was restricting travel from Brazil, two days after Brazil became the world\u2019s No. 2 hotspot for coronavirus cases. In its original announcement, it said the restrictions would come into force on 28 May. Dutch PM Mark Rutte did not visit dying mother due to Covid-19 restrictions. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte was unable to visit his dying mother in her final weeks because he obeyed coronavirus restrictions against visiting care homes, his office has said. His mother did not die of Covid-19 although there had earlier been an outbreak of the disease in the home where she was living, Dutch media reported. Dominic Cummings, the UK PM\u2019s aide, has said he does not regret breaching the lockdown. Dominic Cummings, the chief of staff to Boris Johnson, admitted driving about 250 miles (400km) from his home during the UK\u2019s lockdown, but insisted he acted reasonably. The World Health Organization has suspended testing the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients due to safety concerns. The WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, cited a paper published in the Lancet that showed people taking hydroxychloroquine were at higher risk of death and heart problems. WHO worries about \u2018silent epidemic\u2019 unless Africa prioritises virus testing. Africa has so far been spared the worst impact of the coronavirus, but the World Health Organization is worried the continent could face a \u201csilent epidemic\u201d if its leaders do not prioritise testing for it, a WHO envoy said on Monday.

Germany threw Lufthansa a \u20ac9bn (US$9.8bn) lifeline on Monday, agreeing a bailout which gives Berlin a veto in the event of a hostile bid for the airline, Reuters reports.The largest German corporate rescue since the coronavirus crisis struck will see the government get a 20% stake, which could rise to 25% plus one share in the event of a takeover attempt, as it seeks to protect thousands of jobs. Iceland eases national alert. Iceland eased its national alert against the coronavirus on Monday, allowing for public gatherings of up to 200 people and night clubs and gyms to reopen as the country nears complete recovery from the outbreak.Iceland limited the virus spread through a meticulous test and trace strategy and a full lockdown, has confirmed 1,804 infections and 10 deaths. But there have been only five reported new cases in May, and more than 99% of infected persons have recovered. California issues guidelines for house of worship reopenings. The state released guidance under which county health departments can approve the reopening of churches, mosques, synagogues and other houses of worship. They have been closed since Governor Gavin Newsom issued a stay-at-home order in March to slow the spread of the coronavirus. About 15,000 Rohingya refugees are now under coronavirus quarantine in Bangladesh\u2019s vast camps, officials said Monday, as the number of confirmed infections among them rose to 29.Health experts have long warned that the virus could race through the cramped settlements, housing almost a million Muslims who fled violence in Myanmar, and officials had restricted movement to the area in April. Three dozen inmates in Salvadoran prisons have tested positive for coronavirus, health authorities said Monday, adding that strict health and isolation protocols would be implemented to halt the virus\u2019s spread in the facilities. Twenty-five inmate cases were diagnosed in a prison holding more than 1,200 inmates in the department of San Vicente, Osiris Luna, director of the country\u2019s prison system, told a news conference Monday. The Quezaltepeque prison near the capital, which holds 1,980 prisoners, registered 11 cases, he added. \u201cWe have begun treating and isolating these people,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is an area for isolation in every prison.\u201d Conditions in Salvadoran prisons have come under greater scrutiny after the government in April released startling photos of hundreds of jailed gang members stripped to underwear and pressed together in formation, drawing strong criticism from human rights groups. South Korea has reported 19 new cases of the coronavirus, most from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where officials have been actively tracing transmissions linked to nightclubs and other entertainment venues, AP reports. South Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday also reported two more deaths, bringing national totals to 11,225 cases and 269 fatalities. Officials linked three of the new cases to international arrivals. South Korea has been reporting around 20 new cases per day over the past two weeks after health workers found hundreds of infections linked to club goers who went out in early May as the country eased social distancing measures. The new infections in the greater capital area have caused concern as authorities proceed with a phased reopening of schools, which began with high school seniors last week. Around 2.4 million high school juniors, middle school seniors, first and second graders and kindergarten students will be returning to school on Wednesday. Children under the age of two shouldn\u2019t wear masks because they can make breathing difficult and increase the risk of choking, a Japan medical group said, launching an urgent appeal to parents as the country reopens from the coronavirus crisis. The Japan Pediatric Association has warned parents that masks are too risky for infants. \u201cMasks can make breathing difficult because infants have narrow air passages,\u201d which increases the burden on their hearts, the association said, adding that masks also raise the risk of heat stroke for them. \u201cLet\u2019s stop the use of masks for children under two-years-old,\u201d the association said in a notice on its website. It said that so far there were very few serious coronavirus cases among children and that most kids became infected from family members, with almost no outbreaks at schools or day care facilities. The US Centers for Disease Control and the American Academy of Pediatrics also say children under the age of two should not wear cloth face covering. Australia will not open the country\u2019s borders \u201canytime soon\u201d, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Tuesday, but added the country will continue its discussions with neighbouring New Zealand for a trans-Tasman safe travel zone. \u201cI was speaking with Prime Minister Ardern this morning, and we\u2019ll continue to have our discussions about the trans-Tasman safe travel zone,\u201d Morrison told the National Press Club in Canberra, referring to New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. Joe Biden has made his first public appearance since March, emerging from isolation to lay a wreath to mark Memorial Day at a park in Delaware. \u201cIt feels good to be out of my house,\u201d the 77-year-old said. After abruptly cancelling a campaign rally in Cleveland on 10 March, Biden built a television studio in his home which he has used to appear on news programs and campaign fundraising events: Mexican health officials on Monday reported 2,485 new cases of coronavirus and 239 deaths, bringing the country\u2019s totals to 71,105 and 7,633, respectively. But, as we reported earlier, the toll may be significantly higher: this year, Mexico City has issued 8,072 more death certificates than the average for the same period in the past four years, according to a new study that suggests the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll could be significantly higher than the official figure of nearly 7,400. Watch: The World Health Organization has suspended testing the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients due to safety concerns. The WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, cited a paper published in the Lancet that showed people taking hydroxychloroquine were at higher risk of death and heart problems. Countries where coronavirus infections are declining could still face an \u201cimmediate second peak\u201d if they let up too soon on measures to halt the outbreak, the World Health Organization said on Monday. The world is still in the middle of the first wave of the coronavirus outbreak, WHO emergencies head Dr Mike Ryan told an online briefing, noting that while cases are declining in many countries they are still increasing in Central and South America, South Asia and Africa, Reuters reports. Ryan said epidemics often come in waves, which means that outbreaks could come back later this year in places where the first wave has subsided. There was also a chance that infection rates could rise again more quickly if measures to halt the first wave were lifted too soon. \u201cWhen we speak about a second wave classically what we often mean is there will be a first wave of the disease by itself, and then it recurs months later. And that may be a reality for many countries in a number of months\u2019 time,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cBut we need also to be cognisant of the fact that the disease can jump up at any time. We cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave. We may get a second peak in this wave.\u201d He said countries in Europe and North America should \u201ccontinue to put in place the public health and social measures, the surveillance measures, the testing measures and a comprehensive strategy to ensure that we continue on a downwards trajectory and we don\u2019t have an immediate second peak.\u201d Many European countries and US states have taken steps in recent weeks to lift lockdown measures that curbed the spread of the disease but caused severe harm to economies. Coronavirus hasn\u2019t been kind to US car owners, AP reports. Vehicle larcenies shot up 63% in New York and nearly 17% in Los Angeles from 1 January through mid-May, compared with the same period last year. And many other law enforcement agencies around the US are reporting an increase in stolen cars and vehicle burglaries, even as violent crime has dropped dramatically nationwide in the coronavirus pandemic. It\u2019s a low-risk crime with a potentially high reward, police say, especially when many drivers leave their doors unlocked or their keys inside. \u201cYou might as well put a sticker on the window that says come take my stuff,\u201d said an exasperated Alex Villanueva, the Los Angeles County sheriff. In Austin, Texas, last month, a whopping 72% of the 322 stolen vehicles had their keys nearby. The total number of auto thefts in April spiked about 50%, and burglaries to vehicles were up 2% from April 2019. Salt Lake City police Detective Greg Wilking said a 22% spike in vehicle burglaries there could be from a few criminals working quickly on car prowls. In Baltimore, though, a push to reduce the city\u2019s historically high numbers of vehicle thefts and burglaries appears to have paid off. Thefts from autos plunged 24% and stolen vehicles dropped 19% from January to May compared with the same period last year. Religious services in California will look much different under rules unveiled Monday that limit attendance to 100 people and recommend worshippers wear masks, limit singing and refrain from shaking hands or hugging, AP reports. The state released guidance under which county health departments can approve the reopening of churches, mosques, synagogues and other houses of worship. They have been closed since Governor Gavin Newsom issued a stay-at-home order in March to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Its not immediately known how soon in-person services will resume. Counties that are having success controlling the virus are likely to move quickly. Others with outbreaks such as Los Angeles County, which has about 60% of Californias roughly 3,800 deaths may choose to delay. The guidelines ask worshippers to wear masks, avoid sharing prayer books or prayer rugs and skip the collection plate. They also say to avoid large gatherings for holidays, weddings and funerals and warn that activities such as singing or group recitation \u201cnegate the benefits of social distancing. Africa has so far been spared the worst impact of the coronavirus, but the World Health Organization is worried the continent could face a \u201csilent epidemic\u201d if its leaders do not prioritise testing for it, a WHO envoy said on Monday. \u201cMy first point for Africa, my first concern, is that a lack of testing is leading to a silent epidemic in Africa. So we must continue to push leaders to prioritise testing,\u201d Samba Sow told a news conference. Saudi Arabia will revise curfew times this week, and lift it entirely across the Kingdom with the exception of the holy city of Mecca starting 21 June, state news agency reported in a statement early on Tuesday. Bans on domestic travel, holding prayers in mosques, and workplace attendance in both government and private sector will be lifted, starting 31 May, the statement added. For Mecca, the curfew time will be adjusted to 3pm-6M and prayers will be allowed to be held in mosques from 21 June. The coronavirus pandemic will have a \u201cdisastrous\u201d impact on children\u2019s rights worldwide, making them more vulnerable to forced labour and underage marriage, a rights group said Tuesday. The economic shock from lockdowns would also leave governments short of money for children\u2019s health and education, Dutch NGO KidsRights said as it launched its annual survey. The results of this year\u2019s survey do not take into account the effect of coronavirus but they will be monitored in future years, KidsRights said. \u201cThis crisis turns back the clock on years of progress made on the wellbeing of children,\u201d said Marc Dullaert, founder and chairman of KidsRights. \u201cTherefore, a strong focus for children\u2019s rights is needed more than ever.\u201d Millions of children around the world have been affected by school closures due to strict measures imposed by countries to halt the spread of the coronavirus. While children seemed to be relatively unaffected by the disease physically, \u201cnot only the economic consequences, but also the measures taken by governments... have a disastrous impact on many children\u201d, said KidsRights. School closures left boys and girls more vulnerable to child labour, early marriage and teenage pregnancy, while millions would fall into extreme poverty because of the coronavirus outbreak, the NGO said. There was also an \u201castonishing\u201d rise in domestic violence during lockdowns that was \u201cespecially devastating for girls\u201d, it added. The suspension of vaccination campaigns for children increased the risk of infant mortality, while hundreds of millions of children who normally relied on school meals were being left with no reliable source of daily nutrition. Denmark eased its border controls with other Nordic countries and Germany on Monday, allowing cross-border couples separated by the coronavirus lockdown to meet again if they can prove they have been in a relationship for at least six months, Reuters reports. The government said that within a couple of days, partners of residents of Denmark living across one of its borders would be asked to produce a written declaration to be granted entry. \u201cIf you say, you are in a relationship and put it in writing, that is enough,\u201d Justice Minister Nick Haekkerup told local broadcaster TV2. For now, though, couples will need to show shared text messages, private photos or personal information about their partner, Danish police said earlier in the day. That had sparked an outcry on Monday from lawmakers over privacy, leading to the hasty change being pushed through by the government. \u201cThey can bring along a photo or a love letter,\u201d deputy chief Allan Dalager Clausen told Danish broadcaster DR. \u201cI realise these are very intimate things, but the decision to let in the partner ultimately rests on the judgment of the individual police officer,\u201d he said. Mink with the coronavirus have infected two people in the Netherlands in what are probably the first such cases of transmission during the epidemic, government and health authorities said on Monday, Reuters reports. Mink carrying the virus were found on four of the 155 farms in the country where they are bred for their fur, Agriculture Minister Carola Schouten said in a letter to parliament that detailed the two cases. She said the risk of such animal-to-human transmission of the virus outside the farms was \u201cnegligible.\u201d On three of the four infected farms, the source of infection has been shown to be a sick human, while the fourth is still under investigation, the minister said. The Netherlands\u2019 Institute for Health\u2019s director Jaap van Dissel said that, while a few cats and other animals had been infected with Covid-19 by humans, \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve found, at least we\u2019ve shown that it\u2019s likely, that in two cases the infection has gone from animal to human,.\u201d \u201cOf course the original source of infection in China was also very likely animals,\u201d he said in testimony to parliament on Monday. A law banning mink farming in the Netherlands was passed in 2013, and the remaining farms are due to cease operations in 2023. Iceland eased its national alert against the coronavirus on Monday, allowing for public gatherings of up to 200 people and night clubs and gyms to reopen as the country nears complete recovery from the outbreak. Iceland limited the virus spread through a meticulous test and trace strategy and a full lockdown, has confirmed 1,804 infections and 10 deaths. But there have been only five reported new cases in May, and more than 99% of infected persons have recovered. Iceland\u2019s alert level was lowered from \u2018emergency phase\u2019 to \u2018alert phase\u2019, the second of three stages, the government said in a statement on Monday. Gyms can now reopen, though only at half capacity, while bars and restaurants can serve customers until 11pm, it said. Public gatherings of up to 200 persons will be allowed and a two-metre social distancing rule has become optional, but still recommended by authorities. Meanwhile, for those wishing to encourage social distancing, fashion designer Yr Johannsdottir has this solution: The Icelandic designer\u2019s knitted masks encourage social distancing by letting wearers hide behind scary tongues or fangs, AFP reported earlier this month. Novavax Inc said on Monday it has started the Phase 1 clinical trial of a novel coronavirus vaccine candidate and has enrolled the trial\u2019s first participants, with preliminary results slated for July, Reuters reports. The Maryland-based late-stage biotechnology company in April said it identified the candidate, NVX-CoV2373, with which it planned to use its Matrix-M adjuvant to enhance immune responses. Adjuvants are mainly used to make vaccines induce a strong immune response, including through the greater production of antibodies, and provide longer-lasting protection against viral and bacterial infection. Novavax said it expects preliminary immunogenicity and safety results from the trial in July. The announcement comes as drugmakers pause clinical trials for other ailments and race to find an antidote for Covid-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus which has infected more than 5.3 million people worldwide and killed over 343,000. Novavax said, upon successful completion of Phase 1, the Phase 2 portion of the trial will be conducted in several countries, including the United States. The Phase 2 trial will assess immunity, safety and Covid-19 disease reduction in a broader age range, Novavax said. Uki Go\u00f1i reports for the Guardian from Buenos Aires: One of Argentina\u2019s poorest slums was completely sealed off from the rest of the country on Monday after an explosion of coronavirus cases among its roundabout five thousand inhabitants. Around 100 tests resulted in 83 positive cases in Villa Azul in the province of Buenos Aires, one of 1800 slums in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area. The unusually proportion of positive cases led authorities to call in security forces to block streets in and out of Villa Azul. Unable to leave for work, its inhabitants will now be dependent on the government for food supplies and other essentials. \u201cThe idea is to bolster physical distancing and minimize circulation with other nearby poor communities,\u201d said Argentina\u2019s health access secretary Carla Vizzotti. A crisis committee for the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area, which has concentrated 90% of daily new cases in the last weeks, has been set up by the city of Buenos Aires, population three million, and the province of Buenos Aires, where some seven million other people inhabit the Greater Buenos Aires area. Plans are being made to cordon off a number of other \u201cvillas\u201d or slums in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area, where the virus has started to spread quickly because of cramped living conditions, lack of public services including running water and proper sewages in many cases. Argentina has 12,628 confirmed coronavirus cases and 467 deaths so far, with 552 new cases and 15 deaths reported Monday. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison will on Tuesday outline his government\u2019s plans to revive the sputtering economy, but is expected to warn a recovery will take between three to five years. Australia has reported just over 7,100 Covid-19 infections, including 102 deaths. That is well below numbers reported by many other developed countries, an achievement it attributes to tough social distancing rules, which have prevented local hospitals from being swamped but taken a heavy toll on the economy. With Australia confident it has suppressed the spread of coronavirus, Morrison will on Tuesday turn to how to revive the country\u2019s economy as debt levels rise to about 30% of GDP. Morrison will say in a speech that tax reform, deregulation and lower energy costs will be central to stimulating economic growth as Canberra begins to unwind its more than AU$250bn worth of stimulus. The central bank earlier this month forecast the AU$2tn ($1.31tn) economy would shrink by 10% in the first half of the year, marking the first recession in three decades. Australia has committed to removing the vast majority of social distancing restrictions imposed to slow the spread of Covid-19 by July, while nearly AU$70bn of government aid is scheduled to finish in September. China reported 7 new confirmed coronavirus cases in the mainland as of end-May 25, up from 11 a day earlier, the National Health Commission reported. The commission said in a statement all of the new infections were imported cases, involving travellers from overseas. It also reported 29 new asymptomatic cases - patients who are infected but do not show symptoms - versus 40 a day earlier. The total number of cases to date in the mainland stands at 82,992. The death toll remains unchanged at 4,634. Germany threw Lufthansa a \u20ac9bn (US$9.8bn) lifeline on Monday, agreeing a bailout which gives Berlin a veto in the event of a hostile bid for the airline, Reuters reports. The largest German corporate rescue since the coronavirus crisis struck will see the government get a 20% stake, which could rise to 25% plus one share in the event of a takeover attempt, as it seeks to protect thousands of jobs. Lufthansa has been locked in talks with Berlin for weeks over aid it needs to survive an expected protracted travel slump, with the airline wrangling over how much control to yield in return for financial support. Germany\u2019s central government has spent decades offloading stakes in companies, but remains a large shareholder in former state monopolies such as Deutsche Post and Deutsche Telekom. Berlin also still has a 15% holding in Commerzbank, which it took on during the global financial crisis. Germany\u2019s Finance and Economy Ministries said on Monday that Lufthansa, whose shares closed up 7.5% at \u20ac8.64, had been operationally healthy and profitable with good prospects, but had run into trouble because of the pandemic. \u201cThe support that we\u2019re preparing here is for a limited period,\u201d Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said of the deal, under which Germany is buying new shares at the nominal value of \u20ac2.56 apiece for a total of about \u20ac300m. Berlin, which has set up a \u20ac100bn fund to take stakes in companies struck by the coronavirus crisis, said it plans to sell the Lufthansa stake by the end of 2023. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte was unable to visit his dying mother in her final weeks because he obeyed coronavirus restrictions against visiting care homes, his office has said. The news about Rutte emerged as Britain was gripped by a political row over allegations that the top aide to prime minister Boris Johnson broke Covid-19 rules to travel cross-country to stay on his parents\u2019 estate, AFP reports. Rutte on Monday announced the death of 96-year-old Mieke Rutte-Dilling in a home in The Hague on 13 May, nearly two months after the government shut all such institutions to the public on 20 March. \u201cThe prime minister has complied with all directives\u201d, Rutte\u2019s spokesman told AFP when asked about reports that the premier had stuck to the rules and so not seen his mother before she died. His mother did not die of Covid-19 although there had earlier been an outbreak of the disease in the home where she was living, Dutch media reported. In case you missed it: the White House on Monday issued a statement amending the timing of the start of new restrictions on travel from Brazil to the United States to 11.59pm Eastern Time on Tuesday, 26 May. The White House announced on Sunday that it was restricting travel from Brazil to the United States, two days after the South American nation became the world\u2019s No. 2 hotspot for coronavirus cases. In its original announcement, it said the restrictions would come into force on 28 May. This year, Mexico City has issued 8,072 more death certificates than the average for the same period in the past four years, according to a new study that suggests the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll could be significantly higher than the official figure of nearly 7,400. Research published in the Mexican magazine Nexos on Monday used information from the capital\u2019s 52 civil registries to estimate the number of death certificates created between 1 January and 20 May. The report\u2019s authors, investigators Mario Romero Zavala and Laurianne Despeghel, found 37% more death certificates were issued in April 2020 than that month\u2019s average during the previous four years. By the end of May they estimated the number would mushroom by 120%. Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live coronavirus coverage with me, Helen Sullivan. I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest from around the world for the next while, and as always, it would be great to hear from you: get in touch via Twitter @helenrsullivan or email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com. Tips, questions, feedback and fun all welcome. The British prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has refused to apologise or resign for breaching lockdown rules. Cummings drove 264 miles from London to his parents\u2019 estate in Durham despite suspecting that both he and his wife had coronavirus. Cummings also admitted to having taken a second trip, to a beauty spot 30 miles from Durham, which, my colleague Rowena Mason writes, \u201che claimed was necessary to check his eyesight was good enough for the longer drive back to London.\u201d You, like me, may still have questions. We\u2019ve answered some of them here. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization has temporarily dropped hydroxychloroquine \u2013 the malaria drug Donald Trump said he is taking as a precaution \u2013 from its global study into experimental coronavirus treatments after safety concerns. The WHO\u2019s director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in light of a paper published last week in the Lancet that showed people taking hydroxychloroquine were at higher risk of death and heart problems than those who were not, it would pause the hydroxychloroquine arm of its solidarity global clinical trial. Key global developments in the coronavirus pandemic include: There are more than 5.4m cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins university coronavirus tracker, which has counted a total of 5,467,945 confirmed infections. The death toll stands at 344,731. White House brings forward Brazil travel restrictions by two days, amending the timing to 11.59pm ET on Tuesday, 26 May. The White House announced Sunday it was restricting travel from Brazil, two days after Brazil became the world\u2019s No. 2 hotspot for coronavirus cases. In its original announcement, it said the restrictions would come into force on 28 May. Dominic Cummings, the UK PM\u2019s aide, has said he does not regret breaching the lockdown. Dominic Cummings, the chief of staff to Boris Johnson, admitted driving about 250 miles (400km) from his home during the UK\u2019s lockdown, but insisted he acted reasonably. The World Health Organization has said it will temporarily drop hydroxychloroquine from its study into coronavirus treatments. Director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the decision was made in light research that showed people taking it were at higher risk of early death. Greece took another step towards normality as it reinstated ferry links with islands and allowed restaurants, cafes and bars to reopen. The moves, designed to kickstart the country\u2019s tourist industry ahead of seasonal hotels reopening on 15 June, following almost three months of enforced closure. Health authorities in Spain revised downward the country\u2019s death toll from the coronavirus by nearly 2,000, bringing the total number of deaths recorded to 26,834. A new system of gathering data had allowed them to identify cases that were counted twice and exclude deaths wrongly attributed to the virus, said Fernando Simon, the health ministry\u2019s emergencies coordinator. About 15,000 Rohingya refugees are now under coronavirus quarantine in Bangladesh\u2019s vast camps, officials said Monday, as the number of confirmed infections among them rose to 29.Health experts have long warned that the virus could race through the cramped settlements, housing almost a million Muslims who fled violence in Myanmar, and officials had restricted movement to the area in April. Spain will lift its quarantine requirement for people entering the country from 1 July, the government confirmed. At the moment, travellers from overseas are required to undergo a 14-day self-isolation on arrival. On Saturday the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said the country would reopen to tourists from July. Italy reported its fewest number of new coronavirus cases since early March. Authorities confirmed the deaths of 92 more people, bringing the total death toll from the pandemic to 32,877. New infections grew by 300, down from 531 on Sunday, with zero new cases registered in five regions. Sweden\u2019s top epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, defended his country\u2019s outbreak strategy as the number of people to have died after catching the virus passed 4,000. Critics have accused Swedish authorities of gambling with citizens\u2019 lives by not imposing strict stay-at-home measures.",

      "body": "<p>The Rose Garden at 10 Downing Street is normally reserved for British prime ministers to make set-piece announcements. But on Monday it was the scene of epic political theatre when Boris Johnson\u2019s Svengali-like aide Dominic Cummings sat down and explained to a frenzied British media pack why he had broken the Covid-19 lockdown rules \u2013 or not.</p> <p>The scene tells us a great deal about the country\u2019s politics in the first two decades of the 21st century. Cummings is the embodiment of the bewildering change that has transformed the country from clubbable member of the globalised world into a reckless, Brexit-voting outlier that is now enduring the biggest failure of statecraft since the 1930s. But how did an unelected adviser get to be the most powerful person in the UK after the prime minister? And what will his uncomfortable moment in the spotlight mean for Britain\u2019s immediate future?</p> <h2>Who is Dominic Cummings?</h2> <p>Starting with his portrayal by Benedict Cumberbatch in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/07/brexit-the-uncivil-war-review-superficial-irresponsible-tv-cumberbatch\">TV drama</a> about his triumphant leadership of the Brexit campaign, Cummings has seeped slowly into the public consciousness. However, he remained a slightly mysterious figure to most Britons outside political circles until this weekend.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-press-conference-leaves-questions-unanswered\">The lockdown breach questions Dominic Cummings has yet to clarify</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To some extent, Cummings can be seen as a typical Oxford-educated Tory toff. But although he was privately educated, still a fundamental fault line in British society, you won\u2019t find him posing in toff-tastic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/07/oxford-bullingdon-club-boris-johnson-sexism-violence-bullying-culture\">Oxford Bullingdon Club</a> photographs like Johnson and former Tory prime minister David Cameron.</p> <p>Cummings, the son of a mining engineer and a special needs teacher, grew up in County Durham in north-east England. Cummings eschewed Durham\u2019s prevailing leftwing politics when he was growing up, instead championing the region\u2019s nemesis, Margaret Thatcher, during the bitter miners\u2019 strike of the 1980s (an academic Billy Elliott he was not).</p> <p>He is remembered by university contemporaries and tutors as an outsider who was incredibly sharp. The bookish student was said to be a favourite of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/25/norman-stone-obituary\">the rightwing history professor Norman Stone</a>. Another of his teachers, the history don Robin Lane Fox, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000744y\">was once asked</a> who was smarter, Johnson or Cummings. He replied: \u201cDominic, by a long way. Different class altogether.\u201d</p> <p>After leaving Oxford with a first in ancient and modern history, he spent three years in post-Soviet Russia before drifting into Conservative party politics as a kind of intellectual provocateur <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2002/jul/28/conservatives.politicalnews\">seemingly on a mission to upset the establishment</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2013/feb/26/downing-street-garden-secrets\">Downing Street garden reveals its secrets</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>What has he done to British politics?</h2> <p>Cummings found his political mojo in 2004, when the then Labour government wanted to introduce regional assemblies.</p> <p>Taking his deeply entrenched dislike for officialdom, he turned the campaign about whether the north should have its own political voice into a simpler one about money. His idea to hire a giant inflatable white elephant and parade it around the region as a symbol of what the assembly would become struck a chord with voters. What had seemed like a nailed-on win for the yes campaign became a resounding no, arguably setting the template for the type of Cummings cunning that would carry the day in the 2016 Brexit referendum.</p> <p>Before he got there, however, Cummings had reached Whitehall in the early 2010s as special adviser to then education secretary, Michael Gove. Cummings\u2019 open contempt for civil service conventions made him a polarising figure, so much so that the prime minister, Cameron, described him as a \u201ccareer psychopath\u201d.</p> <p>But while the suave Cameron was sleepwalking into Brexit, Cummings was setting out his political manifesto in his now-famous <a href=\"https://dominiccummings.com/\">blog</a>. This prodigiously ambitious collection of ruminations attempts to describe how science \u2013 everything from Newtonian physics to epidemiology \u2013 could be used to improve governance and public policy, sweeping away what he sees as the amateurish, arts-educated civil service and replacing it with cleverer technocrats with degrees in maths and engineering.</p> <p>His approach helped harness popular disillusionment with the political class to triumph in the 2016 Brexit referendum, and his emergence as Johnson\u2019s top adviser has handed him the chance to swing the Conservative party behind a radical rightwing agenda and reform the entire political system, even advertising earlier this year for \u201cweirdos and misfits\u201d to apply for jobs at No 10.</p> <h2>What happened in the lockdown?</h2> <p>The coronavirus has torn through the UK killing more than 37,000 people, blindsiding a political class that has appeared underpreprared, complacent and incompetent. The inability to contain the spread forced the country into a rigid lockdown, with rules drafted in part by Cummings himself. On Saturday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/22/dominic-cummings-durham-trip-coronavirus-lockdown\">the Guardian revealed</a> that at the end of March Cummings and his wife, Mary Wakefield \u2013 who is a commissioning editor for Spectator magazine \u2013 both suffering symptoms of Covid-19, drove 400km north to his parents\u2019 farm because he feared he couldn\u2019t look after his young son. It then emerged he had driven to a north-east beauty spot with Wakefield and their and child during the lockdown. This flouting of the social distancing rules have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/how-can-a-prime-minister-blatantly-lie-to-protect-his-adviser-dominic-cummings\">brought a hail of criticism on his head</a>, with a telling charge that there was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-one-rule-establishment-sacrifices\">one rule for the elite and one rule for the rest of the country</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-public-sympathy-boris-johnson-chief-adviser-no-10\">Appearing before the media</a> on Monday, the usually unaccountable, silent figure explained in his mild northern accent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/i-think-i-behaved-reasonably-dominic-cummings-defends-actions-in-lockdown-row\">why it was perfectly reasonable to make the journey </a>and then have another spin in his Range Rover to test his eyesight. Most of the public had probably never even heard him speak before, an odd feature for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/stay-elite-what-the-papers-say-about-dominic-cummings-refusal-to-quit\">a moment that stopped the nation</a>.</p> <h2>What happens next?</h2> <p>Cummings\u2019s defiant performance in front of the media brought another statement of support from Boris Johnson, who claims that his most valued adviser had acted reasonably. But the deciding factor in determining Cummings\u2019s future in No 10 will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/public-anger-swells-ranks-tory-mps-turning-on-dominic-cummings\">reaction of voters </a>who have been locked up in strict isolation for weeks. A growing number of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/tory-unrest-increases-pressure-pm-sack-dominic-cummings\"> Tory MPs are calling for Cummings to be sacked</a> as their inboxes fill with irate emails from their fed up constituents. One Tory MP speaking off the record summed up the gathering national mood: \u201cHe claims to be part of a government of the people against \u2018the elite\u2019, but really he has shown contempt for the people I represent.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Rose Garden at 10 Downing Street is normally reserved for British prime ministers to make set-piece announcements. But on Monday it was the scene of epic political theatre when Boris Johnson\u2019s Svengali-like aide Dominic Cummings sat down and explained to a frenzied British media pack why he had broken the Covid-19 lockdown rules \u2013 or not. The scene tells us a great deal about the country\u2019s politics in the first two decades of the 21st century. Cummings is the embodiment of the bewildering change that has transformed the country from clubbable member of the globalised world into a reckless, Brexit-voting outlier that is now enduring the biggest failure of statecraft since the 1930s. But how did an unelected adviser get to be the most powerful person in the UK after the prime minister? And what will his uncomfortable moment in the spotlight mean for Britain\u2019s immediate future? Who is Dominic Cummings? Starting with his portrayal by Benedict Cumberbatch in a TV drama about his triumphant leadership of the Brexit campaign, Cummings has seeped slowly into the public consciousness. However, he remained a slightly mysterious figure to most Britons outside political circles until this weekend. To some extent, Cummings can be seen as a typical Oxford-educated Tory toff. But although he was privately educated, still a fundamental fault line in British society, you won\u2019t find him posing in toff-tastic Oxford Bullingdon Club photographs like Johnson and former Tory prime minister David Cameron. Cummings, the son of a mining engineer and a special needs teacher, grew up in County Durham in north-east England. Cummings eschewed Durham\u2019s prevailing leftwing politics when he was growing up, instead championing the region\u2019s nemesis, Margaret Thatcher, during the bitter miners\u2019 strike of the 1980s (an academic Billy Elliott he was not). He is remembered by university contemporaries and tutors as an outsider who was incredibly sharp. The bookish student was said to be a favourite of the rightwing history professor Norman Stone. Another of his teachers, the history don Robin Lane Fox, was once asked who was smarter, Johnson or Cummings. He replied: \u201cDominic, by a long way. Different class altogether.\u201d After leaving Oxford with a first in ancient and modern history, he spent three years in post-Soviet Russia before drifting into Conservative party politics as a kind of intellectual provocateur seemingly on a mission to upset the establishment. What has he done to British politics? Cummings found his political mojo in 2004, when the then Labour government wanted to introduce regional assemblies. Taking his deeply entrenched dislike for officialdom, he turned the campaign about whether the north should have its own political voice into a simpler one about money. His idea to hire a giant inflatable white elephant and parade it around the region as a symbol of what the assembly would become struck a chord with voters. What had seemed like a nailed-on win for the yes campaign became a resounding no, arguably setting the template for the type of Cummings cunning that would carry the day in the 2016 Brexit referendum. Before he got there, however, Cummings had reached Whitehall in the early 2010s as special adviser to then education secretary, Michael Gove. Cummings\u2019 open contempt for civil service conventions made him a polarising figure, so much so that the prime minister, Cameron, described him as a \u201ccareer psychopath\u201d. But while the suave Cameron was sleepwalking into Brexit, Cummings was setting out his political manifesto in his now-famous blog. This prodigiously ambitious collection of ruminations attempts to describe how science \u2013 everything from Newtonian physics to epidemiology \u2013 could be used to improve governance and public policy, sweeping away what he sees as the amateurish, arts-educated civil service and replacing it with cleverer technocrats with degrees in maths and engineering. His approach helped harness popular disillusionment with the political class to triumph in the 2016 Brexit referendum, and his emergence as Johnson\u2019s top adviser has handed him the chance to swing the Conservative party behind a radical rightwing agenda and reform the entire political system, even advertising earlier this year for \u201cweirdos and misfits\u201d to apply for jobs at No 10. What happened in the lockdown? The coronavirus has torn through the UK killing more than 37,000 people, blindsiding a political class that has appeared underpreprared, complacent and incompetent. The inability to contain the spread forced the country into a rigid lockdown, with rules drafted in part by Cummings himself. On Saturday the Guardian revealed that at the end of March Cummings and his wife, Mary Wakefield \u2013 who is a commissioning editor for Spectator magazine \u2013 both suffering symptoms of Covid-19, drove 400km north to his parents\u2019 farm because he feared he couldn\u2019t look after his young son. It then emerged he had driven to a north-east beauty spot with Wakefield and their and child during the lockdown. This flouting of the social distancing rules have brought a hail of criticism on his head, with a telling charge that there was one rule for the elite and one rule for the rest of the country. Appearing before the media on Monday, the usually unaccountable, silent figure explained in his mild northern accent why it was perfectly reasonable to make the journey and then have another spin in his Range Rover to test his eyesight. Most of the public had probably never even heard him speak before, an odd feature for a moment that stopped the nation. What happens next? Cummings\u2019s defiant performance in front of the media brought another statement of support from Boris Johnson, who claims that his most valued adviser had acted reasonably. But the deciding factor in determining Cummings\u2019s future in No 10 will be reaction of voters who have been locked up in strict isolation for weeks. A growing number of Tory MPs are calling for Cummings to be sacked as their inboxes fill with irate emails from their fed up constituents. One Tory MP speaking off the record summed up the gathering national mood: \u201cHe claims to be part of a government of the people against \u2018the elite\u2019, but really he has shown contempt for the people I represent.\u201d",

The rush is understandable \u2013 the financial benefits to the league of getting bums back on seats are clear, but what would a match-day experience look like in the Covid-19 era? And would it really be an enjoyable day out?</p> <p>Picture this: you travel to the stadium, running a little late after having to wait until there were fewer than 12 people in front of you before you could get on a bus. Rushing in, you have your temperature taken by stadium security before meeting up with your friends, or at least waving to each other from a few seats away while you keep your distance from each other.</p> <p>Not wanting to risk stadium food, presuming any will be sold, you unwrap your soggy sandwich and then wander around in search of a beer. After procuring one \u2013 once you get to the front of a long, socially distanced line \u2013 you traipse back to your seat and shout your thoughts about the team lineups to those within hearing distance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/26/nrls-idea-to-return-crowds-to-stadiums-within-weeks-absurd-and-dangerous-says-doctors-association\">NRL's idea to return crowds to stadiums within weeks \u2018absurd and dangerous\u2019, says doctors\u2019 association</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The MC is trying their best to generate some excitement but your cheering sounds echoey surrounded by all the empty seats and you start to feel self-conscious. Your team scores and you turn to hug and high-five the people around you before remembering there is no one around you and even if there were, you couldn\u2019t touch them anyway.</p> <p>Your team wins and the team song rattles through the eerie half-emptiness as you await instructions for your departure. At last you\u2019re able to get through an exit without being within 1.5 metres of anyone else, wait an hour to get back on the bus and finally make it home where you settle down with a beer on the couch to watch the replay and wonder if that might have been a better plan all along.</p> <p>At the heart of what makes a match-day experience enjoyable is the feeling of being part of something bigger. No matter the size of the stadium, there is an unmistakeable magic about having every seat in the place filled and the explosion of colour and noise that comes from that. Whether it\u2019s a united crowd who all rise as one to celebrate the home team\u2019s victory or a divided one, who push and pull like a tug of war when each team scores, it\u2019s a thrilling beast to be a part of.</p> <p>Aside from the sport itself, a well-devised fan engagement program creates the feeling among those in attendance that they are more than spectators. Well-timed music, a knowledgeable and engaging MC and videos on the big screen work as a conductor, bringing the crowd together like an orchestra to lift the atmosphere and create their own kind of music.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/26/bulldozer-tactics-see-nrl-win-australias-race-to-return-first\">Bulldozer tactics see NRL win Australia's race to return first | Nick Tedeschi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is important for those watching on TV as well \u2013 an empty stadium is just as strange to watch from your home as it is to experience in person.

      "bodyText": "The NRL wants to get fans back into stadiums as soon as possible, under strict biosecurity guidelines, of course. The rush is understandable \u2013 the financial benefits to the league of getting bums back on seats are clear, but what would a match-day experience look like in the Covid-19 era? And would it really be an enjoyable day out? Picture this: you travel to the stadium, running a little late after having to wait until there were fewer than 12 people in front of you before you could get on a bus. Rushing in, you have your temperature taken by stadium security before meeting up with your friends, or at least waving to each other from a few seats away while you keep your distance from each other. Not wanting to risk stadium food, presuming any will be sold, you unwrap your soggy sandwich and then wander around in search of a beer. After procuring one \u2013 once you get to the front of a long, socially distanced line \u2013 you traipse back to your seat and shout your thoughts about the team lineups to those within hearing distance. The MC is trying their best to generate some excitement but your cheering sounds echoey surrounded by all the empty seats and you start to feel self-conscious. Your team scores and you turn to hug and high-five the people around you before remembering there is no one around you and even if there were, you couldn\u2019t touch them anyway. Your team wins and the team song rattles through the eerie half-emptiness as you await instructions for your departure. At last you\u2019re able to get through an exit without being within 1.5 metres of anyone else, wait an hour to get back on the bus and finally make it home where you settle down with a beer on the couch to watch the replay and wonder if that might have been a better plan all along. At the heart of what makes a match-day experience enjoyable is the feeling of being part of something bigger. No matter the size of the stadium, there is an unmistakeable magic about having every seat in the place filled and the explosion of colour and noise that comes from that. Whether it\u2019s a united crowd who all rise as one to celebrate the home team\u2019s victory or a divided one, who push and pull like a tug of war when each team scores, it\u2019s a thrilling beast to be a part of. Aside from the sport itself, a well-devised fan engagement program creates the feeling among those in attendance that they are more than spectators. Well-timed music, a knowledgeable and engaging MC and videos on the big screen work as a conductor, bringing the crowd together like an orchestra to lift the atmosphere and create their own kind of music. This is important for those watching on TV as well \u2013 an empty stadium is just as strange to watch from your home as it is to experience in person. A full stadium with an engaged crowd makes for great TV, which is probably why the NRL is so keen to bring fans back. With that in mind, there have been attempts to make that scenario more watchable \u2013 fill the stands with artificial fans (that didn\u2019t go too well in Korea, sadly), and other innovative ideas being floated to make it a more \u201creal\u201d and therefore presumably enjoyable experience. In Japan, trials are under way for a remote cheering system that enables TV viewers to send their cheers (and, presumably, jeers) from the couch to speakers around the stadium. Looking to the future, this may be a defining moment in how teams connect with their fans. Sporting organisations have had to be more innovative in devising connections through social media and ensuring fans don\u2019t lose their loyalty to their teams. Greg Bowman, the managing and creative director of Great Big Events \u2013 a company that specialises in creating match-day experiences at sporting events \u2013 believes this online engagement will become part and parcel of the way match days are planned. \u201cA lot of the online outreach, via apps and social engagement, will be more integral for sport,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead of just being about game day in the arena, it will become more about engaging with fans throughout the whole event experience, even when they\u2019re not at the stadiums.\u201d So as you watch your team return to the field this weekend and start working on the cardboard cutout of yourself to stick on the hill at Campbelltown, consider what it is that connects you with your team and whether your \u201cI was there\u201d moment might be that much more enjoyable when we can all stand shoulder-to-shoulder once more.",

Also of concern to WHO officials are accelerating outbreaks in Peru, Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua. Global deaths from coronavirus surpassed 350,000 on Wednesday. The number of confirmed cases was more than 5.58 million. The US, the worst-hit nation, was approaching 100,000 deaths. A University of Washington study warned that Brazil\u2019s total death toll could rise five-fold \u2013 to 125,000 \u2013 by early August. The forecast from the university\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) came with a call for lockdowns that Brazil\u2019s right-wing president, Jair Bolsonaro, has resisted. The current data projects Covid-19 deaths in Peru totalling nearly 20,000 by August, IHME said, indicating demand is likely to outstrip of the supply of beds in intensive care units. The latest IHME model projections see deaths rising to nearly 12,000 in Chile, 7,000 in Mexico, 6,000 in Ecuador, 5,500 in Argentina and to 4,500 in Colombia by August. One country in the region doing relatively well against Covid-19 is Cuba, where the IHME forecasts a death toll of just 82 by August while testing continues to outpace the outbreak. In other coronavirus developments: Germany has extended social distancing rules aimed at containing the spread of the coronavirus epidemic to 29 June, Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government said on Tuesday. New Zealand has reported a fifth consecutive day of no new cases of Covid-19 recorded in the country. Japan\u2019s football league launched a \u201cremote cheering\u2019 app to boost the atmosphere at empty stadiums as teams prepared to resume play. Fans\u2019 voices will reverberate around the ground in real time via loudspeakers. in South Korea, a man has been jailed for four months for breaking quarantine rules in the country\u2019s first such prison sentence. The country reported 40 new cases on Wednesday, its biggest daily jump in nearly 50 days, causing alarm on the day when millions of children were returning to school. In Britain, PM Boris Johnson is under growing pressure to fire his adviser Dominic Cummings over a breach of lockdown rules. In Spain, the government declared 10 days of mourning starting on Wednesday. Australia recorded its youngest victim, a 30-year-old man. The Church of the Nativity and the ruins of ancient Pompeii reopened to pilgrims and tourists, as countries further eased coronavirus controls and reopened shuttered economies.

      "body": "<p>The government\u2019s \u201csnapback\u201d strategy has finally snapped. Gone is the Keynesian language about the benefits of the largest stimulus package in Australian history, when jobkeeper was announced in March. Tuesday\u2019s National Press Club address by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, makes clear that his government has returned to austerity, victim blaming and cliches.</p> <p>Like a lost driver claiming to have deliberately taken the scenic route, Scott Morrison is desperate to make a fiscal virtue out of the Australian Tax Office\u2019s $60bn administrative error. Just last week, the Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, was assuring the Senate that the unprecedented size of the government\u2019s fiscal stimulus package was appropriate, given the unprecedented size of the recession we are headed into. But this week, after learning that jobkeeker was only providing half of the stimulus he had promised, Morrison is pretending that he never really wanted to spend the full $130bn on jobkeeper anyway.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/27/scott-morrison-refuses-to-guarantee-pay-and-conditions-under-industrial-relations-overhaul\">Scott Morrison refuses to guarantee pay and conditions under industrial relations overhaul</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The underspend on jobkeeper is based on two entirely unrelated errors, but Morrison is now banking on Treasury having made a third \u2013 even bigger \u2013 mistake. Let\u2019s look at them one by one.</p> <p>The first mistake was the original costing of jobkeeper by Treasury, which predicted more than six million workers would benefit from the payment. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/13/australian-business-cant-lead-us-out-of-this-recession-the-government-must-step-up\">As I\u2019ve said before,</a> the numbers never looked right. With less than 14 million people in the entire labour force, the decision to exempt most casuals and temporary visa holders from the jobkeeper scheme meant that Treasury was predicting nearly half the eligible workforce would have qualified for a wage subsidy. Given that no one was predicting more than two million job losses, this meant that only three things were possible:</p> <p>1. The recession was going to be far deeper than Treasury\u2019s 10% forecast.</p> <p>2. We were going to give an enormous amount of public money to companies that had no intention of standing down most of their staff.</p> <p>3. The program would be massively underspent.</p> <p>I put my money on it being number two, and a bit of three. My colleague, Jim Stanford at the Centre of Future Work, went for a lot of three and a bit of two. Treasury was way off.</p> <p>The next error was made by the ATO, and it is worse in many ways. Forecasting is hard at the best of times and February was not the best of times.

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s \u201csnapback\u201d strategy has finally snapped. Gone is the Keynesian language about the benefits of the largest stimulus package in Australian history, when jobkeeper was announced in March. Tuesday\u2019s National Press Club address by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, makes clear that his government has returned to austerity, victim blaming and cliches. Like a lost driver claiming to have deliberately taken the scenic route, Scott Morrison is desperate to make a fiscal virtue out of the Australian Tax Office\u2019s $60bn administrative error. Just last week, the Treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy, was assuring the Senate that the unprecedented size of the government\u2019s fiscal stimulus package was appropriate, given the unprecedented size of the recession we are headed into. But this week, after learning that jobkeeker was only providing half of the stimulus he had promised, Morrison is pretending that he never really wanted to spend the full $130bn on jobkeeper anyway. The underspend on jobkeeper is based on two entirely unrelated errors, but Morrison is now banking on Treasury having made a third \u2013 even bigger \u2013 mistake. Let\u2019s look at them one by one. The first mistake was the original costing of jobkeeper by Treasury, which predicted more than six million workers would benefit from the payment. As I\u2019ve said before, the numbers never looked right. With less than 14 million people in the entire labour force, the decision to exempt most casuals and temporary visa holders from the jobkeeper scheme meant that Treasury was predicting nearly half the eligible workforce would have qualified for a wage subsidy. Given that no one was predicting more than two million job losses, this meant that only three things were possible: 1. The recession was going to be far deeper than Treasury\u2019s 10% forecast. 2. We were going to give an enormous amount of public money to companies that had no intention of standing down most of their staff. 3. The program would be massively underspent. I put my money on it being number two, and a bit of three. My colleague, Jim Stanford at the Centre of Future Work, went for a lot of three and a bit of two. Treasury was way off. The next error was made by the ATO, and it is worse in many ways. Forecasting is hard at the best of times and February was not the best of times. But once the jobkeeper cash started to flow out of the government\u2019s bank accounts and into employers bank accounts, the forecasting stopped and the counting should have begun. Time will tell how it happened but, to be clear, the ATO\u2019s error was that it had no idea how much money it was actually spending. In an incredible coincidence or cock-up, the wrong number they came up with happened to be about the same as Treasury\u2019s flawed forecast. And now, Morrison is not just betting his credibility, but the livelihood of millions of Australians, on the belief that his Treasury has made a third error about the size of the recession Australia is heading for. Both the Treasury and the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) have forecast that Australia\u2019s GDP will be 10% smaller by September than it was in December last year. To put that fall into context, the 1991 recession saw GDP fall by less than 1.5%. If recessions were a wave, then the one heading towards us now is expected to be seven times higher than the last one to hit us. If Treasury\u2019s forecast is a bit out and GDP \u201conly\u201d falls by 8% then the recession will \u201conly\u201d be five times worse than 1991. Last week, Kennedy addressed the Covid-19 Senate committee and assured the parliament not only that jobkeeper was being delivered to more than six million people, but that the $130bn cost of jobkeeper was appropriate, given the size of the recession that Treasury is expecting. So the $60bn question is: does Treasury still think we are heading for the biggest recession in a century? It would be phenomenal news if Treasury and the RBA no longer thought that Australia\u2019s national income was about to fall by 10%. The 1.5% recession of 1991 ruined hundreds of thousands of lives, and while the unemployment rate took years to fall, the reality is a lot of retrenched workers wound up on the age pension before the labour market created another job for them. Avoiding the 10% recession forecast would be the best possible news. But despite fronting the press club for an hour on Tuesday, Morrison made no mention of any such great news from Treasury. On the contrary, after demonstrating that his government had spectacularly failed to roll out the promised fiscal stimulus, Morrison simply tried to shift responsibility for managing the economy away from his government and on to the shoulders of everyone else.

Blaming the victim always works in Australia. Morrison also tried to shift responsibility for job creation on to the unions and employer groups on Tuesday. Having finally ditched the conservative virtue signalling union busting legislation, Morrison is now arguing that industrial relations reform is central to his \u201cjobmaker\u201d plan, but ultimately the responsibility of others to design.

Drug-related deaths in England and Wales had already hit a record high before coronavirus struck.</p> \n<p>Lorraine Maden, lead clinical pharmacist at We Are With You, said the click-and-collect service was under consideration prior to the pandemic as a means to reach out to people who had not previously engaged with services but added \u201cCovid-19 has accelerated it\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen we provide the equipment it\u2019s about the interventions we can have, the conversation to get people into treatment and recovery longer term,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>People who inject drugs including heroin and steroids are able to access a web portal and request a wide range of needles and equipment including foil packs, needles for different types of veins and specially designed spoons that do not burn when users heat them up.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>They will then be able to collect them from an arranged address where they will be met by staff, who have personal protective equipment (PPE) who will provide the delivery using social distancing measures.</p> \n<p>Many users of drugs have underlying health conditions, Maden said, and require delivery to the door.</p> \n<p>\u201cA lot of our clients our heroin users and have COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a lung condition],\u201d she said. \u201cThe age of users, particularly if they have smoked crack and heroin over the years, some of them are having to shield.\u201d</p> \n<p>Needle sharing facilitates the passing of blood-borne viruses and so, by providing clean equipment, levels of a wide range of diseases, including Hepatitis-B, Hepatitis-C and HIV, can be reduced and consequently relieve the burden on healthcare.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe more that we can do to reduce those costs is a benefit to society as a whole,\u201d Maden says, adding there is also a risk factor with Covid-19 and sharing drug equipment.</p> \n<p>Dr Rachel Britton, director of pharmacy at the charity, said across the country they have had to individually assess clients who require daily supervised consumption to see if they can switch to collecting the medication weekly or even fortnightly. Across England, the number of users of drugs who require supervised consumption has reduced from 51% as of January to 16% now.</p> \n<p>She said: \u201cWe moved away from people having to attend the pharmacy every day to collecting their medication either weekly or in some cases every two weeks, so moving quite quickly away from the need to go to the pharmacy every day. That obviously helped the pharmacy as well.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s always safer for clients to have OST available to them rather than be off it and use street drugs. That was the overarching principle. People are on supervised consumption, if we remove that how do we keep them safe?\u201d</p> \n<p>But there are risks in taking people off daily supervised consumption, Britton said, with risks of clients taking a week\u2019s worth of methadone in one day or selling methadone to other individuals, known as diversion.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe were particularly concerned about people who had a recent history of overdose, particularly if that was intentional,\u201d she said. \u201cGiving that group of individuals a large quantity of opiates is not a safe thing to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>Shortly after lockdown measures were introduced, the government announced plans to allow pharmacists to provide OST medication without a prescription but many weeks past before the legislation was laid \u2013 and even then a \u201cpush the button\u201d clause was written in, meaning a secretary of state has to formally enact the measure.</p> \n<p>Britton said the legislation \u201cwould have made a difference done at the beginning\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe would still like that legislation enacted,\u201d she said. \u201cAlthough there\u2019s no massive crash of the system, and that includes us, at the beginning it would have been valuable.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "An online click-and-collect service for needles and drug equipment has been set up by a national treatment charity as the sector seeks to adapt to the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. We Are With You, which provides drug and alcohol treatment services in 80 locations in England and Scotland, has started the initiative in Truro in Cornwall, the Scottish Borders, Dumfries and Galloway, Argyll and Bute and Glasgow. The scheme is one of a number of changes that drug treatment services have introduced to adapt to the restrictive lockdown environment, with others including restructuring of supervised consumption of heroin substitute treatment, and door-to-door delivery of the anti-overdose medication naloxone. But senior directors at the charity have criticised the government for failing to enact measures earlier in the pandemic that could have simplified the provision of opioid substitute therapy (OST) with methadone or buprenorphine. People who use drugs are vulnerable during the pandemic due to itinerant lifestyles, underlying health conditions and limited access to public health information. Drug-related deaths in England and Wales had already hit a record high before coronavirus struck. Lorraine Maden, lead clinical pharmacist at We Are With You, said the click-and-collect service was under consideration prior to the pandemic as a means to reach out to people who had not previously engaged with services but added \u201cCovid-19 has accelerated it\u201d. \u201cWhen we provide the equipment it\u2019s about the interventions we can have, the conversation to get people into treatment and recovery longer term,\u201d she said. People who inject drugs including heroin and steroids are able to access a web portal and request a wide range of needles and equipment including foil packs, needles for different types of veins and specially designed spoons that do not burn when users heat them up. They will then be able to collect them from an arranged address where they will be met by staff, who have personal protective equipment (PPE) who will provide the delivery using social distancing measures. Many users of drugs have underlying health conditions, Maden said, and require delivery to the door. \u201cA lot of our clients our heroin users and have COPD [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a lung condition],\u201d she said. \u201cThe age of users, particularly if they have smoked crack and heroin over the years, some of them are having to shield.\u201d Needle sharing facilitates the passing of blood-borne viruses and so, by providing clean equipment, levels of a wide range of diseases, including Hepatitis-B, Hepatitis-C and HIV, can be reduced and consequently relieve the burden on healthcare. \u201cThe more that we can do to reduce those costs is a benefit to society as a whole,\u201d Maden says, adding there is also a risk factor with Covid-19 and sharing drug equipment. Dr Rachel Britton, director of pharmacy at the charity, said across the country they have had to individually assess clients who require daily supervised consumption to see if they can switch to collecting the medication weekly or even fortnightly. Across England, the number of users of drugs who require supervised consumption has reduced from 51% as of January to 16% now. She said: \u201cWe moved away from people having to attend the pharmacy every day to collecting their medication either weekly or in some cases every two weeks, so moving quite quickly away from the need to go to the pharmacy every day. That obviously helped the pharmacy as well. \u201cIt\u2019s always safer for clients to have OST available to them rather than be off it and use street drugs. That was the overarching principle. People are on supervised consumption, if we remove that how do we keep them safe?\u201d But there are risks in taking people off daily supervised consumption, Britton said, with risks of clients taking a week\u2019s worth of methadone in one day or selling methadone to other individuals, known as diversion. \u201cWe were particularly concerned about people who had a recent history of overdose, particularly if that was intentional,\u201d she said. \u201cGiving that group of individuals a large quantity of opiates is not a safe thing to do.\u201d Shortly after lockdown measures were introduced, the government announced plans to allow pharmacists to provide OST medication without a prescription but many weeks past before the legislation was laid \u2013 and even then a \u201cpush the button\u201d clause was written in, meaning a secretary of state has to formally enact the measure. Britton said the legislation \u201cwould have made a difference done at the beginning\u201d. \u201cWe would still like that legislation enacted,\u201d she said. \u201cAlthough there\u2019s no massive crash of the system, and that includes us, at the beginning it would have been valuable.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Amid the smog of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/26/lying-government-coronavirus-crisis-dominic-cummings\">lies and contradictions</a>, there is one question we should never stop asking: why has the government of the United Kingdom so spectacularly failed to defend people\u2019s lives? Why has \u201cthis fortress built by Nature for herself against infection\u201d, as Shakespeare described our islands, succumbed to a greater extent than any other European nation to a foreseeable and containable pandemic?</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/19/uk-government-pandemic\">Part of the answer</a> is that the government knowingly and deliberately stood down crucial parts of its emergency response system. Another part is that, when it did at last seek to mobilise the system, crucial bits of the machine immediately fell off. There is a consistent reason for the multiple, systemic failures the pandemic has exposed: the intrusion of corporate power into public policy. Privatisation, commercialisation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/07/outsourcing-coronavirus-crisis-business-failed-nhs-staff\">outsourcing</a> and offshoring have severely compromised the UK\u2019s ability to respond to a crisis.</p> <p>Take, for example, the lethal failures to provide protective clothing, masks and other equipment (PPE) to health workers. A <a href=\"https://weownit.org.uk/sites/default/files/attachments/Privatised%20and%20Unprepared%20-%20The%20NHS%20Supply%20Chain%20Final.pdf\">report</a> by the campaigning group We Own It seeks to explain why so many doctors, nurses and other hospital workers have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/23/emails-reveal-doctors-plea-for-ppe-before-covid-19-death-dr-peter-tun\">died unnecessarily</a> of Covid-19. It describes a system built around the needs not of health workers or patients, but of corporations and commercial contracts: a system that could scarcely be better designed for failure.</p> <p>Four layers of commercial contractors, each rich with opportunities for profit-making, stand between doctors and nurses and the equipment they need. These layers are then fragmented into 11 tottering, uncoordinated supply chains, creating an almost perfect formula for chaos. Among the many weak links in these chains are consultancy companies<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/04/uk-government-using-crisis-to-transfer-nhs-duties-to-private-sector\"> like Deloitte</a>, whose farcical attempts to procure emergency supplies of PPE have been <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/dark-money-investigations/useless-deloitte-accused-of-ppe-failings-amid-covid-19-deal-secrecy/\">fiercely criticised</a> by both manufacturers and health workers.</p> <p>At the end of the chains are manufacturing companies, some of which have mysteriously been granted monopolies on the supply of essential equipment. These private monopolies have either failed to meet their contracts, or provided defective gear to the entire NHS, like the <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/09/ppe-crisis-15m-protective-goggles-pulled-safety-fears/\">15</a><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/09/ppe-crisis-15m-protective-goggles-pulled-safety-fears/\">m protective goggles</a> and the planeload of <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/07/revealed-emailed-offer-help-turkish-t-shirt-salesman-led-ppe/\">useless surgical gowns</a> that had to be recalled.</p> <p>Instead of stockpiling supplies, as emergency preparedness demands, companies in these chains have been using just-in-time production systems, whose purpose is to cut their costs by minimising stocks. Their minimised systems could not be scaled up fast enough to meet the shortfall. Where there should be a smooth, coordinated, accountable programme, there\u2019s opacity, byzantine complexity and total chaos. So much for the efficiencies of privatisation.</p> <p>The pandemic has also exposed the privatised care system as catastrophically unfit and ill-prepared. In 1993, 95% of care at home was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/social-care-network/2016/may/12/why-dont-we-talk-more-about-the-privatisation-of-social-care\">provided publicly by local authorities</a>. Now, almost all of it \u2013 and almost all residential care \u2013 is provided by private companies. Even before the pandemic, the system was falling apart, as many care companies, unable to balance the needs of their patients with the demands of their shareholders, collapsed, often with disastrous consequences.</p> <p>Now we discover <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/covid19-social-care-sector/\">just how dangerous</a> their commercial imperatives have become, as the drive to make care profitable has created a fragmented, incoherent system, answerable sometimes to offshore owners, that fails to meet basic standards, and employs harassed workers on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/08/care-workers-pay-ppe-stress-zero-hours-contracts-coronavirus\">zero-hour contracts</a>. If there is one thing we have learnt from this pandemic, it\u2019s the need for a publicly owned, publicly run <a href=\"https://weownit.org.uk/blog/why-we-need-national-care-service\">National Care Service</a> \u2013 the care equivalent of the NHS.</p> <p>It could all become much worse, due to another effect of corporate power. A <a href=\"https://corporateeurope.org/en/2020/05/cashing-pandemic-how-lawyers-are-preparing-sue-states-over-covid-19-response-measures\">report by the Corporate Europe Observatory</a> shows how law firms are exploring the possibility of suing governments for the measures they have taken to stop the pandemic. Many trade treaties contain a provision called \u201cinvestor state dispute settlement\u201d. This enables corporations to sue governments in opaque offshore tribunals, for any policies that might affect their \u201cfuture anticipated profits\u201d.</p> <p>So when governments, in response to coronavirus, have imposed travel restrictions, or requisitioned hotels, or instructed companies to produce medical equipment or limit the price of drugs, the companies could sue them for the loss of the money they might otherwise have made. When the UK government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-nhs-private-hospitals-join-forces-academics-warn-over-strategy\">commandeers private hospitals</a> or the Spanish government prevents evictions by landlords, and stops water and electricity companies from <a href=\"https://www.euroweeklynews.com/2020/03/17/spain-reassures-public-water-gas-electricity-supplies-will-not-be-cut-off-amid-coronavirus-crisis/\">cutting off destitute customers</a>, they could be open to international legal challenge. These measures, which override democracy, have already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/04/us-trade-deal-full-frontal-assault-on-democracy\">hampered attempts</a> by many governments, particularly of poorer nations, to protect their people from disasters. They urgently need to be rescinded.</p> <p>The effectiveness of our health system is also threatened by the trade treaty the UK government <a href=\"https://www.globaljustice.org.uk/blog/2020/mar/4/dont-be-fooled-governments-pledge-keep-nhs-out-trump-trade-deal-these-are-just-empty\">hopes to sign with the US</a>. The Conservatives promised in their manifesto that <a href=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5da42e2cae7ebd3f8bde353c/5dda924905da587992a064ba_Conservative%202019%20Manifesto.pdf\">\u201cthe NHS is not on the table\u201d</a> in the trade talks. But they have already broken their accompanying promise, \u201cwe will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards\u201d. Earlier this month, <a href=\"http://www.farmbusiness.co.uk/news/minister-claims-unintended-consequences-as-agriculture-bill-import-standards-amendment-is-defeated.html\">they voted that measure out</a> of the agriculture bill. US companies are aggressively demanding access to the NHS. The talks will be extremely complex and incomprehensible to almost everyone. There will be plenty of opportunities to give them what they want while fooling voters.</p> <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s central mission, overseen by Dominic Cummings, is to break down all barriers between government and the power of money. It is to allow private interests to intrude into the very heart of government, while marginalising the civil service. This helps to explain why Johnson is so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/26/dominic-cummings-debacle-exposed-weakness-dependency-boris-johnson\">reluctant to let Cummings go</a>.

Now, almost all of it \u2013 and almost all residential care \u2013 is provided by private companies. Even before the pandemic, the system was falling apart, as many care companies, unable to balance the needs of their patients with the demands of their shareholders, collapsed, often with disastrous consequences. Now we discover just how dangerous their commercial imperatives have become, as the drive to make care profitable has created a fragmented, incoherent system, answerable sometimes to offshore owners, that fails to meet basic standards, and employs harassed workers on zero-hour contracts. If there is one thing we have learnt from this pandemic, it\u2019s the need for a publicly owned, publicly run National Care Service \u2013 the care equivalent of the NHS. It could all become much worse, due to another effect of corporate power. A report by the Corporate Europe Observatory shows how law firms are exploring the possibility of suing governments for the measures they have taken to stop the pandemic. Many trade treaties contain a provision called \u201cinvestor state dispute settlement\u201d. This enables corporations to sue governments in opaque offshore tribunals, for any policies that might affect their \u201cfuture anticipated profits\u201d. So when governments, in response to coronavirus, have imposed travel restrictions, or requisitioned hotels, or instructed companies to produce medical equipment or limit the price of drugs, the companies could sue them for the loss of the money they might otherwise have made. When the UK government commandeers private hospitals or the Spanish government prevents evictions by landlords, and stops water and electricity companies from cutting off destitute customers, they could be open to international legal challenge. These measures, which override democracy, have already hampered attempts by many governments, particularly of poorer nations, to protect their people from disasters. They urgently need to be rescinded. The effectiveness of our health system is also threatened by the trade treaty the UK government hopes to sign with the US. The Conservatives promised in their manifesto that \u201cthe NHS is not on the table\u201d in the trade talks. But they have already broken their accompanying promise, \u201cwe will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards\u201d. Earlier this month, they voted that measure out of the agriculture bill. US companies are aggressively demanding access to the NHS. The talks will be extremely complex and incomprehensible to almost everyone. There will be plenty of opportunities to give them what they want while fooling voters. Boris Johnson\u2019s central mission, overseen by Dominic Cummings, is to break down all barriers between government and the power of money. It is to allow private interests to intrude into the very heart of government, while marginalising the civil service. This helps to explain why Johnson is so reluctant to let Cummings go. The disasters of the past few weeks hint at the likely results. \u2022 George Monbiot is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Police in Japan have arrested the man suspected of carrying out an arson attack last year that killed 36 people, after officers waited 10 months for him to be treated for serious burns. Shinji Aoba was arrested on murder and arson charges over the attack on the Kyoto Animation studio in western Japan, which sparked an outpouring of grief from anime fans around the world. Police had been forced to wait until Aoba had recovered from serious burns sustained in the attack, as well as restrictions caused by the coronavirus outbreak, until they could arrest him. On Wednesday, TV footage showed the suspect strapped to a stretcher as he was carried into a police station. Aoba, 42, is accused of entering Kyoto Animation\u2019s main studio via an unlocked front door on the morning of 18 July armed with two containers thought to have contained petrol. He allegedly doused the entrance with the liquid before setting it on fire with a lighter. About 70 people were inside the studio at the time. It is Japan\u2019s deadliest blaze since 2001, when a fire in Tokyo\u2019s Kabukicho entertainment district killed 44 people. Some employees managed to flee the studio, but others attempting to escape to the roof of the three-storey building found their exit delayed by a door that survivors said had been difficult to open. Many of the dead \u2013 22 women and 14 men mostly in their 20s and 30s \u2013 died from carbon monoxide poisoning. Thirty-three people were injured. Aoba, who reportedly told police he had targeted the studio because it had plagiarised his work, sustained severe burns on his face, torso, and arms and legs, and was unconscious for weeks. He is reportedly unable to walk or eat without assistance. Kyoto Animation said it expected Aoba to be prosecuted \u201cto the maximum extent\u201d under the law. It said in a statement: \u201cWe have no further words for the suspect ... Our fallen colleagues will never return, and our wounds will never heal.\u201d The studio, known by its fans as KyoAni, is well known outside Japan for its role in producing popular TV anime series, including The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, K-ON! and Violet Evergarden. The fire shocked anime fans around the world, and prompted tributes from the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook, who tweeted: \u201cKyoto Animation is home to some of the world\u2019s most talented animators and dreamers \u2013 the devastating attack today is a tragedy felt far beyond Japan. \u201cKyoAni artists spread joy all over the world and across generations with their masterpieces.\u201d",

A<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/junior-minister-resigns-over-dominic-cummings-lockdown-trip-douglas-ross\"> junior minister has resigned</a> and more than 30 other Conservative MPs have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/public-anger-swells-ranks-tory-mps-turning-on-dominic-cummings\">called for Cummings to go</a>, many citing anger among their constituents. A further eight Tory MPs have been publicly critical of the senior aide\u2019s actions and three said privately that he should be forced out. Johnson will be questioned about the Cummings scandal by the Commons liaison committee today.</p> \n<p>Cummings is facing questions about his claim in his press conference on Monday to have written last year about the \u201cpossible threat of coronaviruses\u201d after it emerged that a blogpost published in March 2019 was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/dominic-cummings-faces-questions-over-claim-he-warned-last-year-of-virus-threat\">rewritten last month to insert a reference to \u201cSars coronavirus\u201d</a>.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Americas new centre of pandemic \u2013 WHO Hello, Warren Murray here with you, let\u2019s wade into Wednesday. Boris Johnson faces a growing Tory revolt over his refusal to sack his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, for breaching lockdown rules. A junior minister has resigned and more than 30 other Conservative MPs have called for Cummings to go, many citing anger among their constituents. A further eight Tory MPs have been publicly critical of the senior aide\u2019s actions and three said privately that he should be forced out. Johnson will be questioned about the Cummings scandal by the Commons liaison committee today. Cummings is facing questions about his claim in his press conference on Monday to have written last year about the \u201cpossible threat of coronaviruses\u201d after it emerged that a blogpost published in March 2019 was rewritten last month to insert a reference to \u201cSars coronavirus\u201d. Police have also opened an investigation into where he went, when and how many times around Durham and Barnard Castle. Regional outbreaks of coronavirus in England after rules are eased will be tackled with \u201clocal lockdowns\u201d, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said. The ability to tighten restrictions in individual regions, he said, would be part of the NHS test, track and trace system, which is due to expand on 1 June. The Americas have emerged as the new centre of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said, as a US study forecast deaths surging in Brazil and other Latin American countries through August. The Americas have registered more than 2.4 million cases of the new coronavirus and more than 143,000 deaths from the resulting Covid-19 respiratory disease. Latin America has passed Europe and the United States in daily infections. Global deaths from coronavirus surpassed 350,000 on Wednesday with more than 5.58 million cases. Stay up to date at our global coronavirus live blog and here is a fresh at-a-glance summary. There\u2019s more in our Coronavirus Extra section further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to factchecks and advice. * * * Trump tweet branded fake news \u2013 Twitter has for the first time taken action against falsehoods tweeted by Donald Trump, labelling them with an exclamation mark and linking through to a comprehensive, factual takedown of his claims about mail-in voting. Twitter previously refused to censor the president\u2019s many violations of its policies and changed its rules to exempt tweets by \u201cworld leaders\u201d. Trump has swiftly rounded on his favourite soapbox, accusing its owners of trying to influence the US elections and political bias. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; Labour\u2019s ruling body has chosen David Evans as general secretary to replace Jennie Formby, a Corbyn loyalist who stepped down after Keir Starmer was elected leader. Evans, Starmer\u2019s preferred choice, defeated a union candidate, Byron Taylor. &gt; A serial rapist known as the \u201cbeast of Kavos\u201d has broken his back after Greek police chased him over a cliff. Dimitris Aspiotis, 47, was previously jailed for sexually assaulting six British women but freed because of prison overcrowding. Corfu police were pursuing him for another rape. &gt; A newborn boy delivered by emergency caesarean section at a Norwich hospital is the first in the world to undergo a trial of a cannabis-derived medicine that may protect babies who are at risk of seizures and brain injury. &gt; There have been protests in Minneapolis after a black man, George Floyd, was killed when a policeman knelt on his neck during an arrest. In New York a woman has been fired from her job after video showed her making a fraudulent call to police that a black man was harassing her. He was out birdwatching in Central Park and had asked her to leash her dog in accordance with signage. &gt; Improving the water supply in developing nations could help reduce the hundreds of billions of plastic water bottles produced each year, experts have said. People in many countries use bottled water because their piped supply is of dubious quality. * * * Hong Kong unrest \u2013 Thousands of armed police have flooded the streets of downtown Hong Kong today in an unprecedented show of force to prevent planned protests against a controversial law being debated by the territory\u2019s legislature that would criminalise ridicule of China\u2019s national anthem. It comes amid growing anger at the expected imposition by Beijing of \u201cnational security\u201d laws to prevent challenge to the Communist party\u2019s authority in Hong Kong. Coronavirus Extra For our science podcast, Sarah Boseley talks to Prof Susan Lanham-New about vitamin D and whether it could play a role in protecting us against Covid-19. In Japan, Yamaha has launched an app that lets sport fans cheer for their teams remotely, aiming to boost the atmosphere in empty stadiums. In Australia, surgical masks have washed up on the beaches of Sydney after containers fell off a cargo ship into the sea. Today in Focus podcast: Are we headed for no-deal Brexit? For the past few months UK and EU negotiators have been locked in talks trying to thrash out a trade deal before 1 January. But after the chief negotiators, Michel Barnier and David Frost, exchanged testy letters last week, the talks risk reaching a stalemate. Is the UK headed for a no-deal Brexit? Lunchtime read: The notch of US territory stuck in Canada The Angle is a wedge of Minnesota marooned in a lake and only accessible by road from Canada. It exists because the 1783 Treaty of Paris that ended the American Revolution was negotiated around an inaccurate map. The area wasn\u2019t actually surveyed by white settlers until more than 100 years later, and the telephone only arrived in 1991. To get there by road you have to drive through Manitoba and Canada. Peter Fox makes the journey to one of the strangest places on earth. Sport The controversial \u00a3300m Saudi Arabia-funded takeover of Newcastle United appears to be in serious doubt after the World Trade Organization ruled that the country is behind a pirate satellite TV and streaming service that offers illegal access to sporting events, the Guardian can reveal. The Rugby Football Union has refused to rule out funding cuts for top-flight women\u2019s clubs after it was announced that Tyrrells will be ending its sponsorship of the Premier 15s league in August. Joshua Kimmich\u2019s sublime chip gave Bayern Munich a 1-0 win at second-placed Borussia Dortmund in Der Klassiker as the Bundesliga leaders put one hand on the title. Expectations continue to grow over the prospective return of the Premier League before the first of two key meetings this week. The clubs are to meet via video conference this morning having taken soundings from players and coaching staff, who were briefed on a return to contact training by the league in a pair of short meetings on Tuesday. Business Investment in global energy will fall by $400bn (\u00a3324bn) this year, the biggest slump in the industry\u2019s history, as the Covid-19 pandemic fuels a collapse in energy demand. The International Energy Agency says the decline is \u201cstaggering in both its scale and swiftness\u201d and while it will affect every major sector, from fossil fuels to wind and solar power, it could undermine the transition to renewables just when the sector needs a rapid increase in investment. Asian markets have been mixed, with Shanghai down, along with Hong Kong, which is being roiled by protests over civic freedoms. The pound is worth $1.231 and \u20ac1.124 while at this point the FTSE is forecast to open 0.4% higher. The papers The Sun enthuses \u201cFriends and families reunited\u201d, saying ministers hope to let households mingle from next month. The Mail has \u201cHousing estates will face new local lockdowns\u201d \u2013 our version of which is here. The front of the Express alights on the story of remdesivir trials for selected Covid-19 patients, and quotes Matt Hancock hailing it as the \u201cbiggest step forward since the crisis began\u201d. The Metro, though, gets at what the government is up to: \u201cHancock\u2019s half hour\u201d, it says, going on to say: \u201cThe attempt to save embattled adviser Dominic Cummings descended into farce as Matt Hancock promised a review of fines for parents breaking lockdown \u2013 only to be immediately slapped down by No 10\u201d. Others still have their eye on the ball too: \u201cRising Tory revolt over PM\u2019s refusal to ditch Cummings\u201d, says the Guardian. \u201cFarce and furious\u201d \u2013 the Mirror scoffs at Michael Gove who said he also sometimes uses the public roads to test his eyesight (bound to reassure the pedestrians of Surrey Heath). \u201cPublic backlash over support for Cummings\u201d says the i, reporting that the PM\u2019s approval rating has plummeted. \u201cPM suffers poll slump as Cummings revolt grows\u201d and \u201cTories revolt as voters turn on Cummings\u201d \u2013 the Times and the Telegraph, respectively, can\u2019t credibly turn the page on this story either. The FT has a warning from the European Central Bank: \u201cSoaring public debt poised to heap pressure on eurozone\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Clearing of bushland in the small New South Wales south coast town of Manyana will be halted temporarily after a community environment group trying to save the unburnt habitat began legal action in the federal court. Ozy Homes has a development consent for the 20 hectares that dates back to 2008. But the area is now the only significant piece of unburnt bushland for kilometres after it was saved by volunteer firefighters during the summer bushfire disaster. The Manyana Matters Environmental Association has now launched a legal challenge to try to protect the area and is seeking an injunction from the court to stop any clearing. Ozy Homes agreed on Wednesday to temporarily stop works until the matter returns to court again in June. The company has also agreed to allow ecological experts for Manyana Matters to access the area and conduct surveys for threatened species including the greater glider, which is listed as vulnerable under national environmental law. The company will be permitted to complete fencing work around the site\u2019s perimeter. \u201cThis is only the first step for us in assisting our clients to protect the greater glider and this now critical piece of land,\u201d said David Morris, the chief executive of the Environmental Defenders Office. The Manyana case has attracted high-profile support from the actor Claudia Karvan, who filmed a video calling for the NSW government to protect the bushland as a wildlife refuge for threatened species. The Manyana Matters group says the site is habitat for the greater glider and the swift parrot and wants the state government to buy back the land and turn it into a nature reserve. It is unclear whether greater gliders are now using the site. The project has never been assessed under Australia\u2019s national environmental law, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, but has a state development consent. At the time of the initial proposal in 2008, the greater glider was not listed as a threatened species under the EPBC Act. The species was formally listed as vulnerable in 2016. It is now one of the federal government\u2019s priority species requiring urgent assessment after fires destroyed parts of its habitat in Victoria and NSW. The EDO will argue that the planned development is now a breach of federal environmental law. The legal firm will seek a declaration that the clearing is likely to have a significant impact on the greater glider and should not be permitted to proceed unless it assessed and approved at a federal level. The Manyana development is just one project that highlights the problems that can arise for species when environmental catastrophes occur in the period between a development being granted approval and works commencing. In many instances this timeframe can be several years and a species status can change owing to mounting pressures from drought, heatwaves and fires, or as a result of threats such as clearing for other projects. \u201cIt is clear that a paradigm shift is needed to protect Australia\u2019s incredible wildlife, which suffered so tremendously last summer,\u201d Morris said. \u201cUnfortunately, through no fault of their own, the developer of this site now owns a piece of land that may be critical to the survival of the greater glider.\u201d Since the fire disaster the planned Shenhua Watermark coalmine and logging in NSW and Victoria \u2013 which is exempt from federal environmental laws \u2013 have also been identified as development that will push species under pressure closer to extinction unless governments decide to step in. Morris said the coronavirus pandemic had affected the ability to conduct thorough assessments of the full impact of the fires. \u201cThe proper approach\u201d would be to pause development of sites that might now hold increased importance to the survival of species, he said.

The bad news is current emissions trends (which lie between the RCP 4.5 and RCP 6 pathways) could take the planet to 2C warmer than pre-industrial levels by mid-century, which will increase storm damage, heatwaves, sea-level rise and the already great risk that the Arctic will be ice-free in summer.</p> <p>The climate trends are based on multiple-year averages rather than year-on-year comparisons, which are more subject to natural variation.</p> <p>Even the current best-case scenario \u2013 RCP 2.6, which is roughly in line with the Paris agreement \u2013 would leave the world hotter than today.</p> <p>\u201cWhat stands out is that even in the lowest current scenario, we get warming. We\u2019ll need to prepare and adapt,\u201d says Jason Lowe, the head of climate services at Hadley.

I think of the generations to come. I have a nine-year-old daughter. I find myself wondering which of these pathways we will be on when she is 80 or 90.\u201d</p> <p>More extreme results are possible at both ends of the spectrum. The next set of climate assessments will introduce a more ambitious best-case scenario (RCP 1.9) that would mean a faster transition to zero-carbon energy and a greater chance of holding temperature rises below 1.5C. But the situation could worsen rapidly if the climate hits tipping points, such as the collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet.</p> <p>\u201cThere are still dangers out there that we don\u2019t fully understand,\u201d said Stott. \u201cMuch of the uncertainty lies on the bad side. It could be terrifying. Can we grow enough crops to feed the population? Can we cope if some places are battered by storm after storm?\u201d</p> <p>Such concerns explain why the anniversary cannot be entirely triumphant. Despite growing evidence of climate risks, governments have been slow to act. Apart from downward blips such as the 2008 financial crisis and the coronavirus lockdown, emissions have steadily increased. The Hadley Centre\u2019s work now is not only about predicting impacts, but preparing for them.</p> <p>\u201cReality has proven that what we were saying 20 to 30 years ago was right. As scientists, that is vindication. But on a personal level, I hoped we would track a different emissions trajectory from where we are now,\u201d Stott said.</p> <p>\u201cThe worry is that we are now taking risks globally that we don\u2019t fully understand ... there will be no winners of climate change if we continue. Scientific evidence has been around for a while. It is time it was taken seriously.\u201d</p> <h2><em>Data source notes</em></h2> <p><em>Observed September Arctic sea ice extent from HadISST.2.2.0.0 (selected as single source from <a href=\"https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/monitoring/dashboard.html\">Met Office climate dashboard</a>.)

He predicts extreme summer heatwaves, such as those seen in 2018, will become the norm rather than an exception. \u201cAs a scientist, I want to narrow the uncertainty so the information is as good as possible so we can plan. I think of the generations to come. I have a nine-year-old daughter. I find myself wondering which of these pathways we will be on when she is 80 or 90.\u201d More extreme results are possible at both ends of the spectrum. The next set of climate assessments will introduce a more ambitious best-case scenario (RCP 1.9) that would mean a faster transition to zero-carbon energy and a greater chance of holding temperature rises below 1.5C. But the situation could worsen rapidly if the climate hits tipping points, such as the collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet. \u201cThere are still dangers out there that we don\u2019t fully understand,\u201d said Stott. \u201cMuch of the uncertainty lies on the bad side. It could be terrifying. Can we grow enough crops to feed the population? Can we cope if some places are battered by storm after storm?\u201d Such concerns explain why the anniversary cannot be entirely triumphant. Despite growing evidence of climate risks, governments have been slow to act. Apart from downward blips such as the 2008 financial crisis and the coronavirus lockdown, emissions have steadily increased. The Hadley Centre\u2019s work now is not only about predicting impacts, but preparing for them. \u201cReality has proven that what we were saying 20 to 30 years ago was right. As scientists, that is vindication. But on a personal level, I hoped we would track a different emissions trajectory from where we are now,\u201d Stott said. \u201cThe worry is that we are now taking risks globally that we don\u2019t fully understand ... there will be no winners of climate change if we continue. Scientific evidence has been around for a while. It is time it was taken seriously.\u201d Data source notes Observed September Arctic sea ice extent from HadISST.2.2.0.0 (selected as single source from Met Office climate dashboard.)

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson faced an extraordinary and growing revolt from within his own party on Tuesday over his refusal to sack his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, for breaching lockdown rules. On a day of dramatic developments, a junior minister resigned and more than 30 other Conservative MPs called for Cummings to go, many citing inboxes overflowing with hundreds of angry messages from constituents. A further eight Tory MPs were publicly critical of the senior aide\u2019s actions, and three said privately that he should be forced out. Downing Street had hoped Monday\u2019s lengthy statement from Cummings in the rose garden of No 10 would convince the public he had acted as any concerned father would in driving 260 miles to his parents\u2019 property in Durham when his wife was experiencing potential coronavirus symptoms. But in a snap YouGov poll, 71% of respondents said they thought Cummings had broken the rules, and 59% that he should resign \u2013 up seven percentage points from three days earlier. Forty-six per cent of Tory voters and 52% of leave voters said he should quit. A separate YouGov survey for the Times suggested the Conservative lead over Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour party has been cut by nine points in a week: the sharpest fall for a decade. The poll put the Tories on 44% and Labour on 38%. As the number of excess deaths registered in the UK during the Covid-19 outbreak reached nearly 60,000, and an international comparison confirmed the country has one of the world\u2019s highest rates of coronavirus deaths per capita, the Downing Street press briefing was dominated by questions about Cummings for a fourth consecutive day. It follows an investigation by the Guardian and Daily Mirror revealing Cummings\u2019 previously secret trips to and around north-east England in late March and early April. Douglas Ross, the MP for Moray who stepped down as a Scotland Office minister, said that although he accepted Cummings had acted with his family\u2019s best interests at heart, \u201cMr Cummings\u2019 interpretation of the government advice was not shared by the vast majority of people who have done as the government asked\u201d. He added: \u201cI have constituents who didn\u2019t get to say goodbye to loved ones; families who could not mourn together; people who didn\u2019t visit sick relatives because they followed the guidance of the government. I cannot in good faith tell them they were all wrong and one senior adviser to the government was right.\u201d Cummings insisted a caveat about parents looking after young children legitimised his decision to drive to Durham, saying: \u201cThe guidance says you don\u2019t have to just sit there.\u201d The prime minister has staunchly defended his most senior aide, whose advice was critical in sweeping the Conservatives to an 80-seat majority, with the \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d slogan, at December\u2019s general election. Significant revolts are rare at such an early stage after a thumping election victory, but Cummings was already a divisive figure and his refusal to apologise for an apparent breach of the rules appears to have touched a nerve with the lockdown-weary public. Calls for him to go came from across the spectrum of the Conservative party on Tuesday. They included the former chief whip Mark Harper, who said there was \u201cno credible justification\u201d for the drive to local beauty spot Barnard Castle, apparently to test whether Cummings\u2019 eyesight was good enough to make the drive back to the capital. The former health secretary Jeremy Hunt released the text of a reply to a constituent, in which he said of Cummings: \u201cWhat he did was a clear breach of the lockdown rules\u201d \u2013 though Hunt did not call for him to resign, saying: \u201cYou do make mistakes in these situations.\u201d Four more former ministers \u2013 Steve Baker, Harriett Baldwin, Stephen Hammond and Jackie Doyle-Price \u2013 all called for Cummings to go. The veteran Brexiter Peter Bone said he had not been reassured by Monday\u2019s statement. \u201cThe rose garden interview just confirmed to me that he had driven up to Durham when we were in a strict lockdown. He absolutely should resign,\u201d he said. \u201cI have 400 emails from people and I\u2019m sitting here with my colleague going through every one, and we\u2019d rather be doing some case work but we just have so many people to reply to.\u201d Johnson loyalists continued to defend the embattled adviser on Tuesday, however. Cummings\u2019 longtime political friend and former boss Michael Gove gave a series of supportive interviews, insisting the Barnard Castle side trip was wise. \u201cI think he was wise to make sure he was comfortable before driving back down to London on the A1, an inevitably busier road,\u201d he told Sky News. Gove also said: \u201cIt is the case it was part of the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council\u2019s guidance that you could drive at that time to take exercise as well.\u201d However, the rules on exercise were only relaxed after Cummings was back in London. Later, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who is the minister responsible for the lockdown regulations, repeated his own defence of Cummings, insisting: \u201cMy view is that what he did was within the guidelines.\u201d Asked why he himself had stayed put when he and his wife were ill with the virus, Hancock told the Downing Street press briefing bluntly: \u201cWe had childcare readily available at home, and Mr Cummings didn\u2019t.\u201d But Hancock was blindsided by a question from a vicar in Brighton about whether members of the public who had been fined for travelling during the lockdown could have them reviewed if they were travelling for childcare reasons. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good question and we do understand the impact and the need for making sure that children get adequate childcare, that is one of the significant concerns that we have had all the way through this,\u201d he said. He then said he would speak to colleagues at the Treasury about the issue. Government sources later insisted he had not intended to promise a review, and it would be looked into by the Home Office. Downing Street has not yet announced a replacement for Ross \u2013 and could struggle to find another supportive Scottish Tory MP. The party\u2019s leader in Scotland, Jackson Carlaw, who is an MSP, told the BBC on Tuesday that the Cummings \u201cfurore\u201d was a distraction, and if he were Cummings, he would \u201cbe considering my position\u201d. During his briefing on Monday, Cummings insisted he had not considered resigning and did not regret his various journeys \u2013 though he did concede that perhaps he should have discussed his whereabouts with the prime minister at an earlier stage. He said Johnson found out a few days later, but nothing was made public. Labour sought to pile the pressure on Johnson, with the shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, writing to her Conservative opposite number, Rishi Sunak, to ask if the government has modelled the risks of declining compliance with the lockdown rules. Without mentioning Cummings by name, she said she was \u201cdeeply concerned that the last 48 hours have presented a confused picture\u201d about whether those experiencing symptoms should self-isolate.",

The bike and car parts retailer said the reopenings follow successful tests at its Peterborough and Bristol Cribbs Causeway stores. It will be the first time Halfords customers will be allowed in store since the UK lockdown started on 23 March. Among the sites reopening are Gloucester, Huddersfield, Inverness and North Shields.

You know all of this because they made a point of sharing all of it in detail.</p> <p>Lockdown hit them hard to begin with, but now they can be found uploading screenshot after screenshot of their virtual social engagements, whether it\u2019s a Zoom party or trendy book club. \ufeff</p>",

The certainty expert What they say: \u201cDon\u2019t be an idiot \u2013 have you not read the footnotes on the latest footnotes on the latest Harvard study?\u201d Certainty experts talk about coronavirus with great authority, using complex terms such as \u201ccurves\u201d, \u201cmodels\u201d, \u201cR\u201d, and \u201cwell, actually \u2026\u201d . They\u2019ve even looked up how to pronounce epidemiologist, and take all opportunities to use it. They\u2019ll be the first to tell you that there are too many amateur epidemiologists giving their opinions, before telling you when exactly the country is going to reopen, according to their analysis of what various epidemiologists have said. The one with a totally amazing life you need to know about What they say: \u201cIt\u2019s so weird how I always manage to have the most fun, even in quarantine!\u201d There\u2019s a very specific type of person whose entire existence rests on giving you fomo (the fear of missing out) and gaining clout. Before the pandemic they were always at press parties, on weekend trips or with their best friend who happens to be a model, activist and podcaster with 100,000 followers on Instagram. You know all of this because they made a point of sharing all of it in detail. Lockdown hit them hard to begin with, but now they can be found uploading screenshot after screenshot of their virtual social engagements, whether it\u2019s a Zoom party or trendy book club. \ufeff",

      "body": "<p>Thirty-five years ago, when I was working as a newly qualified doctor, I extracted a sausage from a woman\u2019s windpipe. She was, in the eyes of the ambulance crew who brought her in, probably beyond saving, possibly already dead. The woman had inhaled the sausage while laughing at a joke she\u2019d been telling her family. I leant over her, used a laryngoscope to peer into her larynx, saw the sausage and extracted it. She took a big gasp, looked around in surprise, and after a short recovery, walked out of A&amp;E. I felt a surge of pride. I was a proper doctor. I\u2019d saved someone\u2019s life. My mum understood what I did for a living.</p> <p>After working as a clinician for many years, I became a public health researcher and worked on tuberculosis and emerging infectious diseases for about 25 years. I never got, with the same immediacy, the sense one gets from saving a life. But I suspect that through my research I\u2019ve touched far more lives than I could ever have hoped to in clinical medicine \u2013 even if those lives remain anonymous, distant, opaque. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/05/poorest-hit-hardest-by-cuts-to-public-health-spending-research\">public health</a>, the stakes of life and death are more distant \u2013 but no less impactful.</p> <p>Take, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/18/how-disgraced-anti-vaxxer-andrew-wakefield-was-embraced-by-trumps-america\">Andrew Wakefield</a>, whose <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452\">fraudulent 1998 study</a> falsely claimed a relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism. Though Wakefield was never charged with any criminal offence, his study led vaccination rates around the world and herd immunity to fall. Wakefield\u2019s actions fractured trust in public health functions and institutions. His misconduct resulted in an incalculable number of deaths. Herein lies the difference between medicine and public health. One is proximal, the other distant. One is felt with raw emotion, the other has a slow and less measurable burn.</p> <p>In the frenzied debate around Dominic Cummings, many of us have focused on the hypocrisy of his actions and of Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to keep him in post. And this hypocrisy is undoubtedly present. But hypocrisy is common in politics. There is something much more important happening here. Cummings\u2019 actions have led to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/26/dominic-cummings-lockdown-rules-coronavirus\">loss of trust</a>.</p> <p>Public health is about trust, a largely unwritten contract between all of us and the state. We need to trust that we each have our own <em>and</em> others\u2019 interests at heart, that we share a sense of solidarity and will all do our best to protect the most vulnerable among us. We need to know that the state shares in this. Rules and regulations are insufficient to police this commitment. We need trust. Without trust, the state has few remaining tools at its disposal. It may, when struggling, draw on its coercive powers. After the Wakefield campaign, when measles outbreaks began to occur, discussion of mandating vaccination was seriously considered. In New York City, in the 1990s, because the state didn\u2019t believe people would take their treatment for tuberculosis, patients were locked up on an island. The history of coercion and public health is long and ignominious.</p> <p>The esteemed medical historians Dorothy and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/mar/05/guardianobituaries.obituaries\">Roy Porter</a> once wrote that \u201cthe subtle art of the administratively possible\u201d was at the heart of enforcing public health policies that compromise individual freedoms. Where this \u201cart\u201d falls short, the state may attempt to compel people through other means. Provisions are almost always made when new public health threats emerge. Coronavirus is no different. New regulations from March enabled the police to compel people to stay at home and avoid nonessential travel. The home secretary, Priti Patel, explained, \u201cThe prime minister has been clear on what we need to do: stay at home to protect our NHS and save lives \u2026 That\u2019s why I\u2019m giving the police these new enforcement powers, to protect the public and keep people safe.\u201d The challenge is, as always, enforcement. The police are asked to apply common sense and discretion. When discretion seems unfair and the weight of the state bears down more heavily on some of us than others, trust is eroded. And blame begins to rise.</p> <p>When the burden of inconvenient and often distressing measures, such as staying at home, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/25/my-dad-died-lockdown-barnard-castle-dominic-cummingss-visit-repellent-county-durham-betrayed\">not visiting elderly or dying loved ones</a> or attending the burial of family members, falls on some shoulders but not all, trust begins to fray. And, in the epidemiological parlance of the day, the reproduction number of an infection, R, begins to rise. An epidemic climbs higher and faster as observance of the rules disintegrates.</p> <p>Back in the 1990s I wrote a book, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/From_Chaos_to_Coercion.html?id=ixyrcOPYchUC&amp;redir_esc=y\">From Chaos to Coercion</a>, reflecting on the challenges that arise in public health and infectious diseases when we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/26/lying-government-coronavirus-crisis-dominic-cummings\">no longer trust</a> each other or our institutions to do the right thing. In particular, I explored the outbreak of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in New York City. What I found most striking was that the structural causes of the terrible epidemic received little attention, and the response drew on assessments of the potential behaviour of people rather than an objective assessment of the direct threat they posed. (The city\u2019s laws were changed to incarcerate those who were assessed as potentially posing a threat in the future.)</p> <p>And the institutions whose principle purpose was to care for the most vulnerable, in this case often homeless people and those with Aids, were failing completely in their task. The image of the affluent Connecticut commuter feeling threatened by a contagious disease carried by a homeless man resonated through the epidemic. Fear replaced any dormant sense of solidarity. And fear was associated inextricably with blaming individuals and institutions. Just as night follows day, blame and fear follow the loss of trust.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/26/dominic-cummings-coronavirus-scientific-boris-johnson-adviser-game-theory\">How has Cummings harmed the fight against coronavirus? Here's the scientific answer | Rowland Kao</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I worry that a surge of infections and deaths will result from the public\u2019s loss of trust in social distancing measures. And when this happens, I fear the government will slip down the slope and resort to more coercive measures.

      "bodyText": "Thirty-five years ago, when I was working as a newly qualified doctor, I extracted a sausage from a woman\u2019s windpipe. She was, in the eyes of the ambulance crew who brought her in, probably beyond saving, possibly already dead. The woman had inhaled the sausage while laughing at a joke she\u2019d been telling her family. I leant over her, used a laryngoscope to peer into her larynx, saw the sausage and extracted it. She took a big gasp, looked around in surprise, and after a short recovery, walked out of A&amp;E. I felt a surge of pride. I was a proper doctor. I\u2019d saved someone\u2019s life. My mum understood what I did for a living. After working as a clinician for many years, I became a public health researcher and worked on tuberculosis and emerging infectious diseases for about 25 years. I never got, with the same immediacy, the sense one gets from saving a life. But I suspect that through my research I\u2019ve touched far more lives than I could ever have hoped to in clinical medicine \u2013 even if those lives remain anonymous, distant, opaque. In public health, the stakes of life and death are more distant \u2013 but no less impactful. Take, for example, Andrew Wakefield, whose fraudulent 1998 study falsely claimed a relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism. Though Wakefield was never charged with any criminal offence, his study led vaccination rates around the world and herd immunity to fall. Wakefield\u2019s actions fractured trust in public health functions and institutions. His misconduct resulted in an incalculable number of deaths. Herein lies the difference between medicine and public health. One is proximal, the other distant. One is felt with raw emotion, the other has a slow and less measurable burn. In the frenzied debate around Dominic Cummings, many of us have focused on the hypocrisy of his actions and of Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to keep him in post. And this hypocrisy is undoubtedly present. But hypocrisy is common in politics. There is something much more important happening here. Cummings\u2019 actions have led to a loss of trust. Public health is about trust, a largely unwritten contract between all of us and the state. We need to trust that we each have our own and others\u2019 interests at heart, that we share a sense of solidarity and will all do our best to protect the most vulnerable among us. We need to know that the state shares in this. Rules and regulations are insufficient to police this commitment. We need trust. Without trust, the state has few remaining tools at its disposal. It may, when struggling, draw on its coercive powers. After the Wakefield campaign, when measles outbreaks began to occur, discussion of mandating vaccination was seriously considered. In New York City, in the 1990s, because the state didn\u2019t believe people would take their treatment for tuberculosis, patients were locked up on an island. The history of coercion and public health is long and ignominious. The esteemed medical historians Dorothy and Roy Porter once wrote that \u201cthe subtle art of the administratively possible\u201d was at the heart of enforcing public health policies that compromise individual freedoms. Where this \u201cart\u201d falls short, the state may attempt to compel people through other means. Provisions are almost always made when new public health threats emerge. Coronavirus is no different. New regulations from March enabled the police to compel people to stay at home and avoid nonessential travel. The home secretary, Priti Patel, explained, \u201cThe prime minister has been clear on what we need to do: stay at home to protect our NHS and save lives \u2026 That\u2019s why I\u2019m giving the police these new enforcement powers, to protect the public and keep people safe.\u201d The challenge is, as always, enforcement. The police are asked to apply common sense and discretion. When discretion seems unfair and the weight of the state bears down more heavily on some of us than others, trust is eroded. And blame begins to rise. When the burden of inconvenient and often distressing measures, such as staying at home, not visiting elderly or dying loved ones or attending the burial of family members, falls on some shoulders but not all, trust begins to fray. And, in the epidemiological parlance of the day, the reproduction number of an infection, R, begins to rise. An epidemic climbs higher and faster as observance of the rules disintegrates. Back in the 1990s I wrote a book, From Chaos to Coercion, reflecting on the challenges that arise in public health and infectious diseases when we no longer trust each other or our institutions to do the right thing. In particular, I explored the outbreak of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in New York City. What I found most striking was that the structural causes of the terrible epidemic received little attention, and the response drew on assessments of the potential behaviour of people rather than an objective assessment of the direct threat they posed. (The city\u2019s laws were changed to incarcerate those who were assessed as potentially posing a threat in the future.) And the institutions whose principle purpose was to care for the most vulnerable, in this case often homeless people and those with Aids, were failing completely in their task. The image of the affluent Connecticut commuter feeling threatened by a contagious disease carried by a homeless man resonated through the epidemic. Fear replaced any dormant sense of solidarity. And fear was associated inextricably with blaming individuals and institutions. Just as night follows day, blame and fear follow the loss of trust. I worry that a surge of infections and deaths will result from the public\u2019s loss of trust in social distancing measures. And when this happens, I fear the government will slip down the slope and resort to more coercive measures. As our collective commitment to social distancing and quarantining measures wavers, we risk entering a vicious circle. Cases of Covid-19 climb, we become ever more aware of others failing to follow public health guidelines, the epidemic rages faster and chaos ensues. Epidemics are not linear. In an attempt to halt a second wave, the government would likely resort to stricter police powers and a wider imposition of existing laws. But this would be futile. Older and more vulnerable people \u2013 those dependent on our sense of solidarity \u2013 would by then have been sacrificed. The effects of Dominic Cummings\u2019 and Boris Johnson\u2019s actions will, to my mind, be the same as those of Wakefield. The consequences of their malign influence on trust and public health will persist for years. And the cost in human lives will likely be incalculable. \u2022 Richard Coker is emeritus professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine",

      "body": "<p>On a hot July evening in Charleston, South Carolina, almost 2,000 baseball fans made their way to Joseph P Riley Jr Park, a pleasant if somewhat clumsily-named ball park on a bend in the Ashley river. Their local minor league team, the RiverDogs, were playing against the Columbus RedStixx. But on a beautiful night for baseball in 2002, the stadium gates were padlocked.</p> <p>Not that the fans had expected any different. This was \u201cNobody Night\u201d, a bid to set an unbeatable world record for baseball\u2019s lowest attendance. Fans happily reconvened at a nearby tailgate party, stocked with discounted beer and snacks. Some brought deckchairs and peered through gaps in the gates. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity to have truly terrible seats,\u201d one local told the Associated Press.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/26/michael-jordan-isiah-thomas-dream-team-olympics-last-dance-nba\">New tape contradicts Michael Jordan's Dream Team claims in The Last Dance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fans did get to see some action from a better angle later on. At the bottom of the fifth inning, the official attendance was recorded (zero) and the gates thrown open.

      "bodyText": "On a hot July evening in Charleston, South Carolina, almost 2,000 baseball fans made their way to Joseph P Riley Jr Park, a pleasant if somewhat clumsily-named ball park on a bend in the Ashley river. Their local minor league team, the RiverDogs, were playing against the Columbus RedStixx. But on a beautiful night for baseball in 2002, the stadium gates were padlocked. Not that the fans had expected any different. This was \u201cNobody Night\u201d, a bid to set an unbeatable world record for baseball\u2019s lowest attendance. Fans happily reconvened at a nearby tailgate party, stocked with discounted beer and snacks. Some brought deckchairs and peered through gaps in the gates. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity to have truly terrible seats,\u201d one local told the Associated Press. Fans did get to see some action from a better angle later on. At the bottom of the fifth inning, the official attendance was recorded (zero) and the gates thrown open. Refreshed patrons reclined on \u201cShoeless Joe Hill\u201d, a grass bank overlooking the field, while kids searched for foul balls in the bleachers. Columbus won 4-2, with all six runs scored while the stadium was empty. One baseball fan from Illinois, who had hoped to catch a game while on vacation, was not impressed. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a real good idea. I thought it was kind of silly,\u201d he said.

For some households, the lockdown has led to a huge drop in income and little prospect of more money coming in any time soon.</p> <p>Others have been more fortunate and are still earning their salary, but are unable to spend it on the things they would normally buy. One report by investment firm Peel Hunt suggested there could be \u00a380bn of \u201cenforced savings\u201d in people\u2019s accounts by the end of the year.</p> <p>But even if you are in the fortunate position of having earned as normal through the crisis, you probably have one eye on the future.

Don\u2019t.</p> <p>Sarah Coles, personal finance expert at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, says you may be tempted \u201cto hope for the best and borrow your way through the crisis until things sort themselves out,\u201d but this is unwise. \u201cIf you try to plough on with your usual spending, you are going to end up with far too much month [left] at the end of the money,\u201d she says. \u201cSo you need to make a note of everything you have coming in at the moment, and everything you are spending.\u201d</p> <p>You may use an online bank, which provides this kind of breakdown for you, or you may need to do this with a pen and paper. Pull together details of all your income and outgoings, and work out how much you can cover from what is coming in, and if there are any gaps. Some of the spending you can no longer cover may be discretionary \u2013 a \u00a39.99 a month subscription to Spotify, for example, which you would miss, but can live without while you need the money. This type of outgoing is the first thing to cancel.</p> <p>You may also be able to reduce your spending on essentials. Some of the things you would do in normal times to save money are not an option now, such as visiting several shops to get the best price for food. But you can still make changes. \u201cWhen it takes an hour to queue for the supermarket, you\u2019re not in a position to visit several of them,\u201d says Coles. \u201cThe easiest way to cut costs is to trade down to a budget supermarket, or from brands to own brands and essential ranges.\u201d</p> <p>Think about how you can improve the income side of the equation. If there are things you have paid for and are not able to use \u2013 if, for example, you had a holiday booked or have a season ticket for travelling to work \u2013 ask for a refund.</p> <p>Jasmine Birtles, founder of <a href=\"https://www.moneymagpie.com/\">MoneyMagpie</a>, says that if you are at home it could be a good time to \u201cgo through things that you don\u2019t need and sell them on \u2013 eBay and Gumtree are your friend\u201d.</p> <p>It may be possible to fill some of the gaps between your income and outgoings with help.

      "bodyText": "The coronavirus crisis has had a massive impact on people\u2019s finances. For some households, the lockdown has led to a huge drop in income and little prospect of more money coming in any time soon. Others have been more fortunate and are still earning their salary, but are unable to spend it on the things they would normally buy. One report by investment firm Peel Hunt suggested there could be \u00a380bn of \u201cenforced savings\u201d in people\u2019s accounts by the end of the year. But even if you are in the fortunate position of having earned as normal through the crisis, you probably have one eye on the future. With the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, suggesting the UK is going to see a \u201csevere recession, the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen\u201d, it would be unwise not to plan for a possible drop in income in future. Don\u2019t avoid looking at your bank balance If you have had a wage cut it is unlikely you have thought of much other than your financial position, but you may have avoided looking at the numbers. Don\u2019t. Sarah Coles, personal finance expert at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, says you may be tempted \u201cto hope for the best and borrow your way through the crisis until things sort themselves out,\u201d but this is unwise. \u201cIf you try to plough on with your usual spending, you are going to end up with far too much month [left] at the end of the money,\u201d she says. \u201cSo you need to make a note of everything you have coming in at the moment, and everything you are spending.\u201d You may use an online bank, which provides this kind of breakdown for you, or you may need to do this with a pen and paper. Pull together details of all your income and outgoings, and work out how much you can cover from what is coming in, and if there are any gaps. Some of the spending you can no longer cover may be discretionary \u2013 a \u00a39.99 a month subscription to Spotify, for example, which you would miss, but can live without while you need the money. This type of outgoing is the first thing to cancel. You may also be able to reduce your spending on essentials. Some of the things you would do in normal times to save money are not an option now, such as visiting several shops to get the best price for food. But you can still make changes. \u201cWhen it takes an hour to queue for the supermarket, you\u2019re not in a position to visit several of them,\u201d says Coles. \u201cThe easiest way to cut costs is to trade down to a budget supermarket, or from brands to own brands and essential ranges.\u201d Think about how you can improve the income side of the equation. If there are things you have paid for and are not able to use \u2013 if, for example, you had a holiday booked or have a season ticket for travelling to work \u2013 ask for a refund. Jasmine Birtles, founder of MoneyMagpie, says that if you are at home it could be a good time to \u201cgo through things that you don\u2019t need and sell them on \u2013 eBay and Gumtree are your friend\u201d. It may be possible to fill some of the gaps between your income and outgoings with help. You could be entitled to benefits that you have not previously claimed \u2013 the website Entitledto.co.uk is a good place to go for advice and has a calculator to help you work out what you are, as it says on the tin, entitled to. However daunting it might seem, doing a proper audit of what you have and what you are spending will help. As well as highlighting possible savings, it could also reveal mistakes or fraud, which you can sort out. And it could make you feel better \u2013 knowing exactly where you stand and what you need to tackle can be less stressful than just being aware that things are bad.

Banks, building societies and other lenders have been told they have to help, so this should be easier than in normal times.

      "body": "<p>In early April, frontline workers including a bus driver, a care home manager and a cemetery worker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/uk-coronavirus-frontline-key-workers-police-drivers-postal\">spoke to the Guardian</a> about their experiences during the coronavirus pandemic. Two weeks later we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/21/people-drinking-a-lot-frontline-workers-britain-coronavirus-lockdown\">checked in</a> to hear how they had been coping with the peak of the virus.</p> <p>Now, another month on, with lockdown restrictions easing, we catch up with the workers to see how things have changed.</p> <h2>The Childline supervisor, the Midlands</h2> <p>There\u2019s been a reduction in some of the hoax calls we get. Normally we get lots of groups of kids calling up because they\u2019re bored. Even if they\u2019re winding us up, we never get angry, because sometimes they\u2019re testing the service to see what our reaction would be if they later called up, seriously, with a problem.</p> <p>There\u2019s less of that since the lockdown, because the groups of kids aren\u2019t together. We\u2019re still getting sexualised calls, where people ring up and masturbate on the phone. I think they ring us because most of our call handlers are female.</p> <p>We got sent Easter eggs for every volunteer and member of staff as a gift from a luxury chocolate company. Another place sent us boxes of hand gel because we couldn\u2019t source it, and sent a lovely letter, which really gave a boost to the volunteers and reminded them they\u2019re being thought about.</p> <p>You can feel a bit left behind \u2013 you see rainbows and the Thursday round of applause, and that feels like it\u2019s for the NHS, but there are other [key workers] out there. We had one child say that when they clap, they would clap for us. That was overwhelming \u2013 it keeps you going. </p> <h2>The bus driver, south-east England</h2> <p>It seems like the lockdown has completely and utterly ended over the past couple of weeks. I passed a group of elderly ladies at the bus stop, all huddled together like they would have been a year ago. I mentioned it to them but they just chuckled \u2013 it went in one ear and out of the other.</p> <p>So far we\u2019ve managed to dodge a bullet because the number of people getting on buses is so low, but the bus company have said that from 1 June there\u2019ll be lots of overtime available, so it seems like they\u2019re planning to go back to normal service from then.</p> <p>That\u2019s also when many of the schools will start reopening, but I\u2019m worried about the implications of working on those buses doing school routes. Instead of six or seven passengers for a journey, there could be 60 or 70 schoolkids, and I do the trip from the housing estates to the schools three times each morning.</p> <p>I\u2019m now actively looking for another job. My partner is at high risk and we\u2019ve been doing everything we can \u2013 following all the protocol, taking shoes off at the door, even washing every bit of shopping that comes in with hot water and bleach. But if my exposure to potential carriers increases tenfold or more, we\u2019re really going to have to reappraise what I do.</p> <h2>The care home manager, Scotland</h2> <p>I\u2019m still living at the care home from Monday to Friday, but I\u2019m in the last free room and we might have someone moving in, so I might have to move. I think I\u2019m going to borrow my mum\u2019s camper van and park it at the home. I don\u2019t mind as long as I\u2019ve got somewhere to sleep. I just like to think I\u2019m here if there are any issues.</p> <p>We still don\u2019t have any cases in the home, and spirits are still really high.

      "bodyText": "In early April, frontline workers including a bus driver, a care home manager and a cemetery worker spoke to the Guardian about their experiences during the coronavirus pandemic. Two weeks later we checked in to hear how they had been coping with the peak of the virus. Now, another month on, with lockdown restrictions easing, we catch up with the workers to see how things have changed. The Childline supervisor, the Midlands There\u2019s been a reduction in some of the hoax calls we get. Normally we get lots of groups of kids calling up because they\u2019re bored. Even if they\u2019re winding us up, we never get angry, because sometimes they\u2019re testing the service to see what our reaction would be if they later called up, seriously, with a problem. There\u2019s less of that since the lockdown, because the groups of kids aren\u2019t together. We\u2019re still getting sexualised calls, where people ring up and masturbate on the phone. I think they ring us because most of our call handlers are female. We got sent Easter eggs for every volunteer and member of staff as a gift from a luxury chocolate company. Another place sent us boxes of hand gel because we couldn\u2019t source it, and sent a lovely letter, which really gave a boost to the volunteers and reminded them they\u2019re being thought about. You can feel a bit left behind \u2013 you see rainbows and the Thursday round of applause, and that feels like it\u2019s for the NHS, but there are other [key workers] out there. We had one child say that when they clap, they would clap for us. That was overwhelming \u2013 it keeps you going. The bus driver, south-east England It seems like the lockdown has completely and utterly ended over the past couple of weeks. I passed a group of elderly ladies at the bus stop, all huddled together like they would have been a year ago. I mentioned it to them but they just chuckled \u2013 it went in one ear and out of the other. So far we\u2019ve managed to dodge a bullet because the number of people getting on buses is so low, but the bus company have said that from 1 June there\u2019ll be lots of overtime available, so it seems like they\u2019re planning to go back to normal service from then. That\u2019s also when many of the schools will start reopening, but I\u2019m worried about the implications of working on those buses doing school routes. Instead of six or seven passengers for a journey, there could be 60 or 70 schoolkids, and I do the trip from the housing estates to the schools three times each morning. I\u2019m now actively looking for another job. My partner is at high risk and we\u2019ve been doing everything we can \u2013 following all the protocol, taking shoes off at the door, even washing every bit of shopping that comes in with hot water and bleach. But if my exposure to potential carriers increases tenfold or more, we\u2019re really going to have to reappraise what I do. The care home manager, Scotland I\u2019m still living at the care home from Monday to Friday, but I\u2019m in the last free room and we might have someone moving in, so I might have to move. I think I\u2019m going to borrow my mum\u2019s camper van and park it at the home. I don\u2019t mind as long as I\u2019ve got somewhere to sleep. I just like to think I\u2019m here if there are any issues. We still don\u2019t have any cases in the home, and spirits are still really high. Everybody\u2019s exhausted, but the atmosphere of the home is keeping us going. We\u2019re fine for PPE; I don\u2019t really know how our stocks are so good. I just keep over-ordering through my suppliers, and some weeks they don\u2019t have enough, but we take what we can get. I feel sorry for other homes where things aren\u2019t going so well. It\u2019s terrifying when you hear of homes with lots of deaths. I think the problem is that a lot of them are too regimented. There\u2019s a mindset that you have to treat your staff like rubbish to get good work. For me, \u201cstrict protocol\u201d reads like they don\u2019t trust staff, with bosses hanging over your shoulder pointing at everything you\u2019re doing. Now I have my own home, we encourage staff to come to us with ideas. Our protocols are strict but staff know what they\u2019re doing. The supermarket worker, Cumbria About three weeks ago everything went haywire; people seemed to get fed up of confinement. We saw a huge increase in trade, and that\u2019s gone further through the roof since Boris Johnson relaxed restrictions. Customers are coming in to buy just one fruit scone, or browsing and not buying anything at all. At the moment, 24 bottles at a time is the average for buying booze. We\u2019ve added 20ft of extra space for alcohol, with plans for further extension, but we just can\u2019t get the stock back in for it.

      "body": "<p>The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, has been forced to acknowledge that his state\u2019s health department was notified of sick crew members on board a live export vessel before it docked in Fremantle, but remains critical of the federal Department of Agriculture for not \u201cbacking up\u201d such a significant message with \u201cat least a phone call\u201d.</p> \n<p>The admission came after the federal agriculture minister, David Littleproud, defended the actions of his department in response to McGowan\u2019s claim on Tuesday that he discovered sick crew were on the ship Al-Kuwait that day only by word of mouth from dock workers. Littleproud released an email showing a department worker had notified WA Health on Friday about three sick crew members.</p> \n<p>After six crew tested positive on Tuesday, it emerged on Wednesday the email had been sent to a generic address within the WA Health department, also copying in an incorrect email address for a specific WA Health worker.</p> \n<p>As a result of the delays caused by crew quarantines, the original $12m shipment of about 56,000 sheep destined for Kuwait will likely miss the 1 June deadline introduced to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/14/australias-ban-on-live-sheep-trade-could-be-extended-due-to-heat-stress-risk\">limit transport of live animals to the Middle East</a> during the northern summer.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/26/wa-premier-fears-more-covid-19-infections-after-six-test-positive-on-live-export-ship-in-fremantle\">Western Australian premier fears more Covid-19 cases after six test positive on live export ship in Fremantle</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Also on Wednesday a staff member at a Melbourne hotel hosting quarantined travellers was among Victoria\u2019s eight latest coronavirus cases.</p> \n<p>The Victorian health department revealed the Rydges on Swanston worker had been diagnosed with Covid-19, with the cause of the infection under investigation and the hotel shut to the public.

      "bodyText": "The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, has been forced to acknowledge that his state\u2019s health department was notified of sick crew members on board a live export vessel before it docked in Fremantle, but remains critical of the federal Department of Agriculture for not \u201cbacking up\u201d such a significant message with \u201cat least a phone call\u201d. The admission came after the federal agriculture minister, David Littleproud, defended the actions of his department in response to McGowan\u2019s claim on Tuesday that he discovered sick crew were on the ship Al-Kuwait that day only by word of mouth from dock workers. Littleproud released an email showing a department worker had notified WA Health on Friday about three sick crew members. After six crew tested positive on Tuesday, it emerged on Wednesday the email had been sent to a generic address within the WA Health department, also copying in an incorrect email address for a specific WA Health worker. As a result of the delays caused by crew quarantines, the original $12m shipment of about 56,000 sheep destined for Kuwait will likely miss the 1 June deadline introduced to limit transport of live animals to the Middle East during the northern summer. Also on Wednesday a staff member at a Melbourne hotel hosting quarantined travellers was among Victoria\u2019s eight latest coronavirus cases. The Victorian health department revealed the Rydges on Swanston worker had been diagnosed with Covid-19, with the cause of the infection under investigation and the hotel shut to the public. Two of the other fresh cases have been detected in staff at Lynden Aged Care home in Camberwell, bringing the total cases at the facility to three. With authorities scrambling to find a replacement crew for the Al-Kuwait, McGowan has said he would support an exemption to the summer export deadline being granted by the federal Department of Agriculture. As the sheep have undergone a biosecurity clearance, they are unable to be returned to local farms. Scott Morrison moved to pre-empt any wider opposition to the live export industry, urging people not to get \u201ctoo far ahead of themselves on this\u201d, and arguing halting live exports would \u201churt our economy drastically\u201d. At a press conference on Wednesday, McGowan, while calling for clearer communication between federal and state authorities in relation to port arrivals, said the initial email revealed by Littleproud had been noted by a WA Health employee. \u201cThe email did not raise red flags ... in these times it plainly should have,\u201d McGowan said in a statement. \u201cWe have to be more vigilant. We must do better and we will.\u201d The federal Labor MP Madeleine King, whose electorate takes in the suburb of Baldivis, where the sheep are being held temporarily, criticised the Australian Border Force for a lack of involvement in the Al-Kuwait docking. \u201cIt looks to me from the documents I\u2019ve seen that the only department that didn\u2019t go on board the ship at some point is Australia\u2019s border force. So what are they doing? Their job is in the name, right. Where are they? They are absent,\u201d she said. In March, the ABF commissioner, Michael Outram, said that his officers had no duty in law to deal with biosecurity matters, but \u201csince this Ruby Princess case happened, I\u2019ve asked all my officers in every case, board every ship and ask the master: has anyone on this vessel got or had flu-like symptoms? In plain English.\u201d An ABF spokeswoman declined to respond when asked if ABF officers boarded the Al-Kuwait, deferring questions to WA Health. On 20 May, the Al-Kuwait sent a pre-arrival report to the federal Department of Agriculture alerting that three crew had high temperatures. Two days later, it sent another email informing the department that the three still had high temperatures, with one reporting pain when swallowing.

Here\u2019s a quick rundown on everything that happened today:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>A 30-year-old Queensland man died of Covid-19, the youngest person to die of the virus in Australia. The state\u2019s premier, <strong>Annastacia Palaszczuk</strong>, said the coroner would investigate the death. The man had been displaying Covid-19 symptoms in the week leading up to his death, but had many other health complications. Australia\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, <strong>Paul Kelly</strong>, said the case \u201cshows that there is community transmission of some sort\u201d.</li> \n   <li>The New South Wales premier, <strong>Gladys Berejiklian</strong>, announced a 12-month wage freeze for public servants in line with decisions made in other jurisdictions. She said the freeze was \u201cabout saving livelihoods, saving jobs and saving lives\u201d. </li> \n   <li>The Western Australia premier, <strong>Mark McGowan</strong>, called for better state-federal communication after six Covid-19 cases were confirmed among the crew of a ship which docked at Fremantle. McGowan admitted there were \u201cerrors made all around\u201d.</li> \n   <li>Cedar Meats, the Melbourne abattoir at the centre of a Covid-19 cluster, will restart operations, including processing, on Thursday. About 300 staff are expected to return to work.</li> \n   <li>During an interview on the ABC, the prime minister, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>, refused to guarantee workers would be better off as a result of the so-called Accord 2.0, saying that was what he \u201cwanted\u201d to see.</li> \n   <li>After a two-year investigation, the AFP announced it will not lay charges against the News Corp journalist <strong>Annika Smethurst</strong>.</li> \n   <li>The Victorian premier, <strong>Daniel Andrews</strong>, said people would continue working from home \u201cfor all of June\u201d after the state recorded eight new cases of Covid-19.<br></li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T09:54:36.449Z\">at 10.54am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ece2cbc8f08498203f3cc4b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T09:03:35.947Z\">10.03am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Western Australian premier, <strong>Mark McGowan</strong>, with his daily Covid-19 dashboard.

There are only 2,400 eastern bristlebirds in the wild and about 140 in the Howes Flat population near Mallacoota.</p> \n  <p>They caught the birds, described by the ecologist <strong>Dr Rohan Clarke

speaker would be set up to play the eastern bristlebird\u2019s call and then, when it sounded as if the real birds had approached the speaker, the sound would be remotely switched to a second speaker,

<strong>Josh Taylor</strong> at the bushfire Senate committee hearing ...</p> \n  <p>The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet faced questions at the Senate committee hearing on the 2019-20 bushfires over whether the prime minister, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>, had been adequately briefed about the bushfires during the fire season last year.<br></p> \n  <p>PM&amp;C hadn\u2019t provided verbal or written briefings to him while he was in Hawaii from 15 to 21 December (he cut his trip short by two days), but that doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility that PMO was updating the PM on the situation.</p> \n  <p>The department secretary, <strong>Phil Gaetjens</strong>,<strong> </strong>told the committee that the PM was in Australia when the fires in Victoria, NSW and South Australia flared up in late November, and back when the state of emergency declarations were made in four states on 30 December, so it was incorrect to say he was absent during the crisis.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a correct interpretation to say that the prime minister was not here in the crisis,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Gaetjens himself was on leave for half of December, he told the committee.</p> \n  <p>The department confirmed that before Morrison left on holidays in Hawaii he was \u201cvery well informed\u201d about the bushfire situation via a series of teleconference meetings with the head of Emergency Management Australia and others in November.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt seems to me that what you were telling us is that he would have had considerable knowledge about how extreme the crisis was and what was unfolding, yet he still decided to go off on holidays,\u201d the Greens senator <strong>Janet Rice</strong> replied.</p> \n </div> \n <p

They are absent. </p> \n   <p>I take the minister\u2019s point and I\u2019ve heard his interviews on various platforms, and when he said the agriculture department aren\u2019t medical doctors. Sure, I get that, no one expects them to be. But ministers and departments can talk to one another and talk to one another a bit better than what was, on the face of it, a pretty breezy email to a generic email account.</p> \n   <p>How you can send an email to a generic email address four hours before a ship is meant to dock in Fremantle, a large population centre, and expect it all to quickly happen over here in four hours. I mean that\u2019s a bit unbelievable as well. Again, I just don\u2019t know where Australia\u2019s border force is in all of this ...

I mean, by and large, the states and territories have worked incredibly well through the National Cabinet process. I mean, we have countries of just equal sophistication to ours, developed economies, good health systems, and they have had death rates a hundred times and more what Australia has had. So let\u2019s not just brush aside that. That has been the product of people working together, and particularly states and territories working together with the federal government. Now, on this issue of internal borders, that is not something national cabinet ever agreed was something that was required. <br></p> \n   <p>That is something that individual states have done off their own back. Now, I\u2019m optimistic that will get sorted out, and I think that it is in the interest of jobs for it to be sorted out.

The need to fund more domestic places so young people, and the thousands of other Australians whose jobs have disappeared, have tertiary education as a viable option. Past recessions have shown that, as unemployment rates soar, those who cannot earn enrol to learn.<br></p> \n  <p>2. The proposed \u201csafe corridors\u201d to bring international students into Australia needs to be implemented as soon as is safely possible so there is at least some chance of international students getting to Australia and clearing quarantine for the second part of this year. Failure to do this swiftly will add to the devastation of our international education, which contributed $40 billion to our economy each year before COVID-19.<br></p> \n  <p>3. International students, who are already in Australia, should be supported and encouraged to remain here. Community groups, state and local governments and have stepped up to support those who have been hard hit by job losses and exclusion from JobSeeker and JobKeeper. They do however need practical, ongoing help, coordinated at the national level that shows how we value them for their contributions to the Australian economy.</p> \n  <p>4. Cuts of up to 21000 jobs are underway as universities yet the Federal Government has ensured that universities \u2013 unlike other large businesses and some private universities \u2013 are ineligible for the JobKeeper subsidy. This does not make sense.</p> \n  <p>5. Researchers urgently need government assistance to ensure that they can continue and not waste work already done. Many research projects have already been suspended.</p> \n  <p>International researchers, who are very important to the sector, may not return to Australia to finish their work. Much of the $4.7 billion that universities put into research each year has been funded by revenue from international education. That revenue has now evaporated from a sector that is likely to take years to recover.<br></p> \n  <p>6. There is a need to re-start infrastructure projects that have been suspended as universities try to stop their financial haemorrhaging. The Victorian Government has allocated $350 million, which will greatly assist universities with capital projects in that state, but what about the rest of the nation?<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T23:25:08.432Z\">at 12.25am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecda35e8f0852d72995058d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T23:19:50.747Z\">12.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Hundreds of masks and plastic containers have washed up on Sydney\u2019s eastern beaches overnight.

Now we want to focus on what is happening in the workplace itself and how we could make those businesses work better so they can create more jobs and people can have greater certainty of employment in their conditions.\u201d</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T23:03:36.638Z\">at 12.03am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecd99de8f087412dad110dd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T22:38:55.703Z\">11.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>I know that this new IR process is being described as the \u2018Accords 2.0\u2019 but let\u2019s remember this latest round of reform talks has a September deadline.</p> \n  <p>The original accords began in 1983 and continued until <strong>John Howard</strong> called time on them in 1996.</p> \n  <p>So not exactly the same then.</p> \n  <p>Plus, the OG accord was about restricting wage demands, in exchange for things like Medicare.</p> \n  <p>We don\u2019t have the same set of playing cards.<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecd98888f0852d729950558\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T22:31:23.450Z\">11.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">PM can't guarantee no worker won't be worse off under proposed IR reforms</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Perhaps the highlight of <strong>Scott Morrison\u2019s</strong> round of interviews was the exchange with the ABC AM\u2019s <strong>Sabra Lane </strong> about whether he would guarantee workers would be no worse off after this IR process.<br>He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>We\u2019re getting workers and employers together, their representatives, we\u2019re getting them together in a room to work out how to get their enterprises and workers in a stronger position \u2026</em></p> \n   <p><em>This is a process that will flow through \u2013 we\u2019re getting people together to agree, to work together, so we\u2019re looking to people agreeing to what goes forward \u2026 <strong>This is a process that wants to see workers better off, this is a process that wants to see employers better off, businesses better off.

Here\u2019s a quick rundown on everything that happened today: A 30-year-old Queensland man died of Covid-19, the youngest person to die of the virus in Australia. The state\u2019s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the coroner would investigate the death. The man had been displaying Covid-19 symptoms in the week leading up to his death, but had many other health complications. Australia\u2019s deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, said the case \u201cshows that there is community transmission of some sort\u201d. The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, announced a 12-month wage freeze for public servants in line with decisions made in other jurisdictions. She said the freeze was \u201cabout saving livelihoods, saving jobs and saving lives\u201d. The Western Australia premier, Mark McGowan, called for better state-federal communication after six Covid-19 cases were confirmed among the crew of a ship which docked at Fremantle. McGowan admitted there were \u201cerrors made all around\u201d. Cedar Meats, the Melbourne abattoir at the centre of a Covid-19 cluster, will restart operations, including processing, on Thursday. About 300 staff are expected to return to work. During an interview on the ABC, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, refused to guarantee workers would be better off as a result of the so-called Accord 2.0, saying that was what he \u201cwanted\u201d to see. After a two-year investigation, the AFP announced it will not lay charges against the News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said people would continue working from home \u201cfor all of June\u201d after the state recorded eight new cases of Covid-19. The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, with his daily Covid-19 dashboard. There are currently 12 active cases of the virus in WA. Good evening and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live blog after dark (it is not called that. Sorry. That is not a thing). A little earlier the South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, defended a decision by health officials in the state to allow a British woman into South Australia to visit a dying relative after she later contracted Covid-19. The woman was one of 22 people given exemptions to travel into the state in the past two months, despite its border closure. Marshall said on Wednesday that she had quarantined after arriving in Australia, and had tested negative while in isolation. She then travelled from Victoria to SA, but returned a positive swab soon after flying into Adelaide on the weekend and has now been returned to quarantine. Marshall defended the decision to allow her into the state, saying authorities have \u201cgot to have a heart\u201d. Chief Public Health Officer Nicola Spurrier said the woman was among 22 people from overseas given exemptions to come to SA on compassionate grounds. About half of those were to attend funerals and the rest to visit a close dying relative. Spurrier said in any situation there was some risk, and her team would now review its processes. \u201cI think this is very consistent with what we\u2019ve done over the past two and a half months,\u201d she said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a problem (until now), though we\u2019ve now found we have a case. Thanks for your company and correspondence this afternoon, I\u2019m handing you over to the estimable Michael McGowan. You\u2019re in good hands, make sure you wash yours. The bushfire royal commission this afternoon heard of two missions to endangered species from bushfires \u2013 the Wollemi pines in NSW and the \u201cbrown and drab\u201d and \u201cquite secretive\u201d eastern bristlebird in far eastern Victoria, near Mallacoota. The Guardian has previously reported on the mission to save the critically endangered (and secret) Wollemi pine population in the Blue Mountains from the Gospers Mountain megafire this summer. The NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service director, David Crust, said the operation \u2013 which involved winching people in to hand operate an irrigation system around the ancient trees and two days of water-bombing along the cliffs edge \u2013 prevented the fire from getting into the canopy of the mature pines, although some juvenile pines appear to have been lost. \u201cIf the canopy had burned the results would have been catastrophic,\u201d he said. Crust said it would take five years to see the full impact of the fire on the mortality rates of the pines. In Victoria, the royal commission heard, a team of 11 scientists and zoologists from Melbourne Zoo flew in to Mallacoota in January to catch an insurance population of 15 endangered eastern bristlebirds, whose only population in Victoria is just on the other side of Lake Barracoota. There are only 2,400 eastern bristlebirds in the wild and about 140 in the Howes Flat population near Mallacoota. They caught the birds, described by the ecologist Dr Rohan Clarke as ground-dwelling weak flyers that were \u201crelatively cryptic\u201d animals with a \u201cloud and distinctive metallic call\u201d using mist nets and bluetooth speakers. One speaker would be set up to play the eastern bristlebird\u2019s call and then, when it sounded as if the real birds had approached the speaker, the sound would be remotely switched to a second speaker, which would draw the birds into the path of the fine cotton net. The fire stopped on the edge of the Howes Flat habitat, but another bristlebird population a short distance away, crossing the border with NSW, appears to have been destroyed. An Australian trial of two experimental drugs to treat Covid-19 is under review after the World Health Organization halted all its trials involving hydroxychloroquine due to concerns about its efficacy and safety. A final epistle from Josh Taylor at the bushfire Senate committee hearing ... The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet faced questions at the Senate committee hearing on the 2019-20 bushfires over whether the prime minister, Scott Morrison, had been adequately briefed about the bushfires during the fire season last year. PM&amp;C hadn\u2019t provided verbal or written briefings to him while he was in Hawaii from 15 to 21 December (he cut his trip short by two days), but that doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility that PMO was updating the PM on the situation. The department secretary, Phil Gaetjens, told the committee that the PM was in Australia when the fires in Victoria, NSW and South Australia flared up in late November, and back when the state of emergency declarations were made in four states on 30 December, so it was incorrect to say he was absent during the crisis. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a correct interpretation to say that the prime minister was not here in the crisis,\u201d he said. Gaetjens himself was on leave for half of December, he told the committee. The department confirmed that before Morrison left on holidays in Hawaii he was \u201cvery well informed\u201d about the bushfire situation via a series of teleconference meetings with the head of Emergency Management Australia and others in November. \u201cIt seems to me that what you were telling us is that he would have had considerable knowledge about how extreme the crisis was and what was unfolding, yet he still decided to go off on holidays,\u201d the Greens senator Janet Rice replied. And if you haven\u2019t seen this already, you should really check out the 750kg kookaburra sculpture created by a Townsville man during lockdown. Dr Farvardin Daliri, an academic and artist, unveiled the huge bird this week on the streets of Brisbane, and will soon take it north to the Townsville cultural festival. While we can only endorse the creative and community-minded use of time in lockdown, the laugh does sound slightly maniacal. Nev Power, the chairman of the government\u2019s coronavirus commission is to be questioned by a Senate committee next Wednesday. The National Covid-19 Coordination Commission is tasked with looking into options to recover from the coronavirus-induced economic meltdown and has so far said gas is the way to go. It\u2019ll be a chance for senators to ask Power, a former chief executive of mining company Fortescue Metals, about his conflict as interest as the deputy chairman of WA gas field developer Strike Energy. As Guardian Australia reported on Saturday, Power has \u201cstepped back\u201d from his Strike role and won\u2019t be attending board meetings. The manufacturing taskforce advising the commission has been particularly enthusiastic about gas, proposing in a secret report revealed by Guardian Australia that the government underwrite a massive expansion of the domestic gas industry, including by helping open new fields and building hundreds of kilometres of pipelines. The plan for a \u2018trans-Tasman bubble\u2019 to allow Australians and New Zealanders to travel between the two countries could be presented to both governments as early as next week, and could be operational by September, the expert working group behind the proposal has said. Cedar Meats, the Melbourne abattoir at the centre of a Covid-19 cluster, will restart operations, including processing, on Thursday. About 300 staff are expected to return to work. Staff who have been medically cleared to start work attended a return to work information session at Cedar Meats\u2019 Brooklyn site today. \u201cOur aim is to provide a safe and healthy environment as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. The control measures will be regularly updated to reflect changes resulting from government announcements, directions of the Victorian chief health officer and best practices for the sector,\u201d the general manager, Tony Kairouz, said. Cedar Meats was at the centre of Victoria\u2019s largest Covid-19 cluster, with more than 100 cases traced to it. From the Senate committee on the bushfires (and my indefatigable colleague Josh Taylor). The federal government yesterday claimed around $1bn of the $2bn bushfire recovery fund had been spent so far. But the Labor senator Murray Watt said only around $529m of that money had actually been spent by the government, with another $471m that had been spent by the states and territories and was in the process of being reimbursed by the federal government. Watt also raised questions about whether the money had been spent by the agencies in the community, in terms of clearing debris or on mental health counsellors or the other projects the funding was allocated for. The national bushfire recovery coordinator, Andrew Colvin, said the $1bn was either spent or in the process of being spent. \u201cThat is money that has already been dispensed or dispersed to the organisations that needed it,\u201d Colvin told the committee. From the commonwealth point of view, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet secretary, Phil Gaetjens, told the committee that once it was out of federal government hands it was deemed spent. \u201cI think if money is spent from the commonwealth, cash has gone out of the commonwealth system,\u201d he said. Paul Kelly on the \u2018six sick sailors on board the sheep ship\u2019 \u2013 those crew on board the Al-Kuwait which docked in Fremantle. The six sailors ... are not severely unwell, they are in hotel quarantine, safely for them, safely for the public of WA and the other sailors onboard are being monitored for their own health. Kelly has more information regarding the death of a 30-year-old Queensland man who tested positive for Covid-19 after his death. The man was found unresponsive yesterday afternoon at his home in the small western Queensland town of Blackwater, and could not be revived. He had been displaying Covid-19 symptoms in the week leading up to his death, but he had several other significant health complications. He had had \u201crespiratory illness\u201d for three weeks before his death, Kelly said. A post-mortem Covid-19 test returned positive. The man had not travelled overseas, or left Blackwater since February. He had spent most of the last few weeks at home. There had been no other recorded cases of Covid in Blackwater prior to the man\u2019s death. Kelly: This is a terrible tragedy and my condolences go to his wife and other family and friends. It is by far our youngest death so far from Covid-19 and it is a reminder firstly that this is a serious illness and whilst it does affect ... older people and people with chronic illness, it can affect anyone and it can affect people severely. Kelly said he could not comment in detail on the case, because it was now before a coroner, but that he was concerned by the fact there is no clear chain of transmission to the man\u2019s case of Covid-19. Yes, that in itself is a concern because it shows that there is community transmission of some sort. [It is] unusual that we haven\u2019t had many people in rural areas in any state and so at this point in the pandemic it is a concern. I understand that he had been sick for some weeks and I guess he hadn\u2019t assumed that it was Covid-19. Kelly has urged Australians to get their flu shots. There has been little influenza this year (aided by improved hygiene practices and social distancing measures), but the deputy chief health officer says vaccines will be vital to keep pressure off public health systems. There are 18m vaccines available in Australia this flu season (up from 13m last year). Already this year, 7.3m people have had a flu shot, up from 4.5m all of last year. Paul Kelly (the deputy chief health officer, not the singer-songwriter, nor the former Brownlow medallist) is on his feet in Canberra, providing an update. There have been 11 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Australia in the past 24 hours. There has been one more death, in Queensland, bringing the nation\u2019s death toll to 103. There remain fewer than 500 active cases in Australia, with 30 people in hospital, six of them in intensive care, and just three on ventilators. Kelly: We are continuing to do a lot of testing ... over 1.3 million tests in Australia since the beginning of this pandemic and 35,000 tests in the last 24 hours. The positivity rate remains extremely low and this is a good sign that we are picking up cases if they are indeed there. Apologies for the brief interruption in transmission there, dear reader. I had my head in another story. Standby for it. Ben Doherty here with you for the afternoon. A global update from my colleague Helen Sullivan. The news internationally continues to be grim: the total known deaths from Covid-19 around the world has passed 350,000. And with that, I will leave you in the very capable hands of Ben Doherty. He\u2019ll take you through Prof Paul Kelly\u2019s update \u2013 hopefully there will be a little more information on the Queensland case, where authorities are still trying to find out how an unwell man who had not left Blackwater in months contracted Covid-19 in a town which had no recorded cases. At 30, he became Australia\u2019s 103rd death, and the youngest the nation has recorded. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow \u2013 take care of you. WA Health authorities will go on board the ship to test the rest of the crew. Any crew member needing treatment will, of course, receive it. WA is also upping its allowable elective surgeries to 75% \u2013 but hospitals will contact patients to let them know if they are on the list. The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, is addressing the Al-Kuwait ship issue. He says he was not given the full picture of the situation yesterday and needs to address some matters: An email was sent from the federal Department of Agriculture to the public health emergency operations centre informing them of three ill crew members with elevated temperatures. It is important to note here that the same email said there were no concerns for Covid-19 on the ship. There was also no request for assistance at that time. That email had also been sent after the federal department had already granted approval for the ship to berth in Fremantle. I think this raises some issues that need to be addressed. This morning I contacted minister Littleproud to discuss the issue and the need to improve communications between all parties. There have clearly been some errors made all round. We can and must do better and we will. I am disappointed that the email from the federal department on Friday did not raise red flags inside the department of health. In these times, it plainly should have. I also think we need to have better and more comprehensive communications with the commonwealth than just an email. Any report of crew passengers on board ships or aircraft entering this state with Covid-like symptoms must be given the attention it deserves. We all know that the greatest risk to Western Australia at the moment is from people entering our state from overseas or from interstate. We have to be more vigilant. If there is a lesson to be learned here, it is this: we cannot let our guard down when it comes to this virus. I don\u2019t want our success in controlling the rate of infection to make anyone complacent across Western Australia. If anything, I hope this serves as a wake-up call to everyone. We are not out of this yet. Paul Karp has everything you need to know about the AFP decision regarding the (ridiculous) Annika Smethurst investigation. The AFP won\u2019t be apologising. It also has not concluded its investigation into two ABC journalists who were also raided after publishing an investigation in the public interest. The opposition trade spokeswoman and Perth MP Madeleine King has lashed the agriculture minister, David Littleproud, and the Australian Border Force over actions related to the Al Kuwait live-export ship docked in Fremantle which carried six workers that have tested positive to Covid-19. King was responding to comments from Littleproud defending the response of the Department of Agriculture. He released an email showing the department had sent an email to WA Health on Friday of sick crew members. However, King has accused the Department of Agriculture of sending the \u201cpretty breezy\u201d email to a \u201cgeneric\u201d email address of WA Health hours before the scheduled docking, and said the worker should have phoned the information to make sure it had been received. The WA state government claims to have only learned of the sick crew members by word of mouth days later. All crew remain on board the vessel at Fremantle, except for the six positive workers who were taken to a hotel for quarantine on Tuesday. King told The West Australian\u2019s online radio show: How the minister can sort of handball off responsibility, Mr Littleproud, just beggars belief. And it might not be his department\u2019s responsibility at the final call but it is border force\u2019s responsibility and it looks to me from the documents I\u2019ve seen that the only department that didn\u2019t go on board the ship at some point is Australia\u2019s border force. So what are they doing? Their job is in the name, right. Where are they? They are absent. I take the minister\u2019s point and I\u2019ve heard his interviews on various platforms, and when he said the agriculture department aren\u2019t medical doctors. Sure, I get that, no one expects them to be. But ministers and departments can talk to one another and talk to one another a bit better than what was, on the face of it, a pretty breezy email to a generic email account. How you can send an email to a generic email address four hours before a ship is meant to dock in Fremantle, a large population centre, and expect it all to quickly happen over here in four hours. I mean that\u2019s a bit unbelievable as well. Again, I just don\u2019t know where Australia\u2019s border force is in all of this ... There\u2019ll be a few allegations thrown around about who got an email and who didn\u2019t, but for God\u2019s sake can someone please pick up the phone and let someone know when they think there\u2019s a problem.\u201d The ABF released a brief statement on Wednesday, saying that the group \u201ccompleted all customs and immigration related clearances\u201d, and deferred further questions to the WA Health department. South Australia will be moving into its stage two of restrictions relaxation on 1 June, but the fitness industry, which had been hoping for a reopening, is not entirely happy. The 20 people, 1.5 metres apart limit means gym classes are restricted to 10 people, so for those who have a F45 gym or something similar, the relaxation isn\u2019t exactly a return to normal. To adhere to the limits, people will have to book in for training. Just a reminder that things are not \u2018returning to normal\u2019 even if some parts of normal life look like resuming. Things are not looking rosy for the Australian National University. It has published a series of questions and answers detailing the challenges it faces with a $100m shortfall: How long do we expect to be in this financial position? There are a number of factors that contribute to our financial position that are outside our control. These include international travel restrictions, government policy and funding, and demand for higher education around the world. These challenging financial circumstances are expected to last for at least the next two years. The impact on ANU was slightly cushioned by the progress we have made to achieve a truly diverse student cohort and we are continuing with that work. When will everything return to normal? We don\u2019t expect to ever return to business as usual pre-Covid, but the founding principles of ANU and our community spirit remain. We will continue to adapt, and we must be willing to be both innovative and measured in this uncertain time. Does this mean there will be job losses? Staffing is our biggest expense. As per the vice-chancellor\u2019s message, we will do everything we can to explore voluntary, rather than involuntary measures, and we are absolutely committed to ensuring ANU continues to deliver its mission and is prepared for the years ahead. The vice-chancellor, college deans and portfolio heads will need to make resourcing decisions that reflect the nature of our financial position and our ability to continue to deliver world-class research, education and evidence-based public policy outcomes. To ensure the university operates efficiently and effectively, it regularly reviews all its operations and colleges and portfolios will continue to do so as part of this process. While Australia is looking to reopen and legal cases are being threatened in a bid to force state borders to reopen, it is worth looking to South Korea, which was one of the nations pointed to, repeatedly, as handling the Covid crisis well. It has had its biggest spike in new cases \u2013 40 \u2013 in 49 days. Schools in the Republic of Korea go back today as well. It\u2019s a reminder that until there is a vaccine, we won\u2019t get a handle on this virus. AAP also has an update on measures to help Crown Resorts staff: The 11,500 workers stood down at Crown Resorts amid the coronavirus pandemic will have access to a hardship fund supported by their union. The gaming company on Wednesday said workers in financial hardship would be able to apply for discretionary funds from Friday. Crown Resorts cut 95% of its workforce after coronavirus restrictions were put in place across Australia. The United Workers Union\u2019s national secretary, Tim Kennedy, said these are the type of initiatives needed from big employers to support staff during this crisis. The hardship fund comes after Crown had already implemented other measures such as a two-week special payment and $1,000 for casuals. \u201cWe have deep gratitude to our employees for their understanding and commitment during this uncertain time,\u201d Crown\u2019s chief executive officer, Ken Barton, said. At one point in his evidence, Mullins was asked by the One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts to provide links to papers, not just SBS, ABC and the Guardian, proving an \u201cempirical\u201d link between climate change and the bushfires. Mullins asked whether he had to respond to Roberts\u2019 assertions, and said he had read Roberts\u2019 website and found it \u201cconcerning and muddled\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think there would be any purpose in me trying to convince you ... on the settled science and it is settled. I am at a loss to know how to deal with your assertion. It was not a question.\u201d He said he was retired and didn\u2019t have time to \u201cdeal with denialists who don\u2019t accept settled science\u201d. The former NSW fire chief Greg Mullins, who now is part of a group of former firies concerned about climate change, has appeared before the first hearing of the Senate committee examining Australia\u2019s bushfire season over the new year. Mullins recounted how he and other former emergency service chiefs were unable to get a meeting with the prime minister last year about concern about the pending fire season. He says the request they made included funding for aircraft, and better access to the Australian Defence Force to assist in fires (as eventually happened). Eventually he got a meeting with the disaster management minister, David Littleproud, and the emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor, in early December, but he said at that point it was too late. He said based on the prepared lines Littleproud and Scott Morrison put out after the event, it appeared little more than a \u201ctick the box\u201d meeting. He said it would have made a difference if he\u2019d been able to get a meeting well before December. \u201cI think it would have made a material difference had we been listened to earlier.\u201d Mullins also said he was prompted to speak out because when he was a fire chief, he said he was often spoken to by senior officials and politicians against speaking about climate change. He said the current fire chiefs are \u201cgagged\u201d by the view that public servants should not speak about politically contentious issues. \u201cI was spoken to by my minister at the time and some officials at the time, I was told it was not my job and just stick to fighting fires,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had a number of discussions and it\u2019s clear. It depends on what party is in power in which state and territory. \u201cGenerally they\u2019re told to steer away from policy issues that are contentious.\u201d Mullins said it was \u201crubbish\u201d to say that a reduction in hazard reduction was the fault of \u201cgreenies\u201d or national parks, because the window to do hazard reduction had been reduced in the past few years. In NSW in particular, hazard reduction was done by volunteers, who can usually only do weekends, meaning finding a suitable weekend was even harder. AAP has an update on the Victorian courts: Victorian courts are looking for a way to bring back jury trials, postponed because of coronavirus. Criminal trials in the supreme and county courts have been cancelled because of Covid-19, but work is under way to bring them back. \u201cThat planning includes making sure they can accommodate physical distancing requirements and have spaces in which jurors, in particular, feel safe and comfortable,\u201d a supreme court spokeswoman told AAP on Wednesday. The courts are consulting with lawyers about the arrangements. The state government has passed legislation allowing criminal trials to be heard by a judge alone, but that requires the agreement of judges, prosecutors and the accused. The supreme court justice Paul Coghlan flagged earlier this month that jury trials could resume as early as August. During a bail application for Biannca Edmunds, who is charged with murder and due to stand trial in early August, he admitted \u201cit won\u2019t be easy\u201d but said there\u2019s no reason it couldn\u2019t go ahead. He said juries could be used while maintaining social distancing, but noted that might not even be required by August. The county court has previously said September would be the earliest it would schedule trials to resume. The public sector union has demanded the Australian Taxation Office reconsider new plans to close one of its offices in Geelong. It is understood 121 people work at the site and it is likely there would be significant job losses if the closure goes ahead. Beth Vincent-Pietsch, the CPSU\u2019s deputy national secretary, said: \u201cThe CPSU is calling on the government to reconsider the closure of the Geelong ATO office. \u201cNow is not the time to be cutting jobs from anywhere, but regional centres in particular. The ATO needs all staff on deck to assist with the recovery from the economic impact of Covid-19.\u201d Staff were today told the ATO intends to close the site due to decreasing staff numbers over several years. The site lease is due to expire June 2021, although no closure date has been announced and the ATO maintains it has not formally decided to close the office. Staff have been told their positions will be considered on a case-by-case basis but there would be no ATO jobs available in Geelong. Employees could apply to move to another ATO office, or apply for a transfer to another APS position. But Vincent-Pietsch said the ATO should consider remote work opportunities if the closure was \u201cabout saving on lease arrangements\u201d. The ATO was approached for comment. Spare a thought for the partner of the 30-year-old man who was found to have Covid-19 after he had died \u2013 they have been placed into isolation at the Rockhampton hospital as they are showing symptoms of the virus as well \u2013 which means they cannot receive any physical comfort from their loved ones over their loss. Christian Porter says it is \u201ctoo early\u201d to say whether there are communication breakdowns between federal and state agencies after the Al Kuwait: I think it\u2019s a little bit too early to assess that. I think there are known protocols here. At the federal level, particularly inside the Department of Agriculture, we do not do medical assessments of crew. We have a responsibility when we become aware to notify state authorities there may be an issue in respect to the health of crew, that\u2019s what we did. There may have been some views put yesterday that didn\u2019t happen, but it did happen. The federal authorities notified their state counterparts, just as they should do, just as the process should work. I\u2019m not quite sure why it was the case a statement was made that it didn\u2019t happen because it did happen. Christian Porter is addressing the media now, including about the Al Kuwait: This carries the risk of becoming a massive problem: The bushfire royal commission is looking at the impact of fires on threatened species today. It heard that 377 of Australia\u2019s 1,800 nationally listed threatened species and ecological communities had an overlap of at least 10% of their range with areas affected by bushfire, and 49 species or communities lost more than 80% of their known range. Threatened species commissioner Dr Sally Box said the \u201centire range of some species was burned\u201d. To figure out the impact on threatened species, Box said, the federal environment department had to cobble together a national indicative aggregate fire extent dataset, using information that was either publicly available or made available by states and territories. Some of that data is known to be of \u201clow accuracy\u201d, she said, because different jurisdictions use different mapping methods. Box also said that advice to state governments on bushfire preparedness, like the impact that hazard reduction burning may have on a threatened species, comes from documents including recovery plans. You may recall that in 2018, Guardian Australia\u2019s environment reporter Lisa Cox revealed that less than 40% of nationally listed threatened species in Australia actually had a recovery plan in place, and many are out of date. Box said that while an expert panel had been established to examine the specific impact on threatened species of the 2019-2020 bushfire season: In terms of preparedness, I think that the main advice for species in terms of what are the threats and what are the activities that are required to manage those threats, that advice really sits in recovery plans and \u2026 formal documents.\u201d Earlier, the first assistant secretary for biodiversity and conservation in the federal environment department, Emma Campbell, said that threatened species recovery plans were a \u201ckey document\u201d for determining fire management, although she noted that \u201csome of them are relatively out of date\u201d. The AFP will be addressing media at 1.30pm \u2013 they\u2019ve advised it will be to \u201cdiscuss the finalisation of the investigation involving News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst\u201d and that \u201cno charges will be laid\u201d. However \u2013 the AFP have not yet confirmed whether this means ONLY that no charges will be laid against Smethurst; or whether they are ALSO ruling out charges against her suspected source of leaked material revealing plans to extend ASD\u2019s spying powers. The announcement also does not relate to the separate investigation into the ABC\u2019s reporting of the Afghan Files. There will be a national Covid update today (they are no longer daily) happening at 3.30pm with deputy chief medical officer, Professor Paul Kelly This really should never have reached anywhere near this stage It\u2019s the only acceptable decision - but press freedom in this country has taken more than a few hits and really needs addressing. As Calla Wahlquist continues to cover the busfire commission The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences has released its Stocktake of Fire in Australia\u2019s forests, 2011 to 2016. (So it doesn\u2019t include the 2019/20 climate fires) Principal forest scientist Dr Steve Read said fires were getting more intense, and more frequent: The fire regime, that is, the frequency, intensity, seasonality and spatial pattern of fire, determines both the short-term and the long-term impacts of fire on forests. There is a distinct north-south divide in the fire regime experienced by Australia\u2019s forests. Unplanned fires in forest in northern Australia are more frequent and occur over greater areas. Planned fire in northern Australia is also extensive, and generally of lower intensity and earlier in the dry season than unplanned fire. Unplanned fires in forests in southern Australia are less frequent than in northern Australia, but can be much more intense when they occur, and in some years (such as 2019\u201320) cover large areas. Planned fire in southern Australia generally occurs in small, discrete areas. There are different environmental and social impacts resulting from fires in forests in northern and southern Australia, and different management challenges.\u201d You\u2019ll find the whole report here The Jobmaker plan at this stage, is to develop a plan: It is worth pointing out that the Queensland Labor government put a freeze on public servant wages a little over a month ago (which included health and education workers) Stephen Jones reports the latest APRA report looking at the quarterly performance of regulated super funds shows funds were hit with a -3.3% loss n the first quarter of the year \u2013 the worst quarter on record. This is a double whammy for the 1.4 million workers who withdrew their money at the bottom of the market under the government\u2019s early access scheme. For most super fund members the March quarter drop is a only paper loss. Superannuation is a long term investment so over time, funds can be expected to recover before most members access their accounts. Tragically this won\u2019t be the case for the 1.4 million workers who instead of receiving timely government support resorted to accessing their retirement nest egg. For these workers who withdrew their money at the bottom of the market the loss was crystallised the moment they withdrew funds from their account under the Government\u2019s early access scheme. The hardest hit were young people. Gladys Berejiklian: As a state, we cannot continue to lose thousands of workers every month. We cannot continue to have households living under the fear \u2013 not just of being able to pay their bill, but whether they keep their family home. And unfortunately, that\u2019s the conversation being had in too many households across the state. And that\u2019s why, as a government, it\u2019s up to us to demonstrate leadership. To bring everybody together, and to make decisions that we think are in the best interests of the community. And that\u2019s why today, the treasurer and I are announcing that over the next 12 months, there will be no pay increases for people who work in the public service. There are 410,000 employees in the New South Wales public service, of which the Treasurer and I are, too. And none of us, nobody, will be getting a pay rise from this period onwards for the next 12 months as agreements come up. Now, the reason for this is that every spare dollar we have and every dollar we don\u2019t have, we need to spend in health and also in jobs and job security. That is the priority. Keeping people in jobs who are in jobs at the moment. And we\u2019re also today, giving this announcement, and giving an assurance to every single public servant that during the course of this 12 months, nobody will be forced out of a job in the New South Wales public service. All 410,000 employees will have the choice to remain in the New South Wales public service. Unfortunately, the same can\u2019t be said for literally hundreds of thousands of employees who don\u2019t work for the New South Wales government. And today\u2019s announcement is about keep all of our employees safe. Keeping all of our employees in jobs. Every single one of them. But also, making sure that we can support all of our citizens throughout New South Wales in the best way possible. Gladys Berejiklian: Today is not about managing the budget. It\u2019s not about managing the economy. It\u2019s all about saving livelihoods, saving jobs and saving lives. That\u2019s what this is about. And a government in our shoes, I think, would do the same thing. And I am urging everybody to come together. Please, let\u2019s not descend into the normal political talk that we have. Let\u2019s not descend into the normal obstacles that are faced when governments try to do the right thing. I\u2019m calling everybody to come together to support the government in this. As difficult a decision as it is, and of course, we\u2019ll have every opportunity to negotiate with all of our stakeholders once the agreement, once the 12-month period is completed. Gladys Berejiklian is announcing a 12-month pay freeze for all NSW public servants. This is in line with what other jurisdictions, including the commonwealth and the Queensland government, have done. One of this country\u2019s greatest and ironclad political minds, Kerri-Anne Kennerley, somehow managed to out Joe Hildebrand Hildebrand himself on Studio 10 this morning, when she gave the prime minister this question: I can\u2019t imagine how frustrated you have been, as an elected prime minister, putting out a plan for what has been an enormous crisis in this country and in the world. And then having individual states not toe the line. So let\u2019s just pretend, for instance, I\u2019m Annastacia Palaszczuk and Daniel Andrews. What do you want to say on the QT to me, or to both of those premiers? To which the prime minister said: Well, look, first of all, I don\u2019t think that we should overstate this. I mean, by and large, the states and territories have worked incredibly well through the National Cabinet process. I mean, we have countries of just equal sophistication to ours, developed economies, good health systems, and they have had death rates a hundred times and more what Australia has had. So let\u2019s not just brush aside that. That has been the product of people working together, and particularly states and territories working together with the federal government. Now, on this issue of internal borders, that is not something national cabinet ever agreed was something that was required. That is something that individual states have done off their own back. Now, I\u2019m optimistic that will get sorted out, and I think that it is in the interest of jobs for it to be sorted out. At the moment, they will announce their timetables, but I wouldn\u2019t overstate it in terms of the level of working relationship between the states and territories and the commonwealth. I mean, by and large, that\u2019s worked very well. The expectation that they\u2019re going to agree on everything, and states and territories aren\u2019t going to take unilateral decisions on some things, I think is unrealistic. I mean they\u2019re sovereign states and they\u2019ll make their own calls. But I was just going to say \u2013 they\u2019ve got to be accountable for it, though. There is no medical advice that we received nationally. The conversation then naturally moved on to Tina Arena and the NRL. As you would expect. He then had a chat to Hamish Macdonald on ABC RN radio, which included this exchange: Macdonald: ...The point that Sally McManus has made this morning is that it\u2019s the insecurity of those people\u2019s employment leading into this crisis that has left them in that position. And so that if we are to find a way forward, there must be some more certainty, some more safeguards around their employment to ensure that we don\u2019t end up with these huge unemployment numbers. Porter: Well, and that\u2019s got to be something we will talk about. But I think that you might be slightly misrepresenting my good friend Sally McManus because what has caused the problem that we\u2019re in is something beyond our control. I mean a pandemic swept around the world, was prevented from doing monstrous health harm in Australia and causing what could have been the type of deaths we\u2019ve seen per capita in the UK and Italy and the Government\u2019s response to prevent those deaths at a state and federal level was to have to restrain certain sectors of the economy which has caused enormous economic damage to the economy which now has to be repaired. So I think the reason why there is \u2026 What a time we live in. The man whose main job to date has been to smashing up unions in question time now publicly declares the ACTU head to be his \u201cgood friend\u201d. Christian Porter, who has to come up with these answers by September, had a chat to Melbourne ABC radio this morning. He described the roundtable chats as: Well, I think it\u2019s sort of more targeted in the sense that we\u2019re trying to reach agreed solutions to known problems. And you\u2019ve just mentioned one with enterprise bargaining which has really, sort of, gotten itself into a position where it\u2019s not a useful increase or a productivity, where people find it\u2019s clunky, slow. And the number of enterprise agreements has declined steadily overtime, so that\u2019s a known problem. How we define casual employment is a known problem. The complexity in some of the Awards, particularly those that deal with key industries, hospitality for instance, is a known problem. Now, people will have different views about how to solve those problems, but we want to get everyone in a room, talk through those views and alternative ways to solve those problems, and try and actually produce solutions to known problems that can weather a parliamentary process and actually increase job growth in Australia after COVID-19, where we face the biggest economic challenge of our lives. There have been eight more people in Victoria who have been diagnosed with Covid-19 in the last 24 hours. Four have come from routine testing, and one is still under investigation. Daniel Andrews says there are no plans to have the state return to its usual work patterns any time soon: I do again want to reiterate for all Victorians who have been working from home, if you have been working from home, you must continue to work from home for all of June. Now, that may change beyond June but at this stage, the about literally hundreds of thousands of Victorians returning to office blocks, returning to work in a physical workplace as opposed to continuing their at-homework. It stands to reason. Logic tells you if that many people are crammed in on public transport, pressing lift buttons, sharing spaces across the workplace across the workday, then all that will do is pose an unacceptable risk and potentially see the transmission of the virus and see so much of our hard work undone. No one wants that. You can find all your Covid international news, here Scott Morrison\u2019s merry-go-round of morning media appearances, talking up the coming IR roundtables (we just LOVE a roundtable in this country) included this exchange with Sabra Lane on ABC radio, which covers what I was talking about earlier \u2013 this process is not the Accords, because the government has nothing to offer: Lane: Under the 80s Accord though, the prime minister, the government offered workers family payments, child care, the introduction of Medicare in exchange for restricted wage demands. What can the government bring to the table this time? Morrison: Well, the people coming to the table, as I said, are employees and employers. The government is bringing people together. Lane: And the government is empty handed? Morrison: No. What I\u2019m saying is that this isn\u2019t some reheat of a process done by a former Labour government. It\u2019s not an Accord. It\u2019s a new process. It\u2019s about bringing people together to see what they can agree on in areas like how we deal with casualisation and full time work, how we can ensure that people get paid properly, how we can ensure on new sites that people will invest money in creating jobs because they can get some certainty over what the workplace arrangements will be. This is about employers and employees working together. I\u2019m not sure you can call a complete overhaul of Australian society, (which also led to a Labor government embracing neo-Liberal policies) a \u201cprocess\u201d that you could \u201creheat\u201d, but the prime minister is very adept at weaponising words to suit a message. It\u2019s also not a new process to \u201cbring people together\u201d, but expect to hear a lot about how this is \u2018groundbreaking\u2019 in coming months. My somewhat cynical prediction is that it won\u2019t lead to anything, but the government will blame that on unions not \u2018dropping their weapons\u2019, but we\u2019ll see I guess. The agriculture minister continues: Again, no-one left the ship. Anyone that went on the ship was in protective clothing. It wasn\u2019t until the Sunday that Australian Border Force as I understand also became concerned about consultation with the captain, as well as the department of infrastructure with the captain, Australian Border Force through a third party agency notified them of their concerns about people presenting themselves with symptoms, that again, that agency notified the public health emergency operations centre in Perth. The same protocol that the department of agriculture took two days earlier. It wasn\u2019t until the Monday in which health officials from WA boarded the boat and started to test. Now, those are the facts that have been put before me by my department. I have emails to ensure my department have acted within the protocols set out by the states, even with the Artania, as I would say the WA government handled magnificently. We have not deviated from that. Can I just say it\u2019s important as political leaders, we appreciate those men and women that have put themselves out there, and I will end on this - particularly for those biosecurity officers in my department. David Littleproud is having none of the blame for the live export ship, the Al Kuwait, docking in Fremantle, with suspected Covid cases on board. The WA government says they were given no warning about the Covid risk, although health protocols were still carried out. Littleproud says that\u2019s not true: With respect to the Al Kuwait boat, it\u2019s important we put some facts on the table. Some real facts. The first two important facts, no-one has left the boat without medical attention being provided them. Beforehand. We have undertaken all the quarantine protocols and isolation. No-one went onto the boat unless they were wearing protective equipment. Everyone who has come into contact with the Al Kuwait has undertaken that. It\u2019s important to understand the department of agriculture has a role to play and it\u2019s important we put the facts on the table and work through them calmly. On 20 May, the ship\u2019s master notified the department of agriculture that three of their crew were in fact feeling ill. But they did not have a temperature, did not have symptoms of COVID-19. That was logged. In fact, our departmental personnel have checked that the ship\u2019s log to ensure that is the case and we continue to work through that. From then on, as the boat came in, and was docked on 22 May, at 10:39, we notified WA health, in fact, their public health emergency operations centre, we had been notified less than an hour earlier there had been someone that presented themselves with symptoms of COVID-19. It is not for the department of agriculture to make medical assessment. We look after plants and animals. The Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary, Sally McManus, has explained that unions are taking part in IR consultation because they want to hear what employers and the government have to say, arguing unions lose nothing by keeping an open mind because the government could always \u201cdo it on their own anyway\u201d. Indeed, the attorney general, Christian Porter, was already consulting on changes. She told Radio National: \u201cAll the things they\u2019re talking about they were examining anyway. The only difference now is we\u2019re at the table. In the end they may try to put [reforms we disagree with] through the Senate \u2013 they will \u2013 and if we disagree with them, we\u2019ll fight them.\u201d McManus suggested unions believe changes could be made to the bargaining process \u2013 but did not give much ground on workers being left worse off. She said: \u201cBargaining is on the table and the bargaining process. There is a lot of discussion around the idea there are too many hoops [to get an agreement approved]. We\u2019ve got some sympathy for that \u2013 there are five barriers for employers and 16 for working people when they bargain.\u201d But the sorts of changes the ACTU has pushed for is industry-level bargaining or multi-enterprise bargaining, which McManus returns to by suggesting a bargaining system that \u201csuits all those small workplaces like childcare centres where enterprise bargaining is beyond reach\u201d. Asked if any worker should be worse off, McManus replied: \u201cThe principle that bargaining is about improving conditions \u2013 and yes, [improving them] for everyone \u2013 is a good one.\u201d But McManus suggested the evidence requirements to show everyone is better off could be made more efficient, if unions and employers have already reached agreement on a workplace pay deal. She said it was \u201cabsolutely\u201d fundamental that nobody is worse off, promising \u201cwe\u2019re always going to have [workers] back\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re never going to go into negotiations and see them go backwards, lose pay and conditions.\u201d Anthony Albanese: The fact is, there\u2019s a problem in the economy which is wages, wages have been stagnant. That is a problem for the national economy. And one of the things we know is that every time this coalition government has engaged in industrial relations, what they call reform, it has been aimed at driving down wages and conditions for working people. Every time. And the fact is that they have been engaged in that process and it shouldn\u2019t have taken a pandemic for the government to say that unions and business should have common interests, and that they do in fact have common interests. Workers have an interest in employers and businesses being profitable. Scott Morrison says all sides need to \u201cput down their weapons\u201d as the nation attempts IR reform, which has raised some eyebrows, given the concerted campaign the Coalition has conducted against unions for the past six or seven years. Anthony Albanese isn\u2019t impressed (that is saying it mildly) What they\u2019ve done is establish working groups. This government has been in office for seven years. And for seven years what they\u2019ve done is denigrate workers organisations, attack trade unions, and said that they\u2019ve been a promoter of conflict. They passed the ensuring integrity bill through the House of Representatives last year without allowing a single word of debate. Not one word. Unprecedented. Since Federation. That that would occur. But it occurred on the last sitting day of 2019. Since I\u2019ve been the leader of the Labor party, I, on the day I was elected unopposed as leader, one year ago to the very day today, one of the first things I said, was that Australians were suffering from conflict fatigue. One of the first things I said was consistent with what I said for years previously, that business and unions have common interest. There should be nothing remarkable about that statement. It\u2019s something I put into practice as well as a minister in the former Labor government with the creation of organisations like Infrastructure Australia, with the creation of organisations like the major cities unit and others to drive change through the agenda, to get people sitting around a table and talking about that change. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve always conducted myself in, it\u2019s something that Jim [Chalmers] and I have been participating in meetings, not just with the ACTU, but with the Business Council of Australia. Since I became the leader of the Labor Party. Yesterday, I had a round table that was scheduled some time ago with the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It\u2019s something that we do on a regular basis. It\u2019s not a front page story because it\u2019s what we do. Unlike Scott Morrison, where it is remarkable that he\u2019s prepared to talk to a worker. The Queensland\u2019s man death takes the nation\u2019s total to 103. At 30, he is one of the youngest Australians to have died of the virus. He had several underlying health complications, but it is unsure where he had contracted the virus. So to recap, a 30-year-old Queensland man has tested positive for Covid after his death. His partner returned home from work in the small western Queensland town of Blackwater at 4.30pm and found the man unresponsive. An ambulance immediately responded, but the man could not be revived and was declared deceased at the scene. The man had been displaying Covid symptoms in the week leading up to his death, but had many other health complications A post-mortem Covid test returned positive and authorities were alerted around 11pm on Tuesday. There had been no other recorded cases of Covid in Blackwater prior to the man\u2019s death. The man had not travelled overseas, or left Blackwater since February. He is believed to have spent most of the past few weeks at home. Contact tracing is under way. All residents of Blackwater are being urged to get tested if they are showing any signs of the virus. Testing units have been set up in the town. The man\u2019s partner is showing Covid signs and has been isolated. The emergency service workers who responded to the man\u2019s death have also been isolated. The man\u2019s partner returned from work yesterday at about 4.30pm and found him unresponsive. An ambulance was called immediately, but he was declared dead at the scene. The Queensland chief medical officer, Dr Jeannette Young, says the man is believed to have spent most of his time at home while he was ill, but had not travelled overseas, and had not left Blackwater since February. That\u2019s part of the reason the contact tracing team are now urgently working to see where he may have contracted the virus. Queensland health minister Steven Miles says authorities were made aware of the man\u2019s post-mortem result at around 11pm: This does appear to be Queensland\u2019s seventh COVID-19 related death. We have deployed public health experts and additional contact tracing resources from Brisbane to Blackwater today. The case will now be referred to the coroner and we expect a post-mortem will be conducted. We have set up additional fever clinics that will be ready and operational in Emerald and in Blackwater shortly and we urge anyone, anyone in Queensland, but particularly anyone in Blackwater, who is suffering symptoms to please go and get tested. This message is particularly important for all the blokes out there. I know that men sometimes fob off their illnesses, they don\u2019t go and get medical assistance, but it\u2019s incredibly important right now that anyone with symptoms goes and gets tested. It appears this gentleman who has passed away was ill for some time. And did not get tested. And so I want anyone, anyone in Queensland, who is unwell, to go and get tested today. Especially if they\u2019re from Blackwater or been in Blackwater. Blackwater, in the Queensland central highlands, had not recorded any cases of Covid prior to this man\u2019s death. Health authorities have set up a fever clinic. The man\u2019s partner is also showing Covid symptoms now, and has been isolated, as have the emergency services staff who responded to his home, following his death. The Queensland health minister, Steven Miles, says the man tested positive for Covid after his death: The news today is absolutely tragic and while we are working to finalise all of the facts, we\u2019re sharing with you today what we know. Late yesterday afternoon, the Queensland ambulance service was called to a home in Blackwater, there they found a man who was deceased, he was later tested for COVID-19 and that test was positive. The paramedics and police officers who attended the scene are now in quarantine and we thank them for the assistance they provided to this man and his partner. Of course our thoughts are with a Queensland family that today will be grieving. This does appear to be Queensland\u2019s seventh COVID-19 related death. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk says a man from Blackwater, who was showing Covid symptoms, as well as suffering from other illnesses, has died overnight. The coroner is investigating. Palaszczuk: He\u2019s a 30-year-old man and the coroner is investigating the death. He was showing symptoms prior to his death but also had other illnesses that [health minister] Dr Young will talk about. He positive at the post-mortem and his partner is now sick with symptoms. And she has been transferred to the Rockhampton Hospital where she\u2019s being isolated and further tests are being done. Blackwater has never had a case of COVID before. Contact tracing is extensively underway. The police and ambulance officers who attended the scene are also now in quarantine. And Dr Young can also provide further details and measures being undertaken in Blackwater. If anyone is sick in Queensland, please stay home. Do not go to work. But also too, if you\u2019re showing any symptoms I urge you to go and get tested. There will be fever clinics set up at Blackwater and also at Emerald and if anyone has any flu-like symptoms, we urge you in these two communities to please go and get tested. So, once again, we extend our condolences and it\u2019s a timely reminder for all Queenslanders that - this COVID is real, it\u2019s out there, and it has impacts on Queenslanders and in this case, we have lost another Queenslander today. The deans of the nation\u2019s university business schools say the government needs to act to stop universities from \u201cbeing damaged irreparably\u201d. The president of the Australian Business Deans Council (ABDC), David Grant, has laid out six issues which the council says needs to be addressed urgently: 1. The need to fund more domestic places so young people, and the thousands of other Australians whose jobs have disappeared, have tertiary education as a viable option. Past recessions have shown that, as unemployment rates soar, those who cannot earn enrol to learn. 2. The proposed \u201csafe corridors\u201d to bring international students into Australia needs to be implemented as soon as is safely possible so there is at least some chance of international students getting to Australia and clearing quarantine for the second part of this year. Failure to do this swiftly will add to the devastation of our international education, which contributed $40 billion to our economy each year before COVID-19. 3. International students, who are already in Australia, should be supported and encouraged to remain here. Community groups, state and local governments and have stepped up to support those who have been hard hit by job losses and exclusion from JobSeeker and JobKeeper. They do however need practical, ongoing help, coordinated at the national level that shows how we value them for their contributions to the Australian economy. 4. Cuts of up to 21000 jobs are underway as universities yet the Federal Government has ensured that universities \u2013 unlike other large businesses and some private universities \u2013 are ineligible for the JobKeeper subsidy. This does not make sense. 5. Researchers urgently need government assistance to ensure that they can continue and not waste work already done. Many research projects have already been suspended. International researchers, who are very important to the sector, may not return to Australia to finish their work. Much of the $4.7 billion that universities put into research each year has been funded by revenue from international education. That revenue has now evaporated from a sector that is likely to take years to recover. 6. There is a need to re-start infrastructure projects that have been suspended as universities try to stop their financial haemorrhaging. The Victorian Government has allocated $350 million, which will greatly assist universities with capital projects in that state, but what about the rest of the nation? Hundreds of masks and plastic containers have washed up on Sydney\u2019s eastern beaches overnight. It\u2019s believed to be contents of some of the 40 shipping containers that fell off Singaporean cargo ship APL England on Sunday. Coogee locals have begun trying to clear the debris this morning. \u201cThe beach looked like a rubbish tip,\u201d said Aliy Potts. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to clean things up this morning. I\u2019ve got a two rubbish bags full already.\u201d Angus Taylor has used the 2020 Australian Energy Statistics to push the government\u2019s case for more gas This latest data also demonstrates the continuing importance of coal and the significant and growing reliance on gas to back our significant renewable capacity. Gas is flexible and provides the dispatchable capacity we increasingly need to balance intermittent renewables and deliver a secure, reliable and affordable electricity system to power our homes, businesses and industries. This has never been more important \u2013 particularly as we begin our recovery from the impact of the COVID19 pandemic. This is why the Australian Government believes a gas-fired recovery will drive jobs and economic growth. We now need state and territory governments to do their part to unlock more gas for the domestic market and encourage investment in reliable generation which will put downward pressure on wholesale prices.\u201d Well whisk me round and call me hollandaise, I wonder why *thinking face emoji* Oh look \u2013 renewable energy use continues to grow. Angus Taylor has released the latest energy use data, including that coal underpins 56% of Australia\u2019s energy use, because of course it does, because we can\u2019t work out a transition plan: The 2020 Australian Energy Statistics for electricity generation cover all electricity generation in Australia, including by power plants and by businesses and households for their own use. The new data shows 21 per cent of Australia\u2019s electricity came from renewable energy last year, up from 19 per cent in 2018. The largest increase in renewable generation was in large-scale solar, up 135 per cent, followed by small-scale solar, up 25 per cent, and wind generation up 19 per cent. Gas-fired generation also grew to account for 21 per cent of Australia\u2019s total generation. This was driven largely by growth in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. The data also demonstrates the importance of coal-fired generation, which continues to be an essential part of Australia\u2019s energy mix, representing 56 per cent of total generation in 2019. The dataset is available here. It is worth mentioning that Noel Pearson\u2019s Cape York Institute has begun an education campaign, using the messaging group favoured by conservatives, Crosby Textor, to try and get the First Nations\u2019 From the Heart campaign back in front of people, as well as explain what the Uluru Statement from the Heart actually means. But it is also absolutely worth mentioning that a very big part of the reason they have to do that, is because leaders and MPs, such as Barnaby Joyce, almost immediately muddied the statement, by claiming it would create a \u201cthird chamber of parliament\u201d \u2013 something it never set out. Joyce has since admitted he was wrong, but the damage has been done. And there are still MPs in the government, sitting in parliament, who walked out as the National Apology was being delivered by Kevin Rudd. Scott Morrison wants consensus among Indigenous leaders before moving forward with any proposal, but there is not even consensus in the government party rooms. Indigenous people should not have to be doing this work. That\u2019s our job. We\u2019ve been the hold up. Something which has been pushed to the side (and not just because of the Covid crisis) is Indigenous recognition. Before the pandemic, the government had already abandoned plans to enshrine an Indigenous voice in the constitution. Now, we barely hear of it at all. Linda Burney spoke to the ABC about that this morning: I have great fears that it won\u2019t happen. I\u2019m very proud to be part of a party, the Labor party, that supports the Uluru Statement in its entirety. And that is constitutional recognition, agreement making or treaty making, and of course truth-telling. I think that the prime minister ruling out constitutional reform is going to be on the wrong side of history. And he still has a chance to make it a reality. We cannot go backwards in this country, and it is really at the behest of the prime minster and the government to make that referendum happen in this term. If we don\u2019t, we miss an enormous opportunity. But Labor stay committed. One thing you\u2019d have to give the government is they\u2019re very clear-eyed about the prospect all this IR reform chat will go nowhere. Attorney general Christian Porter told Radio National if you don\u2019t swing at the ball you can\u2019t hit a boundary. On Channel Nine\u2019s Today program, Scott Morrison responded to the Darryl Kerrigan suggestion (tell him he\u2019s dreaming) thus: Well look, perhaps I am. Perhaps I am. But you have got to in this circumstance. Because the country is up against a massive challenge. If that dream involves people might work together in workplaces to create jobs and secure better incomes for people into the future and we come out of this crisis as strong as I believe we can, then that is a dream worth having.\u201d Morrison also implicitly told the unions they were dreaming by trying to bring political debates about extending unemployment benefits (jobseeker) and wage subsidies (jobkeeper) into the IR reform process. He said: Well, that is not part of the discussions. What they are talking about is five key areas. I will be really quick to explain them. The whole issue of casuals and full- time work. The awards ... the enterprise bargaining system, ensuring people get paid properly and compliance. Those investments on new sites that they can go ahead. They are the five areas they are working on. That\u2019s where I have asked them to come together. The government will be considering those other broader issues as we go to the budget later this year and of course in the months ahead. Now we want to focus on what is happening in the workplace itself and how we could make those businesses work better so they can create more jobs and people can have greater certainty of employment in their conditions.\u201d I know that this new IR process is being described as the \u2018Accords 2.0\u2019 but let\u2019s remember this latest round of reform talks has a September deadline. The original accords began in 1983 and continued until John Howard called time on them in 1996. So not exactly the same then. Plus, the OG accord was about restricting wage demands, in exchange for things like Medicare. We don\u2019t have the same set of playing cards. Perhaps the highlight of Scott Morrison\u2019s round of interviews was the exchange with the ABC AM\u2019s Sabra Lane about whether he would guarantee workers would be no worse off after this IR process. He said: We\u2019re getting workers and employers together, their representatives, we\u2019re getting them together in a room to work out how to get their enterprises and workers in a stronger position \u2026 This is a process that will flow through \u2013 we\u2019re getting people together to agree, to work together, so we\u2019re looking to people agreeing to what goes forward \u2026 This is a process that wants to see workers better off, this is a process that wants to see employers better off, businesses better off. But most importantly this is about more jobs.\u201d Wants to see \u2013 but no guarantee. When Lane noted it was a simple yes or no, Morrison replied: The problem with that position \u2013 and this has been the problem with the industrial relations debate for all time is it quickly descends into these sorts of issues and we need to get past all that, past the point it has turned into black and white discussions \u2026 We can\u2019t have those old debates any more, and it\u2019s the same for where the coverage of these issues comes from \u2013 that only gets in the way of people getting jobs.\u201d The Northern Territory government is hinting it could reopen its borders by August. Western Australia is taking it on a month-by-month basis, but Western Australians seem quite happy to have cut the east off, at least at this stage, so there isn\u2019t quite as big a push there to bring down the border blocks. South Australia is also taking it on a month-by-month basis, but having a Liberal premier (as opposed to the other closed states) has also meant there isn\u2019t quite the same amount of pressure. Simon Birmingham has done most of his OPEN THE BORDERS QUEENSLAND posturing, from a state which also has closed borders, but that never seems to get addressed. Queensland has also said it will look at its border closure on a month-to-month basis, but probably won\u2019t be reopening any earlier than July. We\u2019ll have more of an idea from that state on Sunday, when the latest loosening of the restrictions is announced. But the main reason Queensland is under the microscope is because there is a state election in that state in October. Pauline Hanson has issued an \u201cultimatum\u201d to Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk to open the borders by 4pm tomorrow, or she is off to the high court. Cool beans. Meanwhile, Pauline Hanson is crowdfunding her legal challenge and has so far raised just over $3,000 of her $1m goal. You read that right \u2013 One. Million. Dollars. Scott Morrison has been riding the morning interview circuit HARD this morning. We\u2019ll bring you the highlights in a bit. Welcome to today\u2019s coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in Australia. Staff and residents at an aged care centre in Melbourne\u2019s inner east are undergoing further testing for Covid-19 after two workers at the facility contracted the virus. Two staff members at Lynden Aged Care in Camberwell were confirmed as having the illness on Tuesday, the health department said in a statement. A resident at the same facility tested positive earlier this month when they went to hospital for an unrelated procedure. Meanwhile, federal and state tensions are once again flaring after a live export ship was allowed to dock at Fremantle Port, despite Covid-19 concerns for the crew. As AAP reports: Fremantle Port workers boarded a live export ship before a Covid-19 outbreak was confirmed, and there are concerns they and their families have been exposed. Six of the 48 multinational crew have since tested positive to the virus. The federal department says it had been told three of the crew were ill, but none of them had elevated temperatures or Covid-19 symptoms before their arrival. It only learned crew members had fevers when they landed and immediately notified the WA health department, it said. No crew members were permitted to disembark and all federal department staff who attended the vessel wore full personal protective equipment. The state government said its public health emergency operations centre received an email on Friday morning informing it three ill crew members had a temperature. But it explicitly stated no concern for Covid-19 on the vessel and no respiratory illness present, along with making no request for assistance. We\u2019ll bring you all the days events as they happen, live. You have Amy Remeikis with you for the bulk of the day. Ready?",

Six sailors from the ship have tested positive to Covid-19. Initially, WA premier Mark McGowan said his state health authorities were not warned by the commonwealth that there were sick people aboard. Today, it emerged there had been an email that had not been acted upon. McGowan said: This morning I contacted [agriculture] minister [David] Littleproud to discuss the issue and the need to improve communications between all parties. There have clearly been some errors made all round. I also think we need to have better and more comprehensive communications with the commonwealth than just an email. Any report of crew or passengers onboard ships or aircraft entering this state with Covid-like symptoms must be given the attention it deserves. We all know that the greatest risk to Western Australia at the moment is from people entering our state from overseas or from interstate. The six sailors are in quarantine in Perth and are said to be displaying only mild symptoms. Other crew remain onboard the ship and have been tested for the virus by WA health authorities. In Victoria ... Eight new cases have been reported in the past 24 hours. Four have come from routine testing, and one is still under investigation. The premier, Daniel Andrews, says there are no plans to have the state return to its usual work patterns anytime soon. I do again want to reiterate for all Victorians who have been working from home, if you have been working from home, you must continue to work from home for all of June. Cedar Meats, the Melbourne abattoir at the centre of a Covid-19 cluster of more than 100 cases, will restart operations, including processing, on Thursday. About 300 staff are expected to return to work. Staff who have been medically cleared to start work attended a return to work information session at Cedar Meats\u2019 Brooklyn site today.

As Mandela\u2019s health minister from 1994 to 1999, she was tasked with reforming the public health system while trying to come to grips with the new pandemic.</p> <p>Some of her early ideas around Aids prevention were considered pioneering, but her later support for the toxic industrial solvent, Virodene, as an Aids cure, and the misspending of taxpayers\u2019 money on an Aids prevention musical, tarnished her reputation.</p> <p>Later she became Africa Union Commission chair and pushed for the founding of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention after the 2014 Ebola outbreak in parts of the continent. It now plays an important role in supporting African countries on Covid-19.</p> <p>She has earned praise for the clear and simple way she explained the government\u2019s plans to gradually ease the lockdown in her mother tongue, Zulu, the biggest first language in South Africa.</p> <p>Also prominent in South Africa\u2019s Covid-19 crisis are activists like Mark Heywood, who edits a news site focusing on human rights and social justice civil society organisations called <a href=\"https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/\">Maverick Citizen</a>. He was among those who led the fight to make Aids medication affordable and widely available. Of late, he\u2019s also provided advice to the local <a href=\"https://twitter.com/covidcoalition?lang=en\">C19 People\u2019s Coalition</a>, one of the biggest civil society Covid-19 responses in the world.</p> <p>As an Aids activist he learned how important it is to build alliances between those living with the disease, the health sector, trade unions, the media, and government. \u201cCovid-19 is a social ill as much as it affects individuals,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to address it socially, not just through individual behavioural interventions.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8406451756bd87b7e860088a3b8e5cd9e83bf98a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8406451756bd87b7e860088a3b8e5cd9e83bf98a/0_0_6450_4408/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Young children wait to receive food donations without their parents during a handout in Johannesburg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Young children wait to receive food donations during a handout in Johannesburg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kim Ludbrook/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Heywood foresees the looming possibility of a big battle around access to Covid-19 treatment and vaccines, similar to the battles for Aids medicines. \u201cBillions of people are going to need the vaccine when it arrives. How do you make sure it hasn\u2019t been patented and doesn\u2019t become some company\u2019s private intellectual property?\u201d he says. \u201cHow do you ensure that developing countries are not last in the queue to receive it?\u201d</p> <p>Thus far the government\u2019s prompt and scientific response to Covid-19 means the battle hasn\u2019t been as intense as when Aids was \u201cturned into a political fight\u201d and activists \u201cwere pushing against power to try and get something done\u201d, says Heywood.</p> <p>During the most difficult days of the Aids pandemic, activists witnessed death on a big scale and attended multiple funerals every weekend. \u201cWhen you looked at the graves, you would see the ages were all young,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange inversion, because this time it\u2019s older people.\u201d So far South Africa\u2019s confirmed Covid-19 death toll is more than 480.</p> <p>Mia Malan, editor-in-chief of the Bhekisisa Centre for Health Journalism, who reported extensively on Aids as a health reporter for the South African Broadcasting Corporation, says leaders are doing things better this time around. But the government\u2019s past failures to provide an effective and early HIV response has left South Africa with millions of HIV infections that could have been prevented. As a result people with weaker immune systems (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4911250/\">four out of 10</a> HIV-positive South Africans are untreated) could be more vulnerable to developing Covid-19, she says.</p> <p>\u201cThe most obvious lesson is the difference an early response can make. With HIV, the government started an evidence-based response much too late.\u201d South Africa only had 550 coronavirus cases when it closed borders and decided on a strict lockdown that lasted at least five weeks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f312e9297fa47a93b62c777facb5c89a6e3ab6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f312e9297fa47a93b62c777facb5c89a6e3ab6f/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nurse performs a swab test for Covid-19 on a health worker at the Vlakfontein Clinic in Lenasia, Johannesburg.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South Africa managed to flatten its coronavirus curve through an early response and lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michele Spatari/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Communicating a clear and unambiguous message from government was another lesson, and partnerships have been struck with the media to make this possible \u2013 and to fight disinformation. \u201cActivists and the media were the complete enemy during that time [of Aids], but now the minister of health at his briefing would thank the media for being partners,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t criticise them, but we are on the same side.\u201d</p> <p>Putting science above politics is also crucial, she says. \u201cAbdool Karim was world-renowned at that time [during the Aids pandemic] already, and he was rejected. Now he is chair of the [government\u2019s Covid-19 advisory] committee.\u201d</p> <p>Compassion is vital. When child activist Nkosi Johnson died of Aids-related complications aged 12 in 2001, Mbeki was silent. Now, Malan says, Mkhize offers deep condolences in every statement announcing new Covid-19 deaths. \u201cMkhize and [president Cyril] Ramaphosa will come out of this and it will possibly define their legacy \u2013 very much the opposite to Mbeki and Manto.\u201d</p>",

Aids was ravaging lives and overwhelming health systems, at its peak killing up to 1,000 people a day in South Africa. Mandela\u2019s successor as president, Thabo Mbeki, was in obstinate denial. On the sidelines of the conference where Mandela made his appeal, Mbeki\u2019s controversial health minister, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, scolded scientists for daring to oppose the government\u2019s stance. One of those scientists, Salim Abdool Karim, now leads South Africa\u2019s Covid-19 advisory team, earning this government plaudits from the World Health Organization for its response to the pandemic. Tshabalala-Msimang succumbed to liver problems in 2009 and left a legacy of 300,000 preventable deaths. In early April, two weeks into South Africa\u2019s coronavirus lockdown, Abdool Karim led a live two-hour briefing explaining the reasoning behind the strict measures, which confine people to their homes and prohibit public exercise and the sale of alcohol and tobacco. It is in sharp contrast with the Aids response two decades ago. \u201cI\u2019m impressed that the powers that be took this seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t need to be convinced, they didn\u2019t waffle around, they didn\u2019t procrastinate.\u201d The 59-year-old last year joined the world\u2019s most respected scientists to become a fellow of the Royal Society.

Mkhize\u2019s cabinet colleague responsible for promulgating the fierce lockdown regulations, local government minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, was also in the team leading South Africa\u2019s early Aids response. As Mandela\u2019s health minister from 1994 to 1999, she was tasked with reforming the public health system while trying to come to grips with the new pandemic. Some of her early ideas around Aids prevention were considered pioneering, but her later support for the toxic industrial solvent, Virodene, as an Aids cure, and the misspending of taxpayers\u2019 money on an Aids prevention musical, tarnished her reputation. Later she became Africa Union Commission chair and pushed for the founding of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention after the 2014 Ebola outbreak in parts of the continent. It now plays an important role in supporting African countries on Covid-19. She has earned praise for the clear and simple way she explained the government\u2019s plans to gradually ease the lockdown in her mother tongue, Zulu, the biggest first language in South Africa. Also prominent in South Africa\u2019s Covid-19 crisis are activists like Mark Heywood, who edits a news site focusing on human rights and social justice civil society organisations called Maverick Citizen. He was among those who led the fight to make Aids medication affordable and widely available. Of late, he\u2019s also provided advice to the local C19 People\u2019s Coalition, one of the biggest civil society Covid-19 responses in the world. As an Aids activist he learned how important it is to build alliances between those living with the disease, the health sector, trade unions, the media, and government. \u201cCovid-19 is a social ill as much as it affects individuals,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to address it socially, not just through individual behavioural interventions.\u201d Heywood foresees the looming possibility of a big battle around access to Covid-19 treatment and vaccines, similar to the battles for Aids medicines. \u201cBillions of people are going to need the vaccine when it arrives. How do you make sure it hasn\u2019t been patented and doesn\u2019t become some company\u2019s private intellectual property?\u201d he says. \u201cHow do you ensure that developing countries are not last in the queue to receive it?\u201d Thus far the government\u2019s prompt and scientific response to Covid-19 means the battle hasn\u2019t been as intense as when Aids was \u201cturned into a political fight\u201d and activists \u201cwere pushing against power to try and get something done\u201d, says Heywood. During the most difficult days of the Aids pandemic, activists witnessed death on a big scale and attended multiple funerals every weekend. \u201cWhen you looked at the graves, you would see the ages were all young,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a strange inversion, because this time it\u2019s older people.\u201d So far South Africa\u2019s confirmed Covid-19 death toll is more than 480. Mia Malan, editor-in-chief of the Bhekisisa Centre for Health Journalism, who reported extensively on Aids as a health reporter for the South African Broadcasting Corporation, says leaders are doing things better this time around. But the government\u2019s past failures to provide an effective and early HIV response has left South Africa with millions of HIV infections that could have been prevented. As a result people with weaker immune systems (four out of 10 HIV-positive South Africans are untreated) could be more vulnerable to developing Covid-19, she says. \u201cThe most obvious lesson is the difference an early response can make. With HIV, the government started an evidence-based response much too late.\u201d South Africa only had 550 coronavirus cases when it closed borders and decided on a strict lockdown that lasted at least five weeks. Communicating a clear and unambiguous message from government was another lesson, and partnerships have been struck with the media to make this possible \u2013 and to fight disinformation. \u201cActivists and the media were the complete enemy during that time [of Aids], but now the minister of health at his briefing would thank the media for being partners,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t criticise them, but we are on the same side.\u201d Putting science above politics is also crucial, she says. \u201cAbdool Karim was world-renowned at that time [during the Aids pandemic] already, and he was rejected. Now he is chair of the [government\u2019s Covid-19 advisory] committee.\u201d Compassion is vital. When child activist Nkosi Johnson died of Aids-related complications aged 12 in 2001, Mbeki was silent. Now, Malan says, Mkhize offers deep condolences in every statement announcing new Covid-19 deaths. \u201cMkhize and [president Cyril] Ramaphosa will come out of this and it will possibly define their legacy \u2013 very much the opposite to Mbeki and Manto.\u201d",

Ogu, 94, was \u201ceasygoing, kind, always caring\u201d, said Keith Ogu, one of her seven grandchildren. When Beatrice Ogu saw them, she was \u201cfull of joy\u201d.</p> <p>When Beatrice Ogu watched her grandchildren, \u201cshe let us do whatever we wanted. Sometimes it was a good thing, sometimes it wasn\u2019t such a good thing,\u201d he recalled fondly.</p> <p>She came to the US after her son, Ethelbert Ogu, had immigrated and moved in with his growing family. Some of Keith Ogu\u2019s most cherished recollections of her were when she walked him and his siblings to school. \u201cShe was older even back when we were super young\u201d and rested a lot, so their walks together were like a special treat.</p> <p>\u201cIt was just the fact that we got a little bonding time with her,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cShe was definitely a good cook,\u201d he also recalled, saying that she prepared traditional foods including okra and spinach soups and fufu, a staple made of pounded starch such as cassava.</p> <p>In the last couple of years, Beatrice Ogu\u2019s health had deteriorated to the point where she was moved into a nursing home. She could no longer walkand she had diabetes, he said.</p> <p>The last time Keith Ogu and his siblings saw their grandmother was at Christmas.

      "bodyText": "The worst pandemic in a century has claimed victims across the US. Some groups have been particularly vulnerable, with those over 65 making up a large proportion of the fatalities, though all generations have been affected. Three times as many black Americans have died compared with white Americans. Medical workers, grocery store employees and those in other essential jobs have been at increased risk. Here, relatives and friends pay tribute to some of those they have lost. A much-loved grandmother of seven Beatrice Ogu, a homemaker who immigrated to the US from Nigeria in 1990, died last month at a Washington DC nursing home. Ogu, 94, was \u201ceasygoing, kind, always caring\u201d, said Keith Ogu, one of her seven grandchildren. When Beatrice Ogu saw them, she was \u201cfull of joy\u201d. When Beatrice Ogu watched her grandchildren, \u201cshe let us do whatever we wanted. Sometimes it was a good thing, sometimes it wasn\u2019t such a good thing,\u201d he recalled fondly. She came to the US after her son, Ethelbert Ogu, had immigrated and moved in with his growing family. Some of Keith Ogu\u2019s most cherished recollections of her were when she walked him and his siblings to school. \u201cShe was older even back when we were super young\u201d and rested a lot, so their walks together were like a special treat. \u201cIt was just the fact that we got a little bonding time with her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was definitely a good cook,\u201d he also recalled, saying that she prepared traditional foods including okra and spinach soups and fufu, a staple made of pounded starch such as cassava. In the last couple of years, Beatrice Ogu\u2019s health had deteriorated to the point where she was moved into a nursing home. She could no longer walkand she had diabetes, he said. The last time Keith Ogu and his siblings saw their grandmother was at Christmas. She was eating lunch when the family arrived, and they surprised her with gifts in the dining room. When she fell ill, doctors initially said, \u201cit\u2019s just a minor fever\u201d \u2013 not coronavirus. \u201cI had a sense of hope \u2026 that this isn\u2019t going to kill her and that she\u2019d recover from this,\u201d Keith Ogu said. The diagnosis changed several days later. \u201cTo be told it actually was coronavirus, all hope was taken away,\u201d he said. The family have asked for help to pay for her burial and funeral. \u201cI still just can\u2019t believe that someone I\u2019ve known since birth, I won\u2019t ever be able to see again.\u201d \u2013 VB A Brooklyn nurse on the frontline Outside Kings county hospital center in Brooklyn, New York, on a recent Friday night were dozens of healthcare workers, all still dressed in their scrubs, masks and protective gear, clutching white and blue balloons with messages written on them. \u201cWe love you Mama Guia!\u201d they shouted before releasing balloons, cheering as they floated into the sky in a city that has been hit hard by the virus. The group gathered at 8pm, the time Maria Guia Cabillon would have started her typical 12-hour shift at the hospital, to pay tribute to the beloved nurse. Cabillon passed away from complications related to Covid-19 on 26 April at 63. Across the US, dozens of healthcare workers like Cabillon have become victims of Covid-19 after taking care of patients who had the virus. In mid-April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 9,200 healthcare workers had tested positive for Covid-19 and at least 27 had died, though the count is probably much higher. Cabillon was born and raised in Iloilo City, Philippines, eventually moving to New York to become a nurse. She worked at Kings county hospital for over 30 years. Though she stood 5ft tall, Cabillon\u2019s booming voice could be heard throughout the emergency room of Kings county hospital, where she worked on the frontline until she fell ill. She was adored by colleagues throughout the hospital, earning the nickname \u201cMama Guia\u201d for the love and care she showed to her patients and the nurses who worked under her. Colleagues have paid tribute to her life and work, posting pictures and memories of Cabillon. An online fundraiser to help her family bring Cabillon back to the Philippines raised more than $60,000. \u201cYour love for the work you do is evident in everything you\u2019ve done and how much you\u2019ve affected every single life that was to cross your path,\u201d wrote Shane DeGracia, a fellow nurse, on Facebook. \u201cYour death is not in vain. You did what you loved til the very end, which was to take care of others.\u201d \u2013 LA \u2018Irreplaceable in our hearts\u2019 Lukenson Laguerre, described by those who knew him as \u201cone of the sweetest people you can imagine\u201d, died on 12 May. Laguerre, known as \u201cLukey\u201d among those close to him, was 26. Melissa Booker, a speech pathologist at the East Ramapo Central school district in New York who worked with Laguerre, said that his first job was at an after-school homework help center, Excellence in Education and Living Environments for Families (EELEF). Lukenson had once been a student at the center. \u201cHe really just did everything in our office that we needed,\u201d Booker said. \u201cHe had an expertise in understanding the computer and the wizardry that he could just fix anything or create anything or find lost things.\u201d For five years, Laguerre worked as production director on the Rockland Youth film festival, which was put on by EELEF. \u201cHe was the technical support that glued all of the work together,\u201d she said. \u201cWe decided not to do the festival without him,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that we could replace him. He is literally irreplaceable in our hearts in that role.\u201d Laguerre\u2019s most recent job was working as a clerical assistant in East Ramapo Central school district\u2019s special student services division. \u201cHe dedicated his life to helping others,\u201d Booker said. \u201cI loved singing with him. We would sing everything and harmonize perfectly,\u201d said Ruth Laguerre, his younger sister, in a statement emailed to the Guardian by one of his friends. \u201cI just want everyone to remember Luke being happy.\u201d Emmanuela Laguerre, his older sister, said in a statement emailed by one of his friends: \u201cLuke was quiet but if you gave him the chance, he would talk to you about anything \u2026 We know that he is happy and he is probably trying to talk God into putting in some wifi up there in heaven.\u201d Laguerre is also survived by his mother, Claudette Leroy. \u2013 VB \u2018We miss hugging her\u2019 The first thing Roxanna Paisano saw each morning was her daughter Jackie\u2019s smile. The 16-year-old would pinch her mom to wake her up in the morning so they could get ready for school, where she loved to greet bus drivers, classmates and teachers with a big grin. It\u2019s the glowing smile which family, friends and doctors continue to talk about, just over a month after Jackie\u2019s death. The teenager died of Covid-19 complications on 20 April \u2013 a month shy of her 17th birthday. She would usually celebrate her birthday at school, where they would bring a cake and pizza, one of her favorite foods. In the classroom, they would put on music for her and her friends to dance to and used balloons to decorate. \u201cWe miss hugging her,\u201d Paisano said. Jackie lost her ability to walk and talk after experiencing seizures because of a brain tumour starting at 18 months old. She used a talking device to communicate and her mom said the buttons she pressed most were the ones which indicated she was happy. \u201cThey were her favorites, she pushed them all the time,\u201d Paisano said. After Jackie died, the school shared with her family a poem she had composed in class: I am sassy and strong. I dream about doing things with my family. I hope to always be included. I am sassy and strong. I am a person and more than my disability. Her engagement with school was also showcased in a Special Olympics video about her work in a physical activity training program. There have been fewer cases of Covid-19 detected in children and they are dying from Covid-19 at a lower rate than other age groups, but Jackie is one of several children to succumb to the respiratory illness. Health officials have also warned about a mystery inflammatory syndrome related to the virus which resembles the rare childhood illness Kawasaki disease and is tied to the deaths of three children in New York City. \u2013 AH \u2018The river was his domain\u2019 To see Bobby Begay along the Columbia River in northern Oregon was to understand that the river was an extension of Begay himself.

The scheme, which could begin in late July after coronavirus travel restrictions have eased, applies to tourists who make bookings through Japanese travel agencies or directly with hotels and traditional ryokan inns. The programme does not explicitly exclude foreign visitors, but the Japan Travel Agency said in a tweet on Wednesday that it was intended to \u201cstimulate domestic travel demand within Japan after the Covid-19 pandemic and only cover a portion of domestic travel expenses.\u201d The subsidies do not apply to travel expenses for visitors from overseas. Data released this week showed the number of overseas visitors decreased by more than 99% last month to fewer than 3,000 as a result of the pandemic, with domestic travel severely curtailed by the country\u2019s state of emergency. The subsidies, totalling \u00a51.35tn, are expected to form part of a second emergency budget the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, will unveil on Wednesday to help guide the world\u2019s third-biggest economy through the economic crisis triggered by the coronavirus. Tourism was critical to Abe\u2019s growth plans before the pandemic, with the government setting an ambitious annual target of attracting 40 million foreign tourists by the end of this year and 60 million by 2030. Hopes for a tourist-driven spending boom this summer were dashed after the virus\u2019s global spread forced the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics until next year. In addition, entry bans to Japan apply to more than 100 countries, including those, such as China, on which Japan relied for much of its income from tourism. Just 2,900 people visited Japan last month, according to government data, down 99.9% on the same period last year. Some of those restrictions could gradually ease in the coming weeks after Abe lifted the seven-week state of emergency on Monday following a marked fall in new cases of Covid-19 in Japan. Restaurants, which had been asked to close at 8pm, will be able to stay open until 10pm, while museums and some other public spaces will reopen. Official advice to avoid travel between Japan\u2019s 47 prefectures could be relaxed around mid-June. Hotels and other sectors of the economy that depend on tourism have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic. A survey by Tokyo Shoko Research found 31 companies in the accommodation sector had either declared or were preparing to file for bankruptcy in April. Hotels in Kyoto, whose temples and shrines usually attract hordes of foreign tourists at this time of year, said the number of overseas guests in March had decreased 89.5% compared with the same month last year.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning. Donald Trump raged against Twitter \u2013 on Twitter \u2013 on Tuesday, after the social media platform marked the president\u2019s misleading posts with its new \u201cget the facts\u201d label for the first time since introducing the feature this month. Trump had made false statements about the threat of voter fraud posed by the expansion of mail-in voting in California. Twitter, which has long faced criticism for failing to censor the head of state\u2019s most egregious statements, added the new labels after deciding Trump\u2019s tweets violated its new \u201ccivic integrity policy\u201d, which bars users from \u201cmanipulating or interfering in elections\u201d. Trump then repeated his false claims in a further series of tweets, accusing Twitter of \u201cinterfering in the 2020 Presidential Election\u201d and \u201ccompletely stifling FREE SPEECH\u201d. A widower asked Twitter to delete Trump\u2019s \u2018horrifying\u2019 smears about his late wife. But the firm has said it will not take down the tweets, in which the president alludes to debunked claims that Joe Scarborough was involved in the 2001 death of Scarborough\u2019s then congressional aide, Lori Klausutis. Kayleigh McEnany repeatedly ducked questions about the controversy at a White House briefing on Tuesday. The president\u2019s new press secretary is no different from her predecessors, writes David Smith: McEnany has stunned viewers with her evangelical devotion to the US president, her straight-faced defence of his wildest conspiracy theories and her already-wearing-thin stunt of trying to turn the tables on reporters. The Americas are the new epicentre of the pandemic The daily coronavirus infection rate has surged in Brazil and other Latin American countries. According to Carissa Etienne, the World Health Organization\u2019s director for the Americas, it makes the region the latest \u201cepicenter of the Covid-19 pandemic\u201d. A study by the University of Washington predicts the death toll in Brazil could reach 125,000 by early August, while WHO officials have also expressed concern about accelerating outbreaks in Peru, Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua. Venezuela\u2019s official count of just 10 deaths is \u2018not credible\u2019, say activists from Human Rights Watch, calling the statistics released by the Maduro regime \u201cabsolutely absurd\u201d. In Brazil, 157 nurses have died as a result of Covid-19, more than any other country including the US, where at least 146 nurses are known to have died. A cardboard hospital bed that doubles as a coffin could come into use in Colombia, after a team of designers came up with the morbidly pragmatic solution to potential shortages of hospital beds and funerary caskets. Protests followed a police killing in Minneapolis The footage is distressing: a Minneapolis police officer kneels on the neck of 46-year-old George Floyd as he lies in the street, yelling that he cannot breathe. The shocking death of another unarmed black man at the hands of police officers led to clashes between protesters and police in the city on Tuesday, while the FBI and authorities in Minnesota have both launched investigations into the incident. Four officers who were involved in the fatal arrest on Monday have already been fired, while the Minneapolis mayor, Jacob Frey, said on Tuesday that the white officer who knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck for five minutes had \u201cfailed in the most basic human sense\u201d. A viral confrontation between a white dog-walker and a black birdwatcher in New York\u2019s Central Park has ignited a fresh online debate over everyday racism, after the woman was caught on camera saying she would call police \u201cto tell them there\u2019s an African American man threatening my life\u201d. Riot police flooded the streets of Hong Kong again Armed police streamed into the streets of Hong Kong on Wednesday, to suppress widespread protests over a new law that criminalises any mockery of China\u2019s national anthem. Pepper bullets were fired and at least 180 demonstrators arrested during the lunchtime rallies, amid continued anger at Beijing\u2019s increasing interference in the semi-autonomous city\u2019s affairs. McEnany said at a press conference on Tuesday that Trump was \u201cdispleased\u201d by the new national security law being imposed by Beijing, adding it was \u201chard to see how Hong Kong can remain a financial hub if China takes over\u201d. In other news\u2026 The New York stock exchange reopened on Tuesday for the first time since 23 March, with new Covid-19 safety protocols for the small number of traders permitted to return to work in person. The US is letting 10 firms delay paying environmental fines totalling $56m, after granting them a pause during the pandemic. At least two of the polluters in question told the Guardian they had made payments despite the extension. At least 11 local news stations aired segments scripted by Amazon, after the company\u2019s PR team sent out a pre-edited package offering a \u201cglimpse inside\u201d its warehouses and the new safety measures it says it has put in place to protect staff. Yamaha has developed a \u2018remote cheering\u2019 app that will allow Japanese football fans to support their team by cheering into their smartphones, with their voices then reverberating around the empty stadiums in real time, via loudspeakers. Great reads A corner of Minnesota cut off by Canada The Northwest Angle is the northernmost point of the continental US, a tiny, idyllic wedge of Minnesota only accessible via boat \u2013 or via Canada. Porter Fox takes a fishing trip, and explains the quirk of history that created this isolated corner of the US. Will the Biden archive be made public? The University of Delaware is home to 1,875 boxes of \u201cphotographs, documents, videotapes and files\u201d and 415 gigabytes of electronic records that comprise Joe Biden\u2019s archive, spanning his 36 years in the US Senate. Republicans sense rich pickings, but will the collection be made public before the election? David Smith reports. Opinion: It\u2019s not inspiring to see billionaires in space On Wednesday, Elon Musk is helping send Americans back to space on one of his SpaceX rockets. With the world being ravaged by a pandemic, Arwa Mahdawi struggles to find much hope or inspiration in the idea of privatised spaceflight. Seriously, if you think that billionaires are exploring space for the good of humankind then I have a bridge on Mars I can sell you. They are doing it for their ego and the commercial opportunity. Last Thing: What pandemic personality are you? Have you discovered a new you under lockdown? Or has the coronavirus crisis exposed your true character for the first time? Max Benwell breaks down the \u201cpandemic personalities\u201d that have emerged in this unprecedented moment, from smug introverts to radically progressive traditional housewives, or \u201cradwives\u201d for short.

The company settled and agreed to pay $1m in eight installments over four years, but it has not been required to pay its second installment because of the freeze. The company did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>KP Kauffman spent <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/clients/summary?cycle=2019&amp;id=D000035178\">$200,000</a> lobbying the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2019 and the beginning of 2020, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In 2016, the company hosted a meeting between oil industry executives and president Donald Trump, although the company\u2019s CEO Kevin P Kauffman, a major GOP donor, <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2016/10/04/donald-trump-oil-gas-meeting-denver/\">did not attend</a>.</p> <p>Chris Saeger, director of strategic initiatives at Accountable.US, said: \u201cThis is exactly the time to make sure support is flowing to the federal, state and local governments that need a hand with responding to the coronavirus crisis and with the environmental problems that these special interests have caused.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhen we\u2019re facing a public health crisis that causes respiratory problems, this is a time to be holding companies to a higher standard of air quality, not a lower one.\u201d</p> <p>The companies will not be required to pay penalties before 1 June, although they have the option to do so and at least two companies told the Guardian they made payments despite the extension. The EPA would not respond to inquiries about its <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/covid-19-implications-epas-enforcement-and-compliance-assurance-program\">policy</a> and or say which companies paid penalties.</p> <p>The justice department on 14 April sent letters to the affected companies, offering to temporarily suspend collection of the payments, following the EPA\u2019s announcement in March that it would ease some enforcement requirements. The justice department said the suspension was meant to \u201cmitigate the financial impact of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic\u201d.</p> <p>One company, Virginia power provider Dominion Energy, settled and agreed to pay $1.4m for allegedly releasing 27.5m gallons of water from a coal ash impoundment that seeped into groundwater along the shore of the James River. Coal ash contains dangerous pollutants, including mercury, cadmium and arsenic, which can cause widespread environmental damage. The company said it plans to pay the settlement penalty once it is finalized.</p> <p>Dominion has a number of ties to high-ranking Trump officials, including EPA\u2019s former top enforcement official, Patrick Traylor, who had Dominion has a client. Attorney general William Barr has served on the company\u2019s board of directors and received more than $500,000 from Dominion.</p> <p>Another alleged violator, one of the world\u2019s largest steel companies, ArcelorMittal, decided to pay the $5m penalty it agreed to for air quality issues at steel plants in East Chicago, Indiana; Burns Harbor, Indiana; and Cleveland, Ohio, according to a spokesman.</p> <p>ArcelorMittal\u2019s chief executive was at a Trump <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-business-roundtable-new-delhi-india/\">roundtable</a> of business leaders in India in February and also was one of about 20 executives to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jan/21/davos-2020-donald-trump-greta-thunberg-climate-mark-carney-wef-day-one-live?CMP=share_btn_tw&amp;page=with:block-5e2740448f0879d539efc663#block-5e2740448f0879d539efc663\">dine</a> with Trump in Davos at the World Economic Forum in January. Trump\u2019s commerce secretary Wilbur Ross was previously on the company\u2019s board of directors.</p> <p>The oil and gas company BP Products North America said it also paid the $8m penalty it agreed to for alleged air pollution problems at an oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana, on the south-western shore of Lake Michigan.</p> <p>BP was accused of emitting too much particle pollution, which is linked to asthma and heart attacks.

      "bodyText": "Ten corporations that agreed to a total of $56m in civil penalties for allegedly breaking environmental laws are not being required to make payments under a pause granted by the US government during the Covid-19 pandemic. The companies polluted air and water, including in communities already vulnerable to toxic pollution like East Chicago, Indiana, according to legal proceedings. They signed settlements with the government agreeing to pay fines without admitting liability but the justice department last month advised most of the companies of extensions in letters which were obtained by the government watchdog group Accountable.US via public records requests. Denver-based oil and gas company K P Kauffman allegedly violated air pollution laws, emitting volatile organic compounds that form smog in the Denver-Julesburg Basin, an area that wasn\u2019t meeting smog standards. The company settled and agreed to pay $1m in eight installments over four years, but it has not been required to pay its second installment because of the freeze. The company did not respond to requests for comment. KP Kauffman spent $200,000 lobbying the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2019 and the beginning of 2020, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In 2016, the company hosted a meeting between oil industry executives and president Donald Trump, although the company\u2019s CEO Kevin P Kauffman, a major GOP donor, did not attend. Chris Saeger, director of strategic initiatives at Accountable.US, said: \u201cThis is exactly the time to make sure support is flowing to the federal, state and local governments that need a hand with responding to the coronavirus crisis and with the environmental problems that these special interests have caused.\u201d \u201cWhen we\u2019re facing a public health crisis that causes respiratory problems, this is a time to be holding companies to a higher standard of air quality, not a lower one.\u201d The companies will not be required to pay penalties before 1 June, although they have the option to do so and at least two companies told the Guardian they made payments despite the extension. The EPA would not respond to inquiries about its policy and or say which companies paid penalties. The justice department on 14 April sent letters to the affected companies, offering to temporarily suspend collection of the payments, following the EPA\u2019s announcement in March that it would ease some enforcement requirements. The justice department said the suspension was meant to \u201cmitigate the financial impact of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic\u201d. One company, Virginia power provider Dominion Energy, settled and agreed to pay $1.4m for allegedly releasing 27.5m gallons of water from a coal ash impoundment that seeped into groundwater along the shore of the James River. Coal ash contains dangerous pollutants, including mercury, cadmium and arsenic, which can cause widespread environmental damage. The company said it plans to pay the settlement penalty once it is finalized. Dominion has a number of ties to high-ranking Trump officials, including EPA\u2019s former top enforcement official, Patrick Traylor, who had Dominion has a client. Attorney general William Barr has served on the company\u2019s board of directors and received more than $500,000 from Dominion. Another alleged violator, one of the world\u2019s largest steel companies, ArcelorMittal, decided to pay the $5m penalty it agreed to for air quality issues at steel plants in East Chicago, Indiana; Burns Harbor, Indiana; and Cleveland, Ohio, according to a spokesman. ArcelorMittal\u2019s chief executive was at a Trump roundtable of business leaders in India in February and also was one of about 20 executives to dine with Trump in Davos at the World Economic Forum in January. Trump\u2019s commerce secretary Wilbur Ross was previously on the company\u2019s board of directors. The oil and gas company BP Products North America said it also paid the $8m penalty it agreed to for alleged air pollution problems at an oil refinery in Whiting, Indiana, on the south-western shore of Lake Michigan. BP was accused of emitting too much particle pollution, which is linked to asthma and heart attacks. The justice department\u2019s assistant attorney general Brian Benczkowski represented BP in the past. BP employees have given $85,000 to Trump campaign groups. A spokeswoman said BP employees in the US are free to give money to the political campaigns of their choice. This article was amended on 27 May 2020 to correct a name that was misspelled.",

The filter also affects suggested hashtags, meaning users who tried to type #dominiccummings were instead presented with one of the misspelled variations to auto-complete, helping them trend instead.

But what is not often remarked on is how utterly un-American these British musicians sound: listen to their music and you\u2019ll hardly hear<strong> </strong>any swing or bossa nova rhythms, the usual pulse of American jazz. You won\u2019t even hear that much funk, the rhythm that has been the vehicle for most \u201cfusion\u201d over the past 50 years. Instead, a generation of Londoners \u2013 who I spoke to before the coronavirus crisis \u2013 are redefining jazz in a different accent.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/10/history-needs-to-be-set-alight-shabaka-hutchings-on-the-radical-power-of-jazz\">\u2018History needs to be set alight\u2019: Shabaka Hutchings on the power of jazz</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhat sets us apart from American jazz at the moment is that British jazz musicians are having a musical conversation with Africa and the Caribbean,\u201d says tenor saxophonist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/10/history-needs-to-be-set-alight-shabaka-hutchings-on-the-radical-power-of-jazz\">Shabaka Hutchings</a>, whose myriad projects (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/03/the-comet-is-coming-trust-in-life-force-deep-mystery-review\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/03/the-comet-is-coming-trust-in-life-force-deep-mystery-review\">Comet Is Coming</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/28/sons-of-kemet-review-koko-london\">Sons of Kemet</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/28/shabaka-and-the-ancestors-we-are-sent-here-by-history-review\">Shabaka and the Ancestors</a>) have made him a figurehead of the London scene. \u201cDub, dancehall, calypso, soca, Afrobeat, highlife, township jive, nyabinghi \u2013 all put through the filter of rave and house and hip-hop. I don\u2019t hear that so much when I listen to American jazz.\u201d</p> <p>Rhythmically, this cocktail of sounds is not entirely without precedent. Two-tone bands in the early 1980s were experimenting with a similar blend, in particular <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/sep/06/popandrock1\">the Beat</a>\u2019s drummer Everett Morton, who was playing reggae, calypso and Afrobeat in the context of a post-punk band. By the late 80s, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/apr/22/loose-tubes-ride-again-django-bates-jazz\">Django Bates\u2019s big band Loose Tubes</a> were creating a whimsical British jazz that borrowed heavily from South Africa and Brazil, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2000/sep/30/jazz1\">Courtney Pine</a> and the Jazz Warriors were injecting reggae and calypso music into hard bop \u2013 a fusion that would be explored more explicitly with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/27/gary-crosby-godfather-british-jazz-renaissance-bassist-ella-fitzgerald\">Gary Crosby</a>\u2019s Jazz Jamaica big band.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"acb5b7d795bc8df07615d1114901cf66e9368799\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acb5b7d795bc8df07615d1114901cf66e9368799/0_0_3264_4896/667.jpg\" alt=\"Gary Crosby.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An incredible influence ... Gary Crosby.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cGary Crosby has been an incredible influence on a new generation of British jazz musicians,\u201d says Patrick Boyle, drummer with the Mercury-nominated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/14/cassie-kinoshis-seed-ensemble-driftglass-review-jazz\">SEED Ensemble</a> and several other outfits. \u201cHe set up Tomorrow\u2019s Warriors, which has been a breeding ground for dozens of musicians over the last 20 or 30 years. But there are other influences that have fed into the London jazz scene \u2013 one of the things that you didn\u2019t really get in the States is the influence of the South African expatriate community in the 70s.\u201d</p> <p>He adds that for drummers, \u201cyou\u2019re defined by how many styles you can replicate with authenticity. Nowadays, if you want to survive as a jazz drummer in London, you have to check out reggae, soca, calypso and Afrobeat.\u201d</p> <p>Afrobeat has started to play a key role in this blend of rhythms. Many of the current British jazz wave studied at Trinity Laban in south-east London, a music college that was attended by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/may/05/fela-kuti-10-best-songs\">Fela Kuti</a> between 1958 and 1961. Cassie Kinoshi, the alto saxophonist and leader of the SEED Ensemble, was a Trinity student who was disappointed that Fela\u2019s music was not even mentioned on the school\u2019s curriculum.</p> <p>\u201cCassie always made a point of performing Fela\u2019s music at college for big performances,\u201d says Boyle. \u201cBut Fela\u2019s music is something that loads of young British musicians have got into independently. I remember finding his albums in the record library when I was in high school. A few years later I remember going to a Red Bull drumming masterclass with Fela\u2019s drummer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/05/tony-allen-fela-was-right-but-i-detest-singing-militant\">Tony Allen</a>, and loads of other London drummers were there \u2013 including Moses Boyd, Femi Koleoso and Eddie Hick. For all of us, Tony Allen is as important as, say, Max Roach or Tony Williams. Songs such as <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Qj5x6pbJMyU\">Zombie</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bC6ouP7qRoQ\">Colonial Mentality</a> are jazz standards to us.\u201d</p> <p>The multicultural nature of London life has had a very obvious effect on the music made by this generation of musicians. \u201cWe\u2019ve all grown up in London, and these rhythms have just seeped into us,\u201d says tenor saxophonist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/10/nubya-garcia-one-to-watch-saxophone\">Nubya Garcia</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s happened from listening to our parents\u2019 records, or from going to Carnival, or to dub nights, but it can also be the sounds you hear when you\u2019re walking past a car, or in a local shop, or listening to what kids on the bus are playing on their phones.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s tempting to see the family backgrounds of many of these musicians as crucial to the development of this music. Garcia\u2019s parents come from Guyana and Trinidad; <a href=\"http://www.cassiekinoshi.com/\">Cassie Kinoshi</a> has Nigerian, Sierra Leonean and Caribbean ancestry; drummer Femi Koleoso comes from a Nigerian family; tuba player <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/theon-cross-london-jazz-tuba-fyah-804801/\">Theon Cross</a>\u2019s parents come from Jamaica and St Lucia; Shabaka Hutchings spent much of his childhood in Barbados; Binker Golding\u2019s mother comes from Grenada. But it\u2019s not just heritage that is influencing this music.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3a0118a678a7d76a40c3f052e7b70b5868a3e97c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3a0118a678a7d76a40c3f052e7b70b5868a3e97c/0_527_1961_2198/892.jpg\" alt=\"Emma-Jean Thackray.\" width=\"892\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018London is a place where people can flourish\u2019 ...

And, since moving to London, you start to hear so much music from all over the world \u2013 this is a place where people are allowed to flourish and share their music with everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Guitarist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/28/nardeydey-shirley-tetteh-i-was-so-into-jazz-i-thought-everything-else-was-trash\">Shirley Tetteh</a>, who plays with Nubya Garcia in the septet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/27/nerija-review-oslo-london\">N</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/27/nerija-review-oslo-london\">\u00e9rija</a>, is reluctant to draw direct connections between her heritage and the music she makes. \u201cA lot of people will make a connection between my guitar style and Ghanaian highlife, assuming this comes from my Ghanaian family,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd there is possibly is some subliminal influence. But I\u2019m very careful when talking about this. People stop seeing you as a musician and see you just as a Ghanaian. And I don\u2019t want to insult people who spend a lot of time mastering Ghanaian music. For me, it\u2019s about getting into very specific genres with respect, be it the funeral music of northern Ghana, or Jamaican nyabinghi music, or Malian kora music. I know that there are jazz drummers on the scene who are really into drill music, for instance. These are all serious genres that have a complex history.\u201d</p> <p>This palimpsest of Caribbean and African rhythms can have a curious effect on jazz audiences. Older jazz crowds \u2013 who miss the reassuring pulse of swing, bossa or funk beats \u2013 will often be baffled when they hear musicians soloing over these lopsided polyrhythms. But for a generation who have grown up with Latin-derived pop genres such as reggaeton, this music is very dancefloor friendly \u2013 frustratingly so, if you\u2019re now listening to it in lockdown. You see young audiences responding to that dominant 3/3/2 bounce \u2013 an eight-beat phrase that emphasises the first, fourth and seventh beats, the same rhythmic pulse common to big recent hits such as <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kJQP7kiw5Fk\">Despacito</a> or <a href=\"https://youtu.be/JGwWNGJdvx8\">Shape of You</a>.</p> <p>Clearly, such rhythms have also altered the way in which jazz musicians improvise and compose. \u201cWhen you\u2019re playing over certain Afrobeat rhythms, for instance, you tend to play in a more staccato style,\u201d says Shabaka Hutchings. In Sons of Kemet, he says, he tends not to play \u201cthe kind of flowing, narrative lines\u201d used in the classic US mid-century bebop style. \u201cI\u2019ll be playing free, or drawing from the chant-like qualities of nyabinghi music. I tend to improvise in different ways in all of the different line-ups I lead. With Shabaka and the Ancestors, I\u2019m working in the vocabulary of South African music, which is quite vocal-derived. But, in the Comet Is Coming, I\u2019m playing over electronic rhythms, which force me to play at a high intensity. It also forces you to embed yourself within the rhythms but also fight against them, moving between sustained lines and very rhythmic playing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bc35a8153bd83ae1b141c472cf80f28fe569f1f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc35a8153bd83ae1b141c472cf80f28fe569f1f2/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shabaka and the Ancestors.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Embedded in rhythms and fighting against them ...

For instance, if you\u2019re playing over a dancehall beat, the horn parts are often dependent on the lyrical nature of dancehall. You\u2019re playing like a dancehall vocalist, a style that\u2019s marked by repetition and interlocking rhythms \u2013 it\u2019s almost as if the sax is part of the drum kit. And that\u2019s not part of American jazz at all. But it\u2019s part of the London scene, via the Caribbean.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>American jazz still thinks that blending hip-hop with jazz is something quite radical. In London, that\u2019s taken as read</p> <footer> <cite>Emma-Jean Thackray</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Thackray also draws distinctions between US and UK jazz. \u201cAmerican jazz still thinks that blending hip-hop with jazz is something quite radical. Here, in London, that\u2019s taken as read. I\u2019ve always been influenced by the way in which, say, MF Doom constructs his phrases, using his rhythmic intonation to inform my own solos. A lot of British jazz musicians do this \u2013 it\u2019s part of our musical DNA, just as reggae and Afrobeat is. Americans struggle with that.\u201d She remembers how she played with an American drummer in New York after her UK drummer couldn\u2019t make the trip. \u201cHe was very good, and it sounded fine in the end, but it was very different \u2013 he couldn\u2019t really get that Caribbean two-step thing that I wanted.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say that this is music that has no American ancestry. \u201cThe irony is that dozens of these players came through the Trinity Laban jazz course, which was very bebop orientated,\u201d says Thackray. \u201cThat grounding remains strong.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you listen to any of us practise, you\u2019ll hear a hell of a lot of bebop,\u201d says Garcia. \u201cThat\u2019s what you might hear when I\u2019m jamming with other members of N\u00e9rija. I can certainly play bebop over swing rhythms if I choose \u2013 it\u2019s just that I make a conscious decision not to do so on stage.\u201d</p> <p>Golding concurs, insisting that his duets with Boyd are directly inspired by classic duets between John Coltrane and Rashied Ali, Dewey Redman and Ed Blackwell, and Pharoah Sanders and Max Roach \u2013 even if the swing elements have been removed. Boyle acknowledges dozens of key American influences \u2013 not least a 1958 Ahmad Jamal track called Poinciana, where drummer Vernel Fournier seems to be subtly melding New Orleans and Caribbean influences. \u201cIt shows you that you can see glimmers of what we\u2019re now doing throughout jazz history,\u201d says Boyle.</p> <p>American jazz traditions have also remained at the heart of the Tomorrow\u2019s Warriors weekend schools that so many of these musicians attended. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Warriors had an approach to jazz that I really loved,\u201d says Tetteh. \u201cThey didn\u2019t divorce it from its American history, from notions of slavery and segregation. People such as Gary Crosby made it clear that jazz is very much an aural tradition, one that\u2019s not just taught academically, but something that is experienced and absorbed. The community aspect is hugely important.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a050b89f6014f60a511d54060a30de7d064e09b7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a050b89f6014f60a511d54060a30de7d064e09b7/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Theon Cross.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bringing New Orleans to London ... Theon Cross.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fabrice Bourgelle</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Curiously, the one explicitly American area of music being explored by many British jazz musicians at the moment is the century-old traditional music of New Orleans \u2013 not least its marching-band tuba. Ben Kelly, <a href=\"http://orenmarshall.com/\">Oren Marshall</a>, Theon Cross: all have managed to make this seemingly antiquated instrument work in a modern context. \u201cTheon\u2019s music makes perfect sense when you listen to a lot of electronic music,\u201d says Boyle, who is currently touring in Cross\u2019s band. \u201cYou listen to grime, drill, trap, bounce \u2013 a lot of the basslines and sub-bass frequencies make perfect sense when played on a tuba. It becomes this thread linking ancient and modern.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTheon knows his traditional New Orleans jazz history back to front,\u201d says Golding, who taught Cross in Tomorrow\u2019s Warriors. \u201cHe can play you every tuba solo on every old Louis Armstrong 78 [rpm record]; he knows his New Orleans dirges. And it\u2019s the same with musicians such as Moses and Nubya and Shabaka. They\u2019re heading into the future, but they all know their history and they know how to use jazz as a key to unlock and interpret dozens of other forms of music. I\u2019m now teaching a generation of musicians who want to be the new Shabaka or Nubya, and I have to explain that if you want to play like them, you\u2019ve got to understand your history!\u201d </p> <p>What\u2019s exciting is that with their cosmopolitan vision of jazz, this London generation are not just understanding history \u2013 they\u2019re making it.</p>",

But what is not often remarked on is how utterly un-American these British musicians sound: listen to their music and you\u2019ll hardly hear any swing or bossa nova rhythms, the usual pulse of American jazz. You won\u2019t even hear that much funk, the rhythm that has been the vehicle for most \u201cfusion\u201d over the past 50 years. Instead, a generation of Londoners \u2013 who I spoke to before the coronavirus crisis \u2013 are redefining jazz in a different accent. \u201cWhat sets us apart from American jazz at the moment is that British jazz musicians are having a musical conversation with Africa and the Caribbean,\u201d says tenor saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings, whose myriad projects (the Comet Is Coming, Sons of Kemet, Shabaka and the Ancestors) have made him a figurehead of the London scene. \u201cDub, dancehall, calypso, soca, Afrobeat, highlife, township jive, nyabinghi \u2013 all put through the filter of rave and house and hip-hop. I don\u2019t hear that so much when I listen to American jazz.\u201d Rhythmically, this cocktail of sounds is not entirely without precedent. Two-tone bands in the early 1980s were experimenting with a similar blend, in particular the Beat\u2019s drummer Everett Morton, who was playing reggae, calypso and Afrobeat in the context of a post-punk band. By the late 80s, Django Bates\u2019s big band Loose Tubes were creating a whimsical British jazz that borrowed heavily from South Africa and Brazil, while Courtney Pine and the Jazz Warriors were injecting reggae and calypso music into hard bop \u2013 a fusion that would be explored more explicitly with Gary Crosby\u2019s Jazz Jamaica big band. \u201cGary Crosby has been an incredible influence on a new generation of British jazz musicians,\u201d says Patrick Boyle, drummer with the Mercury-nominated SEED Ensemble and several other outfits. \u201cHe set up Tomorrow\u2019s Warriors, which has been a breeding ground for dozens of musicians over the last 20 or 30 years. But there are other influences that have fed into the London jazz scene \u2013 one of the things that you didn\u2019t really get in the States is the influence of the South African expatriate community in the 70s.\u201d He adds that for drummers, \u201cyou\u2019re defined by how many styles you can replicate with authenticity. Nowadays, if you want to survive as a jazz drummer in London, you have to check out reggae, soca, calypso and Afrobeat.\u201d Afrobeat has started to play a key role in this blend of rhythms. Many of the current British jazz wave studied at Trinity Laban in south-east London, a music college that was attended by Fela Kuti between 1958 and 1961. Cassie Kinoshi, the alto saxophonist and leader of the SEED Ensemble, was a Trinity student who was disappointed that Fela\u2019s music was not even mentioned on the school\u2019s curriculum. \u201cCassie always made a point of performing Fela\u2019s music at college for big performances,\u201d says Boyle. \u201cBut Fela\u2019s music is something that loads of young British musicians have got into independently. I remember finding his albums in the record library when I was in high school. A few years later I remember going to a Red Bull drumming masterclass with Fela\u2019s drummer Tony Allen, and loads of other London drummers were there \u2013 including Moses Boyd, Femi Koleoso and Eddie Hick. For all of us, Tony Allen is as important as, say, Max Roach or Tony Williams. Songs such as Zombie and Colonial Mentality are jazz standards to us.\u201d The multicultural nature of London life has had a very obvious effect on the music made by this generation of musicians. \u201cWe\u2019ve all grown up in London, and these rhythms have just seeped into us,\u201d says tenor saxophonist Nubya Garcia. \u201cIt\u2019s happened from listening to our parents\u2019 records, or from going to Carnival, or to dub nights, but it can also be the sounds you hear when you\u2019re walking past a car, or in a local shop, or listening to what kids on the bus are playing on their phones.\u201d It\u2019s tempting to see the family backgrounds of many of these musicians as crucial to the development of this music. Garcia\u2019s parents come from Guyana and Trinidad; Cassie Kinoshi has Nigerian, Sierra Leonean and Caribbean ancestry; drummer Femi Koleoso comes from a Nigerian family; tuba player Theon Cross\u2019s parents come from Jamaica and St Lucia; Shabaka Hutchings spent much of his childhood in Barbados; Binker Golding\u2019s mother comes from Grenada. But it\u2019s not just heritage that is influencing this music. Patrick Boyle, for instance, comes from an Irish and Czech background, while trumpeter Emma-Jean Thackray \u2013 who released new single Brand New last month \u2013 grew up in an almost completely white village in rural Yorkshire and got into Afrobeat via Talking Heads. \u201cIn my naivety I assumed that David Byrne had invented this music!\u201d she says. \u201cBut it was through that album that I started exploring Fela and Ghanaian highlife and other African music. And, since moving to London, you start to hear so much music from all over the world \u2013 this is a place where people are allowed to flourish and share their music with everyone.\u201d Guitarist Shirley Tetteh, who plays with Nubya Garcia in the septet N\u00e9rija, is reluctant to draw direct connections between her heritage and the music she makes. \u201cA lot of people will make a connection between my guitar style and Ghanaian highlife, assuming this comes from my Ghanaian family,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd there is possibly is some subliminal influence. But I\u2019m very careful when talking about this. People stop seeing you as a musician and see you just as a Ghanaian. And I don\u2019t want to insult people who spend a lot of time mastering Ghanaian music. For me, it\u2019s about getting into very specific genres with respect, be it the funeral music of northern Ghana, or Jamaican nyabinghi music, or Malian kora music. I know that there are jazz drummers on the scene who are really into drill music, for instance. These are all serious genres that have a complex history.\u201d This palimpsest of Caribbean and African rhythms can have a curious effect on jazz audiences. Older jazz crowds \u2013 who miss the reassuring pulse of swing, bossa or funk beats \u2013 will often be baffled when they hear musicians soloing over these lopsided polyrhythms. But for a generation who have grown up with Latin-derived pop genres such as reggaeton, this music is very dancefloor friendly \u2013 frustratingly so, if you\u2019re now listening to it in lockdown. You see young audiences responding to that dominant 3/3/2 bounce \u2013 an eight-beat phrase that emphasises the first, fourth and seventh beats, the same rhythmic pulse common to big recent hits such as Despacito or Shape of You. Clearly, such rhythms have also altered the way in which jazz musicians improvise and compose. \u201cWhen you\u2019re playing over certain Afrobeat rhythms, for instance, you tend to play in a more staccato style,\u201d says Shabaka Hutchings. In Sons of Kemet, he says, he tends not to play \u201cthe kind of flowing, narrative lines\u201d used in the classic US mid-century bebop style. \u201cI\u2019ll be playing free, or drawing from the chant-like qualities of nyabinghi music. I tend to improvise in different ways in all of the different line-ups I lead. With Shabaka and the Ancestors, I\u2019m working in the vocabulary of South African music, which is quite vocal-derived. But, in the Comet Is Coming, I\u2019m playing over electronic rhythms, which force me to play at a high intensity. It also forces you to embed yourself within the rhythms but also fight against them, moving between sustained lines and very rhythmic playing.\u201d Binker Golding, a tenor saxophonist who plays with drummer Moses Boyd in the duo Binker and Moses, has also taught many of these musicians as a tutor with Tomorrow\u2019s Warriors. \u201cEven if you\u2019re a surrealist at heart, as I am, there are rules,\u201d he says. \u201cYou might be playing something interesting, but if it\u2019s not in the correct context, it\u2019s garbage! For instance, if you\u2019re playing over a dancehall beat, the horn parts are often dependent on the lyrical nature of dancehall. You\u2019re playing like a dancehall vocalist, a style that\u2019s marked by repetition and interlocking rhythms \u2013 it\u2019s almost as if the sax is part of the drum kit. And that\u2019s not part of American jazz at all. But it\u2019s part of the London scene, via the Caribbean.\u201d Thackray also draws distinctions between US and UK jazz. \u201cAmerican jazz still thinks that blending hip-hop with jazz is something quite radical. Here, in London, that\u2019s taken as read. I\u2019ve always been influenced by the way in which, say, MF Doom constructs his phrases, using his rhythmic intonation to inform my own solos. A lot of British jazz musicians do this \u2013 it\u2019s part of our musical DNA, just as reggae and Afrobeat is. Americans struggle with that.\u201d She remembers how she played with an American drummer in New York after her UK drummer couldn\u2019t make the trip. \u201cHe was very good, and it sounded fine in the end, but it was very different \u2013 he couldn\u2019t really get that Caribbean two-step thing that I wanted.\u201d That\u2019s not to say that this is music that has no American ancestry. \u201cThe irony is that dozens of these players came through the Trinity Laban jazz course, which was very bebop orientated,\u201d says Thackray. \u201cThat grounding remains strong.\u201d \u201cIf you listen to any of us practise, you\u2019ll hear a hell of a lot of bebop,\u201d says Garcia. \u201cThat\u2019s what you might hear when I\u2019m jamming with other members of N\u00e9rija. I can certainly play bebop over swing rhythms if I choose \u2013 it\u2019s just that I make a conscious decision not to do so on stage.\u201d Golding concurs, insisting that his duets with Boyd are directly inspired by classic duets between John Coltrane and Rashied Ali, Dewey Redman and Ed Blackwell, and Pharoah Sanders and Max Roach \u2013 even if the swing elements have been removed. Boyle acknowledges dozens of key American influences \u2013 not least a 1958 Ahmad Jamal track called Poinciana, where drummer Vernel Fournier seems to be subtly melding New Orleans and Caribbean influences. \u201cIt shows you that you can see glimmers of what we\u2019re now doing throughout jazz history,\u201d says Boyle. American jazz traditions have also remained at the heart of the Tomorrow\u2019s Warriors weekend schools that so many of these musicians attended. \u201cTomorrow\u2019s Warriors had an approach to jazz that I really loved,\u201d says Tetteh. \u201cThey didn\u2019t divorce it from its American history, from notions of slavery and segregation. People such as Gary Crosby made it clear that jazz is very much an aural tradition, one that\u2019s not just taught academically, but something that is experienced and absorbed. The community aspect is hugely important.\u201d Curiously, the one explicitly American area of music being explored by many British jazz musicians at the moment is the century-old traditional music of New Orleans \u2013 not least its marching-band tuba. Ben Kelly, Oren Marshall, Theon Cross: all have managed to make this seemingly antiquated instrument work in a modern context. \u201cTheon\u2019s music makes perfect sense when you listen to a lot of electronic music,\u201d says Boyle, who is currently touring in Cross\u2019s band. \u201cYou listen to grime, drill, trap, bounce \u2013 a lot of the basslines and sub-bass frequencies make perfect sense when played on a tuba. It becomes this thread linking ancient and modern.\u201d \u201cTheon knows his traditional New Orleans jazz history back to front,\u201d says Golding, who taught Cross in Tomorrow\u2019s Warriors. \u201cHe can play you every tuba solo on every old Louis Armstrong 78 [rpm record]; he knows his New Orleans dirges. And it\u2019s the same with musicians such as Moses and Nubya and Shabaka. They\u2019re heading into the future, but they all know their history and they know how to use jazz as a key to unlock and interpret dozens of other forms of music. I\u2019m now teaching a generation of musicians who want to be the new Shabaka or Nubya, and I have to explain that if you want to play like them, you\u2019ve got to understand your history!\u201d What\u2019s exciting is that with their cosmopolitan vision of jazz, this London generation are not just understanding history \u2013 they\u2019re making it.",

A report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the UCL institute of education also says mothers in England are more likely than fathers to have lost their jobs during lockdown, increasing fears that the coronavirus crisis has exacerbated inequality and could lead to the gender pay gap increasing. The Office for National Statistics said separately that men were doing more than an hour less unpaid labour than women each day, despite increasing their responsibilities during lockdown. The IFS-UCL study interviewed 3,500 families of two opposite-gender parents and found that mothers were doing more childcare and more housework than fathers. The mothers interviewed were looking after children for an average of 10.3 hours a day \u2013 2.3 hours more than fathers \u2013 and doing housework for 1.7 more hours than fathers. In families where the father had stopped work while his partner continued, on average they did the same amount of household work \u2013 while the woman did an average of five hours of paid work a day.

      "body": "<p>If only Boris Johnson had acted as swiftly and forcefully on the pandemic as he has to save Dominic Cummings. No 10 has thrown everything into defending one man, while it has failed to protect 66 million other Britons.</p> <p>Over February and early March, Johnson was scarcely to be seen, even as the coronavirus crept into the UK through our airports, our workplaces, our pubs and gyms. But in the past few days he has put himself front and centre, displaying a speed and decisiveness that contrasts shamefully with his previous lethal complacency.</p> <p>Describing how the government was plunged into chaos over Covid-19, one senior adviser to No 10 <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-boris-johnson-cobra-meetings-uk-response-a9472631.html\">recently told the Sunday Times</a>: \u201cThere\u2019s no way you\u2019re at war if your PM isn\u2019t there.\u201d Well, 60,000 dead bodies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/uk-coronavirus-deaths-weekly-covid-19\">later</a>, the prime minister is here and he is at war. Except, he is not out to save our lives, but to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/26/dominic-cummings-boris-johnson-terrified-sack-him\">spare the career of his employee</a>.</p> <p>The part-time prime minister is now doing overtime. The shiny-eyed boyfriend who devoted weekends to country breaks with his fiancee as the virus took hold, spent last Sunday in a Downing Street bunker with his aide finessing alibis.</p> <p>However great the rage vented at Cummings, his actual sins are not so rare \u00ad\u2013 just ask <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-adviser-prof-neil-ferguson-resigns-after-breaking-lockdown-rules\">Neil Ferguson</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/05/scotland-chief-medical-officer-seen-flouting-lockdown-advice-catherine-calderwood\">Catherine Calderwood</a>, who also broke the lockdown rules they helped author. But whereas those government scientific advisers made their apologies and left, what\u2019s been extraordinary this week is the way in which the institutions of the British state have been mobilised to defend one man.</p> <p>Nobody elected Cummings. He boasts no policymaking expertise and bears no inherent authority, bar that lent to him by his friend the prime minister. Yet to&nbsp;keep him in post, cabinet ministers have been used as sockpuppets, tweeting the same ridiculous excuses for his behaviour.<br><br>\u201cEntirely right,\u201d declared health secretary <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthancock/status/1264162359733555202\">Matt Hancock</a> who, somewhere on the Cummings itinerary between Durham and Barnard Castle, had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbcnews/status/1246109819234328582?lang=en-gb\">instructed us</a> it was entirely wrong for infected people to leave the house. The attorney general of England, Suella Braverman, whose job is to provide independent legal advice, rushed to declare possibly illegal behaviour above board. Over the weekend Downing Street desperately tried to kill off the story. Then finally, the day after a disastrous public briefing by Boris Johnson, a mere adviser was granted the kind of press conference, in the No 10 rose garden, normally given for world leaders or for major national occasions \u00ad\u2013 once the stage set for Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, for Nick Clegg and David Cameron.</p> <p>For the sake of one father of one four-year-old, the public health guidelines have been binned and, as one of the government\u2019s scientific advisers has said, the credibility of both the advice and those giving it has been \u201ctrashed\u201d.</p> <p>Clutching at terms for this spectacle, many have called it \u201chypocrisy\u201d. If only. At least that\u2019s a familiar vice.&nbsp;Hypocrisy in politics? We\u2019ve all seen that box set.&nbsp;But in truth, this is its opposite \u00ad\u2013 an ugly display of naked honesty by both Cummings and Johnson about who really matters in Britain today. Namely: them. Not us, the Little People who have to follow the rules; nor the health of a democracy that relies on everyone respecting norms and procedures.</p> <p>In that revelation lies so much of the huge public disquiet. The government has displayed immense force in trying to rescue Cummings, while showing just how corrupt it is, by ripping up rules to accommodate one associate of the prime minister. The hard-right groupuscule running Britain has exposed how rotten the country has become.<br><br>Just why the prime minister has lashed himself to his ideas guy is a question best left to biographers. For now, let us observe that, while Cummings has broken the rules, Johnson is bending the machinery of state to his defence, pronouncing:&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/l%27%C3%A9tat%2C%20c%27est%20moi\">L\u2019etat, c\u2019est Dom et moi</a></em>.

      "bodyText": "If only Boris Johnson had acted as swiftly and forcefully on the pandemic as he has to save Dominic Cummings. No 10 has thrown everything into defending one man, while it has failed to protect 66 million other Britons. Over February and early March, Johnson was scarcely to be seen, even as the coronavirus crept into the UK through our airports, our workplaces, our pubs and gyms. But in the past few days he has put himself front and centre, displaying a speed and decisiveness that contrasts shamefully with his previous lethal complacency. Describing how the government was plunged into chaos over Covid-19, one senior adviser to No 10 recently told the Sunday Times: \u201cThere\u2019s no way you\u2019re at war if your PM isn\u2019t there.\u201d Well, 60,000 dead bodies later, the prime minister is here and he is at war. Except, he is not out to save our lives, but to spare the career of his employee. The part-time prime minister is now doing overtime. The shiny-eyed boyfriend who devoted weekends to country breaks with his fiancee as the virus took hold, spent last Sunday in a Downing Street bunker with his aide finessing alibis. However great the rage vented at Cummings, his actual sins are not so rare \u2013 just ask Neil Ferguson or Catherine Calderwood, who also broke the lockdown rules they helped author. But whereas those government scientific advisers made their apologies and left, what\u2019s been extraordinary this week is the way in which the institutions of the British state have been mobilised to defend one man. Nobody elected Cummings. He boasts no policymaking expertise and bears no inherent authority, bar that lent to him by his friend the prime minister. Yet to keep him in post, cabinet ministers have been used as sockpuppets, tweeting the same ridiculous excuses for his behaviour. \u201cEntirely right,\u201d declared health secretary Matt Hancock who, somewhere on the Cummings itinerary between Durham and Barnard Castle, had instructed us it was entirely wrong for infected people to leave the house. The attorney general of England, Suella Braverman, whose job is to provide independent legal advice, rushed to declare possibly illegal behaviour above board. Over the weekend Downing Street desperately tried to kill off the story. Then finally, the day after a disastrous public briefing by Boris Johnson, a mere adviser was granted the kind of press conference, in the No 10 rose garden, normally given for world leaders or for major national occasions \u2013 once the stage set for Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, for Nick Clegg and David Cameron. For the sake of one father of one four-year-old, the public health guidelines have been binned and, as one of the government\u2019s scientific advisers has said, the credibility of both the advice and those giving it has been \u201ctrashed\u201d. Clutching at terms for this spectacle, many have called it \u201chypocrisy\u201d. If only. At least that\u2019s a familiar vice. Hypocrisy in politics? We\u2019ve all seen that box set. But in truth, this is its opposite \u2013 an ugly display of naked honesty by both Cummings and Johnson about who really matters in Britain today. Namely: them. Not us, the Little People who have to follow the rules; nor the health of a democracy that relies on everyone respecting norms and procedures. In that revelation lies so much of the huge public disquiet. The government has displayed immense force in trying to rescue Cummings, while showing just how corrupt it is, by ripping up rules to accommodate one associate of the prime minister. The hard-right groupuscule running Britain has exposed how rotten the country has become. Just why the prime minister has lashed himself to his ideas guy is a question best left to biographers. For now, let us observe that, while Cummings has broken the rules, Johnson is bending the machinery of state to his defence, pronouncing: L\u2019etat, c\u2019est Dom et moi. As Danny Kruger wrote to his fellow Conservative MPs last night, \u201cAppreciate the inbox and press are horrific but the PM is signalling that he\u2019s serious \u2026 calling for [Cummings] to go is basically declaring no confidence in [the] PM.\u201d You can always judge a man\u2019s priorities by his diary, and this prime minister skipped five Cobra meetings on the coronavirus crisis on the trot, even while finding time to attend a giant fundraising ball for the Conservative party. Johnson\u2019s coterie will go to war for Cummings, yet they couldn\u2019t equip doctors and nurses with essential masks and gowns. The result is that 200 healthcare workers have so far died of Covid-19. Although the UK has a GDP per head of nearly \u00a335,000, it still can\u2019t run a test-and-trace regime to touch that of Vietnam (GDP per head, \u00a32,000). When you run one of the richest countries in the world, inaction is as much a choice as action. The prime minister who has thrown a protective ring around Cummings also let thousands of residents of care homes die for want of testing. While Johnson this week commended his aide\u2019s fatherly instincts, he said nothing about the fathers and mothers and grandparents who have died needlessly over the past two months, many without a hand to hold in their final hours. The scandal that today rightly roars around Cummings and Johnson is nothing compared with their gigantic failure on Covid-19. Both men must know that their real reckoning is still to come. Those Westminster bubble descriptions of two \u201cpolitical geniuses\u201d leave out what a mess they\u2019ve made in government, on everything from suspending parliament to Brexit deals. Get past the 20,000-word blog posts and the three-word slogans \u2013 Take Back Control, Get Brexit Done \u2013 and all they have is a talent for self-preservation and media manipulation. It gets them into power, but leaves them no clue what to do with it. So the endless jokes about driving to Barnard Castle for an eye test distract from the government\u2019s multiple failures on sourcing protective equipment for key workers, which in turn overshadows the double-counting of coronavirus tests, which in turn hides the complete failure of the testing regime, which in turn obscures the awful and disgraceful reality that the UK is second only to the US in its total number of Covid-19 deaths. Soon will come a point when the memes peter out and the media scrum disperses. What will be left is a historic economic depression and a public realisation that far more people have died in this pandemic than in the blitz, thanks to an administration that could barely bring itself to care for anyone beyond its own senior members. Stay at Home? That was just for us; for them it meant Stay Where You Like. Protect the NHS? Protect Yourselves. Save Lives? Save Dom. \u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "The Daily Star has printed a cut-out-and-keep Dominic Cummings mask on its front page with a pledge that it will allow the wearer to \u201cdo whatever the hell you want\u201d, as part of the tabloid\u2019s idiosyncratic response to the scandal involving the prime minister\u2019s chief aide. The Star \u2013 which tends to avoid politics stories and last year proudly declared itself a Brexit-free newspaper \u2013 told readers: \u201cCan\u2019t be arsed to stick to the rules like the rest of us? Simply wear this handy Dom face covering and you\u2019ll get away with murder.\u201d The newspaper also included a \u201cThought for the day\u201d bubble that reads \u201cimagine having to defend this bloke on TV with a straight face\u201d after further questions about the aide\u2019s decision to undertake a 60-mile round trip from Durham to Barnard Castle to test his eyesight was good enough to drive. The front page also included a picture of the singer Stevie Wonder commenting on the story, which was justified by the line: \u201cPolice have warned people not to copy PM\u2019s aide Dominic Cummings by driving to check your eyesight, especially if you have vision problems like singer Stevie Wonder.\u201d Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to back Cummings in the face of a media onslaught can be seen as a test of the power of newspapers to set the agenda. The Daily Mail issued a front-page call for the aide to be sacked, a move that would have been career-ending in the past but which Boris Johnson has felt able to ignore, despite his plummeting personal ratings during the crisis. The Daily Star front page was shared widely on social media and will also benefit from being displayed prominently near checkouts in supermarkets and shops across the UK. Sales of the newspaper have been hit hard during the pandemic, dipping by a quarter to an average of 219,275 copies a day. In recent months, the Star \u2013 which is owned by the same company as the Daily Mirror and Daily Express \u2013 has increasingly indulged in many of the classic tropes of British tabloid reporting, with front-page stories about giant lobsters, gull attacks and rat infestations. Last year, it became the last tabloid to drop the Page 3 girl feature, although some staff privately expressed sadness that it took several days before reporters at rival outlets noticed they had done so. It recently declared itself to be the favourite newspaper of Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, after the duo failed \u2013 or forgot \u2013 to include the outlet on their list of British tabloids they would no longer speak to.",

The development comes amid heightened concerns about the spread of coronavirus among NHS workers after the trust governing Weston general hospital in Somerset said there was \u201can emerging picture\u201d of staff with no symptoms testing positive. Authorities at the hospital in Weston-super-Mare faced calls on Wednesday to respond to a claim \u2013 based on what a local media report said was a message from a staff member to colleagues \u2013 that as many as 40% of those who have been tested were found to have the virus. A spokesperson for University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS foundation trust later told the Guardian: \u201cThis was 40% of a limited group of staff who worked with Covid-19 positive patients.\u201d All staff were now being tested at the hospital, which stopped taking admissions, including into its A&amp;E department, from 8am on Monday \u201cto maintain patient and staff safety\u201d as a result of a high number of infections.

Concerns were expressed by staff about why testing had not been being rolled out for everyone at the hospital rather than just for those with patient contact. There were accounts of some being told that they could not have tests, even though cafe workers and scaffolders were spotted in a queue to be swabbed. Amarante Dias, an endoscopy decontamination technician at the hospital, died from Covid-19 on 13 April. Members of the public were being told on Wednesday that it was unclear if the hospital\u2019s A&amp;E would remain closed on Thursday.

Furthermore, we are acutely aware of perhaps an even greater impact, socially, educationally and economically, BAME communities could face as we confront <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/recession-depression-data-coronavirus\">an unprecedented economic downturn.</a></p> <p>\u201cOur demand is for a Covid-19 race equality strategy that will not only deal with the immediacy of saving lives, but also fundamentally rebuild many of our institutions that this disease has exposed as having huge racial disparities.\u201d</p> <p>Black people are more than four times <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/black-people-four-times-more-likely-to-die-from-covid-19-ons-finds\">more likely to die of Covid-19</a> than the white British population, according to analysis by the Office for National Statistics. People of Bangladeshi and Pakistani, Indian, and mixed ethnicities were also found to have raised mortality risk relative to white people.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/inquiry-disproportionate-impact-coronavirus-bame\">A Public Health England (PHE) review</a> into how different factors \u2013 including ethnicity, gender and obesity \u2013 can affect people\u2019s health outcomes from coronavirus is due to be published this week. But the signatories to the demand for a race equality strategy say that a wider-ranging review is needed in order to \u201cbuild something positive and long-lasting from this deadly Covid-19 crisis\u201d amid fears of a deep recession.</p> <p>Lord Woolley, who is chair of the government race disparity unit\u2019s advisory group, said he had had conversations with No 10 about such a review being instigated across Whitehall.</p> <p>\u201cIt gives us a unique opportunity to tackle those deep-seated inequalities, which existed even before Covid-19, that could get very much worse, without dramatic action, without radical action,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBig examples of that would be the prospect of high levels of unemployment, which for young black kids could go to 50, 60, 70%. The inequality in health that we\u2019ve already seen could get very much worse if those poverty predictions kick in. Educationally, unless there\u2019s dramatic action, those kids that are already behind could fall so far behind that a generation of young kids could be failed.\u201d</p> <p>Woolley expects hundreds if not thousands of people to back the demand, which will be posted on <a href=\"https://www.obv.org.uk/news-blogs/bame-leadership-demand-covid-19-race-equality-strategy\">the OBV website</a>.

      "bodyText": "A Covid-19 race equality strategy must be launched across Whitehall in the wake of growing evidence of inequalities amid the pandemic, a coalition of BAME campaigners, peers, academics and religious leaders has said. The disproportionate impact of coronavirus on black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people, who are more likely than the white British population to die from the disease, has highlighted longstanding inequalities in health, incomes, housing and employment. Signatories to Wednesday\u2019s call for action, who include the director of Operation Black Vote (OBV), Simon Woolley, and the mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees, argue that the crisis must be a watershed moment to fix such inequalities. In an open letter seen by the Guardian, they and others \u2013 including religious leaders and academics \u2013 say: \u201cFor many of us there has been much heartache and at times anger in watching this crisis unfold and seeing many brave lives cut short. Furthermore, we are acutely aware of perhaps an even greater impact, socially, educationally and economically, BAME communities could face as we confront an unprecedented economic downturn. \u201cOur demand is for a Covid-19 race equality strategy that will not only deal with the immediacy of saving lives, but also fundamentally rebuild many of our institutions that this disease has exposed as having huge racial disparities.\u201d Black people are more than four times more likely to die of Covid-19 than the white British population, according to analysis by the Office for National Statistics. People of Bangladeshi and Pakistani, Indian, and mixed ethnicities were also found to have raised mortality risk relative to white people. A Public Health England (PHE) review into how different factors \u2013 including ethnicity, gender and obesity \u2013 can affect people\u2019s health outcomes from coronavirus is due to be published this week. But the signatories to the demand for a race equality strategy say that a wider-ranging review is needed in order to \u201cbuild something positive and long-lasting from this deadly Covid-19 crisis\u201d amid fears of a deep recession. Lord Woolley, who is chair of the government race disparity unit\u2019s advisory group, said he had had conversations with No 10 about such a review being instigated across Whitehall. \u201cIt gives us a unique opportunity to tackle those deep-seated inequalities, which existed even before Covid-19, that could get very much worse, without dramatic action, without radical action,\u201d he said. \u201cBig examples of that would be the prospect of high levels of unemployment, which for young black kids could go to 50, 60, 70%. The inequality in health that we\u2019ve already seen could get very much worse if those poverty predictions kick in. Educationally, unless there\u2019s dramatic action, those kids that are already behind could fall so far behind that a generation of young kids could be failed.\u201d Woolley expects hundreds if not thousands of people to back the demand, which will be posted on the OBV website. Its signatories also include the writer Afua Hirsch, David Weaver, the president of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, Dr Elizabeth Henry, the head of diversity for the Church of England, and Rabbi Danny Rich, the chief executive of Liberal Judaism. Among the disparities they highlight are the existence of only seven NHS trust chief executives who are BAME. This is despite 21% of the NHS workforce being BAME and 44% of its medical staff. The letter also says black people are twice as likely as white people to be unemployed and BAME people are 48% more likely to be on zero-hour contracts. The open letter decries what it says are attempts by some to blame genes, culture and/or lifestyle for disparities and to accuse BAME people of victimhood for raising social and economic disadvantages, saying: \u201cWe will not be blamed.\u201d It adds: \u201cWhen we follow those key areas in our society that Covid-19 has exposed for having profound inequalities, such as health, employment, housing, criminal justice and education, we strongly feel that these are the areas we need to drastically put right. \u201cIf anything good is to come from this awful disease, it is that we track what\u2019s been exposed and amplified as discriminatory and we fundamentally fix it. That starting point is a Covid-19 race equality strategy, and it is something that we believe will form part of a new social and race equality contract.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cThis government is committed to levelling up, unleashing potential and increasing opportunity for all. \u201cWe have pledged to improve the quality of data and evidence about the types of barriers faced by people from different backgrounds to help drive effective and lasting change. \u201cThe government\u2019s race disparity unit, which is a world first for publishing data by ethnicity, also publishes data by age, gender and geography wherever possible. It continues to work across departments and their agencies to identify and address adverse variances in outcomes where they are found. \u201cWe\u2019re also aware that the coronavirus sadly appears to have a disproportionate effect on people from BAME backgrounds. \u201cIt is critical we find out which groups are most at risk so we can take the right steps to protect them and minimise their risk. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have commissioned PHE to better understand the different factors, such as ethnicity, that may influence the effects of the virus and explore the possible reasons for disparities.\u201d",

We will sometimes do up to four flights a day, so it\u2019s quite hectic. We can be away for days in a row with each night in a different city. I could wake up in Newcastle one morning and go to bed in Lyon.</p> <p>We came to an agreement with our union, Balpa, before the furlough scheme came in, to take a 50% pay cut for three months to avoid any redundancies. I\u2019ve been volunteering for the London ambulance service for two years now, going out in the response cars once a week, but because of Covid-19 they needed extra ambulance drivers so they trained us up to go out full-time.</p> <p>It\u2019s weird, it\u2019s my life now really. It\u2019s been a good distraction but obviously there\u2019s also been some pretty grim stuff. Sometimes you\u2019re taking patients away from their loved ones who are probably not going to see them again.</p> <p>Tonight I\u2019m going to go out on an ambulance with someone I\u2019ve never met before. You just have to get on with each other \u2013 and that\u2019s basically what being a pilot is. In the crew room I\u2019ll meet a captain I\u2019ve probably never met before \u2013 it\u2019s such a big airline \u2013 and then we\u2019ve got to operate a 70-tonne Airbus and fly it around Europe together.</p> <h2>Kayleigh Easton, 27, glamping manager to lorry driver</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b43eda772da19eb14baee8354c6dc3f587f8693\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b43eda772da19eb14baee8354c6dc3f587f8693/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kayleigh Easton, 27, on the glamping site in Northallerton where she usually works\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kayleigh Easton, 27, on the glamping site in Northallerton where she usually works, has always wanted to drive a wagon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I work as operations manager on the Sedgewell Barn Holidays site, making sure the wigwams are ready, letting people know which one they\u2019ve been allocated and doing bookings.</p> <p>When the lockdown was announced the site shut down.

The high-altitude border has been aggressively contested and heavily militarised since 1962 when China launched an offensive into Indian territory, sparking a short but bloody war. Ashok K Kantha, a former Indian ambassador to China and now director of the Institute of Chinese Studies based in Delhi, said the recent incursions and border aggressions from China were \u201cfar from routine occurrences\u201d. He said: \u201cThis escalation is serious; I don\u2019t think this is just a localised incident. China\u2019s behaviour is more aggressive this time, backed up by a fairly large number of troops, which is not typical of this border where troop levels tend to be low on both sides. It could be a territorial claim or part of a wider messaging to India that they need to be more mindful of China on sensitive geopolitical issues.\u201d Kantha said it was \u201cin the interest of both India and China to keep the situation under control and maintain relative peace\u201d. China\u2019s actions appear to be a response to India\u2019s construction of roads and airstrips adjacent to the Line of Actual Control (LAC), which will improve connectivity and enable easier mobility for Indian troops in the area. Construction has paused during the coronavirus lockdown but is due to resume imminently. There have been diplomatic discussions as well as multiple meetings on a local level in an attempt to defuse the tensions. On Tuesday India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, held a meeting with his national security adviser, Ajit Doval, plus his chief of defence staff and three security chiefs to discuss \u201cbolstering India\u2019s military preparedness to deal with external security challenges\u201d. According to satellite footage published by the Indian news channel NDTV, there has been large-scale construction work at a Chinese military airbase less than 120 miles from the border in recent weeks, including the building of a new runway suitable for warplanes. Zhao Lijian, spokesman for the foreign ministry, told reporters in Beijing that the two countries have channels for resolving such issues. \u201cAt present, the situation along the border between China and India is generally stable and controllable,\u201d he said. \u201cChina is committed to safeguarding the security of its national territorial sovereignty, as well as safeguarding peace and stability in the China-India border areas,\u201d a Chinese foreign ministry statement said. In a recent statement, India\u2019s external affairs ministry blamed China for provoking the military escalation. \u201cIn fact, it is the Chinese side that has recently undertaken activity hindering India\u2019s normal patrolling patterns,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Indian side has always taken a very responsible approach towards border management.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Stock markets gained ground in the US and Europe on Wednesday thanks to hopes that lockdowns will ease, allowing economies to stutter to a start again. However, early gains moderated as the day wore on - illustrating the delicate balance between optimism over reopening and the major costs still to emerge from the pandemic. The FTSE 100 rose by 0.8% at the time of writing, while the European Stoxx 600 index fell slightly. In the US the S&amp;P 500 rose by 0.6%, but the Nasdaq fell heavily after reports of new taxes on tech firms in the EU. In the UK data published on Wednesday showed that more than 10m people - a third of the workforce - have received self-employed income support or have been furloughed, underling the deep harms to the economy caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The cost of the subsidies has mounted to almost \u00a322bn to the Treasury. Here are some of the other important developements today: The European commission unveiled its proposals for a \u20ac750bn recovery fund on top of a \u20ac1.1tn budget, raising the prospect of a large stimulus for the EU economy. The eurozone economy will shrink by at least 8% this year, according to European Central Bank (ECB) president Christine Lagarde. BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest investor, is understood to have voted against ExxonMobil directors in protest at the oil company\u2019s lack of action on the climate crisis. Shares in Asia fell amid protests in Hong Kong over new Chinese security laws. Carmakers Renault and Nissan said they will work together more closely on car development and production as they seek to save money during the pandemic, although they will not pursue a merger.

Please do join Kalyeena Makortoff tomorrow morning for more of the same. JJ US stock markets have gained at the opening bell on Wall Street - matching the positivity seen outside of Asia today as investors bet on recovery. Here are the early moves: S&amp;P 500 UP 28.84 POINTS, OR 0.96%, AT 3,020.61 AFTER MARKET OPEN DOW JONES UP 350.69 POINTS, OR 1.40%, AT 25,345.80 AFTER MARKET OPEN NASDAQ UP 14.73 POINTS, OR 0.16%, AT 9,354.95 AFTER MARKET OPEN Some interesting news on the climate front ahead of US investor ExxonMobil\u2019s annual meeting: BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest fund manager, will lodge multiple votes against the company because of its failure to make progress on its climate change targets. BlackRock will vote against the re-election of two directors and in favour of a shareholder motion that proposes splitting the role of chief executive and chairman. The company manages assets worth $6.9tn (\u00a35.3tn), including large holdings in oil producers such as BP, Shell and ExxonMobil. It announced at the start of the year that it would divest from holdings related to thermal coal and would focus on sustainability when making investment decisions. You can read the full report here: And secondly (but more importantly), there is a lot more detail on the EU\u2019s \u20ac750bn recovery fund, helping the euro gain. Here are some of the details released by the European commission. It is quite a shopping list. Direct investments A new recovery and resilience facility of \u20ac560bn will offer financial support for investments and reforms, with \u20ac310bn in grants and \u20ac250bn available in loans - with aid to be concentrated in the worst affected regions. A \u20ac55bn top-up of the cohesion policy programmes between now and 2022 under the new REACT-EU initiative targeting places with high youth unemployment. Another \u20ac40bn for the just transition fund, to help the move towards climate neutrality. \u20ac15bn for the European agricultural fund for rural development. Public-private investments A new solvency support instrument with a budget of \u20ac31bn, aiming to support \u201cviable European companies\u201d. Upgrade InvestEU, to a level of \u20ac15.3bn to mobilise private investment in EU projects. Health investments A new health programme, EU4Health, to prepare for future health crises with a budget of \u20ac9.4bn. \u20ac2bn more for rescEU, the EU\u2019s crisis fighting fund. \u20ac94.4bn for Horizon Europe, funding research in health, resilience and the green and digital transitions. An extra \u20ac16.5bn for external action, including humanitarian aid. The euro has gained further against the pound: sterling is down by 0.7% for the day, at \u20ac1.1153. Against the dollar the pound is also down by 0.3% at $1.2290. First up: The latest Brexit news may not have helped sterling, with continued tough talk from the UK\u2019s chief negotiator, David Frost. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman also stood by the government\u2019s line that the transition period will end at 31 December. A trade deal or an extension is needed by the end of June to avoid trade defaulting overnight to World Trade Organisation terms. Frost said the EU mandate for negotiations agreed by member states would not allow a deal as it currently stands. With the clock ticking, Frost said talks are at a relatively early stage, and that the Covid-19 illness (that hit the UK and EU governments) had lost them a week or two of time. The positive mood on the FTSE 100 has strengthened: top riser Melrose has now gained 21%, helping the index to a 1.5% increase at lunchtime in London. A reminder: Melrose\u2019s GKN aerospace and engineering subsidiary has been hard-hit by the crisis. But the flip side of that is that shares could be sensitive to signs that the damage won\u2019t be as bad. The same is true of cruise ship operator Carnival, whose shares have now gained 17% today. Engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, which is making swingeing job cuts in anticipation of lower demand, has gained 14%. Its outlook could improve if people return to flying sooner rather than later. Guarantor loans provider Amigo has been forced to disclose a takeover approach after its majority shareholder refused to discuss the potential sale. Amigo, which has faced criticism over its high-cost loans for generally poorer customers, said an unnamed party had made an offer to buy it for 20.9p per share - less than its price of 22.15p on Wednesday afternoon. The company put itself up for sale in January after a regulatory crackdown hit its business model and multiple executives left. Founder James Benamor\u2019s Richmond Group controls 61% of the company, meaning a sale would be impossible without his consent. Amigo said: Despite attempts to discuss the Potential Offer with Richmond Group, Amigo has been unable to engage constructively and ascertain Richmond Group\u2019s willingness or not to accept the Potential Offer. Amigo said it had shown forbearance - relaxing repayment schedules - for 42,000 customers during the lockdown so far. The company had a cash balance of over \u00a3115m as of 25 May, it said. It has also agreed with the regulator to work through a backlog of complaints that have arisen during the course of 2020. Shops and restaurants are reopening some of their operations, with McDonald\u2019s and Nando\u2019s among the latest companies to make announcements. John Lewis has said it will start a phased return to high street shopping by reopening two stores in Poole and Kingston upon Thames on 15 June, followed by 11 more three days later, writes the Guardian\u2019s Sarah Butler: Chancellor Rishi Sunak has also got involved, tweeting that chicken restaurant Nando\u2019s reopening is \u201cthe good news we\u2019ve all been waiting for\u201d - although the responses to his message suggest that some people are more focused on the continued fallout from the saga of Dominic Cummings\u2019 repeated breaking of lockdown rules. The story continues to roll on through the sublime, to the ridiculous, to the even more ridiculous. You can follow more on the reaction to Cummings\u2019 multiple trips and the extraordinary press conference on the UK coronavirus live blog: The euro has gained ground against the US dollar and the pound as the EU nears agreement over a recovery fund to boost growth after the pandemic. The euro gained 0.4% against the pound, with one pound worth \u20ac1.1183. Against the dollar the euro rose by 0.4% as well, to hit $1.1022. Reuters cited two sources in saying that the European commission will propose a \u20ac1.1tn budget for the EU, alongside a recovery fund worth \u20ac500bn in grants and \u20ac250bn in loans to boost economic growth. George Saravelos, global head of forex research at Deutsche Bank, said there were \u201creasons for optimism\u201d on the outlook for the euro, despite the structural flaws in the eurozone highlighted by the German constitutional court\u2019s ruling that the European Central Bank\u2019s bond buying could breach German law. The analysts said: First, there has been recent progress on discussions on the reconstruction fund, and our baseline remains we will get an agreement over the summer. Second, thanks to the presence of the ECB in the background, the Italian bond market has been very resilient to negative news and we anticipate a further upscaling of ECB peripheral buying in June. Finally, the European policy response to labor market distress in particular is superior to the US and likely to lead to lesser employment scarring and a quicker resumption in activity, especially in Northern Europe In total the coronavirus government support for UK workers has come to \u00a321.8bn, if you add together the money paid for furloughed employees and income support for self-employed workers. More than 10m British workers have been given some form of income support, if furlough numbers are added to those who have claimed self-employed support*. That would represent about a third of all workers being given income support, based on pre-lockdown data from the Office for National Statistics showing 33.1m people in employment in the UK. The total cost of battling the crisis will be much higher, thanks to the loans and grants given to businesses. The effects on the Exchequer will be even more pronounced because of the drops in income tax and corporation tax paid. At the same time, the government has had to step in to cover public services, with little signs of appetite for spending reductions from chancellor Rishi Sunak. Economists expect borrowing to remain high relative to GDP for a considerable period, according to a regular poll carried out by the Treasury. While GDP growth is expected to snap back in 2021, annual borrowing by 2024 will still be close to \u00a3100bn, according to the economists\u2019 average expectations. *This post has been corrected to remove the suggestion furloughed employees could also claim self-employed income support. More struggles for the British property sector: British Land, which owns shopping centres including Sheffield\u2019s Meadowhall and Drake Circus in Plymouth, has written down the value of its retail portfolio by more than a quarter due to the impact of the coronavirus. The government\u2019s implementation of a nationwide lockdown in late March helped push the company, which also owns office properties in London, to a \u00a31.1bn loss for the year to the end of March. This compares with a loss of \u00a3320m the previous year. You can read the full report here: HMRC has detailed the number of self-employed people making claims for the Treasury\u2019s latest subsidy scheme. Guardian economics writer Phillip Inman writes: The self-employment income support scheme (SEISS) forms a major part of the government\u2019s economic rescue plans following the lockdown and was launched on 13 May to help an estimated 3.5m people. HMRC, which is running the scheme, says it received 2.3m claims with a value of \u00a36.8bn by midnight on 24 May. The figure marks a slowing of claims since 17 May when the total stood at 2m after only four days of operation. The number of PAYE staff and contractors furloughed increased to 8.4m by 24 May, up from 8m on 17 May, HMRC said. The tax authority said 1m employers were now using the scheme at a cost to the exchequer of \u00a315bn. For keen FTSE watchers, the latest reshuffle could be a big one. The top companies will be decided based on market value at the close of business on Tuesday. EasyJet and Carnival are - perhaps unsurprisingly - most at risk of falling from the blue-chip index, while British Gas owner Centrica and aerospace manufacturer Meggitt are also looking likely, according to handy analysis by AJ Bell. If there were to be four demotions it would be the most movement since March 2016. Russ Mould, investment director at investing platform AJ Bell, said: Despite their latest sharp rallies, easyJet and Carnival are still very likely to lose their FTSE 100 status in the latest quarterly reshuffle, thanks to the even bigger falls seen during the spring as their revenues dwindled to pretty much zero. Centrica and Meggitt also look destined for the drop, as their market capitalisations leave them ranked way below the 110th place cut-off. Avast, Homeserve, GVC and Convatec look the most likely names to take their places but Kingfisher, Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust, B&amp;M European Value Retail and Direct Line are all jockeying for position and sudden gains in their share prices could yet vault them into the UK\u2019s premier index. The most at risk of demotion then would be ITV and M&amp;G. The FTSE 100 has accelerated: London\u2019s benchmark share index is now up by 1.2%. The gains look to be fairly broad-based, with cyclical companies (whose fortunes largely depend on the health of the broader economy) such as banks among the biggest risers. Melrose, the owner of engineering group GKN, is top of the index, up by 10% - in a sign that some of the companies worst affected by the crisis may be rebounding. Also in that category: Carnival, the second-biggest riser. The mid-cap FTSE 250 has gained 1.6%. Ryanair chief executive Michael O\u2019Leary has said the airline could cut fewer than the 3,000 jobs previously announced after some workers agreed pay cuts. Between 25% and 30% of cabin crew and pilots across Europen have agreed pay cuts, he said, speaking to Irish radio station Newstalk. However, he said that the company could make up to half of crew and pilots in Dublin redundant, as he tried to put pressure on unions - mirroring disputes across the European aviation sector. Most planes are still grounded but the Ryanair boss said he was \u201creasonably confident\u201d the airlien could get 50% to 60% of its seats filled by July after a \u201cbig surge\u201d in bookings from the UK and Ireland to Portugal, Spain and Italy. O\u2019Leary expects to fly 75m to 80m passengers this year, against pre-pandemic targets of 150m. Fast fashion retailer Boohoo has published a fairly detailed rebuttal after shares fell heavily yesterday following a short seller attack. Hedge fund Shadowfall published a research note saying that the online retailer was exaggerating its cash flow. Wednesday\u2019s Boohoo statement said: The group strongly refutes the allegations made in the research note The company also said it saw a number of opportunities to buy rivals after it raised \u00a3197m in a recent share placing. The eurozone economy will shrink by at least 8% this year, according to European Central Bank (ECB) president Christine Lagarde. The had outlined three scenarios for GDP in 2020, but on Wednesday Lagarde said its \u201cmild\u201d scenario, which had output falling by 5%, was already outdated. Speaking at a European parliament youth event, Lagarde said GDP would be somewhere between the medium and severe scenarios. Halfords is to fully reopen 53 stores after a successful trial of physical-distancing measures on its shop floors. The bike and car parts retailer said that the reopenings follow successful tests at its Peterborough and Bristol Cribbs Causeway stores. It will be the first time Halfords customers will be allowed in store since the UK lockdown started on 23 March. Among the sites reopening are Gloucester, Huddersfield, Inverness and North Shields. The physical-distancing measures being implemented include queuing marshals outside stores, \u201csneeze screens\u201d for shoppers and staff and customers being asked not to handle or try on products. The decision comes a day after the government said most non-essential retailers could reopen from 15 June. You can read the full report here: Corner shops and independent grocers have seen a 63% surge in trade as shoppers turn to local stores during the coronavirus crisis. Sales at independently owned retailers, many of which trade under brand names such as Spar, Londis and Budgens, soared by more than double the pace of the fastest growing grocery chain, the Co-op, where sales rose 30.6% in the three months to 17 May according to the latest grocery market data from analysts Kantar, writes the Guardian\u2019s Sarah Butler. Some more info from Kantar: Take-home grocery sales grew by 14.3% during the past 12 weeks, the fastest rate since 1994. However, supermarkets will have felt the effect of a reduction in sales of on-the-go meals, snacks and drinks which total \u00a31 billion in normal times. Online grocery sales were 75% higher than a year ago, with nearly one in five households placing an order in the most recent four weeks. Fraser McKevitt of Kantar said: Shoppers and retailers are now thinking about what the impact of a less restrictive lockdown will be, and a phased re-opening of non-essential retail and the out-of-home food and drink sector will have a significant impact on grocery sales in the coming months. However, with plans for reopening the hospitality sector still uncertain, we are currently projecting that extra meals, snacks and drinks consumed at home will mean take-home sales at the grocers could be up 12% over the course of 2020 as a whole. The chief executive of Hammerson has announced he will step down, adding to the troubles of the shopping centre owner that is struggling with the pandemic\u2019s impact on the retail sector. David Atkins will remain at the struggling property group until spring 2021 as the company searches for a successor. The company, which owns the Bullring in Birmingham and Brent Cross in London, has been deluged with requests for rent deferrals, cuts or waivers during the coronavirus pandemic. Atkins, who has been with the company more than a decade, said: The current environment, exacerbated by the impact of Covid 19, is undoubtedly the most challenging we have faced as a business. I feel now is the right time to search for a new chief executive, a person who can not only lead the business as we emerge from this period, but also into its next chapter. Renault, Nissan and Mitsubishi have announced new plans to work together more closely on developing and producing cars, as they seek to move forward with an alliance that was severely dented by the dramatic arrest and flight of Carlos Ghosn. The new plan for the alliance, of which Ghosn was the architect, will see one of the carmakers leading on each type of vehicle and region where they are seen to be a \u201cleader\u201d, while the others follow. That will mean less doubling up on costs, long perceived to be a problem in companies that are nominally working together. Industry experts have joked that the electric cars developed by Nissan and Renault had little in common other than door handles - meaning the alliance was effectively bearing expensive development costs twice. The new plan could see them save costs during the coronavirus pandemic, which has seen carmakers close factories and threatens to severely impact sales for the next year and beyond. It could also see some factories closing as companies share work. Investment needs for new models could fall by 40% under the scheme, the alliance said. As expected, European shares have gained at the opening bell. The FTSE 100 is up by 0.6%, while the more UK-focused FTSE 250 has gained 0.8% in early trades. The broad European Stoxx 600 has gained 0.2%, with Germany\u2019s Dax and France\u2019s Cac 40 up 0.3% apiece. Good morning, and welcome to our live, rolling coverage of business, economics and financial markets. Global stock markets rallied on Wednesday morning as the improving outlook on lockdown easing for the most part outweighed concerns over China\u2019s imposition of new security laws on Hong Kong. Shares in the territory fell by 1% and the Shanghai stock market index on mainland China lost about 0.5%, amid signs there could be a repeat of last year\u2019s disruptive protests. Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s report from Hong Kong this morning: Thousands of armed police have flooded the streets of Hong Kong in an unprecedented show of force to prevent protests against a law criminalising ridicule of China\u2019s national anthem. At lunchtime rallies police fired pepper bullets into crowds, appearing to hit one reporter, and detained dozens of protesters. Protests have also been fuelled by growing anger at Beijing\u2019s increasing interference in the semi-autonomous city. Yet despite threats of action against China from President Donald Trump on Tuesday, investors elsewhere appeared to be more interested in signs of potential economic recovery. In Japan the Topix index gained 1% after reports of new stimulus measures. Stephen Innes, global chief market strategist at online trading platform Axicorp, said: Stimulus measures are the topic of the day again as Asian bourses are trading up this morning with the Nikkei leading the charges as Japans government looks set to unveil another $1.1tn package helping the Nikkei to gain European stock markets were expected to gain ground ahead of opening, with FTSE 100 futures indicating shares were set to rise by about 0.6%. And investors will be keeping an eye on Christine Lagarde this morning for any signs (likely in broad terms) of her thoughts on developments within the eurozone. The European Central Bank president will be answering questions from young people in an event live streamed on social media. The agenda 8:30am BST: European Central Bank (ECB) president Christine Lagarde Q&amp;A 9:30am BST: ECB vice-president Luis de Guindos speeach 1:55pm BST: US Redbook retail sales (to 23 May)",

      "body": "<p>The European Union executive has called for a \u20ac750bn (\u00a3671bn) recovery plan to help the hardest hit countries find a way out of the unprecedented economic downturn caused by the pandemic.</p> <p>The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU faced a defining moment, never seen in its 70-year history. \u201cThe crisis has huge externalities and spillovers across all countries and none of that can be fixed by any single country alone.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Addressing the European parliament, where MEPs wore face masks and sat further apart than usual under mandatory physical-distancing rules, von der Leyen said the sum would be split into \u20ac500bn of grants for EU member states and \u20ac250bn of loans.</p> <p>Under the commission\u2019s blueprint, Italy would get \u20ac82bn in grants, Spain \u20ac77bn, France \u20ac39bn, Poland \u20ac37bn and Germany \u20ac29bn.</p> <p>The money would be raised by the EU borrowing on capital markets on a far bigger scale than ever before, meeting a key demand from France and Germany, but provoking opposition from fiscal hardliners opposed to shared debt.</p> <p>In an attempt to convince governments that are against handing out large grants to their neighbours, von der Leyen told MEPs the money would go through the EU budget, meaning it would be subject to checks and controls. \u201cA struggling economy in one part of Europe weakens a strong economy in another part,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The commission claims its proposals could unleash \u20ac3.1tn of investment in the EU economy and is pledging to intensify spending on the European Green Deal, the pre-crisis plan to meet the demands of the climate emergency.</p> <p>It has promised to add \u20ac30bn to the \u20ac10bn \u201cjust transition fund\u201d, intended to help coalmining regions move away from fossil fuels.</p> <p>But officials face a political fight to persuade all 27 member states that shared debt is the right approach. Battle lines were drawn last week, after Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron called for a \u20ac500bn recovery fund, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/franco-german-plan-for-european-recovery-will-face-compromises\">as the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/franco-german-plan-for-european-recovery-will-face-compromises\">chancellor broke a long-held German taboo against common EU debt</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden, a group labelled the \u201cfrugal four\u201d, think the recovery fund should offer stricken countries loans, not grants. While Danish and Swedish finance ministers have spoken of the need for compromise in recent days, they remain opposed to mutualised debt.</p> <p>Responding to von der Leyen\u2019s plan, one EU diplomat argued the commission had favoured southern and eastern Europe. \u201cBy moving to the south and the east the commission has avoided any difficult decisions or compromises at this stage. As a result the leaders will have been set back significantly in their efforts to reach an acceptable compromise fast.\u201d</p> <p>None of the money would be available until next year, so the commission is calling on member states to agree an extra \u20ac11.5bn spending under the current EU budget. This would not affect the UK, as its liabilities are capped under the Brexit withdrawal agreement.&nbsp;</p> <p>Separately, the commission published an outline for a revamped \u20ac1.1tn EU budget for 2021-27. EU leaders failed to agree their long-term spending plans in February, in a sign of deep divisions between the \u201cfrugals\u201d and more free-spending countries, before the crisis took hold.</p> <p>The plan takes the commission into new territory, borrowing on capital markets on a far bigger scale than ever before. Officials hope to take on debt with a maximum maturity of 30 years, and not start repayments until 2027.</p> <p>Under the proposal, debts would be serviced by new EU taxes, such as corporate levies, a plastics tax or charges on imported goods with a high carbon footprint.<br>If EU countries failed to agree on common EU taxes, they would have to contribute more to future EU budgets or see cuts in EU programmes. Von der Leyen argued that neither of these were attractive options, urging member states to agree new \u201cown resources\u201d for the EU.</p> <p>In recent years, EU governments, generally wary of ceding revenue-raising powers to Brussels, have rejected an EU digital tax and \u2013 repeatedly \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/sep/20/european-commission-tax-avoidance-crackdown-pierre-moscovici\">a common consolidated corporate tax base</a>, a prerequisite for corporate taxes at EU level.</p> <p>\u201cMember states hate [EU taxes] because they basically lose power,\u201d Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian Green MEP, told the Centre for European Reform thinktank on Wednesday.

      "bodyText": "The European Union executive has called for a \u20ac750bn (\u00a3671bn) recovery plan to help the hardest hit countries find a way out of the unprecedented economic downturn caused by the pandemic. The European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU faced a defining moment, never seen in its 70-year history. \u201cThe crisis has huge externalities and spillovers across all countries and none of that can be fixed by any single country alone.\u201d Addressing the European parliament, where MEPs wore face masks and sat further apart than usual under mandatory physical-distancing rules, von der Leyen said the sum would be split into \u20ac500bn of grants for EU member states and \u20ac250bn of loans. Under the commission\u2019s blueprint, Italy would get \u20ac82bn in grants, Spain \u20ac77bn, France \u20ac39bn, Poland \u20ac37bn and Germany \u20ac29bn. The money would be raised by the EU borrowing on capital markets on a far bigger scale than ever before, meeting a key demand from France and Germany, but provoking opposition from fiscal hardliners opposed to shared debt. In an attempt to convince governments that are against handing out large grants to their neighbours, von der Leyen told MEPs the money would go through the EU budget, meaning it would be subject to checks and controls. \u201cA struggling economy in one part of Europe weakens a strong economy in another part,\u201d she said. The commission claims its proposals could unleash \u20ac3.1tn of investment in the EU economy and is pledging to intensify spending on the European Green Deal, the pre-crisis plan to meet the demands of the climate emergency. It has promised to add \u20ac30bn to the \u20ac10bn \u201cjust transition fund\u201d, intended to help coalmining regions move away from fossil fuels. But officials face a political fight to persuade all 27 member states that shared debt is the right approach. Battle lines were drawn last week, after Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron called for a \u20ac500bn recovery fund, as the chancellor broke a long-held German taboo against common EU debt. Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden, a group labelled the \u201cfrugal four\u201d, think the recovery fund should offer stricken countries loans, not grants. While Danish and Swedish finance ministers have spoken of the need for compromise in recent days, they remain opposed to mutualised debt. Responding to von der Leyen\u2019s plan, one EU diplomat argued the commission had favoured southern and eastern Europe. \u201cBy moving to the south and the east the commission has avoided any difficult decisions or compromises at this stage. As a result the leaders will have been set back significantly in their efforts to reach an acceptable compromise fast.\u201d None of the money would be available until next year, so the commission is calling on member states to agree an extra \u20ac11.5bn spending under the current EU budget. This would not affect the UK, as its liabilities are capped under the Brexit withdrawal agreement. Separately, the commission published an outline for a revamped \u20ac1.1tn EU budget for 2021-27. EU leaders failed to agree their long-term spending plans in February, in a sign of deep divisions between the \u201cfrugals\u201d and more free-spending countries, before the crisis took hold. The plan takes the commission into new territory, borrowing on capital markets on a far bigger scale than ever before. Officials hope to take on debt with a maximum maturity of 30 years, and not start repayments until 2027. Under the proposal, debts would be serviced by new EU taxes, such as corporate levies, a plastics tax or charges on imported goods with a high carbon footprint. If EU countries failed to agree on common EU taxes, they would have to contribute more to future EU budgets or see cuts in EU programmes. Von der Leyen argued that neither of these were attractive options, urging member states to agree new \u201cown resources\u201d for the EU. In recent years, EU governments, generally wary of ceding revenue-raising powers to Brussels, have rejected an EU digital tax and \u2013 repeatedly \u2013 a common consolidated corporate tax base, a prerequisite for corporate taxes at EU level. \u201cMember states hate [EU taxes] because they basically lose power,\u201d Philippe Lamberts, a Belgian Green MEP, told the Centre for European Reform thinktank on Wednesday. But he expressed hope EU finance ministers would change their attitudes. \u201cI think that the pandemic and this recovery plan are gamechangers and if we agree to borrow together we will need to reimburse together \u2026 in a way the pandemic opened doors that many believed totally shut up until now.\u201d Central and eastern European countries, who are net beneficiaries of EU spending, are worried about losing money to southern Europe. The Czech prime minister, Andrej Babi\u0161, has said it would be \u201cunfair to be penalised for being successful\u201d referring to the low number of coronavirus cases in his country. Lud\u011bk Niedermayer, a Czech MEP and vice-president of the European parliament\u2019s economic and monetary affairs committee, said such comments were \u201cunfortunate\u201d. Niedermayer, who sits in the opposition centre-right party, said: \u201cFor us, the recovery of overall EU demand is as important as stabilising our domestic situation and one is not possible without the other.\u201d Pascal Canfin, a French MEP and Macron ally who chairs the European parliament\u2019s environment committee, described the crisis recovery fund as a \u201cmajor political victory\u201d and \u201ca great step forward in accelerating the ecological transition\u201d. But green campaigners did not share this positive view. \u201cWe are missing clear mechanisms for implementing and enforcing the green conditions to truly ensure that no money spent by member states will go to harmful activities such as fossil fuels or building new airports and motorways,\u201d said Ester Asin, the director of the WWF European policy office.",

While Galliard does have staff in such roles, the memo does not appear to be limited to people who can only do their job on site. A Galliard staff member, whose employment status the Guardian has verified, said the instructions included head office staff. The employee said they had raised concerns with the company\u2019s HR department. In a series of statements, Galliard Homes said it was taking the utmost care of its staff and appeared to suggest, incorrectly, that the Guardian may have sent the email to HR. A spokesman for Galliard Homes said: \u201cYour understanding is factually incorrect. We have received two emails from a single anonymous email address but suspected that was possibly a journalist seeking out a story where there is none \u2013 your inquiry now reinforces that suspicion. There is no story.\u201d In a second statement the company said: \u201cFAQs issued to staff provide information to Galliard staff; no Galliard employee has raised an interpretation as you are dishonestly asserting. \u201cIn fact, some colleagues are certainly not returning to work in the office environment because Galliard cares and looks after our people. \u201cThe specific reasons discussed and the individuals accommodated are none of your business \u2013 and if you state that any person or persons have requested and/or been denied such humanity then you are lying because you know we have confirmed it to be false. \u201cWe have since discovered that the originating IP address of the two anonymous emails the company received, which uses the same language as your correspondence, has a history of being reported elsewhere as a source of trolling.\u201d The company did not address the substance of the guidelines contained in its FAQ document. Andy McDonald, Labour\u2019s shadow secretary for employment rights, said any confusion over when staff should return to work was down to \u201cmixed messaging from the government\u201d. He said the guidance \u201cfails to make existing health and safety law clear, including that no employee should be pressured to work if they reasonably fear their health is at risk. \u201cWithout clarity and an enforceable plan for a safe return to workplaces, the health of workers and their families will continue to be put in danger.\u201d Gail Cartmail, assistant general secretary of the United trade union, said government guidelines stated that \u201cthose who can work from home should work from home\u201d. \u201cTo suggest this is solely about whether or not you use public transport is a complete nonsense. \u201cThis flawed advice highlights the critical role that unions play in placing checks on employers who are unwilling to toe public health guidelines.\u201d Essex-based Galliard Homes is majority owned by its co-founder Stephen Conway, 72, named in this month\u2019s Sunday Times Rich List as the 319th richest person in the UK, along with his family. His net worth increased by \u00a375m to \u00a3413m thanks in part to a strong year for Galliard Homes, which has overseen London developments including Butler\u2019s Wharf and the old County Hall. Profits for the last financial year rose to nearly \u00a362m on revenues of \u00a3368m.",

Alternatives to detention should be considered for anyone who does not pose a threat to themselves or society.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 29 May 2020 to clarify that children have been held in a secure facility, separate from the adult prison.",

Aya Hachem, 19, was hit by a bullet fired from a passing car as she shopped for groceries near her home in Blackburn on 17 May. Police said the teenager, who was a young trustee at the Children\u2019s Society, was an innocent victim and not the intended target of the shooting. Six people charged with her murder appeared at Preston crown court via video link on Wednesday afternoon. Alexander Langhorn, prosecuting, said police had been called to the shooting, arising out of what appeared to be a dispute between RI Tyres and Quick Shine. He said it was the crown\u2019s case that the defendants arranged the attempt to shoot and kill Pachah Khan, the owner and manager of Quick Shine. Feroz Suleman, 39, appeared alongside fellow defendants 24-year-old Kashif Manzoor, Ayaz Hussain, 34, Uthman Satia, 28, and Abubakir Satia, 31, as well as Judy Chapman, 26. They were all further remanded in custody and no applications for bail were made. The six are also charged with the attempted murder of Khan, who police allege was their intended target. Judge Mark Brown, the honorary recorder of Preston, set a provisional trial date of 4 May 2021, which he described as \u201ca worst-case scenario\u201d amid the coronavirus pandemic.

      "body": "<h2>Whose contacts will be traced?</h2> \n<p>England\u2019s new \u201cNHS test-and-trace\u201d system kicks in when a patient receives a positive test result for coronavirus.</p> \n<p>Unlike in the early days of the outbreak, everyone experiencing symptoms will be expected to take a test. At the same time as ordering the test, by calling 119, or going to <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/\">the NHS website</a>, patients will be asked to take part in the tracking programme.</p> \n<p>If the result of their test is positive, anyone they have been in close contact with will then be contacted, and asked to self-isolate for 14 days, even if they have no symptoms.</p> \n<h2>What counts as \u2018close contact\u2019?</h2> \n<p>It means anyone who has been within 2 metres of the infected person for more than 15 minutes without protective equipment \u2013 something test-and-trace chief Dido Harding says should be rare if workplaces are operating in accordance with \u201cCovid-secure\u201d guidelines.</p> \n<p>The government also hopes the requirements of the new system in England will focus the public\u2019s minds on the importance of continuing to stay 2 metres apart from others, as much as possible.</p> \n<p>Once the app is up and running, the patient\u2019s mobile phone should automatically identify anyone they have come close to. But until that happens, patients will be asked to identify likely contacts themselves, via an online process.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a8aefc4-c87c-430c-81cd-7b8b5fa27431\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VIZouD5qaLM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2>What happened to the app?</h2> \n<p>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, announced the pilot of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/04/contact-tracing-app-to-be-piloted-on-isle-of-wight-this-week-matt-hancock-says\">new NHS tracing app on the Isle of Wight</a> earlier this month, and had hoped it would form an integral part of the contact-tracing system, saying: \u201cWhere the Isle of Wight leads, Britain follows.\u201d</p> \n<p>But it is yet to be cleared for launch, as developers tackle glitches.

      "bodyText": "Whose contacts will be traced? England\u2019s new \u201cNHS test-and-trace\u201d system kicks in when a patient receives a positive test result for coronavirus. Unlike in the early days of the outbreak, everyone experiencing symptoms will be expected to take a test. At the same time as ordering the test, by calling 119, or going to the NHS website, patients will be asked to take part in the tracking programme. If the result of their test is positive, anyone they have been in close contact with will then be contacted, and asked to self-isolate for 14 days, even if they have no symptoms. What counts as \u2018close contact\u2019? It means anyone who has been within 2 metres of the infected person for more than 15 minutes without protective equipment \u2013 something test-and-trace chief Dido Harding says should be rare if workplaces are operating in accordance with \u201cCovid-secure\u201d guidelines. The government also hopes the requirements of the new system in England will focus the public\u2019s minds on the importance of continuing to stay 2 metres apart from others, as much as possible. Once the app is up and running, the patient\u2019s mobile phone should automatically identify anyone they have come close to. But until that happens, patients will be asked to identify likely contacts themselves, via an online process. What happened to the app? Matt Hancock, the health secretary, announced the pilot of a new NHS tracing app on the Isle of Wight earlier this month, and had hoped it would form an integral part of the contact-tracing system, saying: \u201cWhere the Isle of Wight leads, Britain follows.\u201d But it is yet to be cleared for launch, as developers tackle glitches. Ministers have been stressing more recently that on-the-ground tracing, involving local public health teams as well as call-centre staff, is more important. Will there be fines to enforce the new requirements? Not to begin with. Harding stressed that, for the time being, the new system will rely on the voluntary compliance of the public. But ministers do have the legal power to enforce self-isolation requirements with fines, if it is deemed necessary at a later stage. Travellers who break the new quarantine regime for arrivals at airports and ports will already be charged up to \u00a31,000 if they breach the restrictions. Does the NHS have the testing capacity to back up the new system? The latest official daily testing capacity figure was a record 154,120, and the Department of Health insists it will achieve the 200,000-a-day target set by the prime minister by the end of May \u2013 later this week. The former health secretary Jeremy Hunt has warned that long waits for some test results could hamper the effectiveness of the new system. Harding has acknowledged she is keen to increase the speed of the entire system, including the turnaround times for results, some of which are still taking more than 24 hours to return. Could people end up having to self-isolate repeatedly? They shouldn\u2019t: Harding suggested if people in a particular workplace or local area appear are repeatedly showing up as in close contact with sufferers, local public health authorities could intervene to investigate. Part of the rationale for the new system is meant to be to allow local, small-scale action to be taken, such as shutting down particular services or businesses, where there appears to be an outbreak. Will people who have already had Covid-19 be exempted from the requirements to self-isolate? No. Scientific advice remains that we cannot be certain whether having had the virus means a patient has immunity. So even someone who has had a positive test for Covid-19 in the past, will have to stay at home for 14 days if they have come into contact with a new sufferer.",

      "bodyText": "Opposition politicians in Tanzania have accused president John Magufuli of covering up a major outbreak of Covid-19 in the east African country. Magufuli has repeatedly played down the threat from the pandemic and refused to impose a strict lockdown as many other leaders on the continent have. Instead the 60-year-old has encouraged the country\u2019s 56 million inhabitants to keep working and socialising, while a key ally announced a three-day \u201ccorona party\u201d in Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital, this weekend to give thanks to God for what he claimed was a reduction in levels of infection. Tanzanian authorities have not released official date on infections for nearly a month, despite requests from the World Health Organization (WHO). There were 480 confirmed cases with 16 deaths on 29 April. However, the opposition politicians say they believe there have been more than 400 deaths in Dar es Salaam and between 16,000 and 20,000 cases nationwide, according to their own ongoing research. \u201cThe government say there are no patients in the hospitals but we know of three hospitals in Dar es Salaam where the ICU beds are all completely full,\u201d said Zitto Kabwe, leader of the Alliance for Change and Transparency. Many African countries have been praised for their response to the coronavirus. Though testing has been patchy and the true extent of the spread of the virus is unknown, there are still only 3,600 deaths and 120,000 confirmed cases on the continent. Magufuli has rejected advice from the WHO on social distancing to restrict transmission of the disease, while laboratory officials were suspended earlier this month after the president said he had secret tests performed in which a papaya and a goat tested positive. Colleges and sports events will restart next month, along with international flights. International experts have watched developments in Tanzania with dismay. Senior officials at the WHO have made repeated requests for permission to offer extensive assistance in the country\u2019s fight against the pandemic. Earlier this month, the US embassy advised that \u201call available evidence pointed to exponential growth\u201d of Covid-19 cases in Dar es Salaam and other locations in Tanzania\u201d, and warned that \u201cmany hospitals \u2026 have been overwhelmed in recent weeks\u201d. The foreign ministry rejected the claim. Hassan Abbas, a government spokesman, said it would be impossible to cover up an outbreak and dismissed reports that hospitals were overwhelmed, noting that one, which has room for more than 160 patients, only had 11 in it. Magufuli cited several examples of improvement in a speech, notably at the Amana hospital in Dar es Salaam, where the number of patients reportedly dropped from 198 to 12. But the opposition accused authorities of emptying clinics in order to counter international concern. \u201cThe government decongested these hospitals in order to prove the US wrong \u2026 A number of patients were told to treat themselves at home. This will cause a very big problem in the next weeks,\u201d Kabwe said. The country\u2019s neighbours fear that a major outbreak could spill over the country\u2019s borders. Kenya imposed stringent testing measures on Tanzanian truck drivers after more than 50 of them tested positive for the virus in a single day. Districts in Zambia which border Tanzania have some of the highest levels of infection in the country. Though schools have been closed, churches in Tanzania have remained open. A devout Catholic, Magufuli has described the Covid-19 virus as \u201cthe devil\u201d and said it cannot survive in the body of Christ. In mid-March he ordered three days of national prayers against the disease. The son of a peasant farmer, Magufuli faces elections to win a second term later this year. Experts describe the veteran politician, who has a doctorate in chemistry and won his nickname \u2018The Bulldozer\u2019 as a minister, as a populist who likes to fly in the face of convention. \u201cHe\u2019s set himself up as a firebrand leader who will do great things \u2026. But he\u2019s very popular and in charge of a dominant party. He\u2019s in a fairly solid position,\u201d said Prof Nic Cheeseman, an expert in African politics at Birmingham University. Magufuli was praised when he came to power in 2015 for his high-profile efforts to crack down on corruption but has grown increasingly authoritarian. \u201cThe problems with mistreatment are still continuing \u2026 There is a lot of pressure being put on the media,\u201d said Kabwe. Albert Msando, a lawyer, was arrested in late April after a video circulated showing him distributing masks to journalists and talking about the importance of the news media\u2019s role in informing the public, according to the Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition. Three media organisations were fined for \u201ctransmission of false and misleading information\u201d about the government\u2019s response, and a newspaper had its online publishing license suspended. Erick Kabendera, an investigative journalist spent seven months in prison on what Amnesty said were \u201ctrumped-up charges\u201d. \u201cPeople in Tanzania cannot express themselves,\u201d said Roland Ebole, an Amnesty International researcher based in Kenya.",

      "bodyText": "The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, has warned that Britain\u2019s recovery from its Covid-19 slump will be tougher than anticipated and signalled that a fresh wave of money creation will be needed to support the pandemic-battered economy. Writing for the Guardian on a day that saw news that a third of Britain\u2019s 32-million- strong workforce is now being paid by the government via its staff furlough or self-employed support schemes, Bailey made clear that Threadneedle Street was contemplating new moves to boost growth. The governor indicated that the support was more likely to come in the form of quantitative easing \u2013 whereby the Bank buys government bonds from investors and creates money in the process \u2013 than by cutting official interest rates to below zero for the first time in its 326-year history. Since the Covid-19 crisis began in March, the Bank has cut official borrowing costs to 0.1%, announced a \u00a3200bn expansion of QE, taken steps to ease the financial pressure on large companies and made it easier for banks to lend. Bailey expressed caution, however, about going a step further and taking interest rates negative. \u201cWe have signalled that we stand ready to do more within the framework of policies we have used to date. And, in view of the risks we face, it is of course right that we consider what further options, such as cutting interest rates into unprecedented territory, might be available in the future. But it is also important that we consider very carefully the issues that such choices would give rise to.\u201d Despite the support measures announced by both the Bank and the Treasury, official figures released today (Wednesday) showed that out of a total labour force of 32 million the government was paying the wages of 8.4 million employees and providing income support to a further 2.3 million self-employed people. With Bailey noting that the unemployment rate had more than doubled to 10% and expressing doubts about whether the economy could bounce back quickly, financial markets would now be braced for the Bank\u2019s nine-strong monetary policy committee to provide more stimulus when it meets next month. Action taken so far had helped keep borrowing costs for firms and the government down, which was needed to support the economy and hit the official 2% inflation target. \u201cNo one can be sure exactly how the pandemic will unfold,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cThere are reasons to believe that economic activity will return at a faster pace than in many past recessions, but this depends on how the measures continue to be eased, what degree of natural caution is shown by people, and how much longer-term damage is done to the economy.\u201d He added: \u201cThe risks are undoubtedly on the downside for a longer and harder recovery.\u201d The governor said the Bank was monitoring a wide range of data to provide an up to date picture of how the economy was doing.

      "body": "<p>The government\u2019s decision to push ahead with reopening schools on 1 June is reckless and dangerous. Britain still has the highest death toll in Europe. The National Education Union, whose members are being asked to work in schools, has rightly raised the question of <a href=\"https://neu.org.uk/neu-five-tests-government-schools-can-re-open\" title=\"\">five tests</a> before schools reopen. These should be met before any return to schools \u2013 and other workplaces \u2013 is considered.</p> <p>Some local councils have said that schools will not be ready to open on 1 June (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/24/pm-accepts-some-english-primary-schools-may-not-return-on-1-june\" title=\"\">PM accepts some English primary schools may not return on 1 June</a>, 24 May). Others should follow suit and say schools won\u2019t open until the five tests are met. Parents have rightly organised meetings up and down the country against the reopening of schools. Most workers would have to use public transport to return to work, and it is clear this cannot be operated safely on a mass scale at present. As of 25 May, 43 transport workers have died from coronavirus <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/ticket-inspector-and-care-worker-join-list-of-london-victims-to-die-a4448296.html\" title=\"\">in London alone</a>. There are already far too many workers engaged in non-essential production, such as on most building sites, who should not be working.</p> <p>We reject the government\u2019s attempts to use economic hardship \u2013 for example, the winding down of the furlough scheme \u2013 to force people into unsafe work.

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s decision to push ahead with reopening schools on 1 June is reckless and dangerous. Britain still has the highest death toll in Europe. The National Education Union, whose members are being asked to work in schools, has rightly raised the question of five tests before schools reopen. These should be met before any return to schools \u2013 and other workplaces \u2013 is considered. Some local councils have said that schools will not be ready to open on 1 June (PM accepts some English primary schools may not return on 1 June, 24 May). Others should follow suit and say schools won\u2019t open until the five tests are met. Parents have rightly organised meetings up and down the country against the reopening of schools. Most workers would have to use public transport to return to work, and it is clear this cannot be operated safely on a mass scale at present. As of 25 May, 43 transport workers have died from coronavirus in London alone. There are already far too many workers engaged in non-essential production, such as on most building sites, who should not be working. We reject the government\u2019s attempts to use economic hardship \u2013 for example, the winding down of the furlough scheme \u2013 to force people into unsafe work. We have seen nothing that suggests that the government will ensure safe working. We therefore call on the trade union movement to support school staff and other workers who are concerned about a return to unsafe schools and other workplaces on 1 June or beyond. No one should be forced to return to an unsafe workplace \u2013 and we support them if they refuse to do so.

Many countries, including the UK, introduced social distancing. Schools and workplaces were closed, travel restricted and people instructed to stay at home. In the UK, about one in five companies report that they have temporarily closed or paused trading. Close to one in four have seen their turnover halve. Payments data suggest household spending is down by around a quarter. Official estimates suggest that UK economic output contracted by almost 6% in March as lockdown measures were introduced. It is likely to have fallen considerably further in April as those measures remained in place. As activity has fallen in the UK, the number of people in work has dropped sharply. Claims for universal credit have surged, suggesting the jobless rate has more than doubled from around 4% at the start of the year to about 10% now.

The risks are undoubtedly on the downside for a longer and harder recovery. The Bank has taken unprecedented actions in terms of their scale and speed. I believe these actions are working. At a time when a sharp increase in borrowing, by firms and the government, is needed to support the wellbeing of people, we have been able to keep the effective cost of borrowing down, which is essential to support the economy and meet our target for inflation. It can only be achieved because the Bank is an effective independent central bank, and in no sense has that independence been put on hold. We have signalled that we stand ready to do more within the framework of policies we have used to date. And, in view of the risks we face, it is, of course, right that we consider what further options, such as cutting interest rates into unprecedented territory, might be available in the future. But it is also important that we consider very carefully the issues that such choices would give rise to. The Bank stands ready to do whatever we can to support UK households and businesses during this period of economic disruption and get through this together. This is our duty. \u2022 Andrew Bailey is governor of the Bank of England",

      "bodyText": "Only about half of Americans say they would get a Covid-19 vaccine if available, according to an Associated Press-NORC poll, as a top US government scientist tempered claims by Donald Trump that the United States would be able to invent, manufacture and administer hundreds of millions of vaccine doses by the end of the year. Trump has routinely touted the speedy development of a vaccine as America\u2019s path out of the coronavirus pandemic, which has taken nearly 100,000 lives in the US. As part of an effort branded \u201cOperation Warp Speed\u201d, Trump has set a goal of a 300m-dose stockpile by January. Vaccine developers have called that time frame \u201caspirational\u201d. But polling published on Wednesday indicates that the country could run up against another obstacle in its fight against the virus: vaccine refusal. In reply to the question, \u201cIf a vaccine against the coronavirus becomes available, do you plan to get vaccinated?\u201d, 49% of respondents said yes and 20% said no. About one-third said they weren\u2019t sure. Most epidemiologists believe that either a 50-60% infection rate, or a vaccine, would be required to stop the spread of the virus in the United States. Current infection rates vary regionally from an estimated 5% to 20%. Public attitudes towards a vaccine could change quickly if a vaccine or vaccines were unveiled with a public education campaign. But the polling figures reflected US attitudes toward common vaccines such as the flu vaccine, which has about a 50% uptake rate each year. In previous years, Trump has added his voice to the anti-vaccination movement in the United States, falsely linking vaccines with autism. The movement has contributed to outbreaks of measles in the United States and raised fears about the potential return of eradicated diseases such as smallpox. Early clinical trials from multiple vaccine candidates have been promising. But Dr Anthony Fauci, the country\u2019s top infectious diseases expert and a member of the White House coronavirus taskforce, warned in an interview with CNN on Wednesday that the road to a vaccine could have unforeseen detours. Asked whether a vaccine would be widely available in the United States \u201cbefore the end of the year,\u201d Fauci said \u201cit is possible. \u201cBut when you\u2019re dealing with vaccines, you\u2019ve got to remember that you\u2019re dealing with things that have a lot of vicissitudes,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cThere are a lot of landmines and hiccups that occur. Fauci said that scientists were accelerating the vaccine development process \u201cwhich I must emphasize is not at the expense of safety nor at the expense of scientific integrity. \u201cI still think that we have a good chance, if all the things fall in the right place, that we might have a vaccine that would be deployable by the end of the year, by November-December,\u201d he said. Respondents in the poll told the Associated Press said they were concerned about the vaccine development process being rushed.

But, \u201cto get a Covid-19 vaccine within a year or two ... causes me to fear that it won\u2019t be widely tested as to side-effects.\u201d Dr Francis Collins, who directs the National Institutes of Health, insisted safety was the top priority.

      "bodyText": "Australians who relied on social security benefits were five times more likely to be living in poverty than others before the coronavirus pandemic, sparking calls to maintain the boosted rate of unemployment payments before an eventual overhaul of the system. The Australian Council of Social Services\u2019s Poverty in Australia report, released on Thursday, found being unemployed was the greatest risk factor to living in poverty, while people in paid work were also struggling owing to the increasing cost of raising children. Overall, the report said two-thirds of those living in households where the main breadwinner was out of work lived below the poverty line, which is set at $457 a week for a single person. The research relies on data collected in 2018 and reflects analysis conducted under the pre-Covid-19 social security system, where the base rate of the jobseeker payment stood at about $275 a week. In March the government introduced a $550-a-fortnight coronavirus supplement, effectively doubling jobseeker payments and other benefits. Before the pandemic, campaigners including Acoss had been calling for a $95-a-week increase to the old Newstart payment but the massive temporary increase to the dole and changing economic conditions have made pre-Covid proposals increasingly irrelevant. Acoss is yet to name a new figure it will seek on an increase to the jobseeker payment. Its acting chief executive, Jacqui Phillips, said the peak body was calling for the coronavirus supplement to \u201cremain in place until we have a social security system that prevents poverty\u201d. \u201cWe must ensure that there is an income floor under which no one falls into poverty, regardless of their circumstances,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cThe poverty line for a single person without children is around $500 per week, including housing costs.\u201d Households relying \u201cmainly on social security payments are approximately five times more likely to experience poverty\u201d, while 44% of sole-parent households live below the poverty line. The highest poverty rates were found in homes where the main breadwinner received Newstart, now known as jobseeker. More than half (57%) of Newstart recipients lived below the poverty line, as did a large proportion of those on the parenting payment (57%), the disability support pension (41)%, and the youth allowance. Among them is a law student and youth allowance recipient Freya Pollard, 22, who said she had struggled to make ends meet while living with her mother in a sharehouse last year. On top of her $300-a-fortnight payments, Pollard said she earned additional wages from her part-time job at a cafe, although a hip condition prevented her from working more than a few shifts a week. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t eat three meals a day,\u201d Pollard said. \u201cOr I would save up for anything that I need.\u201d Pollard said she had been rarely able to go out with friends or look after her mental health by seeing her psychologist. \u201cWhen you live such a long time on welfare benefits, you tend to normalise the kind of really degrading behaviour you revert to in order to live,\u201d she said. \u201cThe psychological effects of living in poverty, the stress, the guilt and the shame around your relationship with money, that affects your living conditions for the rest of your life. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a short-term thing. Living in poverty is not just something you pass through.\u201d Since April Pollard has been receiving the boosted youth allowance payment of $854.60 a fortnight, up from $304.60 before the pandemic. She said it was a \u201cbit scary\u201d knowing that the payments would reduce in September. \u201cI think they should keep the payment as is it now,\u201d she said. \u201cEven as it is now, it\u2019s still only minimal. When they go back to what they were before, it\u2019s really going to set me back.\u201d About 1.3 million people are now on the boosted jobseeker payment, up from about 700,000 who received the standard rate of about $275 a week in 2018. Given that the Australian government does not have an official poverty measure, the University of New South Wales researchers used the relative poverty line of 50% of median household income. This month a Senate inquiry report into the adequacy of unemployment benefits called for the government to establish an official poverty measure.",

      "body": "<p>As we look towards next week\u2019s GDP figures, the latest construction data released on Wednesday by <a href=\"https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/8755.0Main+Features1Mar%202020?OpenDocument\">the bureau of statistics</a> shows that well before the coronavirus hit, Australia\u2019s economy was in dire need of stimulus.</p> <p>Next week we will see what happened across the entire economy in the first quarter of this year. But because those first three months only partly cover the impact of the coronavirus, the true economic horror of the virus will likely be seen in the second quarter figures that include April, May and June.</p> <p>The March quarter will take in the bushfires, and the beginnings of the virus shutdown, and as such may even cause some \u201cnot as bad as expected\u201d views to be stated next week should the GDP not completely implode.</p> <p>Of course we don\u2019t need to wait for the GDP figures to talk about a recession. When employment falls 3%, unemployment rises 1 percentage point and underemployment rises 5.2 percentage points in one month, you are in a recession. Any measure that does not register that fact is broken.</p> <p>But what the plethora of data out in the next week will show us is not so much the total impact of the virus, but just how badly things were going before we had to shut down the economy to keep people alive.</p> <p>We <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2020/mar/04/households-and-businesses-are-woefully-unready-to-keep-australias-economy-afloat\">already know that the economy</a> grew slower last year than it had in any one calendar year since the 1990s recession. And the early data does not suggest there was any great improvement about to occur.</p> <p>The virus did not so much infect a healthy economy as it did knock out one already rather sick.</p> <p>The latest construction figures out on Wednesday show that in the March quarter, both the level of building work and engineering construction declined:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Value of construction work\">  <iframe title=\"Value of construction work\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-YZeiR\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/YZeiR/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The level of building work done in March was back to December 2015 levels, while engineering construction is now lower than any time since 2007.</p> <p>But this is not some recent phenomenon to be blamed on either a virus or even the bushfires. The annual growth of both building and engineering construction has now been falling for over a year:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Construction work - annual growth\">  <iframe title=\"Construction work - annual growth \" aria-label=\"chart\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-QbAFF\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QbAFF/2/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>There will be a lot of talk about how the coronavirus has damaged the economy \u2013 and of course that is correct.

      "bodyText": "As we look towards next week\u2019s GDP figures, the latest construction data released on Wednesday by the bureau of statistics shows that well before the coronavirus hit, Australia\u2019s economy was in dire need of stimulus. Next week we will see what happened across the entire economy in the first quarter of this year. But because those first three months only partly cover the impact of the coronavirus, the true economic horror of the virus will likely be seen in the second quarter figures that include April, May and June. The March quarter will take in the bushfires, and the beginnings of the virus shutdown, and as such may even cause some \u201cnot as bad as expected\u201d views to be stated next week should the GDP not completely implode. Of course we don\u2019t need to wait for the GDP figures to talk about a recession. When employment falls 3%, unemployment rises 1 percentage point and underemployment rises 5.2 percentage points in one month, you are in a recession. Any measure that does not register that fact is broken. But what the plethora of data out in the next week will show us is not so much the total impact of the virus, but just how badly things were going before we had to shut down the economy to keep people alive. We already know that the economy grew slower last year than it had in any one calendar year since the 1990s recession. And the early data does not suggest there was any great improvement about to occur. The virus did not so much infect a healthy economy as it did knock out one already rather sick. The latest construction figures out on Wednesday show that in the March quarter, both the level of building work and engineering construction declined: The level of building work done in March was back to December 2015 levels, while engineering construction is now lower than any time since 2007. But this is not some recent phenomenon to be blamed on either a virus or even the bushfires. The annual growth of both building and engineering construction has now been falling for over a year: There will be a lot of talk about how the coronavirus has damaged the economy \u2013 and of course that is correct. But let us not forget the grim reality that existed before the health crisis occurred. The decline of the construction sector is a major story of the past decade. The investment mining boom of the 2000s was as much a boom for construction as it was actual mining. But while the mining sector continues to increase production, the construction industry has flatlined for six years: It is actually a stunning turnaround. During the first decade of this century, the construction industry was the biggest contributor to the growth in the economy \u2013 more so than the finance, health and mining sectors: But over the past decade its importance has fallen steadily, and over the past five years it has been the worst performed industry \u2013 indeed it reduced GDP growth last year by 0.2 percentage points \u2013 a significant amount given the economy only grew by 2.05%. And yet, the sector remains a massive part of our economy as a whole. It is the fifth biggest industry \u2013 7% of the total economy, and just marginally below the size of the healthcare industry. But six years ago it was our biggest industry. It remains one of the biggest employers \u2013 even as the share of its production within the economy declined, its share of total employment has remained steady, and even grew a little: But declining production with increasing employment will not continue long term, and neither is it a situation beholden to improving wages. This is why it has been six years since annual wage growth in the construction sector was above the national average: Yes, there were some massive pay spikes back during the mining boom when companies were desperate for workers, but the past decade has seen construction workers\u2019 pay rise by less than the national average. And while the major issue is the lack of work coming from the private sector, the latest construction figures show this has been greatly exacerbated by the lack of construction work coming from the public sector. For nearly two years now, while the private sector has been in retreat, the public sector has failed to step in and provide work that would stimulate the economy (as occurred during the GFC): The failure of the construction sector \u2013 and by extension the failure of the economy \u2013 prior to the coronavirus lays at the feet of the government, for it desired a return to surplus above economic growth and determined the best way to stimulate the economy was through tax cuts and the Reserve Bank cutting interest rates. The decline of the construction industry shows record low interest rates and tax cuts sold as \u201creform\u201d were nowhere near enough to stimulate the economy, and neither will they be in the years ahead as we hope to recover from the depths of a coronavirus-induced recession. \u2022 Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

He said the body would move quickly to consider the rule change \u2013 taking submissions until late June, with a decision in July \u2013 because of the risk of \u201cfinancial contagion in the market from multiple retail business failures\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that retailers are facing increases in the level of non-paying and hardship customers while still paying for wholesale electricity and network access \u2013 which together make up nearly 80% of their costs. And they have been put on notice not to disconnect customers who are having trouble paying their bills because of Covid-19,\u201d he said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cSome retailers are more financially healthy than others \u2013 but if a large retailer or a number of smaller ones go out of business in a short space of time this may have a domino effect on the others, who in turn will be under pressure to service larger numbers of hardship customers.\u201d</p> <p>Out of every $100 paid on retail bills, about $43 goes towards network costs, according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. A further $33 covers wholesale electricity costs, $8 for environmental scheme costs and $11 for retailer costs, leaving a retail margin of $4.</p> <p>The Australian Energy Regulator \u2013 which requested the urgent rule change \u2013 has argued these margins mean a relatively small increase in customer non-payment could hit retailers\u2019 cashflow and \u201cmay threaten their viability\u201d.</p> <p>If energy retailers ceased operation as a result of extending support to Covid-19-affected households and businesses, it could result in less competition in the market, the AER chair, Clare Savage, said.</p> <p>\u201cThis means fewer options for customers and possibly higher prices, as well as adding to Australia\u2019s increasing unemployment rate,\u201d she said.</p> <p>An AEMC spokesperson said a hardship customer was generally defined as someone who was having trouble paying their energy bills for a number of reasons including things such as unemployment, reduced income, family violence, household illness or a death in the family.</p> <p>The regulator\u2019s request, however, was to defer network charges incurred by retailers in relation to customers they had on a \u2018Covid-19 arrangement\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cThis means a hardship customer or someone who has been put on a payment plan/has arranged to defer their debt for the period between 1 March and 31 December 2020,\u201d the AEMC spokesperson said.</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t apply to the network charges of customers on payment plans/who were deemed hardship customers before that date.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about the proposed benefit that would flow to households, the AEMC spokesperson said: \u201cIt\u2019s about making sure they can still access their electricity supply \u2013 and this is a benefit for all customers not just those on hardship provisions.\u201d</p> <p>Consultation on the proposal was launched on the same day the AEMC unveiled plans to support the use of off-grid energy in some remote communities \u2013 potentially including in bushfire, cyclone or flood-prone areas and weak parts of the power grid.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/may/25/australias-muddled-energy-policy-and-the-roadmap-to-nowhere\">Australia\u2019s muddled energy policy and the roadmap to nowhere</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The rule change will allow energy distribution businesses to \u201ctake advantage of improved renewable technologies to choose stand-alone power systems when it\u2019s cheaper than using poles and wires to supply their customers via the grid\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cStand-alone power systems, which are usually a combination of solar, batteries and a back-up generator, are getting cheaper and more sophisticated,\u201d Pierce said.</p> <p>\u201cIn contrast, supplying customers using poles and wires in remote areas can be very costly.</p> <p>\u201cStand-alone systems give electricity networks more options.\u201d</p> <p>The AEMC says the total number of customers eligible for stand-alone power systems will be relatively small, but the move could drive large cost savings to networks, because getting power to remote communities is \u201cdisproportionately expensive\u201d.</p> <p>The new rule would ensure customers did not lose consumer protections, retail deals or reliability.

And they have been put on notice not to disconnect customers who are having trouble paying their bills because of Covid-19,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cSome retailers are more financially healthy than others \u2013 but if a large retailer or a number of smaller ones go out of business in a short space of time this may have a domino effect on the others, who in turn will be under pressure to service larger numbers of hardship customers.\u201d Out of every $100 paid on retail bills, about $43 goes towards network costs, according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. A further $33 covers wholesale electricity costs, $8 for environmental scheme costs and $11 for retailer costs, leaving a retail margin of $4. The Australian Energy Regulator \u2013 which requested the urgent rule change \u2013 has argued these margins mean a relatively small increase in customer non-payment could hit retailers\u2019 cashflow and \u201cmay threaten their viability\u201d. If energy retailers ceased operation as a result of extending support to Covid-19-affected households and businesses, it could result in less competition in the market, the AER chair, Clare Savage, said. \u201cThis means fewer options for customers and possibly higher prices, as well as adding to Australia\u2019s increasing unemployment rate,\u201d she said. An AEMC spokesperson said a hardship customer was generally defined as someone who was having trouble paying their energy bills for a number of reasons including things such as unemployment, reduced income, family violence, household illness or a death in the family. The regulator\u2019s request, however, was to defer network charges incurred by retailers in relation to customers they had on a \u2018Covid-19 arrangement\u2019. \u201cThis means a hardship customer or someone who has been put on a payment plan/has arranged to defer their debt for the period between 1 March and 31 December 2020,\u201d the AEMC spokesperson said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t apply to the network charges of customers on payment plans/who were deemed hardship customers before that date.\u201d Asked about the proposed benefit that would flow to households, the AEMC spokesperson said: \u201cIt\u2019s about making sure they can still access their electricity supply \u2013 and this is a benefit for all customers not just those on hardship provisions.\u201d Consultation on the proposal was launched on the same day the AEMC unveiled plans to support the use of off-grid energy in some remote communities \u2013 potentially including in bushfire, cyclone or flood-prone areas and weak parts of the power grid. The rule change will allow energy distribution businesses to \u201ctake advantage of improved renewable technologies to choose stand-alone power systems when it\u2019s cheaper than using poles and wires to supply their customers via the grid\u201d. \u201cStand-alone power systems, which are usually a combination of solar, batteries and a back-up generator, are getting cheaper and more sophisticated,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cIn contrast, supplying customers using poles and wires in remote areas can be very costly. \u201cStand-alone systems give electricity networks more options.\u201d The AEMC says the total number of customers eligible for stand-alone power systems will be relatively small, but the move could drive large cost savings to networks, because getting power to remote communities is \u201cdisproportionately expensive\u201d. The new rule would ensure customers did not lose consumer protections, retail deals or reliability. It applies across Australia except in Western Australia, because that state is not part of the national electricity market. WA moved recently to put in place its own off-grid arrangements.",

In a reflection of the scale of the damage and only tentative steps to lift controls, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has played down the chances of a swift bounce back. Pouring cold water on hopes of a V-shaped recovery, Sunak said last week that Britain faces a \u201csevere recession, the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen\u201d. Official figures for growth from the Office for National Statistics, which come with a six-week time lag, revealed that GDP \u2013 the broadest measure of economic activity \u2013 plunged by 5.8% in March, despite only accounting for nine days of lockdown. In the first official signs of the damage to come, retail sales in April plunged by almost a fifth. The Bank has also warned that GDP could contract by 25% in the second quarter, putting the country on course for the worst economic slump in three centuries. Faced with a lengthy recovery and gradual easing of lockdown after Boris Johnson announced non-essential shops could reopen from the middle of June, business groups have called on ministers to maintain the emergency financial support unveiled in March to smooth Britain\u2019s economic reboot. A third of the British workforce is now receiving government wage subsidies, with more than 8m jobs protected on the Treasury furlough scheme and more than 2 million self-employed people claiming grants for lost profits. However, in the coming days Sunak is expected to unveil steps to scale back the support from August given the spiralling price tag attached to the support schemes. Government borrowing surged by \u00a362bn in April, more than was previously anticipated for the whole of 2020-21. Experts have warned that focusing on the deficit and slashing the support too soon could choke off the economic recovery and trigger more job losses. Despite the furlough scheme, millions of people are slipping through the safety net. Unemployment is expected to more than double this summer after the number of people claiming unemployment benefits rose by almost 70% in April, the most since records began, to reach 2.1 million.",

Police officers erected barriers at the entrance to Villa Azul on the outskirts of Buenos Aires on Monday after widespread testing was launched in poorer districts. By Wednesday, 174 of 301 tests carried out in Villa Azul had come back positive, and officials expressed concern that if the 4,000 or so inhabitants of the neighbourhood were allowed to move freely, they could spread the virus to other areas nearby. \u201cThis is worse than a nuclear explosion,\u201d said Sergio Berni, the security minister for Buenos Aires, on Wednesday. \u201cAt least you can measure radioactivity in real time. With this [virus], it\u2019s 14 days late.\u201d But the move was criticized by local activists and even members of Argentina\u2019s leftwing government. \u201cIt looks like we are creating ghettoes for poor people,\u201d said a junior minister for social development, Daniel Men\u00e9ndez. Daniel Goll\u00e1n, health minister of Buenos Aires province, dismissed the charge. \u201cWe are working with the neighbourhood organisations, first to cut off the chain of contagion, and second to prevent people from leaving or entering because there is a much larger neighbourhood just next door.\u201d So far, no deaths have been reported in Villa Azul, Goll\u00e1n said. Intensive testing is also being carried out in Villa Itat\u00ed, an equally destitute area nearby, which is home to about 15,000 people. Mayra Mendoza, the mayor of Quilmes, the district including Villa Azul, said: \u201cIt\u2019s like a family: if one member tests positive, all the other members become close contacts. That is why we isolated the residents of Villa Azul, considering them close contacts of those who have been infected.\u201d \u201cIf this had happened in a gated community, we would have isolated it as well,\u201d the mayor said. As in other slum neighbourhoods or villas, most inhabitants of Villa Azul live in makeshift homes without public services, and the enforced isolation has left the population entirely dependent on deliveries of essential items by the army. Valeria Mansilla, a 35-year-old mother of two who lives in Villa Azul, told TN television: \u201cTuesday was a terrible day \u2013 very stressful \u2013 because they brought water and bottled gas [for heating] but only for part of the neighbourhood. They brought us powdered milk but we don\u2019t have water.\u201d Teams of sanitary workers in white full-body protective gear have been going door to door in Villa Azul, testing, and carrying food delivered by army units. Argentina\u2019s villas often suffer from cramped living conditions and a lack of proper sewerage or running water, making it difficult for inhabitants to self-isolate or maintain proper hygiene. \u201cThe first thing the pandemic has taught us, is that we live in an unfair country \u2013 and no one has the excuse of saying they didn\u2019t know because we\u2019ve all seen it,\u201d said the country\u2019s president, Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, in a speech about the situation in the country\u2019s slums. So far, most of Argentina\u2019s 23 provinces have fared relatively well during the pandemic, reporting low numbers of new cases, thanks to a tough government lockdown implemented early in the pandemic. But the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area \u2013 which counts as a separate administrative district and includes nearly 2,000 villas \u2013 has seen a worrisome spike, and has accounted for 90% of the country\u2019s new cases in recent weeks. Argentina has 13,228 confirmed coronavirus cases and 490 deaths so far, with 600 new cases and 19 deaths reported on Tuesday \u2013 a sharp rise from early May when the number of daily new cases was in the low hundreds. Security minister Berni said that the coronavirus situation in Buenos Aires slums would only get worse. \u201cThis is like the Titanic, we\u2019ve got an iceberg ahead and we can chose to hit it head-on or from the side \u2013 but the crash is inevitable.\u201d",

China, as the first country struck by Covid-19, is gradually recovering as lockdown controls are lifted.

      "bodyText": "Decline in new Covid-19 cases The number of new confirmed cases of Covid-19 has been steadily falling from a peak reached after the government lockdown began, even as more tests are being done. New daily cases in London are now close to zero. As of 26 May, 3,681,295 people have been tested, of which 265,227 had coronavirus. The number of daily deaths with Covid-19 has been falling. In total, 37,048 people have died. Markets rally on economy optimism Global financial markets have risen in the past month amid hopes for a vaccine and that the economic fallout from Covid-19 can be contained. Some analysts warn that markets are failing to reflect the scale of the international recession and risk that no vaccine is found. The FTSE 100 has risen 3% in the past month to 6144, recovering ground lost in March when it collapsed, the most since Black Monday in October 1987. Road trips are climbing There are signs lockdown is starting to fray around the edges, with growing numbers of journeys being made. Apple mobility data \u2013 which records requests made to Apple Maps for directions \u2013 suggests driving on Britain\u2019s roads is down 31% from around the start of the year, compared with more than 60% down in early April. Business slump recovers slightly Surveys of business activity show the world economy continued to shrink at a record pace this month, albeit at a slower pace than in April when most major countries\u2019 lockdown measures were toughest. After imposing tight controls on business and social life later than other European countries, Britain\u2019s economy appears to be underperforming many other wealthy nations. China, as the first country struck by Covid-19, is gradually recovering as lockdown controls are lifted. In the UK, the purchasing manager index (PMI) compiled from business surveys by IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply rose to 28.9 in May from a record low of 13.8 in April. However, that is still far below the 50.0 mark that separates economic growth from contraction. First steps into recession taken Official figures show just nine days of lockdown caused gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest measure of the economy, to fall by 5.8% in March, and by 2% in the first three months of the year. Activity declined across the board, with a slump by almost as much in a single month as in the 18-month slide caused by the 2008 financial crisis. Economists regard two consecutive quarters of shrinking GDP as the technical definition of recession. Most forecast a second quarterly decline in the three months to June, given the scale of restrictions on business and social life, with the Bank of England pencilling in a 25% drop. Retail sales plunge during lockdown With people confined to their homes and much of the high street closed, official figures show a drop in retail sales of 5.2% in March was dwarfed by an 18.1% plunge in April \u2013 as the first full month of the lockdown sapped consumer demand. Boris Johnson is attempting to reboot the retail sector from the start of June, allowing non-essential shops to reopen. But with rising job losses and a continued health risks from Covid-19, analysts do not expect a sharp rise in sales soon. Unemployment begins to spiral The number of people claiming unemployment benefits rose by almost 70% in April, the most since records began, to reach 2.1 million as rising numbers of people lose their jobs during the health emergency. Experts said the dramatic increase would have been much higher without the government\u2019s furlough scheme. About a third of the British workforce are receiving wage subsidies from the Treasury at a cost of almost \u00a322bn, with 8.4m jobs protected and 2.3 million self-employed people claiming support. The furlough scheme is due to be scaled back from August. Tumbling oil price sinks inflation Inflation in Britain fell to 0.8% in April, its lowest level in four years, as the collapsing global oil price sent the cost of petrol tumbling. Fading demand for crude as the global economy slips into recession \u2013 as well as a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia \u2013 has caused oil prices to plunge in recent months. Consumer groups have warned that prices of some high-demand products have gone up during the lockdown, but retailers struggling to sell other goods has pushed down general inflation. House prices slide The government effectively putting the housing market in the deep freeze during lockdown, alongside concerns over the economic outlook, has sent house prices sliding. With transaction volumes evaporating, house prices fell by 0.6% in March from a month earlier, according to figures compiled by Halifax \u2013 Britain\u2019s biggest mortgage lender. Some forecasters expect house prices to fall by as much as 13% this year. Government borrowing hits peacetime record The government borrowed a record \u00a362bn in April \u2013 more than had been expected for the whole of 2020. The budget deficit \u2013 the shortfall between state spending and income from taxes \u2013 is spiraling as tax receipts fall off a cliff with the economy largely at a standstill, and as the Treasury steps in with emergency financial support. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury tax and spending watchdog, estimates the deficit could max out close to \u00a3300bn this year, five times the sum borrowed a year ago, and almost twice as much as after the 2008 financial crisis. And another thing \u2026 the Bank of England stands ready to act The Bank of England has crashed interest rates down to the lowest levels in its 325-year history, as Britain slips into the deepest recession for more than three centuries.

      "bodyText": "The US has announced it will no longer treat Hong Kong as autonomous for trade and economic purposes, as China prepares to impose a new security law that would drastically limit civil liberties in the territory. The US decision could have a serious impact on the Hong Kong economy, which has been used by Beijing as a portal for dealings with the outside world \u2013 particularly if its financial sector is hit by sanctions as a result of the move. Beijing is preparing to impose a highly restrictive anti-sedition law on Hong Kong on Thursday, bypassing its legislature, and threatening the freedoms granted its citizens under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy. In response, on Wednesday, Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, announced that the US would no longer maintain special trade relations with Hong Kong or consider it an autonomous region, as it has done since the 1997 handover by the UK to China. \u201cNo reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, given facts on the ground,\u201d Pompeo said, announcing a move that could have serious consequences for Hong Kong\u2019s finance industry. \u201cWhile the United States once hoped that free and prosperous Hong Kong would provide a model for authoritarian China, it is now clear that China is modeling Hong Kong after itself,\u201d the secretary of state said. Experts said the impact of the US decision on Hong Kong and on China would depend to a great degree on how it was implemented. The end of preferential trade status would mean the imposition of the same tariffs that the US applies to Chinese products, but Hong Kong has a limited trade in goods with the US. It could affect travel restrictions and its impact would be hugely amplified if Hong Kong banks were hit by potential new sanctions targeting people and entities held responsible for the violation of the territory\u2019s autonomy. \u201cUltimately we could see capital flight. We could see US businesses moving out of Hong Kong, expats leaving, and the end to Hong Kong as an international financial center as we know it,\u201d Bonnie Glaser, the director of the China power project at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said. \u201cThat may be a worst case picture, it may not be that bad but I think we have to consider that that is one possible outcome.\u201d Joshua Wong, a Hong Kong pro-democracy activist, urged global corporations to support the opposition to the security legislation. \u201cI ... urge US, European and Asia\u2019s leaders to reconsider whether Hong Kong\u2019s special trade status can still be held since, once the law is implemented, Hong Kong will be assimilated into China\u2019s authoritarian regime, on both rule of law and human rights protections,\u201d Wong wrote on Twitter. Tensions over Hong Kong have combined with accusations over blame for the pandemic and military posturing across the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea, to drive US-China relations to a dangerous new low. Xi Jinping told military officers that in the wake of the coronavirus epidemic: \u201cIt is necessary to step up preparations for armed combat, to flexibly carry out actual combat military training, and to improve our military\u2019s ability to perform military missions.\u201d At a separate meeting on the sidelines of the the National People\u2019s Congress, the defence minister, General Wei Fenghe, said:\u201cThe US has intensified the suppression and containment of our side since the [coronavirus] outbreak, and the Sino-US strategic confrontation has entered a period of high risk.\u201d \u201cWe must strengthen our fighting spirit, be daring to fight and be good at fighting, and use fighting to promote stability.\u201d",

Apparently unclear about how NRPF operates, Johnson asked why they were not eligible for benefits like universal credit, with Timms having to explain their situation again, and what NRPF involves. Johnson said he would look at how the scheme works: \u201cYou\u2019ve raised a very, very important point if a condition of their leave to remain is that they should have no recourse to public funds. I will find out how many there are in that position, and we will see what we can do to help.\u201d Test, track and trace did not happen at first due to lack of testing This has been strongly hinted at before by government scientific advisers, but answering questions from Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary who now chairs the health committee, Johnson was very open. \u201cWe did have a test, track and trace operation but unfortunately we did not have the capacity in Public Health England,\u201d he said. \u201cTo be absolutely blunt, we didn\u2019t have the enzymes, we didn\u2019t have the test kits, we just didn\u2019t have the volume, nor did we have enough experienced trackers ready to mount the kind of operation they did in some other east Asian countries, for instance,\u201d he said. He would like more women at the daily Covid-19 press conferences Quizzed by Caroline Nokes, the Tory MP who chairs the women and equalities committee, Johnson said: \u201cIt\u2019s certainly true that I would have liked to have had more female representation at the press conferences so far.\u201d Asked by Nokes how many women would be \u201cenough\u201d representation, Johnson appeared to laugh, and was reprimanded by Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative who chairs the liaison committee, who reminded him this was a serious matter. While some of the scientists at the press conferences have been women, among the ministers, only the home secretary, Priti Patel, has appeared on occasions.",

      "bodyText": "France, Italy and Belgium have all taken steps against the use of hydroxychloroquine in treating patients with Covid-19 as safety concerns over the drug, touted by Donald Trump and Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro, continue to grow. Paris on Wednesday revoked a decree allowing doctors to use the drug with severely ill coronavirus patients, while the Italian and Belgian medicine agencies either suspended or warned against its use except in clinical trials. Days after the World Health Organization suspended a global trial of the drug citing safety concerns, Oxford University also paused an international hydroxychloroquine trial less than a week after it started. An observational study published in the Lancet of nearly 100,000 patients in 671 hospitals has suggested hydroxychloroquine \u2013 promoted by the controversial French infectious diseases specialist Didier Raoult \u2013 might increase mortality rates. Meanwhile, research by France\u2019s Pasteur Institute suggested 98% of people with mild coronavirus developed antibodies capable of neutralising the virus a month later, raising hopes that everyone who has had the disease may enjoy some immunity. As the EU unveiled a proposed \u20ac750bn (\u00a3673bn) recovery plan \u2013 the biggest EU stimulus package in history \u2013 to get the continent back on its feet after the economic devastation wrought by the pandemic, Latin America overtook Europe and the US in the number of new daily infections. The European Commission plan was proposed to the European parliament and 26 member states on Wednesday, aimed at helping the worst-affected countries \u2013 in particular Italy and Spain \u2013 with a mixture of \u20ac500bn of grants and \u20ac250bn of loans. Under the commission\u2019s blueprint, Italy would get \u20ac82bn in grants, Spain \u20ac77bn, France \u20ac39bn, Poland \u20ac37bn and Germany \u20ac29bn. The EU\u2019s economic affairs commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni, called the package a \u201cEuropean breakthrough\u201d that would \u201ctackle an unprecedented crisis\u201d, but it is far from being a done deal: a so-called frugal four northern members are opposed to shared debt and cash handouts for already debt-laden nations. Spain on Wednesday began 10 days of official mourning for the more than 27,000 people who have died of Covid-19, as Moscow\u2019s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, announced an easing of the Russian capital\u2019s lockdown from 1 June. Infections continued to creep up in and around Seoul, South Korea, prompting Jeong Eun-kyeong, the director of Korea Centers for Disease control and Prevention, to say social distancing measures eased in April may need to be reimposed. South Korea reported 40 new cases on Wednesday, its biggest daily rise in nearly 50 days, as officials scrambled to trace hundreds of infections linked to nightclubs, restaurants and a massive e-commerce warehouse near Seoul. \u201cWe will do our best to trace contacts and implement preventive measures,\u201d Jeong said, \u201cbut there\u2019s a limit to such efforts. There\u2019s a need to maximise social distancing in areas where the virus is circulating, to force people to avoid public facilities and other crowded spaces.\u201d Countries across the Middle East, meanwhile, are cautiously eyeing a return to normality after the end of the Eid al-Fitr holiday. A four-day lockdown was lifted in Turkey, with shopping malls and hairdressers reopening on Wednesday morning. In government-held Syria, mosques reopened and inter-city travel was allowed again, while mosques in Saudi Arabia reopen for Friday prayer from this week.

In other developments: Bulgaria will allow restaurants, bars and cafes to reopen at full capacity on Monday, further easing restrictions imposed in mid-March. Officials in Strasbourg, France have appealed for hundreds of spectators who attended an illegal football match at the weekend to be tested for Covid-19. People in Poland will be allowed to go outside without masks from 30 May as long as they can keep two metres apart. Masks are still mandatory on public transport and in shops. Switzerland announced on Wednesday it would remove most of its remaining restrictions on 6 June, when all leisure and entertainment activities will resume if appropriate precautions are in place.",

It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.</p>\n    <p>Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.</p>\n    <p>It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.</p>\n    <p>South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.</p>\n    <p>Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany.

      "bodyText": "It was meant to be the system that would allow the country to emerge confidently from lockdown. But the development of the NHS tracing system has been characterised by missteps, conflict and frustration behind the scenes. At the heart of the difficulties have been tensions between central government and local public health officials, or as one insider complained: \u201cThere has been control freakery from start to finish by the NHS and the Department of Health.\u201d Public health officials say systems and protocols to manage so-called \u201ccomplex cases\u201d involving central and local cooperation, such as the outbreak in Weston-super-Mare, have not yet been fully worked out days before schools start reopening on 1 June. \u201cI think councils will be told who will need extra help because they are vulnerable in a shielded category, and that\u2019s about it,\u201d the official added, saying there had been difficult meetings between officials from both sides. Tensions came to the fore after it became clear that a mobile phone app trumpeted by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, as being ready to launch nationally \u201cmid May\u201d was beset with technical difficulties. There is now no set date for its launch. That switched attention to what was intended to be a supplementary system of national call centres, where 25,000 people, including more than 6,000 clinicians, had been hastily recruited to interview people testing positive for coronavirus and ask who they had been in contact with. Public health experts believed they had the expertise that people who had been trained with the help of a script did not have. But they claim that for weeks during March and April they were sidelined and only became actively involved in May after \u201ca massive campaign behind the scenes\u201d to get them on board. Working within local councils, contact tracers have been employed for decades, tackling infections such as tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases. It is an interview-based process that requires experience and tact to obtain sometimes sensitive information from sick individuals, and employs dozens of people in large councils scattered across environmental and sexual health teams, although the services have been hit hard by spending cuts. Meanwhile, some of those hired for the national contact tracing centres have had relatively cursory training. One told the Guardian that the guidance on doing the job simply consisted of watching videos and reading scripts. \u201cI have not been given any details of who to call if I have problems. Only an email address has been provided which largely goes unanswered.\u201d Others warned that they had little experience of using computer systems intended to help them talk through cases.

But he also conceded there had been problems with the training process. \u201cInevitably, I am afraid, we will have made some mistakes along the way and if it has all felt a bit clunky and rushed, I apologise.\u201d Insiders have been reluctant to go public because they want the tracing system to succeed but some have told the Guardian they would have liked more time and that a three-month joint effort, including local public health experts from the start, could have created a comprehensive system for England. On Tuesday a letter from Public Health England to councils\u2019 directors of public health asked for information on the \u201ccurrent resources\u201d devoted to managing the more serious outbreaks, an audit that could have happened weeks ago. Once it became clear the system would be entirely reliant on patient interviews at launch because the app was not ready, ministers were keen to link up with local authorities. Last Friday it was announced there would be a new \u00a3300m fund for local authorities in England to support test-and-trace services, with a promise that data on the spread of the coronavirus would be shared with local authorities. Dido Harding, chair of the NHS Test and Trace service, said that the role of public health officials was hugely important in tackling a game of virus \u201cwhackamole\u201d.

It\u2019s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially.

That means each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.</p>\n    <p>The reproduction number is not fixed, though. It depends on the biology of the virus; people's behaviour, such as social distancing;&nbsp;and a population\u2019s immunity.

      "bodyText": "Tina Case paints a bleak picture when asked about the last two months at her family daycare service in Woy Woy on the New South Wales central coast. Case has been driven to the point of near financial ruin. She\u2019s had to defer car loans and rely on money from her sons to help pay off a home loan taken out just before the pandemic, all while providing more hours of care without any added pay. Paradoxically, the source of her pain has not been Covid-19 itself, but the $1.6bn government package designed to save her. \u201cIt\u2019s been probably the hardest time in my life,\u201d Case says. \u201cThe financial stress has just been so overwhelming.\u201d Case spoke to Guardian Australia just days after the education minister, Dan Tehan, proclaimed that the government\u2019s support package for the childcare sector had \u201cdone its job \u2026 quite successfully\u201d since its introduction in early April. The package, an important part of the government\u2019s overall coronavirus response, worked by giving operators 50% of the revenue they usually received, based on fees received in a fortnight in February, before the pandemic. That measure was designed to work in tandem with the jobkeeper wage subsidy to keep services afloat, kids in childcare and parents at work. In return, childcare providers were not allowed to charge parents fees and were required to remain open. There is no doubting that, for many childcare services, the package has been a lifeline. The government\u2019s review of its first four weeks suggests 99% of the roughly 13,400 centres remained open as of 13 May. A survey conducted just before the government\u2019s announcement by peak group Australian Childcare Alliance, which represents the majority of the nation\u2019s privately owned early learning services, found 30% were expecting to close due to falling occupancy rates caused by the pandemic. For major corporates such as G8 Education, the announcement provided an immediate boost to share prices. But the package also effectively forced other services to run at a loss, either because it was ill-suited to some segments of the childcare sector, such as small family daycare operators, or didn\u2019t properly account for a highly casualised workforce with large numbers of workers on temporary visas, who were not eligible for jobkeeper. One-quarter of services surveyed in the four-week review of the scheme reported that it hadn\u2019t helped them remain financially viable. Case\u2019s story is illuminating in understanding why. When Covid-19 hit, she found herself providing vastly more hours of care for her children, not less. What was previously only before and after-school care suddenly turned into entire days for most of her children. In normal circumstances, she would have taken in more fees from parents. But the support package prevented her from doing so and, worse, entitled her only to 50% of the income she was receiving prior to the pandemic. She felt she couldn\u2019t turn children away, and doing so would have dragged parents out of the workforce, an outcome completely contrary to the scheme\u2019s aims. \u201cThere are three schoolchildren I\u2019ve got that I don\u2019t get paid for, so there\u2019s hundreds if not thousands that I\u2019m out of pocket on,\u201d Case said. \u201cBut I still do it because they\u2019re my families ... I do love what I do.\u201d She spent six weeks waiting for approval for jobkeeper. Case says she would have been better off without the government support package. The scheme makes provision to pay extra for those in exceptional circumstances, including those who, like Case, have increased attendance. But of the 168 applications for the exceptional circumstances supplementary payment made by family daycare providers, only 5% have been approved. The rate is about 36% for centre-based care, and 75% for outside school hours care. In a submission to government this week, Family Day Care Australia said the system\u2019s failings \u201chave generated immense financial and emotional distress for a majority of family daycare educators and services\u201d. Chief executive Andrew Paterson said the support package is hampered by its inflexibility and its inability to recognise the differing circumstances and varying demand across the sector. \u201cThe current funding framework does not support the higher levels of attendance that have been maintained in family daycare throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, nor does it support any capacity for growth,\u201d Paterson told Guardian Austraia. \u201cThis is becoming increasingly problematic for the sector and for families as Covid-19 restrictions are wound back.\u201d Paterson and his members say the end of the support package cannot come soon enough. They, along with others in the sector, are now preparing for what comes next. Paul Mondo, the president of the Australian Childcare Alliance, predicts the next six weeks will pose an immense challenge to childcare operators. Children will begin to return to care in increased numbers, he says, due to Australia\u2019s remarkable recovery. \u201c[But] the limitations of the current arrangements will impact the number of children services can provide care for,\u201d Mondo says. The package was put in place for three months from April with an option to extend it for another three. The Coalition government has indicated the support is not likely to continue in its current form beyond 28 June. That has concerned many, who warn the lingering economic crisis, coupled with a sudden loss of free childcare, will turn families away. Unemployment continues to rise sharply, belts will keep tightening, and parents will soon face the prospect of somehow meeting childcare fees with no work or insecure work. Prue Warrilow, the national convenor of not-for-profit peak group Australian Community Children\u2019s Services, predicts the sector will struggle to maintain the occupancy rates needed to remain viable without ongoing government support. \u201cYou can\u2019t switch off free childcare on Friday and go back to [childcare subsidy] on Monday. That\u2019s just not going to be possible,\u201d Warrilow told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe financial crunch is going to come in a six-to-nine-month period for many families, I think you\u2019re going to see utilisation of children\u2019s services decrease quite dramatically because families won\u2019t be able to afford childcare unless there is a staged transition process.\u201d There are widely held fears in the sector about simply reverting back to the previous arrangements, which provided financial support to families for childcare in the form of the childcare subsidy (CCS). The CCS relies on an activity test, which pegs parents\u2019 eligibility to the number of hours they work each week. Such an approach would ignore the mass unemployment and lack of secure work Covid-19 has caused. For a sector not without division, there is clear unity that the activity test must change dramatically or be suspended for the foreseeable future. Mondo says it is \u201cvitally important\u201d that exemptions be made to the test to ensure children continue to receive care. \u201cWe know that the government did consider and apply such exemptions during the bushfires earlier this year and have confidence that they are actively considering supporting families in this way as we transition out of the Covid crisis and into the economic one,\u201d he said. Lisa Bryant, an education and care advocate and consultant, also warns against relying on a work activity test at a time when 600,000 more people are unemployed across Australia due to Covid-19. The consequences would be dire, both in terms of family access and provider viability, Bryant said. \u201cIf a woman loses her job, then the child\u2019s family is only able to get 16 hours of funded subsidy a week,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cFor most services that means only one day a week. So if a family suddenly can only afford to get subsidised care for a day a week, and only one person is working, then they\u2019re not going to be able to afford the four days that they used to have. So occupancy will fall dramatically.\u201d The government offers a temporary hardship payment to give additional subsidies to those struggling. But the subsidy boost is generally only available for 13 weeks. \u201cWe know that it\u2019s going to be years before some people get their jobs back,\u201d Bryant said. Warrilow believes an effective solution would be to revert back to old arrangements that gave all families, regardless of their work activity, eligibility for two days of free childcare a week. She said that would be the best way to help service operators and aid the most vulnerable of Australian families. \u201cThe families that are not able to meet the work activity test, and because it\u2019s a more generous test under CCS, are those that are really struggling. They don\u2019t know how to do school volunteering, they don\u2019t know how to be looking for work, so they\u2019re long-term intergenerationally unemployed. \u201cBy excluding those families we are exacerbating that problem. So if we had a minimum of two days for every family, that would make a significant difference to utilisation and service viability moving forward.\u201d",

We are partnering with commercial industry with the intent that they would go get customers that are not Nasa, drive down our costs and increase the access to space.\u201d Closer to blast-off - optimism spreading Gray skies, thunderstorms and even a tornado warning made for a depressing scene at the Kennedy Space Centre as the countdown continued, but mission managers remained optimistic of an on-time launch at 4.33pm, Richard Luscombe writes from Florida, for the Guardian. Astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley are strapped into their seats aboard the Dragon crew capsule that might, or might not, blast off today for the International Space Station. Launch director Mike Taylor told them he was monitoring a large collection of heavy clouds moving east from Orlando, that he said would be the \u201cdecision gate\u201d for a final go-no go call before fuelling is set to begin about 3.45pm. But he said they appeared to be \u201ceroding\u201d. The weather appears to be the only obstacle remaining to be overcome. SpaceX headquarters reports that the Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule are technically sound and all systems are \u201cgo for launch\u201d. Air Force One has just flown low over the space centre, giving Donald Trump a close-up view of the launchpad as he arrived to watch the launch. SpaceX managers have taken another launch poll and decided to go ahead with fueling. This is a good sign - it means most of the traditional constraints to launch have been cleared. The weather is \u201ctrending in the right direction\u201d SpaceX says, but it\u2019s still not completely a done deal. Good afternoon, Guardian US readers and blog fans, we\u2019re going to run a live blog to cover the historic launch that\u2019s scheduled for just past the half hour of the NASA-SpaceX partnership blasting two American astronauts into Space from US soil. Stay tuned for up-to-the-minute developments over the next few hours. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening: Nasa, in partnership with Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, plans to launch Falcon 9 rocket from the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral in Florida at 4.33pm ET (US Eastern Time), carrying two American astronauts on their way to the International Space Station. Not since the retirement of Nasa\u2019s space shuttle fleet in 2011 has the US possessed the capability to send its own astronauts into orbit on US kit from American soil, and the success of this mission, formally known as SpaceX Demo-2, is likely to shape the direction of the space agency\u2019s near-Earth ambitions for a generation.There are weather worries ahead of blast-off. The decision was made this morning to keep the launch on track, but everyone will be on edge until the last minute. Tropical thunderstorms have been forecast and there was even a tornado warning a little earlier.Donald Trump and Melania Trump are attending the launch. The president just retweeted a Nasa post saying: \u201cHistory is about to be made.\u201d Astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley are the lucky pair in the capsule, blasting off from a coronavirus pandemic-ridden, climate crisis-fried Earth into Space because...Space is the final frontier.",

The men, who are all Indigenous, are predominantly based in Dubbo. The department has never publicly disclosed the settlements, which in some cases included confidentiality clauses preventing disclosure of the value of the payouts. Nor has it acknowledged the existence of a serial paedophile in the public school system, a step that might have encouraged others to come forward.</p> \n<p><strong>360 people have been arrested in Hong Kong, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/hong-kong-trump-china-security-crackdown-protests\">as thousands of armed police clashed with demonstrators</a> engaged in day-long protests,</strong> sparked by China\u2019s plans to introduce sweeping anti-sedition laws in the former British territory. Those arrested have been charged with offences including unauthorised assembly and possession of objects such as petrol bombs, with police firing pepper-spray bullets into assembled crowds, gathered to prevent the passing of a law criminalising ridicule of China\u2019s national anthem. The EU has called on China to respect Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, but on Wednesday US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/hong-kong-china-autonomous-us-pompeo-security-law\">paved the way to revoke the territory\u2019s&nbsp;preferential trade and financial status</a>, telling Congress the Trump administration no longer regards Hong Kong as autonomous from mainland China.</p> \n<p><strong>Two-thirds of Australians in households where the main breadwinner has lost employment are living below the poverty line,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/28/poverty-findings-heighten-calls-to\">a major new report has found</a>.

The department has never publicly disclosed the settlements, which in some cases included confidentiality clauses preventing disclosure of the value of the payouts. Nor has it acknowledged the existence of a serial paedophile in the public school system, a step that might have encouraged others to come forward. 360 people have been arrested in Hong Kong, as thousands of armed police clashed with demonstrators engaged in day-long protests, sparked by China\u2019s plans to introduce sweeping anti-sedition laws in the former British territory. Those arrested have been charged with offences including unauthorised assembly and possession of objects such as petrol bombs, with police firing pepper-spray bullets into assembled crowds, gathered to prevent the passing of a law criminalising ridicule of China\u2019s national anthem. The EU has called on China to respect Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, but on Wednesday US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, paved the way to revoke the territory\u2019s preferential trade and financial status, telling Congress the Trump administration no longer regards Hong Kong as autonomous from mainland China. Two-thirds of Australians in households where the main breadwinner has lost employment are living below the poverty line, a major new report has found. The research commissioned by the Australian Council of Social Services also suggests those already relying on social security before Covid-19 were five times more likely to be living in poverty, with Acoss calling for a thorough overhaul of the benefits system in the light of the coronavirus pandemic. Australia Electricity retailers could be allowed to put network costs on hold amid fears bankruptcies could spark \u201cfinancial contagion\u201d, the Australian Energy Market Commission has announced. More than 20,000 households have registered for payment plans since March, placing financial stress on retailers. Building product suppliers Boral have been hit with a major shareholder class action, just days after the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, used emergency powers to change regulations to shield companies from such legal challenges. Boral have been accused of making misleading or deceptive statements to the market. Suburban Sydney could be poised for a major \u201crat plague\u201d, as empty offices and closed restaurants in the CBD drive rat populations towards the periphery, with one leading rat-catcher saying callouts are up by at least 30% during the lockdown, with declining food stocks also driving some rats to cannibalism. The world President Trump has threatened to \u201cclose down\u201d social media platforms that \u201csilence conservatives voices\u201d, a day after Twitter affixed warning labels to several of the president\u2019s tweets, suggesting that he had posted misleading information. Boris Johnson\u2019s beleaguered chief adviser Dominic Cummings is facing further scrutiny for flouting UK lockdown, with senior government minister, Penny Mordaunt, criticising \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in his account of his movements. A French medical study has raised hopes that even mild cases of the coronavirus can lead to longer-term immunity, in a finding that could have major consequences for public health response strategies. Two hikers, lost for 18 days, have been rescued in New Zealand, with police hailing a \u201cfantastic outcome\u201d after an extensive search was hampered by bad weather in the 450,000-hectare Kahurangi national park in the South Island. Recommended reads If you\u2019re lucky to have a steady home at this time, improving it has become a compulsion. After Josephine Tovey\u2019s flatmate moved out with almost all the interior furnishings, the imperative to make a home was thrust upon her. \u201cI\u2019m surprised by how quickly I have become a home obsessive.

In part three of our special investigation, Stimulus under scrutiny, we look at why the federal government\u2019s childcare recovery package has sent some operators to the brink of collapse. The latest construction data released illustrates that even before the coronavirus crisis, Australia\u2019s economy was in dire need of stimulus, writes Greg Jericho: \u201cThe failure of the construction sector \u2013 and by extension the failure of the economy \u2013 prior to the coronavirus lays at the feet of the government, for it desired a return to surplus above economic growth and determined the best way to stimulate the economy was through tax cuts and the Reserve Bank cutting interest rates.\u201d The coronavirus pandemic has encouraged many Australians to revisit classic novels. For author of The Erratics, Vicki Laveau-Harvie, the Australian book you\u2019ve finally got time to read is Clive James\u2019 Sentenced to Life. \u201cPoetry may be the antidote to what many of us feel: we are glued to screens, numb with fear, lost in elastic expanses of time. Poetry\u2019s density can steady us. It contains worlds.\u201d Listen The rise and fall of Alan Jones. A divisive and polarising figure across his four decades in broadcasting, on this week\u2019s episode of Full Story, Guardian Australia\u2019s media reporter, Amanda Meade, explores the controversial shock jock\u2019s legacy.

The NRL becomes Australia\u2019s first major league to return to the field on Thursday night, despite there being no end in sight to the Covid-19 pandemic, Larissa O\u2019Connor writes. Follow the grand return with our liveblog from 7.30pm (AEST). LeBron James has joined a chorus of athletes expressing anger over the death of George Floyd, with the NBA star, F1\u2019s Lewis Hamilton and Colin Kaepernick all taking to social media to condemn the death of the 46-year-old after a white police officer knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck. Media roundup Queensland is poised to lose $769m in tourism revenue for every month its borders remain closed, claims the Australian, with interstate visitors constituting nearly half of the state\u2019s domestic market. Workplace reforms will be put before parliament with or without union and employer buy-in, reports the Age, with the industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, set for a crucial meeting with the ACTU next week. And, a 51-year-old Sydney man has been charged for the murder of Nicole Cartwright on her birthday in 2018, after the two met on a dating app, in what police called a \u201ccallous and heinous\u201d act, writes the ABC. Coming up Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, will appear before the Senate select committee on Covid-19 today, as well as the heads of Apra and Asic. And if you\u2019ve read this far \u2026 It\u2019s no Big Merino, but lockdown boredom may have just delivered Australia its next \u201cBig Thing\u201d.

The former chancellor Sajid Javid also said the journey was not \u201cnecessary or justified\u201d as the number of backbenchers calling for Cummings to resign or be sacked grew to 44, with a total of 61 Tory MPs weighing in to criticise him.

In an email sent to constituents, Mordaunt said Cummings\u2019 continued position was a \u201cmatter for the prime minister\u201d but she could \u201cfully understand how angry people are\u201d and believed there was no doubt he \u201ctook risks\u201d.

Almost twice as many men as women are dying of Covid-19, various studies show, including data from New York city\u2019s health department. 80% of deaths, 53% of intensive care admissions and 45% of hospitalizations, are people 65 and older according to an early CDC analysis in March. More than 200 children in the US and Europe have been hit by an inflammatory syndrome that may be linked to the coronavirus that has killed several, and shaken a belief children were less at risk from the virus. It is similar to Kawasaki syndrome. Race Almost three times as many black people are dying of the virus compared to white people and at least 20,000 African Americans have died, according to Amp Research Lab. The virus is twice as deadly for black and Latinos than white people in New York City, preliminary data suggests. African Americans are 70% of all coronavirus cases in Chicago, which is 30% black, and more than half of the state\u2019s deaths, by early April. Location and occupations Up to half of the deaths in some US states have been nursing home residents or workers, studies have indicated. There have been 55 deaths at one Brooklyn nursing home, the Cobble Hill health center, according to reports. Dozens of medical workers have died; the CDC says at least 27 are confirmed to have died, but this is likely to be a significant undercount. As many as 20% of cases of Covid-19 are medical staff in some states. Scores of grocery workers have died across the country. Fifty-nine members of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union have died, Axios reports. There have been 81 employees testing positive at one Walmart in Massachusetts, according to reports. At least 64 meat plant workers have died from the virus nationwide and 16,600 have become infected at 32 plants in 19 states, according to the MidWest Center for Investigative Reporting. 80% of inmates tested positive for Covid-19 at one Ohio prison and across the US, prisons and jails have reported large outbreaks, which could spread out to the community. Testing and the response 5m Covid-19 tests a day would be carried out \u201cvery soon\u201d in the US, Donald Trump promised on 28 April. This many tests would be needed by early June to begin reopening the economy, according to a report by Harvard University\u2019s Edmond J Safra Center for Ethics 900,000 tests a day by mid-May should be the target, according to the research group Harvard\u2019s Global Health Institute. Only just over 300,000 tests a day were being carried out by mid-May, according to the daily tracking by the Covid Tracking Project. 1,000 contact tracers \u2013 New York is trying to recruit this many tracers by 1 June as part of efforts to advance reopening. About $400m per year is contributed to the World Health Organization by the US but President Trump has frozen this, during the height of the global pandemic, and criticized its links with China. Controversial treatments and anti-vaxxers A more than 1,000% surge in online demand for hydroxychloroquine came after Donald Trump backed the anti-malaria drug as a potential treatment for Covid-19, a study found, despite evidence it doesn\u2019t work. Almost 23% of adults in one poll said they would not be willing to take a vaccine against Covid-19 if it became available, amid concern from experts at the impact of the anti-vaxxer movement. Economic fallout Almost 39 million Americans have lost their jobs in the last few weeks \u2013 more than 10% of the entire US population, and more than 20% of the working population. 14.7% was the official unemployment rate in May, up from 4.4%, a figure that probably significantly underestimates the true scale of job losses, which are at a rate unseen since the 1930s Great Depression. 40% of households earning less than $40,000 have experienced job losses, according to the Federal Reserve. Only 20% of black workers reported being eligible to work from home, compared with about 30% of their white counterparts, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Businesses More than 100,000 small businesses have permanently closed since March, an academic study says. 3% of restaurants have permanently closed, 44% have temporarily closed and 11% say they expect to close permanently in the next month, according to research from the National Restaurant Association. 2,800 flights were in US airspace on 29 March, compared with 6,800 on 1 March, according to Flightradar24. $4bn could be lost by baseball team owners if there is not a season in 2020, according to Rob Manfred, commissioner of the MLB. Health insurance Up to 43 million people face losing their job-based health coverage since the coronavirus, according to the Urban Institute and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. That is nearly one-quarter of all Americans who rely on job-based insurance. As many as 7 million people will be unable to find new health insurance coverage, according to the same report, joining 28 million who already lacked insurance. Food supply An average of 63% more food was being sought by food banks and pantries around the US in the wake of widespread job losses, according to Feeding America. 2.6% was the rise last month in grocery prices, the largest such jump since the 1970s, the Washington Post reported, citing the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Meats, poultry, fish and eggs were among the goods going up in price. This article was amended on 27 May 2020 to add a word that had been unintentionally omitted, to clarify that research shows hydroxychloroquine is not an effective treatment for Covid-19.",

Macmillan Cancer Support said the disease risks becoming \u201cthe forgotten C\u201d of the coronavirus pandemic, with evidence of patients having appointments cancelled or postponed, while others awaiting possible diagnosis say they are put off attending hospitals due to concerns about contracting the virus. It follows a study from the Institute of Cancer Research, London, that suggested putting off cancer surgeries for three months could lead to almost 5,000 excess deaths in England alone. A survey of 100 cancer patients who support Macmillan\u2019s campaigning work showed almost half (45%) had seen their cancer treatment delayed, cancelled or changed as a result of coronavirus. Steven McIntosh, Macmillan Cancer Support policy director, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a very worrying drop in the number of people coming forward with suspected cancer symptoms to be referred for diagnosis by their GPs. \u201cWe estimate that disruptions to GP referrals \u2013 screening programmes \u2013 could mean as many as 1,900 cases of cancer a week are currently going undiagnosed. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re warning that the size of this ticking time bomb is deeply worrying for people who are living with cancer but also for storing up huge problems for the NHS in trying to diagnose and treat cancer, when we have also seen significant disruption to cancer surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy.\u201d The 1,900 figure is based on evidence given to Parliament last month by Dame Cally Palmer, national cancer director for NHS England, who said that two-week referrals - where GPs send patients with suspected cancer to specialists for further investigation - were down by almost two-thirds. Macmillan is calling on the government to set out clear plans for restoring cancer care that clarify how cancer patients will have access to timely diagnosis and treatment, with surge capacity to catch up on the backlog of care coronavirus has caused. Prof Charles Swanton, chief clinician at Cancer Research UK, who is leading the Covid-19 testing laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute, said that late diagnosis is a major concern and that Covid protected zones need to be urgently established in hospitals to allow cancer screening and treatment to restart. \u201cWe need to build confidence back in the system so that patients can be seen safely, treated and protected,\u201d he said. This would require widespread, routine, rapid testing of healthcare workers and routine testing of patients on admission. \u201cWe basically need to make Covid testing part of the fabric of modern life until this is in the distant past,\u201d he said. An analysis of official health data by Macmillan also suggested that cancer deaths may already have increased due to disruption to care caused by Covid-19. It found that in England and Wales there were at least 500 more deaths from cancer than average in March and April this year. McIntosh said: \u201cMacmillan is deeply concerned that the impact of the pandemic is really going to wreak havoc in the progress we\u2019ve made in improving cancer care in the UK, in both the public\u2019s willingness to come forward with symptoms because they\u2019re nervous about the medical system, and in the risk of disruption to treatment and cancer surgery. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important that we send out a strong message to the public: you\u2019ve got to come forward with cancer symptoms, and that governments demonstrate we have cancer care back on track, being delivered safely. \u201cWe need to catch up with treatment so that we don\u2019t see a serious spike in cancer deaths and we prevent people living anxiously in fear of both coronavirus and undiagnosed cancer.\u201d Swanton said that clearing the backlog of missed appointments and delayed treatment would be a major challenge in the coming months. \u201cThe system is stretched even in peacetime,\u201d he said. \u201cMy concern is the NHS is going to be very stretched at the point when normal work resumes.\u201d The charity saw a rise in demand for a number of its services and has launched new virtual ones \u2013 such as telephone buddying \u2013to prevent people with cancer from falling through the cracks.

They were ordered to shield at home until the end of June, although their employers did not have to furlough them.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/about-us/policy/policy-research-topics/welfare-policy-research-surveys-and-consultation-responses/welfare-policy-research/ensuring-people-do-not-fall-through-the-gaps-in-the-governments-employment-support-schemes/\">Research</a> by Citizens Advice found that of the 2,000 people contacting them since 14 April for help, over 70% of those who were shielding had not been furloughed.</p> <p>The research also found that more than one in 10 of the shielded group were working outside the home, including people who had undergone organ transplants or who had serious lung conditions.</p> <p>Dame Gillian Guy, chief executive of <a href=\"https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/\">Citizens Advice</a>, said: \u201cPeople who are shielding have a right to be furloughed while their health is at risk [otherwise] some will face an impossible choice: paying the bills or protecting their health.\u201d</p> <p>Faye, a care home worker, has to shield because she has blood cancer. She is currently furloughed but is expected back at work on 19 June. \u201cI watch the daily broadcast every single night waiting for something, but I\u2019ve heard nothing about people with illnesses who work,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know which way to turn: do I go back to work and take the chance?\u201d</p> <p>Around 118,000 people have bought employment cases through Citizens Advice since lockdown began. More than a quarter of those shielding had lost 60% of their income since the coronavirus outbreak began. Four in 10 have lost at least 20%.&nbsp;</p> <p>Some had been denied access to the furlough scheme. Others were initially furloughed but have since been asked to return to frontline roles as shop workers and delivery drivers, and felt unable to refuse.&nbsp;</p> <p>The government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/vulnerable-not-exempt-from-coronavirus-furlough-winding-down-employers-told\">told charities</a> and social enterprise employers that when it brings the coronavirus job retention scheme to a close, there will be no exemption for vulnerable workers.</p> <p>Sarah, a mother of two, has been told her three-year-old daughter must shield due to asthma and allergies. Sarah is currently furloughed from work at a preschool, but has been told she will have to take unpaid leave if she does not return to work when it opens on 1 June.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/vulnerable-not-exempt-from-coronavirus-furlough-winding-down-employers-told\">Vulnerable not exempt from furlough winding down, employers told</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019ve basically been told to choose between my daughter\u2019s health or keeping food on the table,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful.

Employers have no legal obligation to furlough an employee who is shielding.</p> <p>Debbie Nolan, health programme lead at Citizens Advice Liverpool, coordinates calls with people in the shielded group to check on their wellbeing. She said: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a surge in concerns about health and safety over the past two weeks as people with serious medical conditions, and those they live with, are asked to return to work.\u201d</p> <p><strong>A government spokesperson said: </strong>\u201cWe understand the huge sacrifices those being asked to shield from coronavirus are making, and we are determined to give them the support they need at this unprecedented time.</p> <p>\u201cThe safer workplace guidance sets out clearly that the government advice on vulnerable and shielded groups continues to apply.

      "bodyText": "A loophole in government guidance has caused some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable people to lose up to 60% of their income and is now forcing many to put their health at risk as lockdown comes to an end, one of the UK\u2019s biggest charities has warned. Around 2.5 million UK residents, hundreds of thousands of whom are in employment, have been identified by the government as being \u201cextremely clinically vulnerable\u201d. They were ordered to shield at home until the end of June, although their employers did not have to furlough them. Research by Citizens Advice found that of the 2,000 people contacting them since 14 April for help, over 70% of those who were shielding had not been furloughed. The research also found that more than one in 10 of the shielded group were working outside the home, including people who had undergone organ transplants or who had serious lung conditions. Dame Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \u201cPeople who are shielding have a right to be furloughed while their health is at risk [otherwise] some will face an impossible choice: paying the bills or protecting their health.\u201d Faye, a care home worker, has to shield because she has blood cancer. She is currently furloughed but is expected back at work on 19 June. \u201cI watch the daily broadcast every single night waiting for something, but I\u2019ve heard nothing about people with illnesses who work,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know which way to turn: do I go back to work and take the chance?\u201d Around 118,000 people have bought employment cases through Citizens Advice since lockdown began. More than a quarter of those shielding had lost 60% of their income since the coronavirus outbreak began. Four in 10 have lost at least 20%. Some had been denied access to the furlough scheme. Others were initially furloughed but have since been asked to return to frontline roles as shop workers and delivery drivers, and felt unable to refuse. The government has told charities and social enterprise employers that when it brings the coronavirus job retention scheme to a close, there will be no exemption for vulnerable workers. Sarah, a mother of two, has been told her three-year-old daughter must shield due to asthma and allergies. Sarah is currently furloughed from work at a preschool, but has been told she will have to take unpaid leave if she does not return to work when it opens on 1 June. \u201cI\u2019ve basically been told to choose between my daughter\u2019s health or keeping food on the table,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful. I can\u2019t concentrate, I can\u2019t sleep, I can hardly eat.\u201d Those who come under Public Health England\u2019s shielding guidance are only entitled to statutory sick pay. Employers have no legal obligation to furlough an employee who is shielding. Debbie Nolan, health programme lead at Citizens Advice Liverpool, coordinates calls with people in the shielded group to check on their wellbeing. She said: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a surge in concerns about health and safety over the past two weeks as people with serious medical conditions, and those they live with, are asked to return to work.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe understand the huge sacrifices those being asked to shield from coronavirus are making, and we are determined to give them the support they need at this unprecedented time. \u201cThe safer workplace guidance sets out clearly that the government advice on vulnerable and shielded groups continues to apply. We expect employers to be understanding in situations where people aren\u2019t able to work and need to stay at home in order to follow this advice.\u201d",

Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest news:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>More than 40 Tory MPs have now called for Dominic Cummings to go. </strong>With Downing Street continuing to defend him, the senior government minister Penny Mordaunt also said there were \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in Cummings\u2019 account of his actions and apologised to her constituents for how recent days were distracting from key public health messages. The former de facto deputy prime minister Damian Green criticised Cummings, but stopped short of calling for him to go.</li> \n   <li><strong>The former home secretary, Amber Rudd, added her voice to those calling for Cummings\u2019 departure.</strong> Rudd, who stood down as an MP in December, told ITV\u2019s Peston programme that Cummings\u2019 continued presence in No 10 was making the government\u2019s job more difficult at a time of national crisis.</li> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson said an independent inquiry into Dominic Cummings\u2019 actions wouldn\u2019t be a good use of official time.</strong> The PM was grilled on the Cummings affair and his government\u2019s response to the pandemic by the powerful liaison committee. Under forensic questioning and several times facing the charges of putting political concerns before the nation\u2019s health and of underestimating the public\u2019s anger, the prime minister said it was time to \u201cmove on\u201d from the \u201cvery frustrating\u201d episode. He also didn\u2019t give a clear answer on whether he was saying that if people don\u2019t have access to childcare they could do what Cummings did.</li> \n   <li><strong>The NHS test and trace programme goes live at 9am on Thursday.</strong> If you get a call from a contact tracer because you\u2019ve been in contact with an infected person, you must isolate for 14 days, even if you don\u2019t have symptoms. The government has said these instructions must be followed. Though they will be voluntary at first, they will be made mandatory if necessary. \u201cIt\u2019s your civic duty to follow test and trace instructions,\u201d Matt Hancock said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Officers are reporting people breaking lockdown rules and using Dominic Cummings as an excuse, the West Midlands police and crime commissioner said. </strong>David Jamieson told the BBC in the last few days the public has pushed back and the police\u2019s ability to enforce the rules has been undermined. He said people are telling officers that \u201cif it is OK for Cummings, it is OK for us\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Most people now believe there is \u201cone rule for them, and one rule for us\u201d after Cummings remained in post despite breaching the lockdown, a government adviser said. </strong>Prof Stephen Reicher, who advises the government on human behaviour during disease outbreaks. He has told Channel 4 News: \u201cAnd all the research on compliance with authority shows that it depends critically on thinking that authority is part of us, is with us, is for us. And so, once you create that sense of \u2018us and them\u2019, you undermine trust and you undermine compliance.\u201d</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>If you\u2019d like to read yet more, head over to our global pandemic live blog, which is still running:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/27/coronavirus-live-news-spain-begins-10-days-of-mourning-as-global-deaths-near-350000\">Coronavirus live news: US deaths from Covid-19 have passed 100,000</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T23:08:13.779Z\">at 12.08am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eceec948f0898700351d890\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T22:42:23.505Z\">11.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>McGuinness said Cummings\u2019 actions had undermined the goodwill needed to maintain the lockdown.

It is vital that adequate support is on hand, to enable all directors of public health and Public Health England consultants leading these local systems, to deliver this effectively.</p> \n   <p>The safety of the public and key workers is paramount and given the limits of the test itself, self-isolation of those with symptoms and their contacts is even more vital. This will require good communication with the public at a national level.</p> \n   <p>Establishing local test, track and trace is a step in the right direction but will require significant resources, monitoring and vigilance to ensure that it is working effectively across the country.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eced6db8f087e3ca0f64ac8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T21:22:08.609Z\">10.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Alicia Kearns</strong>, the Tory MP for Rutland and Melton, is another to criticise Cummings, while stopping short of calling for his departure. A statement posted on her website reads:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Over the weekend. I relentlessly pressed for more information to get the facts of what happened, I believed that was the least the British people were owed. On Monday, we received more of the information that residents had been calling for: I wish this information had been made available at an earlier time.</p> \n   <p>I do not support Mr Cummings\u2019 actions. I would not have done the same.</p> \n   <p>Mr Cummings believed he was protecting his family, and not just from his fear of not being able to care for his child, but from the abuse his family was enduring at their home. I know what it is to be a worried parent, but his actions have caused much disappointment.</p> \n   <p>Mr Cummings has accepted that he could have done better. I agree.</p> \n   <p>With regards to his travelling to County Durham, he was acting within the very limits of what Deputy Chief Medical Advisor Dr Harries OBE set out at the daily televised press conference on 24th March when she said \u2018clearly if you have adults that are unable to look after a small child, that is an exceptional circumstance\u2019.</p> \n   <p>It is for the police, not me, to determine whether Mr Cummings breached the lockdown guidelines. Durham police had publicly stated that there was no case to answer.

Leaving women behind means we risk no economic recovery at all.</p> \n   <p>What this study shows is that we are going backwards and that is extremely worrying. There is also the real prospect of two-tier workplaces as the lockdown is eased with men getting back into work and women still left at home caring for children, without nursery places or schools fully open for months. </p> \n   <p>Government must now prioritise strategic investment to create a childcare infrastructure, reform parental leave, to equalise parenting in a child\u2019s first year and normalise flexible and remote working in the post-Covid economy.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re closing this blog down now. Thanks for reading and commenting. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest news: More than 40 Tory MPs have now called for Dominic Cummings to go. With Downing Street continuing to defend him, the senior government minister Penny Mordaunt also said there were \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in Cummings\u2019 account of his actions and apologised to her constituents for how recent days were distracting from key public health messages. The former de facto deputy prime minister Damian Green criticised Cummings, but stopped short of calling for him to go. The former home secretary, Amber Rudd, added her voice to those calling for Cummings\u2019 departure. Rudd, who stood down as an MP in December, told ITV\u2019s Peston programme that Cummings\u2019 continued presence in No 10 was making the government\u2019s job more difficult at a time of national crisis. Boris Johnson said an independent inquiry into Dominic Cummings\u2019 actions wouldn\u2019t be a good use of official time. The PM was grilled on the Cummings affair and his government\u2019s response to the pandemic by the powerful liaison committee. Under forensic questioning and several times facing the charges of putting political concerns before the nation\u2019s health and of underestimating the public\u2019s anger, the prime minister said it was time to \u201cmove on\u201d from the \u201cvery frustrating\u201d episode. He also didn\u2019t give a clear answer on whether he was saying that if people don\u2019t have access to childcare they could do what Cummings did. The NHS test and trace programme goes live at 9am on Thursday. If you get a call from a contact tracer because you\u2019ve been in contact with an infected person, you must isolate for 14 days, even if you don\u2019t have symptoms. The government has said these instructions must be followed. Though they will be voluntary at first, they will be made mandatory if necessary. \u201cIt\u2019s your civic duty to follow test and trace instructions,\u201d Matt Hancock said. Officers are reporting people breaking lockdown rules and using Dominic Cummings as an excuse, the West Midlands police and crime commissioner said. David Jamieson told the BBC in the last few days the public has pushed back and the police\u2019s ability to enforce the rules has been undermined. He said people are telling officers that \u201cif it is OK for Cummings, it is OK for us\u201d. Most people now believe there is \u201cone rule for them, and one rule for us\u201d after Cummings remained in post despite breaching the lockdown, a government adviser said. Prof Stephen Reicher, who advises the government on human behaviour during disease outbreaks. He has told Channel 4 News: \u201cAnd all the research on compliance with authority shows that it depends critically on thinking that authority is part of us, is with us, is for us. And so, once you create that sense of \u2018us and them\u2019, you undermine trust and you undermine compliance.\u201d If you\u2019d like to read yet more, head over to our global pandemic live blog, which is still running: McGuinness said Cummings\u2019 actions had undermined the goodwill needed to maintain the lockdown. She told Newsnight: I think people do feel that Dominic Cummings\u2019 action undermines everything that they\u2019ve all put themselves through, the things that they\u2019ve missed, the people that they\u2019ve missed and all of that. But I also think that we\u2019re at the back end of a lot of very complex and confused messaging from government who haven\u2019t been clear about what the rules are and why the rules are there. You know, why can you meet one person and not two people? Social distancing is optional and so on. And so the police have been there to enforce it, to keep us safe and they\u2019ve done that but that goodwill with people is so very important and Dominic Cummings completely undermined that and then the prime minister has refused to hold him to account. Kim McGuinness, the Police and Crime Commissioner for Northumbria, has told BBC\u2019s Newsnight she was concerned the public\u2019s attitude towards the lockdown has changed. We\u2019re already anecdotally hearing from MPs, from the media, from police officers that people are using Dominic Cummings as an excuse when they\u2019re approached about why they\u2019re breaking lockdown rules. So, whilst people have been great in the last eight weeks, they\u2019ve been, by and large, listening to the lockdown because we\u2019re in it together fighting this deadly virus, that confidence is starting to erode and if test, track and trace is going to work we need to get that back on track. When asked how people who will need to self-isolate after being informed by a contact tracer will likely respond, McGuinness replied: I think it\u2019s very difficult, you\u2019re asking people to go right back to the beginning of where we were eight weeks ago. And that is a big ask at the best of times and particularly when they\u2019ve already been asked to do that and so I think that we need to make sure that people are aware of what is expected of them, that they have confidence that other people are doing it as well. So this system needs to be slick, it needs to be well delivered and it needs to be ready to go and really we should have had it weeks ago. Here\u2019s a little more from Rudd\u2019s appearance on this evening\u2019s edition of Peston: The former Tory home secretary Amber Rudd has become the latest prominent figure to say Dominic Cummings should depart No 10 over his lockdown breach. Rudd, who also served as work and pensions secretary and chose not to stand for reelection as an MP in December after resigning the Conservative whip, has told ITV\u2019s Peston: He should quit because he\u2019s making things worse. People have been great during the lockdown. In a really difficult period, they have complied. And now they\u2019re confused and that makes them angry and I think that will have consequences. So when he thinks, as any of us working in government must, \u2018am I adding here, am I helping?\u2019 he can only conclude that his presence is making things worse at a time when we\u2019re already in a crisis. Responding to the launch of the test and trace system in England (see 4.45pm), the British Medical Association public health medicine committee member and former chairwoman Dr Penelope Toff has said: Having a robust test, track and trace system in place is vital to being able to effectively prevent a second wave of infection and to ensure that we can safely ease out of lockdown. What will be absolutely crucial is that the government can implement this effectively with all the components in place, so it can run at capacity. Success will not just hinge on the availability of testing and delivering test results quickly but on rapid identification of contacts and support to enable them to self-isolate. There is a very real concern that as funding has only now been made available at local level, and as much of the local contact tracing will need to be done in person, there is the potential for some of these systems to become overwhelmed with the sudden surge in demand. It is vital that adequate support is on hand, to enable all directors of public health and Public Health England consultants leading these local systems, to deliver this effectively. The safety of the public and key workers is paramount and given the limits of the test itself, self-isolation of those with symptoms and their contacts is even more vital. This will require good communication with the public at a national level. Establishing local test, track and trace is a step in the right direction but will require significant resources, monitoring and vigilance to ensure that it is working effectively across the country. Alicia Kearns, the Tory MP for Rutland and Melton, is another to criticise Cummings, while stopping short of calling for his departure. A statement posted on her website reads: Over the weekend. I relentlessly pressed for more information to get the facts of what happened, I believed that was the least the British people were owed. On Monday, we received more of the information that residents had been calling for: I wish this information had been made available at an earlier time. I do not support Mr Cummings\u2019 actions. I would not have done the same. Mr Cummings believed he was protecting his family, and not just from his fear of not being able to care for his child, but from the abuse his family was enduring at their home. I know what it is to be a worried parent, but his actions have caused much disappointment. Mr Cummings has accepted that he could have done better. I agree. With regards to his travelling to County Durham, he was acting within the very limits of what Deputy Chief Medical Advisor Dr Harries OBE set out at the daily televised press conference on 24th March when she said \u2018clearly if you have adults that are unable to look after a small child, that is an exceptional circumstance\u2019. It is for the police, not me, to determine whether Mr Cummings breached the lockdown guidelines. Durham police had publicly stated that there was no case to answer. However, since then they are now investigating and dependent on the outcome, I will make a further statement. And, on Sunday, the MP for Winchester and Chandler\u2019s Ford Steve Brine posted a statement on his personal website saying he too has spoken to the chief whip. The Guardian has also been passed an email from him to constituents in which he said: In a painfully difficult time when the government, trying as it is to safely ease the necessary restrictions on our lives, needs to retain public trust this is unhelpful to put it mildly. Furthermore, when the UK has north of 36,000 deaths from this awful pandemic, it\u2019s a distraction for ministers \u2013 and proper scrutiny from the media on track and trace, vaccine etc \u2013 which I would think this country can ill afford right now. Public adherence to the rules is done by consent in this country and that is made much harder if people feel, no matter that these events were some time ago, it\u2019s one rule for them and another for senior government advisors. I have this lunchtime robustly raised my concerns and disappointment at Mr Cumming\u2019s behaviour in the most appropriate \u2013 and I believe effective way \u2013 with the government chief whip. Ultimately, it is for the prime minister to decide the future of his senior advisors. Brine has not responded to a request for comment. More Tory MPs have expressed concerns about Cummings\u2019 actions, while stopping short of calling for his removal from No 10. The Guardian has been passed an email to a constituent from the former education secretary, Damian Hinds. He said he believes that, at the very least, Cummings breached the spirit of the rules. The key tasks at hand are fighting this terrible virus, dealing with all its knock-on effects, and starting to move gradually and cautiously towards reopening more of the economy and society more broadly. It is essential that attention is not further deflected from these priorities. I am not convinced that changing personnel at this stage would actually help that, and there is a real possibility it could have the opposite effect. But it does need to be acknowledged that in the case of Mr Cummings mistakes were made and the spirit, at least, of the rules broken, whatever the motivation; and acknowledged again the huge restrictions and privations that the country as a whole has withstood. The Tory backbencher Royston Smith has called for Cummings to resign or be sacked, taking the number of Conservative MPs who have done so to 44. We are in the middle of the worst health and financial crisis this country has faced since the war. Unfortunately, the Dominic Cummings saga has become a distraction from the very urgent issues facing the country. We cannot allow crucial messaging and public understanding to be clouded by this, and for that reason I feel it is time Mr Cummings stood aside so that the government can dedicate all its resources to managing the pandemic and our way out of it. The former de facto deputy prime minister Damian Green has lamented the damage done to the government\u2019s public health efforts by Cummings\u2019s lockdown breach, but stopped short of calling for him to resign or be sacked. In a letter to a constituent, Green has said: I have expressed my own displeasure, and the anger of many of those who wrote to me, both to the chief whip and to cabinet ministers. No one at the top of government can be unaware of the widespread public anger at Dominic Cummings\u2019 actions. Many of the individual points put in emails to me have been relayed to senior ministers. Green, who was sacked as first secretary of state in 2017 after admitting he lied about the presence of pornographic images on his House of Commons computer, added: We all know that some families have suffered appallingly during the lockdown, not just losing relatives but being unable to comfort them at the end. For many more there has been the pain of long-term separation from close family members. It is possible to put up with this if we all accept that we are in the same boat. A combination of Dominic Cummings\u2019s actions and the way they were reported has clearly damaged that sense of solidarity, as is reflected in many of the emails I have received. Most people now believe there is \u201cone rule for them, and one rule for us\u201d after Cummings remained in post despite breaching the lockdown, according to Prof Stephen Reicher, who advises the government on human behaviour during disease outbreaks. He has told Channel 4 News: I think there is very little doubt \u2013 and the polling shows it very clearly \u2013 that most people think now there is one rule for them, and one rule for us. And all the research on compliance with authority shows that it depends critically on thinking that authority is part of us, is with us, is for us. And so, once you create that sense of \u2018us and them\u2019, you undermine trust and you undermine compliance. However, there is a positive side as well because I think many people are going along with restrictions not because they have been told to by the government but because they realise it is the right thing. And, if you look at the data on people\u2019s own behavioural intentions, it doesn\u2019t look as bad. And I think the point is this: That there is an irony here, because to the extent that people think that Dominic Cummings is one of them, and if they think that his behaviour doesn\u2019t represent them, it\u2019s counter-normative, it can prove a model of what we shouldn\u2019t do. Adding the Lib Dem response, the party\u2019s health spokeswoman Munira Wilson has said: The coronavirus crisis is leaving people rightly worried about their loved ones. Sadly, the government has left confusion in its wake this week and there are plenty questions still to answer. Central to the government\u2019s strategy must be a comprehensive test, trace and isolate system. Time and again, we have seen ministers announce the next steps but never an effective plan to support people in isolation, thereby stopping the spread and saving lives. Ministers must come forward with these clear and honest answers, in addition addressing the obvious issues with their app and why the level of testing remains so low across the UK compared to some countries. Responding to the announcement of the government\u2019s test-and-trace strategy (see 4.45pm), the shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has said: We have long called for a functional testing and tracing regime as key to the safe easing of the lockdown. The government\u2019s decision to abandon contact tracing in mid-March was a huge error leaving a huge gap in our defences against the virus. We will need everyone asked to cooperate fully with NHS Test and Trace\u2019s stay at home instructions to keep all of us safe. It\u2019s why Boris Johnson\u2019s support for Dominic Cummings is both dangerously irresponsible and undermines vital public health messaging. It\u2019s remains clear there is still one rule for Mr Johnson\u2019s friends and another for the rest of us. Hello, Kevin Rawlinson with you now for a while. If you\u2019d like to get in touch, feel free to email me on kevin.rawlinson[at]theguardian[dot]com or you can get me on Twitter. More than 40 Tory MPs have now called for Dominic Cummings to go. With Downing Street continuing to defend him, the senior government minister Penny Mordaunt also said there were \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in Cummings\u2019 account of his actions and apologised to her constituents for how recent days were distracting from key public health messages. Boris Johnson said an independent inquiry into Dominic Cummings\u2019 actions wouldn\u2019t be a good use of official time. The PM was grilled on the Cummings affair and his government\u2019s response to the pandemic by the powerful liaison committee. Under forensic questioning and several times facing the charges of putting political concerns before the nation\u2019s health and of underestimating the public\u2019s anger, the prime minister said it was time to \u201cmove on\u201d from the \u201cvery frustrating\u201d episode. He also didn\u2019t give a clear answer on whether he was saying that if people don\u2019t have access to childcare they could do what Cummings did. The NHS test and trace programme goes live at 9am tomorrow. If you get a call from a contact tracer because you\u2019ve been in contact with an infected person, you must isolate for 14 days, even if you don\u2019t have symptoms. The government has said these instructions must be followed. Though they will be voluntary at first, they will be made mandatory if necessary. \u201cIt\u2019s your civic duty to follow test and trace instructions,\u201d Matt Hancock said. Officers are reporting people breaking lockdown rules and using Dominic Cummings as an excuse, the West Midlands police and crime commissioner said. David Jamieson told the BBC in the last few days the public has pushed back and the police\u2019s ability to enforce the rules has been undermined. He said people are telling officers that \u201cif it is OK for Cummings, it is OK for us\u201d. Sajid Javid, the former chancellor, has said \u201cthe journey made by Dominic Cummings to County Durham to isolate on his family estate was neither necessary nor justified\u201d, the Bromsgrove Standard reports. In a letter to his constituents, seen by the Standard, the Bromsgrove MP said the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser should have made a full and frank apology for his actions. Javid also said: I remain unconvinced his visit to Barnard Castle could be considered reasonable. I was also deeply concerned by his decision to return to Downing Street directly after coming into contact with a family member who was ill, potentially with coronavirus. He stopped short of calling for Cummings to go, saying he thought it best to reserve judgement on his actions until \u201cwe were in possession of all the facts\u201d and until he was given the opportunity to explain himself. Another Tory MP, George Freeman, has called for Dominic Cummings to go. He said it was clear to him that public anger at the betrayal of trust and compliance now risks the collapse of respect for the government\u2019s public health advice. Q. What more can and should the government be doing to reassure parents about schools reopening? Hancock says the government wouldn\u2019t have made this decision unless it was safe. Harding adds children under five will be able to get tested from tomorrow, so immediate action can be taken. Q. New data has revealed that BAME people in England are 54% more likely to be fined under coronavirus laws than white people. If Dominic Cummings were black it\u2019s statistically more likely he\u2019d have been stopped by police with his family. What\u2019s your message to black families who worry fines aren\u2019t being issued fairly? Hancock says it\u2019s vital that the rules are policed without fear or favour and fairly and equally according to the evidence. Q. Are you able to share any preliminary findings on the PHE research into BAME deaths at this time? Van Tam says he regards this as very pressing and important. PHE says the report is on schedule and will be very comprehensive, he says. It will deal with the enormous complexity of unpicking several signals in the data, he says. Q. Is the reason the NHS tracing app is being delayed because of problems on the Isle of Wight? Are you confident test and trace will work even if the app doesn\u2019t work? Hancock says the Isle of Wight has proven that asking people to isolate is better when it comes from human contact tracers. The app is a complement to this system, he adds. Q. When there are grey areas, whose authority is it that decides whether something is in keeping with the law? Hancock says test and trace isn\u2019t going to be a mandatory system in the first instance. Q. If you get stopped by the police but believe you were using your \u201cgood judgment\u201d as the communities secretary put it this morning, who\u2019s judgement is right \u2013 yours or the police? Hancock says there are exceptional circumstances in the guidelines. With test and trace, if you\u2019re told to isolate, this will at first be voluntary, he adds. Harding says people need to feel safe and confident in coming to NHS test and trace and sharing their contacts. Van Tam adds that the natural R for Covid-19 is three, so it would go out of control very quickly. The extent to which we keep control of it and move towards normal life very much depends on people engaging with and cooperating with NHS test and trace, he says. Q. If you have no symptoms but you get a call from a contact tracer, do you have to isolate at your normal home or can you isolate somewhere else? Hancock says if you\u2019re a contact of somebody who\u2019s tested positive and you\u2019re instructed to isolate, your household members don\u2019t have to isolate \u2013 they can carry on under the normal guidelines. That means you can isolate at home, he adds. He moves swiftly on. Q. If there are local flare-ups, who will identify whether a road or tower block needs to be locked down, who will communicate it, who will enforce it? Hancock says it is a local judgment where directors of public health have a critical role to play, which will be tied up with national intelligence through test and trace, the biosecurity centre and Public Health England. Harding adds it is a genuinely national effort. It needs to be locally led and nationally supported, she says. Q. Have you ironed out problems of some people waiting over a week for a test? Harding says there will be examples where the turnaround time wasn\u2019t fast enough. It\u2019s got to get better and better, she adds. Crucial to the speed of it all will be the individual recognising they have symptoms and the speed with which their contacts also isolate, she adds. They are taking questions from journalists now. Q. Are you sure you have sufficient capacity to test the contacts of all of those infected, given the ONS puts the figure for new cases at over 9,000 in England alone? Hancock says over 2,000 people tested positive yesterday. He says it\u2019s right the ONS survey estimates there are between 7 to 9,000 people who had coronavirus. As many of those as possible need to come forward into the contact tracing system, he says. Harding says there are 25,000 contact tracers ready to start work tomorrow, which is easily enough, she adds. Chris from Whitley Bay asks if the government has a strategy for future pandemics. Hancock says the government is learning about the disease and how to handle the pandemic. They are taking questions from the public now. Ella from Maidenhead asks if lifting of lockdown restrictions can be targeted at different age restrictions. Hancock says that while those under the age of 45 are at less risk from the disease, they\u2019re just as likely to get it and transmit it. Van Tam says while the death rate due to Covid-19 is very age-dependent, it\u2019s simply not true that those under 45 aren\u2019t at risk. The infection rates in under 45-year-olds isn\u2019t any lower, he says. And the transmission rates are likely higher based on social contacts and networking, he adds. Prof Van Tam is going through the slides now. Use of cars, light goods vehicles and HGVs are gradually increasing, he says. 117,013 tests were delivered in the last 24 hours, he says. 2,013 new cases were confirmed in the last 24 hours, he adds. Baroness Harding, the chair of NHS Improvement and the government\u2019s lead on the test and trace programme, is speaking now. If you have one of the symptoms of coronavirus, you must immediately self-isolate, she says. You should then book a test on nhs.uk/coronavirus or call 119, she says. Do not leave home for any other reason, she says. If you test positive, the test and trace service will contact you within 24 hours, she says. NHS test and trace will help you establish who you might have infected and gather their contact details, she says. This could be someone you\u2019ve been in contact with for more than 15 minutes or in your own household. If you\u2019ve been in contact with an infected person, NHS test and trace will instruct you to self-isolate, even if you don\u2019t have symptoms, she says. You must follow the instructions, she says. In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll move away from a blanket lockdown and focus on local action to tackle local flare-ups, Hancock says. If you receive a call from a contact tracer saying that you need to isolate, whether you have symptoms or not, you must do so, Hancock says. This is because you could have the virus and spread it to others without ever having symptoms at all, he adds. The test and trace system will start tomorrow morning at 9am, he says. The first people to be contacted will be those who got a positive test result today, Hancock adds. To protect your friends and family, testing and tracing must become a new way of life, Hancock says. The four nations are working together so this is coordinated, he adds. The instructions are clear: if you get symptoms, isolate and get a test. If you get a call from an NHS contact tracer, you must self-isolate. This will be voluntary at first, he says, but this can be made mandatory if that\u2019s what it takes. It\u2019s your civic duty to follow the instructions, Hancock says. We now have capacity for 161,000 tests a day, Hancock says. So, from Thursday, eligibility for testing will be extended for under-fives, he says. So, anyone with symptoms can get tested, he adds. We must all follow the NHS test and trace instructions, Hancock says. This is how we will protect the NHS and save lives. The health and social care secretary is speaking now. Until an effective treatment or vaccine comes through, NHS test and trace is a big part of how the country moves forward out of lockdown, Hancock says. Through testing, we find out who is infected, Hancock says. \u201cWe\u201d all have a part to play, he adds. If you have symptoms you must isolate immediately and get a test, the health secretary says. The next step is that the clinician and patient identify the possible movements of the virus and who else it might have infected, he says. Those contacts will be isolated and break the chain of transmission, he says. The health and social care secretary will lead this evening\u2019s news briefing, pushed back to this later time following the prime minister\u2019s extended questioning by the liaison committee. He\u2019s joined by Prof Jonathan Van Tam and Baroness Dido Harding. Penny Mordaunt, a senior government minister, has said there are \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in Dominic Cummings\u2019 account of his actions during lockdown and apologised for how recent days have \u201cundermined key public health messages\u201d, my colleague Rowena Mason reports. In an email sent to constituents, seen by the Guardian, Mordaunt said Cummings\u2019 continued position as Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser was a \u201cmatter for the prime minister\u201d but she also she could \u201cfully understand how angry people are\u201d and believed there was no doubt he \u201ctook risks\u201d. The Cabinet Office minister, whose official title is paymaster general, is the second and most senior government minister to have criticised Cummings, after Douglas Ross resigned as Scotland Office minister on Tuesday. Mordaunt\u2019s letter was sent in her capacity as a constituency MP, rather than as a government minister. But her comments are the most critical to come from a senior member of Johnson\u2019s team. More on this exclusive story here. As of 9am 27 May, there have been 3,798,490 tests, with 117,013 tests on 26 May, DHSC said. 267,240 people have tested positive. And as of 5pm on 26 May, of those tested positive for Covid-19, across all settings, 37,460 have died. That is a rise of 412 since yesterday. In a rare example of a U-turn on a U-turn, the government said it will now fund free school meals for school children in England over the half-term holiday \u2013 even though the holiday is halfway over. The Department for Education had funded free school meal vouchers over the Easter holidays, and then said it had no plans to fund them for the current break, despite criticism from opposition parties and teaching unions. But Nick Gibb, the schools minister, told the education committee the DfE was now willing to fund food vouchers during the week-long break that began for most schools last Friday. The news came as a surprise to many head teachers, some of whom had sought to buy supermarket vouchers for the children of disadvantaged families from their school\u2019s budgets. Tulip Siddiq, Labour\u2019s shadow minister for children, said: Labour has always supported families accessing free school meals over half-term, but announcing this u-turn during the week itself is far too late. Families have been extremely worried that they would not be able to feed their children properly this week as a result of the government\u2019s initial reluctance. Meanwhile, another Tory MP, seeing this performance, believes it\u2019s time for Dominic Cummings to go. Giles Watling says his presence is \u201can unwanted distraction\u201d at this time. Jenkin asks what is causing the delay to tests and who is in charge of implementing a resolution. Johnson says the delays are caused largely by difficulties in the labs with producing the results in a speedy way. Hunt asks if the government will look at banning agency workers from working in several care homes to reduce the risk of spreading the disease. Johnson claims they have done this already. Hunt, who chairs the health committee, asks why the UK doesn\u2019t return test results in 24 hours like other countries. Johnson says they\u2019re working to reduce the time. Isn\u2019t turnaround time just as important as the volume of tests, Hunt points out. Why don\u2019t you say all tests need to be returned within 24 hours, in order to galvanise the system to work more effectively? Johnson claims he\u2019s introduced a 24-hour target. He doesn\u2019t reveal if there\u2019s a deadline for this target to come in beyond \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. Hunt says a consequence of this was the UK couldn\u2019t test everyone being discharged from hospitals. Did the prime minister get any advice saying that doing that would risk spreading the virus into care homes? No, Johnson says. Every discharge from the NHS into care homes was made by clinicians, he adds. It\u2019s not true that there was some concerted effort to move people out of NHS beds into care homes, the prime minister says. Why did it take until April to introduce the test and trace target, even though our first case was in January, the Tory former health secretary Jeremy Hunt asks. Johnson says Public Health England didn\u2019t have the capacity that other countries had. This country didn\u2019t learn the lessons of Sars or Mers, Johnson adds. If you\u2019re phoned up by a contact tracer and told to stay at home as you\u2019ve had contact with an infected person, is staying at home compulsory or can people use their judgement, Clark asks. Johnson says no, they will be asking people to stay at home. If people don\u2019t follow that advice, financial sanctions will be considered. You should self-isolate, he adds. If people don\u2019t, we\u2019ll consider fines. Clark suggests Sage could review the two metre rule before shops and other non-essential places begin to reopen. Johnson says he has already done this. Clark asks why the UK\u2019s social distancing policy is two metres, when the WHO recommends one metre. Johnson says the advice from Sage remains at the moment there is a considerable reduction in risk from two metres. Greg Clark, who chairs the science committee, asks if the prime minister reads the scientific advice himself. Johnson says \u201conly in exceptional circumstances\u201d. What he gets is the \u201cdirect digest\u201d from Sage, he adds. Hoare asks why Cummings is so pivotal to moving the country forward from coronavirus. Is it on your radar than people are very annoyed? Johnson says he understands people\u2019s feelings about the pain of the lockdown. He refers to the \u201cpolitical ding dong\u201d over what one adviser has done, and that several allegations weren\u2019t correct. You have a choice between Dominic Cummings and putting the national interest first, which will it be prime minister, Cooper asks. Johnson says we should lay aside \u201cparty political point-scoring\u201d and stress the vital messages. Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper says it\u2019s \u201cextremely surprising\u201d he won\u2019t provide that evidence to the cabinet secretary or have any independent verification. What are your instructions now to parents who either have Covid or have symptoms, who won\u2019t know how seriously they\u2019re going to get ill and have no local childcare available? Is the message to those parents now the one from Dr Jenny Harries to stay at home unless there is risk to life and to contact local community hubs, or is it the message from members of your government to travel to wherever you have a support network? Cooper cites the communities secretary\u2019s words this morning. Robert Jenrick said: If you don\u2019t have access to childcare, you can do what Dominic Cummings did. Johnson says he\u2019s not sure there\u2019s a discrepancy between those two pieces of advice. Cooper said a Mumsnet survey of parents found that a quarter of them had no access to local childcare and had symptoms of Covid, and were in exactly the same circumstances as Dominic Cummings, which aren\u2019t \u201cexceptional\u201d. A third said they\u2019re more likely to break the rules now, she says. You need to give clear advice to parents. Johnson says the clear advice is to stay at home unless you have exceptional problems with childcare which might make you \u201cvary your arrangements\u201d. You\u2019d have to look at each individual case, he says. From tomorrow, we\u2019ll require compliance from the public with the test and trace programme, he adds. Cooper says the reason he can\u2019t give a clear answer is because he\u2019s trying not to incriminate Dominic Cummings. You\u2019re putting your political concerns ahead of clear public health advice, she adds. Labour\u2019s Meg Hillier, who chairs the public accounts committee, asked if the prime minister saw any evidence to prove the allegations against Cummings was false. Yes or no, prime minister? Johnson says yes, if it please you. Hillier then asks if it might be a good idea for the cabinet secretary to also see it. Johnson says he would not be doing his job if he were to \u201cshuffle\u201d this into the hands of officials dealing with the coronavirus. He \u201ctotally understands\u201d public indignation, he says. He reiterates it\u2019s time to move on. Conservative MP Simon Hoare told the PM that, if his inbox is anything to go by, the nation will be \u201cfar less energetic\u201d about obeying future restrictions as \u201ca direct result of the activities of your senior adviser\u201d if the R starts to creep up. Hoare asked what MPs should tell constituents who ask \u201cif other people don\u2019t abide by it why on earth should we\u201d because \u201cwe know what your views are, frankly prime minister, I don\u2019t think anybody understands why you hold those views\u201d. Johnson replied: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true about how the British people will respond to the next phases, to how to work the test and trace system, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how they responded at all throughout the crisis. If, just suppose for a second that you were right, which I don\u2019t accept, all the more reason now for us to be consistent and clear in our message driving those key messages. But anger is growing and reaching fever-pitch, Wishart says. You know that eventually you\u2019ll have to let him go, why not just get on with it? Johnson says he considers the government needs to focus on getting its message across. Wishart says his inbox, and that of so many MPs, is full of messages from constituents who haven\u2019t seen loved ones in so long. To them, this looks like one rule for him [Cummings] and one rule for them, he adds. He wouldn\u2019t say sorry, will you say sorry on his behalf, Wishart asks the PM. Johnson says he is sorry for the pain, the anguish and the heartbreak people have felt. He says we need to set aside this row \u2013 and a lot of allegations turned out to be wrong, he adds. It\u2019s a distraction, the prime minister says, and it\u2019s time to move on. You\u2019ve managed to unite the nation in condemnation and indignation over your handling of Cummings, the SNP\u2019s Pete Wishart says. 80% of the British public feel he broke the rules, 63% think you should sack him, but most worryingly, 65% say his conduct make it less likely the public will now follow lockdown rules, he adds. Surely no man is more important than keeping this nation safe, Wishart asks. Johnson says a lot of what was said on Friday and Saturday was \u201cfalse\u201d and his adviser has \u201ccleared that up\u201d. He says Wishart is making \u201cparty political points\u201d. He respectfully disagrees that the message is unclear. He says the best thing would be is for us to move on. It\u2019s unprecedented for an adviser to have their own press conference, how was the cabinet consulted before agreeing to this, Jenkin asks. Johnson said he thought it would be good for people to understand what took place. It\u2019s been a very frustrating episode, the prime minister adds. We need to move on and get onto how we deal with coronavirus, he adds. Jenkin asks what advice he has sought from the cabinet secretary on compliance with the code and the matter of integrity in the code. Johnson says he has no reason to believe there is any descent from what was said a few days ago. Jenkin then asks if the cabinet secretary has had the opportunity to ask Cummings questions himself. Johnson says he won\u2019t go into the discussions that have happened. The committee is \u201cextremely concerned\u201d about his senior adviser, Jenkin says. Polls suggest the vast majority of the public believe he did break the lockdown rules, how much do you think this undermines the authority of the government at a time when public confidence in the government is so important? Johnson says he\u2019s deeply sorry for the anxiety and hurt people have been through in this period. He says there has been a lot of \u201cautobiography\u201d on this and he doesn\u2019t propose to add to this. Jenkin asks why the cabinet secretary hasn\u2019t been invited to conduct an independent inquiry in order to give independent advice on this. Johnson says it\u2019s a reasonable question but there has been lengthy discussion on this and he isn\u2019t certain that an inquiry into this right now is a very good use of official time. The last time a prime minister appeared before the committee was 12 months ago, Sir Bernard Jenkin, the committee chairman, said. Can you, prime minister, commit to attending regularly this and again before summer recess? Boris Johnson asks if he can get back to him on that as \u201cthere is a lot on at the moment\u201d and his time is scarce. The prime minister is in for a grilling from senior MPs at the powerful liaison committee, due to begin shortly. The UK is unlikely to get a fishing deal that will unlock the latest Brexit impasse by the deadline of 30 June, Boris Johnson\u2019s chief negotiator has said. Despite reports that the EU was willing to make concessions in order to clear the way for the wider free trade agreement, David Frost said he was not hopeful. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to think we might not make it by 30 June,\u201d he told the House of Commons Future Relationship with the EU. He said the EU\u2019s chief negotiator Michel Barnier had dropped hints that the EU\u2019s position may not be \u201ccompletely realistic position\u201d but the UK could not accept the status quo, nor did it support the EU\u2019s insistence that a full trade deal was contingent on fishing agreements. The row centres on continued access to British waters with the EU arguing that while the UK takes back control of the seas it relies on the single market to sell its catch. More than 770,000 people have signed a petition calling for Dominic Cummings to be sacked. The change.org petition was set up on Saturday and has racked up thousands of signatures over the last few days. All the while a growing number of Tory MPs continue to join calls for the prime minister\u2019s key aide to either resign or be dismissed. Fast food giant McDonald\u2019s is rapidly expanding its store openings across the UK and Ireland and expects to have more than 1,000 restaurants reopened for drive-through or delivery by next Thursday (4 June). Last week, it reopened 33 drive-through sites in London and the south-east but in some areas decided to close some lanes where demand \u201cimpacted local communities or the safety of our people or customers\u201d due to lengthy queues. The company said today every drive-through in the UK and Ireland will be reopened between Tuesday and Thursday of next week. The exact locations will be announced on the morning they open their doors, it said, to help manage customer demand, while it is working with local authorities and the police over openings. Further evidence that the Dominic Cummings has ruffled feathers all over the place. Here is an exceptionally sassy Dublin airport, winning the internet. Durham county council has advised schools that 15 June \u201cis a more realistic date for the phased reopening to begin\u201d. In a statement, councillor Olwyn Gunn, cabinet member for children and young people\u2019s services, said the priority was staff and pupil safety, adding: We have at no point stated schools should return on 1 June. And in the light of the new scientific advice, high infection rates and the unacceptable delays in implementing contact tracing, we believe 15 June is a more realistic timeline for all schools to work towards, subject to government scientific advice and individual school risk assessments. Ultimately it remains a decision for schools to open when they feel it is safe to do so and I would like to place on record our sincere thanks to all headteachers and staff for the tremendous work they are doing to this end. It comes after Downing Street reiterated that, ahead of the official legal review of the lockdown on Thursday, the government remains \u201chopeful\u201d that schools could begin reopening on 1 June (see 1.07pm.). West Midlands police and crime commissioner David Jamieson said officers are reporting people breaking lockdown rules and using Dominic Cummings as an excuse, amid fears Boris Johnson\u2019s key aide\u2019s actions are undermining the government\u2019s public health messaging. Jamieson told BBC Radio 4\u2019s The World At One programme that people are telling officers that \u201cif it is OK for Cummings, it is OK for us\u201d and \u201cit looks like there is one rule for us and another rule for the people in No 10 Downing Street\u201d. He said: Now you can\u2019t ... if the rules are flexible, and people seem to have interpreted them who are at the heart of government, then it is almost impossible then for police officers to be able to carry out their job effectively. What the police are now saying to me is they are getting quite a push back, not just from some of the younger people who previously where saying why can\u2019t I play football, why can\u2019t I go out in the streets? They\u2019re getting push backs from other generations of people as well. Now that is a bad sign, showing that confidence in the rules, confidence in government and thereby the police\u2019s ability to enforce it has been undermined very much in the last few days. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has told reporters that the Cummings controversy has had a \u201creal impact in our fight against this virus\u201d, with a clear increase of people breaking lockdown rules on social distancing and gathering in groups. Bev Hughes, the deputy mayor and lead on policing, told a virtual press conference that resulting confusion over what is and isn\u2019t allowed has made it \u201calmost impossible for police to deal with\u201d infringements. She added: It\u2019s difficult to see a role for police in maintaining social distancing rules. Hughes said there were clearly more group gatherings over the weekend but police issued just five fixed penalty fines, all to people who had driven to Greater Manchester from Birmingham. Covid-19 remains a significant problem in the north-west. There were 349 new cases in Greater Manchester over the past week, said Burnham, representing a gradual slowing of the virus. But he warned that 25 people were admitted to hospital with Covid-19 yesterday, up from 18 the previous Tuesday. Sixty-five people are currently in intensive care in Greater Manchester hospitals, down from 77 last week. Burnham said he had \u201csignificant concerns\u201d after hearing the health secretary, Matt Hancock, float the idea of local lockdowns to deal with flare-ups in particular communities. He said: It would be a real challenge with regards to the enforceability of any lockdown and indeed the fairness. If we rush into a local lockdown policy I think it\u2019s a recipe for chaos. He also complained that Greater Manchester had received \u201cminimal\u201d information from the government about how these local lockdowns would work, adding: We are in the dark as to this policy even though it will have a major impact on us. I\u2019m afraid it follows a pattern on PPE and testing and now this. Hi everyone. I\u2019m Lucy Campbell, back from lunch. Please do continue to get in touch throughout the day with news tips and stories we should be covering. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ Mike Freer, Conservative member of parliament for Finchley and Golders Green and government whip, has said he would not have done what Dominic Cummings did. In a letter to his constituents who raised complaints, he said: I certainly would not have taken the actions Mr Cummings did. There is an argument that can be made for Mr Cummings\u2019 trip, and I know that many will understand his actions as a father. Of course, it is entirely reasonable for people to vehemently disagree with his view of events. I do not believe it is the conclusion many of my constituents, or myself, would have reached. Many would simply not have taken this course of action. I completely understand the anger with which you write, especially as the British public have given up so much to help fight this virus. Please be assured that the full feeling of my constituents is always passed on to relevant ministers, including the Prime Minister. As a government minister, I am in the privileged position of being able to ensure your views, the strength of your views, alongside my own views, are conveyed directly to the prime minister. I take my role in representing the constituency very seriously and in my experience, firm but private representations are more effective than public denunciations. The chief executive of NHS Providers has said healthcare professionals would like \u201cdots to be joined up\u201d with the government\u2019s track and trace plan. Chris Hopson told BBC Radio 4\u2019s The World At One Programme: I think what we\u2019re saying here is we are about to enter a dangerous phase, but if we haven\u2019t got the track, test and isolate infrastructure in place, and if we\u2019ve got confidence and trust in the guidelines starting to reduce, that feels to us to be really quite a dangerous position. So if I was one of those select committee chairman, I would be asking the question - prime minister, given we\u2019re not going to have the world-class test and trace in by June 1, when will it be available? How can you restore the trust and confidence in the social distancing guidelines that has been lost over the last four days, given that we are entering this dangerous phase?\u201d Asked why the government\u2019s system would not be world class, Hopson said \u201cwe need to build local test and trace capacity and that is simply not going to be in place\u201d. A retired doctor who set up the UK\u2019s first Covid-19 contact-tracing scheme has warned the government faces major challenges after they struggled to persuade health and care workers to self-isolate. Dr Bing Jones told BBC Radio 4\u2019s The World At One programme that only a third of people involved in their testing scheme agreed to self-isolate. He said: \u201cThe other two-thirds were mostly co-operative but we didn\u2019t complete the follow-up. One of the reasons was that three-quarters of these people who we were unable to follow, so that is around 30 people, were employed in the health service or care homes or home care. \u201cThey generally said \u2018we\u2019d like to help but I discussed it with my manager and my manager says no\u2019.\u201d He added that \u201cthis is a major challenge for the government\u201d. Greg Fell, a director of Public Health in Sheffield, added: \u201cI hope the app will do what it was built to do but certainly I\u2019m not building my hopes and aspirations about the app being there to save us. I\u2019m building my hopes and aspirations about having skilled humans.\u201d Hello everyone. I am covering the blog for an hour while Lucy Campbell takes a well-earned lunch break. Please do get in touch to share any news tips or information with me. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com The schools minister, Nick Gibb, has told MPs it is \u201cdifficult to say\u201d whether the government\u2019s ambition for primary schools to reopen to all pupils this summer term will be met. He told the education select committee that the final decision on the wider reopening of primary schools before September will depend on whether transmission rates continue to decline. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, is pushing for pupils in reception, year one and year six at English primaries to return from 1 June, to be followed soon after by other years. Gibb said: We don\u2019t know [this will happen] until we see more evidence of the R factor continuing to reduce over the next few weeks. The R number refers to the average number of people that will contract coronavirus from an infected person. Gibb confirmed that a decision on reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils will be taken on Thursday after the government has reviewed the latest scientific evidence. He added that rotas could be introduced if primary schools also reopened to other years to ensure physical distancing takes place. Conservative MP Jonathan Gullis raised concerns that the furore over Dominic Cummings refusing to apologise for breaking lockdown rules had undermined parents\u2019 and teachers\u2019 confidence in the government\u2019s plans, to which Gibb responded: The more we all adhere to the rules, the more that we\u2019ll be able to make further progress in reopening schools. Meanwhile, the NEU teaching union has written to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, criticising the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies\u2019 advice on reopening schools. Among the concerns raised in the letter is the issue of regional variations in the R number, which was also raised in the select committee hearing. The Labour MP for Gateshead, Ian Mearns, pointed out it was five times higher in his constituency than in Cornwall. Here are some of the main points from this afternoon\u2019s lobby briefing. Downing Street defended not carrying out a review into fines issued to families who travelled to get childcare during lockdown. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said: We\u2019re confident that the police will use their common sense and discretion, they have been very clear throughout that they will explain, encourage and finally enforce fines are always used by police as a last resort. Boris Johnson maintains his position that Dominic Cummings acted legally and with integrity despite a Tory backlash and opinion polls suggesting the public disagree. The spokesman said: The PM set out on Monday night when he was asked about this that people would have to make up their own minds. He said his own conclusion was Dominic Cummings acted reasonably, legally and with integrity and care for his family and for others. He noted that the PM said reasonable people may disagree with some of the decisions but not his aide\u2019s motivation, adding: From the prime minister\u2019s view, he concluded that Dominic Cummings acted reasonably and legally. Downing Street said the Treasury\u2019s schemes will help the economy bounce back after the latest figures showing their cost were published. The spokesman told the briefing: The Bank of England and the OBR have both said that without these schemes the impact on our economy would\u2019ve been much worse. The schemes put us and businesses across the UK in a strong position to bounce back in the future and carry on delivering the agenda set out earlier this year at the budget. Downing Street said it is \u201chopeful\u201d that schools could begin reopening on 1 June ahead of the official legal review into the lockdown on Thursday. The spokesman said: The PM said on Sunday night the final decision will be taken as part of the formal review into lockdown measures, which the law requires us to undertake by Thursday. That formal review will happen tomorrow and we are hopeful, without prejudging it, that we will be able to proceed with the reopening schools on June 1. Downing Street denied that the PM outlined plans to reopen schools to distract from the Dominic Cummings furore. The PM\u2019s spokesman said: No, absolutely not. I\u2019ve been asked here day after day when we were going to say to schools what our position was because they needed a significant period of notice to start planning for the reopening, so the PM\u2019s timing reflects that and nothing else. Downing Street said the lockdown review should be announced at the daily press conference on Thursday after ministers consider Sage advice. The spokesman added: Cabinet has discussed the road map and the decision which the government would like to implement on the proviso that it\u2019s in line with the five tests and any package we bring forward wouldn\u2019t risk a second spike in the virus that would overwhelm the NHS. A further cabinet meeting was not expected on Thursday, he added. Downing Street remains confident of hitting the 200,000 target for testing capacity by Monday, with that ability standing at 154,120 in the 24 hours up to 9am on Tuesday. Asked if the target will be met, the PM\u2019s official spokesman said: Yes, that\u2019s right. It\u2019s in tandem with the commitment we have to have the tracing and testing scheme in place on Monday. The prime minister missed vital meetings on coronavirus and had barely been seen for weeks, but for Dominic Cummings he\u2019s fought tooth-and-nail, writes Guardian columnist Aditya Chakrabortty. An extract from this week\u2019s column reads: Soon will come a point when the memes peter out and the media scrum disperses. What will be left is a historic economic depression and a public realisation that far more people have died in this pandemic than in the Blitz, thanks to an administration that could barely bring itself to care for anyone beyond its own senior members. And here is the full piece. At first minister\u2019s questions, Nicola Sturgeon was challenged repeatedly about the hundreds of older people who were discharged from hospital in the early days of the pandemic to care homes, without being tested for coronavirus. The first minister has previously accepted she cannot say for certain whether people died as a result of being discharged from hospital into care homes. Last week the Scottish health secretary, Jeane Freeman, said 921 \u201cdelayed discharge\u201d patients were moved to care homes in March, yet mandatory testing of all those being moved into care homes only started on 21 April, raising fears the untested patients transferred from hospitals took the infection into homes with fatal results. Sturgeon said she could see \u201cwith everything we know now, people will look and ask why\u201d, but asked people to appreciate that at the time hospitals were expecting \u201ca tsumani\u201d of cases and to leave older people in hospital would have put them at huge risk. The Scottish Conservative leader, Jackson Carlaw, described the untested discharges as a \u201cnational scandal\u201d, and Sturgeon assured him that the promised public inquiry into the response to the pandemic would \u201cundoubtedly include what happened in care homes\u201d. But she told the Holyrood chamber that she had taken \u201cthe best decisions I can every step of the way, based on the best information and evidence I had at the time\u201d. She added that she would \u201cnot shy away [from admitting to] instances where had I known then what I know now I might have come to different conclusions. But that is what leadership means, you have to make the tough calls when they fall to be made, you can\u2019t hide away with your head down and hope it all goes away.\u201d Boris Johnson will be questioned by senior MPs as he faces a growing Tory revolt and plummeting poll ratings over the Dominic Cummings row. The prime minister will appear before the powerful liaison committee \u2013 the only committee with the authority to question the PM \u2013 at 4pm. The group of senior MPs are to grill Johnson on all aspects of his response to the coronavirus crisis, including over his most senior adviser Dominic Cummings\u2019 260-mile lockdown trip to Durham. It is understood that parliamentarians will have 20 minutes at the start of the session to interrogate the prime minister on the Cummings affair, while other aspects of the government\u2019s handling of the lockdown are set to be discussed in three other 20-minute periods. About 40 Tory MPs have called for Cummings to go and, despite expressing public support for the PM\u2019s chief adviser, there are reports of private dissatisfaction among cabinet members who also believe he must go. The latest figures from the National Records of Scotland show the fourth consecutive weekly reduction of deaths involving Covid-19. With lockdown restrictions easing across the country on Thursday, the new data reveals a decrease of a third in death registrations relating to the virus, from 335 the previous week to 230 between 18 and 24 May. This means that as of 24 May, there have been a total of 3,779 deaths in Scotland where the virus was mentioned on the death certificate. It\u2019s still the case that more than half of all registered deaths involving Covid-19 in week 21 occurred in care homes, standing at 54%, compared with a previous peak of 60% in week 18. Three-quarters (76%) of registered deaths involving Covid-19 to date were people aged 75 or over. The total number of deaths registered in Scotland from 18-24 May was 17% higher than the average number of deaths registered in the same week over the last five years, but the number of excess deaths has been decreasing week on week over the past six weeks. The report also notes fewer deaths from respiratory diseases, circulatory conditions, and dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s compared with the average for this time of year. The Dominic Cummings saga shows no sign of letting up and government ministers have repeatedly defended his actions as coming down to his family\u2019s \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d, ie needing childcare if both he and his wife became ill with the virus. However, several readers have been in touch over the last few days to highlight the precise point made in this piece \u2013 that the \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d clause was added to the lockdown guidelines to safeguard women and children in domestic abuse households. It stated that lockdown rules could be broken in these exceptional circumstances, to protect vulnerable people from abuse and neglect. There is thus the perception that Cummings is exploiting a rule meant for abuse victims, and the government continues to defend him for doing so. Calls to the Refuge charity\u2019s domestic abuse helpline have increased by two-thirds since lockdown started, while website visits have risen nearly tenfold. The charity said it had seen a 66% rise in demand for its 24-hour 0808 2000 247 helpline since the nation was ordered to stay indoors and more women ended up trapped inside with abusive partners. Meanwhile, visits to the service\u2019s helpline website, where women can confidentially ask for a safe time to be contacted, have soared by 950% since 23 March, it added. The chief executive, Sandra Horley, said: Right now women\u2019s lives depend on them being able to access the specialist services Refuge provides, and now, more than ever, we must continue to provide the confidential support needed. While lockdown itself does not cause domestic abuse, it can aggravate pre-existing behaviours in abusive partners. Women up and down the country are isolated with abusive partners \u2013 and children will be witnessing and in some cases experiencing domestic abuse. This is a terrifying ordeal and Refuge wants women to know they are not alone. Last week, the director of public prosecutions, Max Hill QC, said domestic abuse cases were among those being treated \u201cas a priority\u201d. He told the Commons justice committee: We are as alarmed as anybody by the very difficult position that, in the main, women are put in, particularly in some communities, in enforced lockdown. It is very important that we say publicly that we are there to deal with those cases. The security minister, James Brokenshire, also announced the government was looking at implementing a \u201ckey word\u201d system to help victims alert people such as shop workers during a rare trip outside the home that they need help. Good morning. I\u2019m Lucy Campbell, taking over the blog for the remainder of the day. As always, please do feel free to get in touch with news tips and comments! Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ More evidence exposing a lack of equality in the home and at work, this time from the Office for National Statistics. The ONS has found that men are doing more than an hour less unpaid labour than women each day, despite increasing their responsibilities during the coronavirus lockdown. Time spent on childcare has risen by more than a third (35%) during the lockdown, while help from grandparents has plummeted 90%, according to the ONS survey. Men increased their unpaid labour, such as caring for children or adults, housework and volunteering, by 22 minutes to two hours and 25 minutes a day, the study found. But while women\u2019s burden was reduced by 20 minutes a day, to three hours and 32 minutes, they are still giving an hour and seven minutes more of their time than men. The time use survey compared data from 28 March to 26 April with figures from the previous study between April 2014 and December 2015. The study found people with low household incomes have been spending more time doing paid work since the lockdown began. Those with monthly household incomes up to \u00a31,700 have spent an extra 21 minutes a day on average doing paid work, compared with a drop of about 32 minutes for those on monthly incomes of \u00a31,700 to \u00a33,300. The ONS said low-paid jobs were less likely to be able to be done from home. Households earning up to \u00a31,700 per month after tax were working the same amount outside the home as they were five years ago, while higher-income households were more likely to have switched to home working. Gueorguie Vassilev of the ONS said: These new findings show that not all households are experiencing the impacts of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic in the same way. It will be interesting to see if time use reverts to a pre-pandemic pattern after this crisis is over, or if some changes will be lasting ones. While higher earners had seen a daily increase of 46 minutes of free time, lower earners only experienced a 19-minute increase. The number of workers in a trade union increased by 91,000 last year, according to data published by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. The total rose to 6.44 million, the third consecutive yearly increase following a low of 6.23 million in 2016. The proportion of workers who were trade union members increased to 23.5% in 2019, up from 23.4% a year earlier. The rise was driven by the increase in female members, up 170,000 on the year to 3.69 million, the highest figure since the records began in 1995. The main boost to numbers has come from the public sector, which rose by 74,000 to 3.77 million; private sector membership rose by 17,000 to 2.67 million. The TUC said the most recent figures did not take into account increases in union membership since the coronavirus outbreak. The TUC general secretary, Frances O\u2019Grady, said: Today\u2019s figures show that union membership was growing before the coronavirus crisis hit, and we know that in the last few months, thousands of workers have been turning to unions to protect their jobs, defend their rights and keep their workplaces safe. The hard work and dedication of millions of workers has brought us through this crisis. Ministers must put workers\u2019 voices at the heart of their strategy, including through a national recovery council bringing together unions and employers. The Conservatives\u2019 poll lead over Labour has suffered a sharp week-on-week drop following the Dominic Cummings row. A YouGov survey for the Times reveals that support for the Conservatives is down by four points to 44%, while Labour climbed five points to reach 38%. Here\u2019s a snapshot of some of the key findings: The majority of voters think the media has been fair in the reporting of the row. And 70% of Britons \u2013 and 59% of Conservative voters \u2013 say the Cummings coronavirus row will make it harder for the government to get future lockdown messaging across to the public. A really significant report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which has found that mothers appear to be doing most of the housework and childcare during lockdown. The research suggests that in homes where there is a working mother and father, women are doing more chores and spending more time with children. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) and University College London (UCL) interviewed 3,500 families and found mothers were only able to do one hour of uninterrupted work, for every three hours done by dads. Lucy Kraftman, a research economist at the IFS, said the finding applied to families where a mother and father were both working, as well as to families where both parents were furloughed or out of work. Mothers are doing, on average, more childcare and more housework than fathers who have the same work arrangements. The only set of households where we see mothers and fathers sharing childcare and housework equally are those in which both parents were previously working, but the father has now stopped working for pay, while the mother is still in paid work. However, mothers in these households are doing paid work during an average of five hours a day, in addition to doing the same amount of domestic work as their partner. Mothers in two-parent households are only doing, on average, a third of the uninterrupted paid-work hours of fathers, UCL and the IFS found. Before lockdown, mothers completed on average around 60% of the uninterrupted work hours that fathers did. Alison Andrew from the IFS said: A risk is that the lockdown leads to a further increase in the gender wage gap. But her colleague, Sonya Krutikova, said the lockdown had also given some cause for hope that the future could see a more equal division of household labour between parents: Fathers, on average, are doing nearly double the hours of childcare they were doing prior to the crisis. This may bring about changes in the attitudes of fathers, mothers, children and employers about the role of fathers in meeting family needs for childcare and domestic work during the working week. Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said: This data reveals the motherhood penalty multiplied by the effects of the lockdown and confirms what we have feared. This will reverse decades of progress on women\u2019s participation in the labour market unless the government intervenes to address it. Leaving women behind means we risk no economic recovery at all. What this study shows is that we are going backwards and that is extremely worrying. There is also the real prospect of two-tier workplaces as the lockdown is eased with men getting back into work and women still left at home caring for children, without nursery places or schools fully open for months. Government must now prioritise strategic investment to create a childcare infrastructure, reform parental leave, to equalise parenting in a child\u2019s first year and normalise flexible and remote working in the post-Covid economy. And they could also relieve the financial pressure on parents by increasing child benefit. Three Tory MPs newly elected to seats in County Durham issued a statement last night to express their disappointment in Dominic Cummings \u2013 but stopped short of calling for him to resign. In their joint statement, Richard Holden (North West Durham), Dehenna Davison (Bishop Auckland) and Paul Howell (in Tony Blair\u2019s former seat of Sedgefield), said they would not have done the same as Cummings, particularly not the 30-mile trip to Barnard Castle to \u201ctest\u201d his eyesight. But they said they accepted he was \u201cmotivated out of his desire as a parent to do what he thought was necessary in protecting his family\u201d. This is the full statement. I\u2019m making no apologies for posting a few pictures of some happy, in-love people this morning. Here is ambulatory emergency nurse Jann Tipping, 34, and acute medical registrar Annalan Navaratnam, 30, who have got married at the hospital where they work. They were married by the Rev Mia Hilborn (who I interviewed about her work when the NHS turned 70, incidentally) in the Grade II-listed chapel at London\u2019s St Thomas\u2019 hospital. Tipping said they \u201cwanted to make sure we could celebrate while we were all still able to even if it meant our loved ones having to watch us on a screen\u201d and described the wedding on 24 April as \u201cintimate\u201d and \u201clovely\u201d, but added it felt \u201csurreal\u201d getting married where they both work. Navaratnam said they were \u201cso happy that we have been able to commit ourselves to one another\u201d. They had a virtual drinks reception, including a first dance and speeches. Congratulations Jann and Annalan! Halfords is set to reopen 53 stores to deal with a surge in bike sales since the government relaxed lockdown rules and encouraged commuting that avoids public transport. The stores, spread across the country, will allow a limited number of shoppers through its doors under a model bosses want to call \u201cRetail Lite\u201d. The decision comes a day after the government said most non-essential retailers could reopen from June 15. Halford\u2019s had been permitted to open during the strict lockdown, but shut its shops, allowing only purchases from outside or online. New rules include reduced customers, queuing marshals, safety notices and floor markings, sneeze screen visors for staff and instructions to customers not to handle or try on products. The chief executive, Graham Stapleton, said: There has been a big surge in demand for our bike products and services as people have taken to cycling during the lockdown, both for commuting and for fun. We are also anticipating a similar level of demand for our motoring products and services in the coming days, as people begin to use vehicles again that in some cases will have been off the road for many weeks. Meanwhile, the housing, communities and local government secretary, Robert Jenrick, has said it is time to \u201cmove on\u201d from the Cummings scandal. Asked if he believes Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser should resign, Jenrick told the BBC\u2019s Breakfast programme: No, he shouldn\u2019t. He has given his explanation to the prime minister, who listened and concluded that he\u2019d acted reasonably and legally. The prime minister then asked him to give that statement on Monday to the public and to answer questions from journalists.He answered them for over an hour and now, I think, is the time for us all to move on. That\u2019s not to say this isn\u2019t an important issue or that people don\u2019t care about it, but I think there\u2019s a lot more that we need to focus on now. Jenrick said the explanation given by Cummings over his reasons for travelling to Durham was \u201creasonable\u201d. Asked if he could understand the anger of the public over the issue, Jenrick said: I can and many people would disagree with the decisions that Dominic Cummings made, both members of the public and members of Parliament. But he set out why he made those decisions and his motivations, which were to protect his unwell wife and his young child, and to self-isolate at a household somewhere where he believed he could get the childcare and support that they needed. I think that that\u2019s a reasonable explanation and it\u2019s a legal one, it doesn\u2019t look as if any of the guidelines or the rules have been broken. My view is that now we accept that and we move on because there are many, many more important issues that we need to be talking about. Jenrick said there will not be a review of UK lockdown fines for childcare-related travel. Here isn\u2019t going to be a formal review. It\u2019s for the police to decide whether to impose fines under the law. They have the guidance that we\u2019ve provided and the national police chiefs have provided their own guidance, which does give officers a degree of discretion to use their common sense, reflecting the fact that all of our circumstances are different and families, in particular, face particular challenges. They are encouraging their officers to engage in the first instance, to explain and to resort to fines only where absolutely necessary and in most cases that is what\u2019s happened. The shadow foreign and commonwealth affairs secretary, Lisa Nandy, has said the prime minister must take responsibility over the scandal surrounding his adviser Dominic Cummings. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Breakfast programme, the Labour MP said: The prime minister has got to take responsibility for this now. He\u2019s got to decide whether he can actually account for why that situation was so unique that the rules had to be broken and if he can\u2019t, then I think it\u2019s right that he should take action to restore public confidence. At the moment, we\u2019ve got a situation where both the prime minister and his own adviser are just refusing to resign or to sack him, and also refusing to answer basic questions. That\u2019s just not sustainable. Something has got to change and it\u2019s got to change very, very quickly if the public are going to have confidence. Conservative former MP Dr Sarah Wollaston has added her voice to calls that Dominic Cummings must be sacked. Wollaston, who previously chaired the liaison committee, told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain that she would urge Boris Johnson \u201cunequivocally\u201d to sack the prime minster\u2019s chief adviser over his trip to Durham from London. She said: You cannot put one single special adviser above the public health of the nation and put the health of the nation at risk just to protect somebody who\u2019s clearly not being straight with the public. The principle that there\u2019s one rule for you, one rule for everybody else, it just won\u2019t wash and he has to go. The Rev Martin Poole, the Church of England vicar who last night put health secretary Matt Hancock on the spot by asking if fines given to people travelling for childcare reasons during the lockdown will be looked into by the government, has been on the BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning. Hancock said during the press briefing that it was a \u201cperfectly reasonable\u201d question to ask and he would ask the Treasury about the penalty notices, which were initially \u00a360 and later rose to \u00a3100, which were given to people breaching the lockdown rules. But Poole said this morning he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that shortly after government advisers stressed that Hancock had been asked about another government policy area and had not promised an official review but only to look into the issue. The Home Office, rather than the Treasury, will look into the issue. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Poole said: I took [Hancock] at his word that he would go away and have some discussions and that was really nice to hear. It\u2019s a little disappointing to hear afterwards that they\u2019ve rowed back on that a bit. What I want is honesty from Government all the time and if their response is they can\u2019t review things or they don\u2019t want to, I accept that they\u2019ll say that. But I do feel that if there are people with children, who have been fined for doing that, then they\u2019ll want some sort of recourse. Asked if he knew of any families who had been fined, he added: I don\u2019t know anyone who has, but I know plenty of people where both parents (are) sick with small children and have deliberately stayed in because that\u2019s what they understood the rules to say. And I think, more widely, there\u2019s just that feeling that there\u2019s a different set of rules for those in leadership than there are for the rest of us. Here\u2019s our original story: Good morning to all of our readers around the world and in the UK. Here the row over the prime minister\u2019s chief adviser Dominic Cummings continues to rumble on. Here\u2019s a quick roundup of our main stories: Boris Johnson faced an extraordinary and growing revolt from within his own party on Tuesday over his refusal to sack his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, for breaching lockdown rules. Yesterday a junior minister resigned and more than 30 other Conservative MPs called for Cummings to go, many citing inboxes overflowing with hundreds of angry messages from constituents. Regional flare-ups of coronavirus cases in England after rules are eased will be tackled with \u201clocal lockdowns\u201d, the health secretary has said. Matt Hancock told the No 10 daily press briefing the ability to tighten restrictions in individual regions would be part of the NHS test, track and trace system, which is due to expand on 1 June. Boris Johnson will be questioned by senior MPs later amid continued calls for Cummings to resign. It is the first time he has appeared before the Commons Liaison Committee \u2013 the only committee that gets to question the PM - since taking office. Committee members will ask Johnson about the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 we can expect questions around his aide too. A scientific adviser to the government has warned that public anger over the conduct of Cummings has encouraged some people to break lockdown rules, raising the risk of a resurgence in coronavirus infections.",
