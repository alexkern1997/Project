      "bodyText": "General practitioners have rallied behind a Melbourne doctor who tested positive for coronavirus and demanded an apology from the Victorian health minister who they say has maligned frontline health workers. It comes as the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia reaches 75. Dr Chis Higgins saw approximately 70 patients while recovering from what he believed to be a mild cold last week, before he tested positive for Covid-19. He had flown in from the US on Saturday morning. All of those patients, including two he visited at Malvern\u2019s Mecwacare nursing home, as well as all the clinical staff at the Toorak Clinic where Higgins is a GP, have since been told to self-isolate for 14 days. The health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said on Saturday that she was \u201cflabbergasted that a doctor that has flu-like symptoms has presented to work\u201d, and that his decision to continue to treat patients while unwell may be a matter for the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency to pursue. \u201cI understand our medical and healthcare workers are dedicated to the work they do \u2026 But it is irresponsible for people to be going to work if they are unwell, and that is not just healthcare workers, it is everybody in the community who needs to take this very seriously,\u201d Mikakos said. She did not name the doctor, but the Toorak Clinic only has eight GPs. The federal president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Tony Bartone, said the doctor had acted in good faith and in accordance with current guidelines, which do not recommend testing or isolation for people who become unwell upon returning from the US, and that Mikakos\u2019s comments were \u201cvery disappointing indeed\u201d. Bartone said the minister should apologise. He also challenged suggestions GPs were well-resourced and had been kept well-informed during the outbreak. \u201cWhat is clear is that \u2026 there has been an inconsistency of messaging through various parts of the system,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have an official online advisory site that is supposed to guide but clearly there have been times where various states and territories have had different messaging to their communities. \u201cWe have to start acting as one if we\u2019re to deal with this threat of Covid-19 and assure that we have not only the briefs of truth online but that we are singing from the same song sheet, we know what is expected of us, and that information is clearly communicated in real-time and updated as quickly as necessary.\u201d Higgins, the father of the singer Missy Higgins, responded in a comment on Mikakos\u2019s Facebook page, saying: \u201cAs the doctor concerned, I have been upset about the inaccuracies and unfairness of your comments. \u201cThis is not the story that I told the DHSS whose job it is to relay information to you.

And the important point here is the coronavirus will have a significant impact,\u201d he told ABC Insider\u2019s on Sunday. \u201cNobody is denying that. We\u2019re not denying that. But the problems in the economy didn\u2019t start with the coronavirus and they won\u2019t disappear when the coronavirus is dealt with. </p> <p>\u201cThere has been ongoing weakness in the economy. Economic growth is slowing.\u201d</p> <p>The Reserve Bank expects Australia\u2019s economy to improve once the crisis has passed, but Bowen said the four cuts the RBA had made to interest rates in the past year was indicative the economy was struggling before the recent natural disasters and coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cThe economy has been weakening,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the government does need to respond. One of the things that they could do is adopt the policy we took with the election with the Australian investment guarantee \u2013 a \u2026 20% upfront for all businesses and investments big or small.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a good step. One that they dismissed arrogantly at the time and said wasn\u2019t necessary. I do think that they\u2019ll have to adopt something like that. And there are other measures that need to be put in place as well.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike Labor\u2019s response to the global financial crisis, which included individual cheques in a successful bid to keep Australians spending and the nation out of recession, the prime minister has continually pointed to a \u201ctargeted, measured and scalable\u201d response.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/07/gig-economy-workers-on-breadline-too-poor-to-stay-at-home-if-they-catch-coronavirus\">\u2018If I catch the coronavirus I\u2019m screwed.

Businesses are also expected to receive a further boost through instant asset write-off and investment tax breaks.</p> <p>Reports have placed the stimulus package at between $5bn and $10bn, with other measures on the table if the June quarter slowdown fears look to be realised.</p> <p>Labor has said it would look at the measures, but has announced it was looking to support the government\u2019s attempts to ward off recession.</p> <p>An economy is in a technical recession if it experiences two quarters of negative growth.

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government is putting together the final touches to its coronavirus stimulus plan, which is expected to be announced early this week. The multibillion-dollar plan, brought forward after talks with the International Monetary Fund and treasury, aims to offset a recession. The bushfires and Covid-19 hits to the economy are conservatively predicted to have shaved 0.7% off growth figures. On Tuesday the attorney general, Christian Porter, will meet unions and employers \u201cto enlist their support and cooperation\u201d to minimise impacts to Australia\u2019s workforce and ensure supply chains are not impeded. \u201cIt\u2019s vitally important that we are all working towards the same goal of ensuring that, as much as possible, key industry sectors like food and pharmaceutical manufacturing, mining, health and transport are able to operate at maximum capacity,\u201d Porter said. With fears Australia is already in negative growth with one month of this quarter to go, compacted by fears the June quarter could also be severely affected, the Morrison government is expected to release its \u201ctargeted\u201d plan within days. Labor\u2019s health spokesman and former shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, said the government should have had an economic response in place. \u201cYes, it should have. And the important point here is the coronavirus will have a significant impact,\u201d he told ABC Insider\u2019s on Sunday. \u201cNobody is denying that. We\u2019re not denying that. But the problems in the economy didn\u2019t start with the coronavirus and they won\u2019t disappear when the coronavirus is dealt with. \u201cThere has been ongoing weakness in the economy. Economic growth is slowing.\u201d The Reserve Bank expects Australia\u2019s economy to improve once the crisis has passed, but Bowen said the four cuts the RBA had made to interest rates in the past year was indicative the economy was struggling before the recent natural disasters and coronavirus. \u201cThe economy has been weakening,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the government does need to respond. One of the things that they could do is adopt the policy we took with the election with the Australian investment guarantee \u2013 a \u2026 20% upfront for all businesses and investments big or small. \u201cThat\u2019s a good step. One that they dismissed arrogantly at the time and said wasn\u2019t necessary. I do think that they\u2019ll have to adopt something like that. And there are other measures that need to be put in place as well.\u201d Unlike Labor\u2019s response to the global financial crisis, which included individual cheques in a successful bid to keep Australians spending and the nation out of recession, the prime minister has continually pointed to a \u201ctargeted, measured and scalable\u201d response. Local councils are expected to be a key beneficiary, with the government keen to continue infrastructure spending. Businesses are also expected to receive a further boost through instant asset write-off and investment tax breaks. Reports have placed the stimulus package at between $5bn and $10bn, with other measures on the table if the June quarter slowdown fears look to be realised. Labor has said it would look at the measures, but has announced it was looking to support the government\u2019s attempts to ward off recession. An economy is in a technical recession if it experiences two quarters of negative growth. Australia, as one of the only nations to escape recession during the GFC, has experienced 30 years of economic growth as it has taken advantage of China and India\u2019s economic booms. One sitting week of parliament remains before the Coalition hands down its May budget, which it had already declared to be in surplus a year earlier. In the past few months, both Scott Morrison and Frydenberg have distanced themselves from the \u201cback in black\u201d claims, instead pointing to having brought the previous budget to balance. The bushfires, floods and now coronavirus have severely bitten into the promised surplus, which had been revised down by $2bn to $5bn in the December update. While a health crisis, coronavirus has had a strong economic impact, with end-to-end supply chains badly hit, meaning businesses have been unable to receive necessary products or in some cases send them. Labor is also calling for an increase to Newstart, or help for casual workers, who may not have the sick leave available to be able to self-isolate and earn at the same time. Speaking to Sky News on the same morning, the social services minister Anne Ruston said any Newstart changes would be part of a separate measure, with the stimulus aimed at a \u201cshort-term, measured and proportionate response\u201d to the current economic conditions.",

On Sunday he was in isolation in hospital. \u201cIt is unacceptable to continue activities in public or attend work while waiting for the coronavirus test results,\u201d Veitch told the ABC. Seven people \u2013 four in the same household and three friends of the man \u2013 had been placed in self-isolation for 14 days, and authorities were contact tracing anyone who may have had prolonged contact with him at the Grand Chancellor Hotel. Hunt said the issue of casual workers having to miss work without sick leave if they are made to self-isolate for 14 days would be addressed at a national roundtable chaired by the federal attorney general, Christian Porter, in Sydney on Tuesday. He said the advice for anyone who believes they may have been exposed is to self-isolate, even if their symptoms would not usually prompt them to visit a doctor. \u201cIf in doubt, get yourself tested \u2013 that\u2019s the important message,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though it can be a little bit of a stress on the system, we would rather people over-test rather than under-test.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>When middle-aged and older people feel unsafe, they run to the familiar and reliable, even if it\u2019s deadly dull. Younger people who feel threatened are more likely to take risks in hopes of finding something better.</p> <p>This generational difference explains a great deal about what\u2019s happened during the most tumultuous two weeks in recent American economic and political history.</p> <p>Since 24 February, with the lethal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> spreading around the world, middle-aged and older Americans \u2013 not only most vulnerable to the disease but also accounting for most retirement savings \u2013 have been fleeing stocks for the relative safety of US government bonds.</p> <p>The stampede has gutted the stock market while reducing bond yields, which move in the opposite direction of bond prices, to unprecedented lows. The interest rates on the 10-year Treasury note fell Friday to a record-breaking 0.71%.</p> <p>Despite the Fed\u2019s half-per cent cut in interest rates last Tuesday and the labor department\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/06/us-job-growth-february-far-above-predictions-employment-economy\">upbeat</a> jobs report on Friday, the flight to safety continues.</p> <p>Bonds are deadly dull, but when the economy is wracked by uncertainty they\u2019re the safest havens available.</p> <p>The rush to safety didn\u2019t end there. In last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/super-tuesday\">Super Tuesday</a> primaries in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">2020 election</a>, older <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democratic</a> voters stampeded toward <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a>.</p> <p>As recently as 22 February \u2013 the Friday before the giant selloff on Wall Street \u2013 only 17.2% of Democratic voters supported Biden, according to the RealClearPolitics aggregate polls. Less than two weeks later, Biden\u2019s support had surged to 34.3%.</p> <p>Biden was helped by his strong showing in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-carolina\">South Carolina</a> primary and by the last-minute endorsements of the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pete-buttigieg\">Pete Buttigieg</a> and the Minnesota Senator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/amy-klobuchar\">Amy Klobuchar</a>.

      "bodyText": "When middle-aged and older people feel unsafe, they run to the familiar and reliable, even if it\u2019s deadly dull. Younger people who feel threatened are more likely to take risks in hopes of finding something better. This generational difference explains a great deal about what\u2019s happened during the most tumultuous two weeks in recent American economic and political history. Since 24 February, with the lethal coronavirus spreading around the world, middle-aged and older Americans \u2013 not only most vulnerable to the disease but also accounting for most retirement savings \u2013 have been fleeing stocks for the relative safety of US government bonds. The stampede has gutted the stock market while reducing bond yields, which move in the opposite direction of bond prices, to unprecedented lows. The interest rates on the 10-year Treasury note fell Friday to a record-breaking 0.71%. Despite the Fed\u2019s half-per cent cut in interest rates last Tuesday and the labor department\u2019s upbeat jobs report on Friday, the flight to safety continues. Bonds are deadly dull, but when the economy is wracked by uncertainty they\u2019re the safest havens available. The rush to safety didn\u2019t end there. In last week\u2019s Super Tuesday primaries in the 2020 election, older Democratic voters stampeded toward Joe Biden. As recently as 22 February \u2013 the Friday before the giant selloff on Wall Street \u2013 only 17.2% of Democratic voters supported Biden, according to the RealClearPolitics aggregate polls. Less than two weeks later, Biden\u2019s support had surged to 34.3%. Biden was helped by his strong showing in the South Carolina primary and by the last-minute endorsements of the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg and the Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar. And by fear-mongering over Bernie Sanders by Democratic insiders, big funders and pundits. But the rapidity of Biden\u2019s ascendance was fueled by a sudden flight to safety among older voters. Biden is the political equivalent of US government bonds. He may be boring but at least he\u2019s familiar and safe. Younger voters are still counting on Bernie Sanders. They\u2019re looking beyond the immediate coronavirus and financial crises to the larger existential crises of this century \u2013 climate change, health care, inequality and corruption. Their time horizons extend beyond those of their parents and grandparents because they\u2019ll be here longer. The generation gap revealed itself on Super Tuesday. Voters between 45 and 64 preferred Biden by 22 points over Sanders (42% to 20%). But Sanders triumphed with younger voters. In Texas, Biden won the support of just 17% of voters under the age of 45, while Sanders won only 19% of voters over 45. In Colorado, Biden won a mere 8% of the under-45s, while Sanders pulled down just 20% support among their elders. In California, Biden\u2019s support among sub-45 voters came to a bare 9%; Sanders won only 22% of those over 45. Meanwhile, as the coronavirus and its financial fallout continue to spread, Donald Trump appears even more dangerous than he did just weeks ago. The deceptive, narcissistic, vindictive president is helping transform a public health problem and financial slide into a double-barreled national emergency. On Friday, while wearing his own re-election campaign merchandise, Trump gave a disjointed news conference during which he called Jay Inslee, the Washington state governor who has criticized Trump\u2019s leadership on the coronavirus, a \u201csnake\u201d. He also claimed the coronavirus test was available to all who needed it, but anyone who has tried to be tested knows that\u2019s untrue. As of now, no more than several thousand people can be tested per day. Trump is facing crises that elude his capacities to con. He can\u2019t bully the coronavirus.

      "body": "<p>\u2018People with knowledge should talk about it, not football managers.\u201d Such was the refreshingly honest response of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/jurgen-klopp\" title=\"\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp</a> when pressed for his views about coronavirus by journalists last week. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIZZCbxngQ\" title=\"\">My opinion about corona is not important</a>.\u201d The Liverpool manager\u2019s comments embody an important sentiment that seems to have emerged in this outbreak: a reappraisal of the importance of experts in the wake of their denigration by populist leaders around the world.</p> <p>This government is not a fan of experts. For months, it has repeatedly ignored warnings from scientists, trade experts and economists about the impact of a hard Brexit on the country\u2019s economic wellbeing and security. It has implicitly declared war on the civil service: aides and advisers liberally brief against \u201cthe blob\u201d and its perceived resistance to ripping up a supposedly pointless rulebook. But thankfully \u2013 perhaps with as much a view to protecting its own political fortunes as well as public health \u2013 ministers have temporarily put their hostility towards experts and civil servants aside. Last week, we criticised the government\u2019s slow response to the crisis: holding back ministers from news programmes that had caused it offence; taking days to call a meeting of Cobra chaired by the PM. But as the government has moved from the \u201ccontain\u201d to the \u201cdelay\u201d phase of its response, there has been a marked improvement.</p> <p>Boris Johnson gave a press conference flanked by the government\u2019s chief medical officer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/uk-government-coronavirus-plans-strip-fire-and-police-to-essentials-covid-19\" title=\"\">Chris Whitty</a>, and its chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance. Decision-making is clearly being driven by medical and scientific expertise. The government quickly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/05/coronavirus-minister-hints-u-turn-decision-stop-daily-uk-updates\" title=\"\">corrected a major misstep</a> when it at first announced it would stop publishing daily information on the location and numbers of patients testing positive. As stressed by the World Health Organization, information and transparency about the extent of the outbreak and plans to deal with it are vital in building public trust; on the whole, the government has been very open about its strategy. There is a sense that the UK response is striking the right balance, issuing accurate and useful information that has avoided over-hyping the risk, and making proportionate responses to try to delay the spread of the virus that do not engender panic.</p> <p>That is not to say that the government\u2019s response has been beyond reproach. It was extremely worrying that the health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/06/uk-supermarkets-asked-to-deliver-food-to-people-in-coronavirus-self-isolation\" title=\"\">Matt Hancock</a>, said that he had been in touch with supermarkets to work on plans to ensure that people in self-isolation would be able to get the food and supplies they need, only for industry executives to accuse him of lying. It undermines the reassurances he offered that the government is confident there will be no problem with the food supply. It reinforces the importance of ministers being truthful rather than relying on bluster.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What is unfolding in the US is exposing in real time the dangers of populism and its rejection of evidence and experts</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While the government\u2019s short-term response has, on the whole, been good, a decade of austerity has put the public infrastructure required to manage a pandemic \u2013 the NHS, the social care system, the police service \u2013 under intolerable strain. It is no exaggeration to say that, as a result, under a worst-case scenario more people will die than necessary. Scientists have also raised fears about the UK\u2019s lack of capacity for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51454859\" title=\"\">vaccine manufacture</a> in preventing future waves of this virus from affecting the population, which is partly as a result of the government\u2019s failure to invest in this years ago.</p> <p>Casting an eye across the Atlantic, to the chaos of the US response, provides a salutary reminder of just how much further Donald Trump is prepared to go than Boris Johnson in his war on experts. Trump has repeatedly contradicted medical experts and consequently confused the public health messaging. \u201cWe closed it down, we stopped it,\u201d he said on Friday, arguing that this justified his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/mar/06/joe-biden-bernie-sanders-2020-presidential-election-trump-coronavirus-live-updates\" title=\"\">tightening of border controls</a>. He labelled the WHO statistics as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/05/trump-coronavirus-who-global-death-rate-false-number\" title=\"\">a really false number</a>\u201d and the <em>New York Times</em> has reported that his administration has told a top infectious disease expert not to say anything to the press <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/03/trump-coronavirus-plan-pence-politics\" title=\"\">without clearance</a>.</p> <p>There are also huge concerns about the capacity of the US to deal with the virus outbreak, given its lack of health infrastructure and employment rights relative to the EU. Almost one in 10 Americans <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/number-of-americans-without-insurance-shows-first-increase-since2008-11568128381\" title=\"\">have no health insurance</a> and will have to meet any costs of treatment \u2013 and perhaps even testing for the virus \u2013 out of pocket. There is a shortage of testing kits and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have refused to publish statistics about <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/03/how-many-americans-have-been-tested-coronavirus/607597\" title=\"\">how many people have been tested</a>. There is no legal entitlement to sick pay in the US, meaning millions of low-paid workers living in poverty will simply not be able to afford to self-isolate as a containment measure.</p> <p>What is unfolding in the US is exposing in real time the dangers of populism and its rejection of evidence and experts. And societies\u2019 responses to the crisis are casting a spotlight on their key vulnerabilities and fragilities. In America, it is the lack of a universal entitlement to healthcare and basic employment rights in one of the world\u2019s richest countries. In Britain, coronavirus has only brought to the fore concerns about the brittle system for caring for older people, who are most at risk of the virus, many of whom suffer from social isolation.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very proud that UK experts\u2026 are on the frontline of global efforts,\u201d Johnson said on Friday, in an about-turn for a prime minister who has made ignoring experts a defining characteristic of his leadership. But will this newly found sense of pride last beyond the coronavirus crisis? That very much remains to be seen.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u2018People with knowledge should talk about it, not football managers.\u201d Such was the refreshingly honest response of J\u00fcrgen Klopp when pressed for his views about coronavirus by journalists last week. \u201cMy opinion about corona is not important.\u201d The Liverpool manager\u2019s comments embody an important sentiment that seems to have emerged in this outbreak: a reappraisal of the importance of experts in the wake of their denigration by populist leaders around the world. This government is not a fan of experts. For months, it has repeatedly ignored warnings from scientists, trade experts and economists about the impact of a hard Brexit on the country\u2019s economic wellbeing and security. It has implicitly declared war on the civil service: aides and advisers liberally brief against \u201cthe blob\u201d and its perceived resistance to ripping up a supposedly pointless rulebook. But thankfully \u2013 perhaps with as much a view to protecting its own political fortunes as well as public health \u2013 ministers have temporarily put their hostility towards experts and civil servants aside. Last week, we criticised the government\u2019s slow response to the crisis: holding back ministers from news programmes that had caused it offence; taking days to call a meeting of Cobra chaired by the PM. But as the government has moved from the \u201ccontain\u201d to the \u201cdelay\u201d phase of its response, there has been a marked improvement. Boris Johnson gave a press conference flanked by the government\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and its chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance. Decision-making is clearly being driven by medical and scientific expertise. The government quickly corrected a major misstep when it at first announced it would stop publishing daily information on the location and numbers of patients testing positive. As stressed by the World Health Organization, information and transparency about the extent of the outbreak and plans to deal with it are vital in building public trust; on the whole, the government has been very open about its strategy. There is a sense that the UK response is striking the right balance, issuing accurate and useful information that has avoided over-hyping the risk, and making proportionate responses to try to delay the spread of the virus that do not engender panic. That is not to say that the government\u2019s response has been beyond reproach. It was extremely worrying that the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said that he had been in touch with supermarkets to work on plans to ensure that people in self-isolation would be able to get the food and supplies they need, only for industry executives to accuse him of lying. It undermines the reassurances he offered that the government is confident there will be no problem with the food supply. It reinforces the importance of ministers being truthful rather than relying on bluster. While the government\u2019s short-term response has, on the whole, been good, a decade of austerity has put the public infrastructure required to manage a pandemic \u2013 the NHS, the social care system, the police service \u2013 under intolerable strain. It is no exaggeration to say that, as a result, under a worst-case scenario more people will die than necessary. Scientists have also raised fears about the UK\u2019s lack of capacity for vaccine manufacture in preventing future waves of this virus from affecting the population, which is partly as a result of the government\u2019s failure to invest in this years ago. Casting an eye across the Atlantic, to the chaos of the US response, provides a salutary reminder of just how much further Donald Trump is prepared to go than Boris Johnson in his war on experts. Trump has repeatedly contradicted medical experts and consequently confused the public health messaging. \u201cWe closed it down, we stopped it,\u201d he said on Friday, arguing that this justified his tightening of border controls. He labelled the WHO statistics as \u201ca really false number\u201d and the New York Times has reported that his administration has told a top infectious disease expert not to say anything to the press without clearance. There are also huge concerns about the capacity of the US to deal with the virus outbreak, given its lack of health infrastructure and employment rights relative to the EU. Almost one in 10 Americans have no health insurance and will have to meet any costs of treatment \u2013 and perhaps even testing for the virus \u2013 out of pocket. There is a shortage of testing kits and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have refused to publish statistics about how many people have been tested. There is no legal entitlement to sick pay in the US, meaning millions of low-paid workers living in poverty will simply not be able to afford to self-isolate as a containment measure. What is unfolding in the US is exposing in real time the dangers of populism and its rejection of evidence and experts. And societies\u2019 responses to the crisis are casting a spotlight on their key vulnerabilities and fragilities. In America, it is the lack of a universal entitlement to healthcare and basic employment rights in one of the world\u2019s richest countries. In Britain, coronavirus has only brought to the fore concerns about the brittle system for caring for older people, who are most at risk of the virus, many of whom suffer from social isolation. \u201cI\u2019m very proud that UK experts\u2026 are on the frontline of global efforts,\u201d Johnson said on Friday, in an about-turn for a prime minister who has made ignoring experts a defining characteristic of his leadership. But will this newly found sense of pride last beyond the coronavirus crisis? That very much remains to be seen.",

For now, the large players are in two minds. The drop in the stock market does not worry them as such. Their concern is that the recent bull market was running on increasingly suspect debt and that Covid-19 may have pricked a bubble that was going to burst anyway. Similarly in Europe, the worst spectre hovering over investors\u2019 heads is that large corporations, relying for too long on free money from the European Central Bank, may be downgraded from investment to junk-grade \u2013 especially so at a time of stagnant domestic demand and a collapsed Chinese import market.</p> <p>Taking a leaf out of the aftermath of the crash of 2008, and the Eurozone crisis that followed, bullish speculators are looking at their central banks, primarily the Fed and the ECB, to do, once again, \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to re-float their flagging fortunes. Two questions keep them up at night: will the central banks oblige? And if they do, will it be enough?</p> <p>The first question is easy to answer: governments are impotent on both sides of the Atlantic. In the United States the federal budget deficit is already at a historic high, especially in the context of a tight labour market, while the Eurozone remains in the straightjacket of its fiscal compact. Therefore the central banks will be forced, whether they like it or not, to step up to the mark. Already we have seen announcements of lower interest rates, even of Japanese-style semi-direct purchases of government and private debt by the monetary authorities.</p> <p>But will it be enough for the central banks to throw more money at the Covid-19-infected money markets? Will the economy go back to where we were a month ago if enough liquidity is pumped into the system? Or will it resemble a slow puncture that demands increasing pump-priming to stay inflated? Moreover, will the new wall of public money push back the wall of xenophobia? The sad answer to the last question is instructive about the economic ones too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/05/coronavirus-could-push-uk-to-brink-of-recession-says-goldman-sachs\">Bank of England drafts action plan to head off coronavirus recession</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When a border closes down, it does not open again easily even if the conditions that caused its closure are largely reversed. This is a safe lesson from Europe\u2019s recent experience. Take, for example, Austria, which closed its border with Italy following the rise of refugee arrivals in the summer of 2015. For a couple of years after that refugee wave had died out, the borders remained shut. Similarly with the borders along the Western Balkans. Why is this relevant to the question of whether increased central bank liquidity will ameliorate the effects of Covid-19 on the economy? To answer, we need to remind ourselves of what happened after the crash of 2008.</p> <p>There were two responses to the 2008 crisis that saved capitalism from total collapse: the gigantic injection of liquidity into the economy by central banks, the Fed above all else; and China, whose government took it upon itself intentionally to build up the greatest private credit bubble in history to replace the lost export demand by a stupendous investment boost. The Fed\u2019s and China\u2019s intervention succeeded in re-floating global finance and putting stock markets onto the path of their longest growth spurt. However, the world did not go back to its pre-2008 ways.</p> <p>Before 2008, Wall Street played a crucial role in recycling non-US surpluses that were the repercussion of American deficits into global investment funding. After 2008, the refloated Wall Street could not perform that task, channelling much of the abundant liquidity not to fixed capital investment but to share buy-backs and other asset purchases. The result was that the post-2008 economy is characterised by savings being permanently in excess of capital goods investment. Since savings are the supply of money and investment its demand, the permanent excess supply of money explains the permanently low, or negative, interest rates. It also explains the downward pressure on median wages against a background of rising asset prices causing unbearable inequality and thus producing the political triumphs of xenophobic nationalism.</p> <p>In precisely the same way that the increased liquidity after 2008 failed to rebalance savings and investment globally, so will any renewed monetary \u201ceasing\u201d to counter the ill effects of Covid-19 fail to return the global economy to its pre-February state. Of course, as happened after 2008, speculators will make a mint and nationalist forces will milk the ensuing discontent for all its worth.</p>",

Similarly in Europe, the worst spectre hovering over investors\u2019 heads is that large corporations, relying for too long on free money from the European Central Bank, may be downgraded from investment to junk-grade \u2013 especially so at a time of stagnant domestic demand and a collapsed Chinese import market. Taking a leaf out of the aftermath of the crash of 2008, and the Eurozone crisis that followed, bullish speculators are looking at their central banks, primarily the Fed and the ECB, to do, once again, \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to re-float their flagging fortunes. Two questions keep them up at night: will the central banks oblige? And if they do, will it be enough? The first question is easy to answer: governments are impotent on both sides of the Atlantic. In the United States the federal budget deficit is already at a historic high, especially in the context of a tight labour market, while the Eurozone remains in the straightjacket of its fiscal compact. Therefore the central banks will be forced, whether they like it or not, to step up to the mark. Already we have seen announcements of lower interest rates, even of Japanese-style semi-direct purchases of government and private debt by the monetary authorities. But will it be enough for the central banks to throw more money at the Covid-19-infected money markets? Will the economy go back to where we were a month ago if enough liquidity is pumped into the system? Or will it resemble a slow puncture that demands increasing pump-priming to stay inflated? Moreover, will the new wall of public money push back the wall of xenophobia? The sad answer to the last question is instructive about the economic ones too. When a border closes down, it does not open again easily even if the conditions that caused its closure are largely reversed. This is a safe lesson from Europe\u2019s recent experience. Take, for example, Austria, which closed its border with Italy following the rise of refugee arrivals in the summer of 2015. For a couple of years after that refugee wave had died out, the borders remained shut. Similarly with the borders along the Western Balkans. Why is this relevant to the question of whether increased central bank liquidity will ameliorate the effects of Covid-19 on the economy? To answer, we need to remind ourselves of what happened after the crash of 2008. There were two responses to the 2008 crisis that saved capitalism from total collapse: the gigantic injection of liquidity into the economy by central banks, the Fed above all else; and China, whose government took it upon itself intentionally to build up the greatest private credit bubble in history to replace the lost export demand by a stupendous investment boost. The Fed\u2019s and China\u2019s intervention succeeded in re-floating global finance and putting stock markets onto the path of their longest growth spurt. However, the world did not go back to its pre-2008 ways. Before 2008, Wall Street played a crucial role in recycling non-US surpluses that were the repercussion of American deficits into global investment funding. After 2008, the refloated Wall Street could not perform that task, channelling much of the abundant liquidity not to fixed capital investment but to share buy-backs and other asset purchases. The result was that the post-2008 economy is characterised by savings being permanently in excess of capital goods investment. Since savings are the supply of money and investment its demand, the permanent excess supply of money explains the permanently low, or negative, interest rates. It also explains the downward pressure on median wages against a background of rising asset prices causing unbearable inequality and thus producing the political triumphs of xenophobic nationalism. In precisely the same way that the increased liquidity after 2008 failed to rebalance savings and investment globally, so will any renewed monetary \u201ceasing\u201d to counter the ill effects of Covid-19 fail to return the global economy to its pre-February state. Of course, as happened after 2008, speculators will make a mint and nationalist forces will milk the ensuing discontent for all its worth.",

      "body": "<p>The numbers of diagnosed coronavirus cases in the UK is still relatively low, but the epidemic has been causing havoc for those with travel plans. As the situation evolves, individual countries \u2013 and travel operators \u2013 are introducing different policies, leaving some travellers stranded, others uncertain and many out of pocket. Advice from airlines has been confusing, with some offering refunds or rebookings to passengers headed for risky regions and some leaving them to their fate. Insurers are similarly divided in what they will and won\u2019t offer. For those wondering what to do about an impending holiday, it\u2019s important to know when a refund is a right and when it depends on goodwill.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019m due to go on holiday to Venice this month but I\u2019m worried about the infection in </strong><strong>northern Italy. I\u2019m a diabetic and the symptoms could prove severe. If I cancel am I entitled to my money back</strong><strong>?</strong><br><em><strong>RD, Buxton, Derbyshire</strong></em></p> <p>No is the short answer, although that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not worth a try, since some airlines and holiday firms are refunding or rebooking customers as a goodwill gesture. Ordinarily, travel insurance won\u2019t pay out unless the Foreign Office advises against travel to your destination. Insurers may make an exception if your GP confirms that your condition makes it risky for you to travel.</p> <p><strong>I booked flights from London to Delhi with Oman Air to attend a wedding. A fellow guest, booked with Virgin Atlantic, informed me that India was revoking visas for </strong><strong>visitors</strong><strong> who had recently been in China. Virgin </strong><strong>notified passengers of the new rules and promised refunds. Oman Air had no idea of the restriction</strong><strong>. Eventually it conceded that I would not be allowed to board</strong><strong>. It is only willing to refund the refundable taxes, leaving me \u00a3217 out of pocket.</strong><br><em><strong>EH, Bath</strong></em></p> <p>Ordinarily a passenger denied boarding would be entitled to a refund under EC regulation 261/2004. However, article 2(j) exempts airlines from liability if there are \u201creasonable grounds\u201d such as health, safety or inadequate travel documentation. All of those could be applied to you, meaning that you are not entitled to your money back, although some airlines are being more sympathetic. Many passengers are struggling to get accurate information from airlines and booking agents so it\u2019s vital that you make your own checks. Oman Air did not respond to requests for a comment.</p> <p><strong>We were booked to go on a Royal Caribbean cruise from Hong Kong. Due to the </strong><strong>coronavirus, Royal Caribbean asked us to change our flights to Singapore instead.

The Cruise Lines International Association says its members will deny boarding to anyone who has been in South Korea, China, Hong Kong or Macau within 14 days of joining the cruise ship.

      "bodyText": "The numbers of diagnosed coronavirus cases in the UK is still relatively low, but the epidemic has been causing havoc for those with travel plans. As the situation evolves, individual countries \u2013 and travel operators \u2013 are introducing different policies, leaving some travellers stranded, others uncertain and many out of pocket. Advice from airlines has been confusing, with some offering refunds or rebookings to passengers headed for risky regions and some leaving them to their fate. Insurers are similarly divided in what they will and won\u2019t offer. For those wondering what to do about an impending holiday, it\u2019s important to know when a refund is a right and when it depends on goodwill. I\u2019m due to go on holiday to Venice this month but I\u2019m worried about the infection in northern Italy. I\u2019m a diabetic and the symptoms could prove severe. If I cancel am I entitled to my money back? RD, Buxton, Derbyshire No is the short answer, although that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not worth a try, since some airlines and holiday firms are refunding or rebooking customers as a goodwill gesture. Ordinarily, travel insurance won\u2019t pay out unless the Foreign Office advises against travel to your destination. Insurers may make an exception if your GP confirms that your condition makes it risky for you to travel. I booked flights from London to Delhi with Oman Air to attend a wedding. A fellow guest, booked with Virgin Atlantic, informed me that India was revoking visas for visitors who had recently been in China. Virgin notified passengers of the new rules and promised refunds. Oman Air had no idea of the restriction. Eventually it conceded that I would not be allowed to board. It is only willing to refund the refundable taxes, leaving me \u00a3217 out of pocket. EH, Bath Ordinarily a passenger denied boarding would be entitled to a refund under EC regulation 261/2004. However, article 2(j) exempts airlines from liability if there are \u201creasonable grounds\u201d such as health, safety or inadequate travel documentation. All of those could be applied to you, meaning that you are not entitled to your money back, although some airlines are being more sympathetic. Many passengers are struggling to get accurate information from airlines and booking agents so it\u2019s vital that you make your own checks. Oman Air did not respond to requests for a comment. We were booked to go on a Royal Caribbean cruise from Hong Kong. Due to the coronavirus, Royal Caribbean asked us to change our flights to Singapore instead. It has since cancelled the cruise 13 days before the sailing date and will refund us the cost. However, the airline is refusing to offer a credit note as it has already amended our flights once.

      "body": "<p>My clumsy fingers lose hold of the thread and it unravels, spiralling out of control. Back to square one. I pick up the wire frame and wind the brightly coloured cotton around it once more. Aasma, tasked with showing me how to handcraft intricate earrings, is patient with my mistakes. But then, she knows all about things falling to pieces, and having to start again. Arriving in Istanbul as a refugee from Syria, she didn\u2019t find it easy to pick up the threads of a new life. Work permits for displaced people are hard to come by, so she had no hope of finding a secretarial job, the career she\u2019d had at home.</p> <p>Here at the <a href=\"https://www.smallprojectsistanbul.org/who-we-are/our-story/\" title=\"\">Olive Tree, a community centre</a> on a narrow lane in Istanbul\u2019s Capa district, she found a way to begin again. Gathered around a long wooden table, while their kids play downstairs in the children\u2019s centre, more than 40 women refugees embroider bags, print T-shirts and hand-coil drop earrings \u2013 with the tagline \u201cdrop earrings, not bombs\u201d \u2013 for their own fashion brand, <a href=\"https://www.muhra.org/\">Muhra</a>. The proceeds help keep their families afloat financially.</p> <p>As Aasma and her friends show us the basics of jewellery-making, they share stories of homes left behind. \u201cI don\u2019t think I will ever be able to go back to Syria,\u201d says Aasma. \u201cBut still, I am lucky. I haven\u2019t lost anyone, yet. Many of the women here, their families \u2026\u201d She trails off, but the silence speaks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5bd8bb724fc23b9f7facced57edad3f0e774aa09\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bd8bb724fc23b9f7facced57edad3f0e774aa09/0_0_1600_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The writer learning how to make jewellery with Aasma is Istanbul.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The writer learning how to make jewellery with Aasma is Istanbul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joanna Booth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m visiting this social enterprise scheme as part of Intrepid Travel\u2019s new Turkey: Women\u2019s Expedition, a tour led by and for women. We travel from Istanbul to the wind-carved rock-scapes of Cappadocia and on to Kekova, a sleepy-feeling island off the Aegean coast. Our itinerary intersperses famous sights with the chance to meet local women who are using tourism to change their fortunes.</p> <p>Intrepid launched the first of these women-only tours in 2018, to Iran, Morocco and Jordan. The company\u2019s customer base is 65% female anyway, and these tours sold out in a month, making them the most successful style of trip in the company\u2019s 30-year history. Tours of Nepal, India and Turkey were added, and this month the operator introduced trips to Pakistan, and Israel and Palestine.</p> <p>In Turkey, travelling in an all-female group opens doors that would be closed to a mixed-gender party, and we are able to make heartfelt connections with Turkish women \u2013 and support their businesses. Only 30% of Turkish women are in paid work, and this is something Intrepid hopes to change by championing and mentoring female business owners.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28184022eb2fc7d196253ee249f44675abe6a8f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/28184022eb2fc7d196253ee249f44675abe6a8f4/195_1063_4629_2777/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The women\u2019s Turkey expedition group on home cooking day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The women\u2019s Turkey expedition group on home cooking day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of these is Ke\u015fke, an Istanbul-based single mother who teaches and performs traditional dance, from Turkish folk dance to the Egyptian-style belly dancing that has become popular in Turkey.

      "bodyText": "My clumsy fingers lose hold of the thread and it unravels, spiralling out of control. Back to square one. I pick up the wire frame and wind the brightly coloured cotton around it once more. Aasma, tasked with showing me how to handcraft intricate earrings, is patient with my mistakes. But then, she knows all about things falling to pieces, and having to start again. Arriving in Istanbul as a refugee from Syria, she didn\u2019t find it easy to pick up the threads of a new life. Work permits for displaced people are hard to come by, so she had no hope of finding a secretarial job, the career she\u2019d had at home. Here at the Olive Tree, a community centre on a narrow lane in Istanbul\u2019s Capa district, she found a way to begin again. Gathered around a long wooden table, while their kids play downstairs in the children\u2019s centre, more than 40 women refugees embroider bags, print T-shirts and hand-coil drop earrings \u2013 with the tagline \u201cdrop earrings, not bombs\u201d \u2013 for their own fashion brand, Muhra. The proceeds help keep their families afloat financially. As Aasma and her friends show us the basics of jewellery-making, they share stories of homes left behind. \u201cI don\u2019t think I will ever be able to go back to Syria,\u201d says Aasma. \u201cBut still, I am lucky. I haven\u2019t lost anyone, yet. Many of the women here, their families \u2026\u201d She trails off, but the silence speaks. I\u2019m visiting this social enterprise scheme as part of Intrepid Travel\u2019s new Turkey: Women\u2019s Expedition, a tour led by and for women. We travel from Istanbul to the wind-carved rock-scapes of Cappadocia and on to Kekova, a sleepy-feeling island off the Aegean coast. Our itinerary intersperses famous sights with the chance to meet local women who are using tourism to change their fortunes. Intrepid launched the first of these women-only tours in 2018, to Iran, Morocco and Jordan. The company\u2019s customer base is 65% female anyway, and these tours sold out in a month, making them the most successful style of trip in the company\u2019s 30-year history. Tours of Nepal, India and Turkey were added, and this month the operator introduced trips to Pakistan, and Israel and Palestine. In Turkey, travelling in an all-female group opens doors that would be closed to a mixed-gender party, and we are able to make heartfelt connections with Turkish women \u2013 and support their businesses. Only 30% of Turkish women are in paid work, and this is something Intrepid hopes to change by championing and mentoring female business owners. One of these is Ke\u015fke, an Istanbul-based single mother who teaches and performs traditional dance, from Turkish folk dance to the Egyptian-style belly dancing that has become popular in Turkey. We\u2019re here for a class in the latter, and as we tie scarves adorned with jingling bells around our waists she tells us how what was once considered low-class dancing is now de rigueur at weddings. Her snake hips seem to move in directions ours can\u2019t, but by the end of a laughter-filled hour we can all stumble through the semblance of a routine. No one could give a warmer reception than Sabahat, who welcomes us into the Istanbul home she has shared with her daughter and grandsons since her husband and son-in-law died. The second I enter I\u2019m enveloped in a hug, then ushered into her kitchen to be plied with food. There\u2019s a b\u00f6rek pastry the size of a manhole cover, candied pumpkin with fresh cream, homemade baklava and turkish delight.

I don\u2019t see where they could hide: Sabahat\u2019s life-affirming force fills the apartment. Before we go, she presses more gifts on us \u2013 prayer beads she brought back from her umrah pilgrimage (currently banned as part of coronavirus precautions). This tour doesn\u2019t skip the classic sights \u2013 in Istanbul there\u2019s time to visit the usual mosques, bazaars and palaces before we move on to central Turkey, where we\u2019re up at 3am for a sunrise balloon flight over Cappadocia.

      "bodyText": "Dozens of residents filtered past a syringe disposal box in a parking lot as they headed to the free weekly meal at the Church of the New Covenant in the town of Austin, Indiana. \u201cWe still have darkness around us, we still have addiction, it\u2019s going to take Jesus\u2019s return to stop all of it,\u201d said Pastor Jacob Howell, who stopped using heroin a few years ago and devoted his life to God. \u201cI\u2019d rather have them throw it in there than have some kid get stuck with it walking in the park.\u201d It\u2019s still illegal to have a syringe without a prescription in the state of Indiana, but Austin is one of the exceptions to the rule: this town of just over 4,000 was the site of a 2015 HIV outbreak that ultimately infected more than 200 people, an infection rate on par with some of the world\u2019s most HIV-affected countries. Donald Trump\u2019s vice-president, Mike Pence, has been tasked with heading up the US response to coronavirus, a dangerous disease that has now killed more than 3,400 people worldwide and quarantined millions. It has shuttered institutions from schools to the Louvre and put an end to pilgrimages to Islam\u2019s two holiest cities in Saudi Arabia. But before his time in the Trump administration, Pence was the governor of Indiana, and the 2015 HIV outbreak was the biggest public health crisis he had ever faced. He is widely seen to have botched the response. When the outbreak was first detected at the start of 2015, there were immediate calls from public health experts for Pence to lift the ban on syringe exchanges to stop the spread of the disease, but he held off, remaining morally opposed to needle exchanges despite a wealth of evidence that such practices do not encourage more drug use, and successfully curb the spread of HIV. Pence instead told people he was going to pray on what to do. By the time he finally signed an executive order in March allowing a needle exchange in Scott county, where Austin is located, weeks had passed and dozens of more cases had been confirmed. In announcing Pence\u2019s new coronavirus role last week, Trump said that the vice-president \u201chas a certain talent for this\u201d and pointed to his healthcare record as governor of Indiana. But healthcare providers and public health experts have said that he mismanaged the HIV crisis in Austin, putting his own personal beliefs about syringe exchanges ahead of evidence presented to him. \u201cI\u2019m hoping he learned a lot from the experience of the HIV outbreak and how it was handled,\u201d said William Cooke, who was the sole doctor in Austin when the outbreak began. When a surge of HIV cases were detected in Austin in January 2015, Cooke and others intensified calls for Pence to lift the ban on syringe exchanges to halt the spread. When he was finally able to speak to the governor face-to-face, he said Pence \u201cdidn\u2019t really want to talk about a syringe service program, so he moved on from that subject quickly. But I felt it was important that he needed to know that the only doctor in Austin supported a syringe service program.\u201d Cooke, who like Pence considers himself a conservative Christian, hopes the vice-president will listen to science this time around. \u201cHistory tends to be the best predictor of the future and there\u2019s not a good track record coming from Indiana from a public health standpoint and listening to public health experts,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I really hope that having gone through the HIV epidemic that he really learned that public health experts know what they\u2019re talking about: they know the science they know what\u2019s evidence based.\u201d In Scott county the impact of the syringe exchange programs has been dramatic: the number of HIV infections linked to the outbreak dropped from 187 in 2015 to just 10 in 2018 and seven last year, according to statistics provided by the county\u2019s department of health. Employees at the department of health were unwilling to comment on Pence, but they did say that the syringe program has been overwhelmingly successful in confronting the HIV outbreak. However, despite that success, opponents of the programs remain and without legislative action, exchanges in Austin and elsewhere in Indiana will be shut down next year. Public health experts who offered recommendations on combatting the HIV outbreak in Indiana have questioned whether Pence can put evidence ahead of his own beliefs. In combatting Covid-19 \u201cwe need a leader who is not only data-driven, but somebody who understands evidence \u2013 and somebody who can communicate it. Neither one of those things is in Mike Pence\u2019s skillset,\u201d said Beth Meyerson, the co-director of Indiana University\u2019s Rural Center for Aids/STD Prevention. Carrie Lawrence, the associate director of the center, said the Austin HIV outbreak showed that when Pence has to make a public health decision \u201chis go to is his ideology or faith instead of going to the data or the evidence\u201d. Pence likely already faces a conflict between ideology and expertise: while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has warned that coronavirus has the potential to have serious disruption in the US, the president has largely downplayed the threat of the virus. On Wednesday, Trump \u2013 without evidence \u2013 called the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) coronavirus mortality rate \u201ca false number\u201d and said thousands of people infected with coronavirus \u201cget better, just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work\u201d. In Austin, where the HIV outbreak occurred, there is hope that Pence\u2019s experiences in Indiana will help him. Howell, the pastor, said Pence made some missteps in 2015. \u201cI think he missed telltale signs prior \u2013 and then when the problem got big he acted on it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to put a fire out when it\u2019s smoldering. Once it becomes a blaze, it\u2019s harder to control.\u201d However, he said he trusts Pence and believes he is capable of handling the US\u2019s coronavirus response. \u201cI think maybe [the HIV outbreak] was given to him as a test for this bigger obstacle now that he has to take care of,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe he can take some of these hard lessons learned and apply them here. And I pray that he listens to doctors and goes against what even he himself might think to do what\u2019s right.\u201d Howell said addiction remains a problem in Austin, but that \u201crecovery is bigger\u201d. One of the people at the church\u2019s free meal last week was Laura Nowling, 51, who has been sober for three years following addictions to methamphetamines, cocaine and alcohol. Her life came crashing down in February 2016 when she was arrested for drug possession at Austin elementary school, where she was a teacher. Then, last year, her oldest son died at 26 from a fentanyl overdose in Ohio after getting hooked on opioids in Austin. Her two other children are recovering from addictions as well. Nowling said the idea of a syringe exchange was wildly unpopular in Austin in 2015, particularly among those who had no personal connection to addiction. \u201cEven though it wasn\u2019t popular at the time, [Pence] went ahead and made it,\u201d she said. \u201cSo he went against public opinion, I guess. I think that\u2019s good.\u201d She added: \u201cI think if they\u2019ve asked him to do that, he will take the initiative to do what\u2019s right and not necessarily go with popular opinion.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Since 2017, Donald Trump has pushed a hardline immigration agenda that has sown confusion, fear and distrust among immigrant communities. Now, as the world deals with a <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen\">public health emergency</a> in the shape of the coronavirus outbreak, experts worry his immigration policies may put everyone at risk.</p> <p>There is a widespread fear that the president\u2019s policies have sown such fear of deportation and wariness of any contact with US authorities among immigrants \u2013 who also have greater difficulty getting healthcare \u2013 that many of them will not seek help if they fall sick with the virus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/us-coronavirus-outbreak-nurses-cdc\">\u2018Wildly unprepared\u2019: survey of US nurses highlights coronavirus concerns</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf you continue to discourage people from seeking services under normal circumstances, you cannot expect them necessarily to seek those services just because you as the racist, anti-immigrant president have decided that now it\u2019s a good idea. That\u2019s not gonna work,\u201d said Max Hadler, director of health policy at the New York Immigration Coalition.</p> <p>Even as coronavirus spreads across the US, the Trump administration is ramping up surveillance in so-called sanctuary cities, places where local police<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/8/17091984/sanctuary-cities-city-state-illegal-immigration-sessions\"> don\u2019t always </a>work with federal immigration enforcement.

      "bodyText": "Since 2017, Donald Trump has pushed a hardline immigration agenda that has sown confusion, fear and distrust among immigrant communities. Now, as the world deals with a public health emergency in the shape of the coronavirus outbreak, experts worry his immigration policies may put everyone at risk. There is a widespread fear that the president\u2019s policies have sown such fear of deportation and wariness of any contact with US authorities among immigrants \u2013 who also have greater difficulty getting healthcare \u2013 that many of them will not seek help if they fall sick with the virus. \u201cIf you continue to discourage people from seeking services under normal circumstances, you cannot expect them necessarily to seek those services just because you as the racist, anti-immigrant president have decided that now it\u2019s a good idea. That\u2019s not gonna work,\u201d said Max Hadler, director of health policy at the New York Immigration Coalition. Even as coronavirus spreads across the US, the Trump administration is ramping up surveillance in so-called sanctuary cities, places where local police don\u2019t always work with federal immigration enforcement. The operation\u2019s goal is to \u201carrest as many undocumented immigrants as possible\u201d, the New York Times reported, and it is being executed as prominent sanctuary cities such as Seattle, Los Angeles and New York stare down a potential coronavirus public health crisis. Randy Capps, director of research for US programs at the Migration Policy Institute, warned that officers could spread the coronavirus if they go door-to-door in localities that have already been affected. Meanwhile, Hadler worried that an increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) presence could deter immigrants from accessing healthcare. Medical treatment and healthcare facilities are supposed to be \u201csensitive locations\u201d, exempt from most immigration enforcement actions. But that has been undermined as reports from around the country have indicated Ice officers arrested or questioned people at or near hospitals. Last month, Ice brought a man in handcuffs out of a Brooklyn hospital after agents tasered and shot another person who tried to intervene in his arrest. Neither the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) nor Ice responded to a request for comment. An expanded public charge rule targeting immigrants\u2019 use of public benefits could also impact how people approach coronavirus as fears over their citizenship status \u2013 or that of their relatives \u2013 discourages many from seeking help from the state, even when it comes to healthcare. The rule went into effect in late February, and has caused fear and uncertainty in immigrant communities. It doesn\u2019t apply to public health services, community health centers or hospital emergency rooms or preclude anyone from getting screened or cared for, said Capps, but it still might make immigrants less likely to seek healthcare unless they\u2019re in urgent need. The Trump administration has also attempted to deny visas to anyone who can\u2019t prove they will have health insurance or be able to afford medical costs in the US. In the face of more stringent immigration policies and heightened enforcement, it\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that in December 2018, 6.3% of adults in immigrant families said they or a family member had avoided going to the doctor or a clinic because they did not want to be asked or bothered about their citizenship status. \u201cWe certainly have seen that there\u2019s evidence that some people are avoiding medical care, and I think our take is that it certainly poses a public health risk,\u201d said Hamutal Bernstein, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute who co-authored the report. Her research found immigrant families didn\u2019t enroll in benefits such as Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program before the new rule was implemented because they didn\u2019t want anyone in their family to lose out on a green card. Those reactions were widespread, even among people who weren\u2019t implicated in the policy change. It\u2019s too soon to know how these trends will influence whether immigrants get screened or treated specifically for coronavirus, experts say, though some believe there\u2019s cause for concern. \u201cIf it hits the immigrant communities, I mean, I\u2019m just sure that some people will not go to the hospitals because of fear of being deported and being separated from their loved ones,\u201d said Ally Bolour, a Los Angeles- based immigration attorney who\u2019s on the American Immigration Lawyers Association\u2019s board of governors. Bolour has witnessed first-hand what the virus can do: his sister and her husband tested positive while traveling abroad and are currently quarantined in Tokyo. He said the situation has been \u201clike a horror movie\u201d, and as recently as two weeks ago, he wasn\u2019t sure that his brother-in-law would survive. \u201cThis is a national health emergency crisis. The government needs to come out, and just be out, and say, \u2018We\u2019re not going to deport you,\u2019\u201d Bolour said. \u201c\u2018If you\u2019re sick, come on in. We\u2019ll take care of you.\u2019 I mean, nobody\u2019s saying any of that.\u201d Bolour also felt that all detainees in government custody with only immigration violations \u2013 almost 19,000 people in late February \u2013 need to be released now for their safety and the safety of the public. The US hosts the world\u2019s largest immigration detention system, where detainees sometimes endure \u201cdilapidated\u201d and \u201cmoldy\u201d bathrooms, eat expired food and lack basic toiletries for personal hygiene, according to DHS\u2019s internal watchdog. Capps said that he\u2019s visited an Ice facility where there was no soap or cleaning supplies, and that Ice and US Customs and Border Protection facilities have a \u201cvery, very poor\u201d recent track record with disease. In the last few years, mumps, influenza, scabies, shingles and chickenpox have all plagued such centers. \u201cIf it goes into the detention facilities, it just boggles the mind how it\u2019s gonna be handled.

      "body": "<p>On Sunday Liz Mayne will make a familiar \u201cpilgrimage\u201d to the Netherlands. In 2015, she flew in to inspect the wreckage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/malaysia-airlines-flight-mh17\" title=\"\">Malaysia Airlines flight MH17</a>, shot down over eastern Ukraine the previous summer. \u201cYou could still smell the burning,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was an overwhelming experience.\u201d</p> <p>Her son Richard, a second-year student at Leeds University, was one of 298 people on board. Ten were Britons. All perished. Richard was 20. His body was recovered intact from sunflower fields near the village of Hrabove. He was returned in the clothes he had set off in: sweatshirt and socks bearing the logo of his favourite rugby team, the Leicester Tigers.</p> <p>Since that first grim trip to see the debris, Liz has returned each year. In 2018 she and her husband, Simon, were shown poignant CCTV images of Richard, taken at Schiphol airport. On 17 July 2014, she had driven him from their home in Leicester to Birmingham; he gave her a \u201ccheeky\u201d wave before boarding a connecting flight to Amsterdam.</p> <p>The footage shows him walking towards gate eight \u2013 on his way to Australia. He goes into a tunnel and then vanishes. Seeing him alive again was both sad and magical, Liz recalls. \u201cHe is on his way to this wonderful experience. I see that as something to celebrate. He\u2019s not thinking: \u2018I am walking to my death.\u2019 He\u2019s thinking: \u2018The world is my oyster\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The wheels of justice have turned slowly. For Liz and other relatives seeking to understand why their loved ones were killed, it has been a long and painful process, threaded with grief and frustration. Their agony not helped by the fact that Russia \u2013 the state investigators allege is most responsible for the disaster \u2013 continues to deny its guilt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"189e044b01bc6cb234485d6abad0d934c4d365f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/189e044b01bc6cb234485d6abad0d934c4d365f4/0_111_2471_3087/800.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Mayne.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Mayne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On Monday Liz will watch the start of a trial of four suspects whom Dutch authorities say were responsible for downing the Boeing 777 with a Russian anti-aircraft missile while it was on its way to Kuala Lumpur. The trial is to take place in a judicial complex in Schiphol. Twenty next of kin chosen by ballot will sit in courtroom D; Mayne will watch on a video feed from a conference centre in Utrecht.</p> <p>It will be an international affair \u2013 not surprising given that two-thirds of the passengers were Dutch, and the others came from Australia, Malaysia, Indonesia, the UK, Germany, Belgium, the Philippines, Canada and New Zealand. Four hundred journalists from around the world are expected to attend. Some of the British families may drop out because of fears over the coronavirus.</p> <p>The first week is expected to deal with \u201chousekeeping\u201d issues rather than hearing evidence. It will include the crucial detail of whether<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/19/mh17-suspects-dutch-reveal-backgrounds-of-ukraine-separatists\" title=\"\"> the suspects</a> \u2013 who are each charged with murdering all 298 passengers and crew, and with bringing a missile launcher into eastern Ukraine \u2013 will turn up. One is known to have appointed a lawyer but, since neither Russia nor Ukraine extradites its nationals, it is almost certain they will be tried in absentia.</p> <p>Three are Russians \u2013 Igor Girkin, a former colonel of Russia\u2019s FSB spy service; Sergei Dubinsky, employed by Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence agency; and Oleg Pulatov, a former soldier with the GRU\u2019s Spetsnaz special forces unit. A fourth is a Ukrainian citizen, Leonid Kharchenko. All were senior commanders in the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic (DNR). In summer 2014, the separatist militia, helped and armed by Moscow, was embroiled in a bloody war with Ukrainian forces. Russia boosted the DNR\u2019s efforts with undercover soldiers.</p> <p>According to the prosecution, the defendants asked Russia\u2019s defence ministry for heavy weapons, and it agreed. A convoy was allegedly sent from the 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade, based in the Russian city of Kursk. It included the Buk missile launcher used to bring down MH17.</p> <p>A tragic mistake? Or a deliberate act? This is something relatives hope the public sessions will establish.</p> <p>For more than five years the Kremlin has denied all involvement. In contrast to authorities in Iran, which in January said their military had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/11/iran-admits-shooting-down-ukrainian-airliner-unintentionally\" title=\"\">shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane</a> in error, President Vladimir Putin has batted away accusations of responsibility. Russian state TV has broadcast conspiracy theories: the Ukrainians fired on the plane, mistaking it for Putin\u2019s jet; it was already full of dead bodies; the US was to blame.</p> <p>Despite these counterclaims, the evidence against Moscow has piled up. The investigative website Bellingcat found <a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2017/06/05/pre-mh17-photograph-buk-332-discovered/\" title=\"\">photographs </a><a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2017/06/05/pre-mh17-photograph-buk-332-discovered/\" title=\"\">of Russian soldiers</a> who travelled with the convoy. Locals filmed the Buk as it headed back to the Russian border, minus one missile. Girkin boasted that the rebels had shot down another \u201cbird\u201d, before deleting his post.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/sep/30/bellingcat-eliot-higgins-exposed-novichok-russian-spy-anatoliy-chepiga\" title=\"\">Bellingcat\u2019s founder, Eliot Higgins, </a>thinks prosecutors will reveal additional evidence. He believes the Dutch-led joint investigation team has obtained further videos and photographs, and may have an image of the missile being fired.

      "bodyText": "On Sunday Liz Mayne will make a familiar \u201cpilgrimage\u201d to the Netherlands. In 2015, she flew in to inspect the wreckage of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, shot down over eastern Ukraine the previous summer. \u201cYou could still smell the burning,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was an overwhelming experience.\u201d Her son Richard, a second-year student at Leeds University, was one of 298 people on board. Ten were Britons. All perished. Richard was 20. His body was recovered intact from sunflower fields near the village of Hrabove. He was returned in the clothes he had set off in: sweatshirt and socks bearing the logo of his favourite rugby team, the Leicester Tigers. Since that first grim trip to see the debris, Liz has returned each year. In 2018 she and her husband, Simon, were shown poignant CCTV images of Richard, taken at Schiphol airport. On 17 July 2014, she had driven him from their home in Leicester to Birmingham; he gave her a \u201ccheeky\u201d wave before boarding a connecting flight to Amsterdam. The footage shows him walking towards gate eight \u2013 on his way to Australia. He goes into a tunnel and then vanishes. Seeing him alive again was both sad and magical, Liz recalls. \u201cHe is on his way to this wonderful experience. I see that as something to celebrate. He\u2019s not thinking: \u2018I am walking to my death.\u2019 He\u2019s thinking: \u2018The world is my oyster\u2019.\u201d The wheels of justice have turned slowly. For Liz and other relatives seeking to understand why their loved ones were killed, it has been a long and painful process, threaded with grief and frustration. Their agony not helped by the fact that Russia \u2013 the state investigators allege is most responsible for the disaster \u2013 continues to deny its guilt. On Monday Liz will watch the start of a trial of four suspects whom Dutch authorities say were responsible for downing the Boeing 777 with a Russian anti-aircraft missile while it was on its way to Kuala Lumpur. The trial is to take place in a judicial complex in Schiphol. Twenty next of kin chosen by ballot will sit in courtroom D; Mayne will watch on a video feed from a conference centre in Utrecht. It will be an international affair \u2013 not surprising given that two-thirds of the passengers were Dutch, and the others came from Australia, Malaysia, Indonesia, the UK, Germany, Belgium, the Philippines, Canada and New Zealand. Four hundred journalists from around the world are expected to attend. Some of the British families may drop out because of fears over the coronavirus. The first week is expected to deal with \u201chousekeeping\u201d issues rather than hearing evidence. It will include the crucial detail of whether the suspects \u2013 who are each charged with murdering all 298 passengers and crew, and with bringing a missile launcher into eastern Ukraine \u2013 will turn up. One is known to have appointed a lawyer but, since neither Russia nor Ukraine extradites its nationals, it is almost certain they will be tried in absentia. Three are Russians \u2013 Igor Girkin, a former colonel of Russia\u2019s FSB spy service; Sergei Dubinsky, employed by Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence agency; and Oleg Pulatov, a former soldier with the GRU\u2019s Spetsnaz special forces unit. A fourth is a Ukrainian citizen, Leonid Kharchenko. All were senior commanders in the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic (DNR). In summer 2014, the separatist militia, helped and armed by Moscow, was embroiled in a bloody war with Ukrainian forces. Russia boosted the DNR\u2019s efforts with undercover soldiers. According to the prosecution, the defendants asked Russia\u2019s defence ministry for heavy weapons, and it agreed. A convoy was allegedly sent from the 53rd anti-aircraft missile brigade, based in the Russian city of Kursk. It included the Buk missile launcher used to bring down MH17. A tragic mistake? Or a deliberate act? This is something relatives hope the public sessions will establish. For more than five years the Kremlin has denied all involvement. In contrast to authorities in Iran, which in January said their military had shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane in error, President Vladimir Putin has batted away accusations of responsibility. Russian state TV has broadcast conspiracy theories: the Ukrainians fired on the plane, mistaking it for Putin\u2019s jet; it was already full of dead bodies; the US was to blame. Despite these counterclaims, the evidence against Moscow has piled up. The investigative website Bellingcat found photographs of Russian soldiers who travelled with the convoy. Locals filmed the Buk as it headed back to the Russian border, minus one missile. Girkin boasted that the rebels had shot down another \u201cbird\u201d, before deleting his post. Bellingcat\u2019s founder, Eliot Higgins, thinks prosecutors will reveal additional evidence. He believes the Dutch-led joint investigation team has obtained further videos and photographs, and may have an image of the missile being fired. There are likely to be recorded calls between the indicted DNR operatives and their Russian army handlers, plus a possible witness who travelled with the Buk on its deadly journey. The trial will last many months . It\u2019s unclear if more will follow. Possible future defendants include the four Russian soldiers and a captain who crewed the anti-aircraft system \u2013 assuming they are still alive \u2013 as well as senior members of Moscow\u2019s general staff. \u201cThere\u2019s been a total Russian disinformation campaign. Getting some hard truths in a court of law is what\u2019s needed,\u201d Richard\u2019s brother, Will \u2013 now 24 \u2013 says.

      "body": "<h2>If my pupils get ill, the parents will bring out the flaming torches and pitchforks</h2> \n<p><strong>Headteacher of a primary school in Nottingham </strong><br></p> \n<p>A lot of the kids had already heard about Covid-19 because it\u2019s been on the news. I invited a member of staff for Public Health England to come into my school last week to give an assembly on cleaning hands. To ensure the pupils didn\u2019t feel worried, we were careful to stress that good handwashing is what they should be doing anyway, to avoid getting colds and tummy bugs.</p> \n<p>The reality is, though, I\u2019ve got 200 children at my school and about 20 sinks. Making sure each child washes their hands for 30 seconds four times a day (after they arrive, before snacktime, before lunchtime and before they go home) is quite a big ask. If we really try to enforce that, we will cut into learning time and break time. It\u2019s very hard, logistically, to get them all to the sinks and back quickly.</p> \n<p>A number of families at our school have recently returned from holidaying in Italy. None of them are feeling unwell and none are self-isolating. They did ask me for advice on what they should do. But there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s called \u201cself\u201d isolation. It\u2019s a tricky question for me to answer. First, I am not allowed to say you should keep your kids at home. Second, missing two weeks of school is massively detrimental to someone\u2019s learning. But on the other hand, we have immunocompromised children, parents and grandparents in our school community.</p> \n<p>If staff or children fell ill, I\u2019d feel awful and to some extent, responsible. On top of that, all the parents would be up in arms, criticising my decisions, bringing out the flaming torches and pitchforks, and the names of the children who didn\u2019t self-isolate will be mud. Already I\u2019ve had parents emailing, saying we should be bleaching the desks after every lesson. No matter how well we follow Public Health England\u2019s guidance, if someone does contract the coronavirus via a school, headteachers are liable to get the blame.</p> \n<h2>My pharmacies are getting a hundred requests every day for hand sanitisers</h2> \n<p><strong>Olivier Picard, owner of four Newdays pharmacies in Berkshire </strong><br></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"98e3248052b4119a4011fed280cf7786a155416c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/98e3248052b4119a4011fed280cf7786a155416c/0_283_1788_1072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olivier Picard is working 12-hour shifts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Olivier Picard is working 12-hour shifts.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We are getting about 100 requests every day for hand sanitisers, but we ran out of stock more than a week ago. We are also getting 20 people a day coming in to buy face masks, and we still have some of those left.</p> \n<p>My advice to people who come in for hand sanitisers is that washing your hands with soap and water is just as efficient as using the alcohol-based gel. Anxiety levels are definitely rising, because more people are talking about it, especially in the media. I have patients with long-term conditions and respiratory diseases who are genuinely worried that the coronavirus might infect them, and are thereforelooking for professional advice. A pharmacist is available to them without an appointment, in a way that a GP isn\u2019t.</p> \n<p>We\u2019re getting lots of information from NHS England and the National Pharmacy Association, which has been very helpful. But seeing an extra 100 people a day who need reassurance about the lack of hand sanitisers means we are very busy. For the past few weeks, I have been working 12-hour days, six days a week, staying for hours after the pharmacy closes to dispense prescriptions and do work I would normally have been able to do in the daytime. Then, at the end of the day, I make sure I catch up on the news about the virus and NHS emails.</p> \n<p>I am most worried about how the coronavirus might hit my staff, particularly the pharmacists who dispense the medicines. There could come a point when I and other pharmacists across the country can\u2019t operate and that would affect the health of many people. I do find it very difficult to switch off from it all. But when I finally get home and put my key in the door, I try to put my phone down and give my young family the little time I have left in the evening. We tend to avoid conversations about the virus.</p> \n<h2>Residents of our care home are in their 80s and frail.

I also reassured them they would get their test results within an average of two days \u2013 with a phone call if they were positive. That classic \u201cno news is good news\u201d.After one day off from CV duty I was back to it on Tuesday: another day working long hours, but at least there was a positive side: I was working with my favourite doctor. We had a relatively pleasant morning and I got my lunch in good time. </p> \n<p>Later in the week we were advised by our managers that the general public were bulk buying hand-sanitiser and we needed to be mindful they might come and target our department looking for some. An additional lock has been placed on our store cupboard \u2013 I don\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.</p> \n<p>Last Thursday we had a total of 16 patient referrals, a mixture of 111 referrals and people who were self-presenting. I think that is the only frustrating thing about all this: people who are not following the public health advice, which is to call 111 and stay indoors, not come to hospital, where you are putting many more people at risk. We will not get pre-alerted that these people are on their way and subsequently they end up mixing with the general population that attend our department. It is important we educate them, and don\u2019t get too frustrated, as they tend to be anxious and are simply seeking health advice. Anyway, I cannot wait for this to be over \u2013 I hope I never have to wear another face mask or goggles again.</p> \n<h2>We are now screening all patients, and segregating any with respiratory problems</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"dd26b30d2043cff5dd1c1b9808a8ada202cb7845\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd26b30d2043cff5dd1c1b9808a8ada202cb7845/0_0_321_429/321.jpg\" alt=\"Jane Wheatley\" width=\"321\" height=\"429\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Dr Jane Wheatley, a GP in North London </strong><br></p> \n<p>Although we are still in the early stages of the Covid-19 outbreak it has already had a major impact on the surgery where I work.</p> \n<p>One of our receptionists told us that her younger brother had become unwell after returning from a school skiing trip to Italy, as had several of his friends. One of them got tested for the virus. When our receptionist\u2019s mother rang 111 to see if her son needed to be tested too, they said someone would come out to do that.</p> \n<p>When we heard that, we sent our receptionist home as a precaution. Public Health England said she should self-isolate and be tested and we should deep clean the surgery. That was done\u2013 overnight, so we didn\u2019t have to close \u2013 and our receptionist self-isolated. But despite several more calls to 111, her brother was never tested \u2013 his friend tested negative \u2013 and neither was she, so she came back to work. But the incident did raise concerns for us as a practice about how 111 are handling things.Last Wednesday we were told that one of our patients had been admitted to hospital with Covid-19. The next day a local primary school emailed parents of its pupils to say that a parent had tested positive for coronavirus. The parent is not in hospital, though; they are self-isolating at home. That\u2019s in line with the new policy announced that day that Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, Public Health England (PHE), the NHS and ministers have agreed, that if people who have tested positive have mild symptoms then they can stay at home as long as they isolate themselves to reduce the risk of onward transmission.</p> \n<p>Also on Thursday a parent at the school who had received its email rang our duty doctor to say that they had a child who had been unwell for a week with a temperature and dry cough but had no history of travel to any of the high-risk areas. 111 had advised that the child should see a GP. But after consultation with PHE (three phonecalls) it was decided not to see the child in our surgery and that the father should ring 111 again, with our duty doctor reviewing the child again by telephone.</p> \n<p>As GPs we do have questions about the advice NHS111 are giving some people. So far I have seen two possible Covid-19 patients, both at the GP extended hours service where I work on Saturdays. The first had symptoms of a mild viral illness and wanted a test for the virus. He had recently come back from a conference in the Far East, but not a country with a high incidence of cases, which meant he could not be tested. NHS 111 booked him in. I feel that he should have been told to self-isolate at home and not been booked in to a GP appointment, because he was not unwell enough to be seen by a doctor. I think he just had a cold.</p> \n<p>The second patient had a temperature and dry cough but no recent history of travel to an affected area overseas but had been in touch with two people who had been to a Category 1 (high-risk) country. Again he was worried about infecting family members and wanted a test. Again he had been booked in by 111. That\u2019s a concern, though, because the official advice is that anyone who may have Covid-19 should not go to a GP surgery. Generally patients worried that they may have the virus are phoning us for advice. But we\u2019ve also had two patients with symptoms come into the surgery asking to be seen, both after being told to come by 111. Neither was very unwell. We appreciate that 111 services are very busy just now, but why are they sending people who may be infected and who want a test to a GP surgery?</p> \n<p>We are now considering or have already implemented steps in line with the government\u2019s strategy of \u201ccontain\u201d and then \u201cdelay\u201d. That includes screening patients when they book an appointment by asking about travel and potential symptoms of Covid-19, and segregating patients who have any respiratory symptoms \u2013 such as babies with bronchiolitis and viral-induced wheeze \u2013 in our isolation room, so we keep them out of our waiting area. We\u2019re also dealing with more patients on the phone, through home visits and by issuing longer prescriptions to reduce the need for people to come in to the surgery. Older doctors and pregnant doctors may also concentrate on doing lab results, paperwork and telephone consultations rather than seeing patients, as we have to look after ourselves as well as our patients.</p> \n<p>But we also need PHE to takegreater account of GPs\u2019 clinical judgements about who needs to be tested, as too many people are finding it impossible to get a test, and 111 to be more consistent and not send possible Covid-19 patients to GP surgeries like ours, just because they haven\u2019t travelled or are not very sick. And importantly, we need the NHS to ensure that every GP practice has the right Personal Protective Equipment \u2013 an FFP3 respirator mask, full-length gown, long gloves, head cap and goggles or face visor \u2013 to deal with any patients we may come across who we think may have the virus. That has taken far too long to happen, which has also been an issue for GPs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ddc4ba48-47b8-4b2b-91d2-081cd3e143d1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3jpXAMwRSu4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

      "bodyText": "If my pupils get ill, the parents will bring out the flaming torches and pitchforks Headteacher of a primary school in Nottingham A lot of the kids had already heard about Covid-19 because it\u2019s been on the news. I invited a member of staff for Public Health England to come into my school last week to give an assembly on cleaning hands. To ensure the pupils didn\u2019t feel worried, we were careful to stress that good handwashing is what they should be doing anyway, to avoid getting colds and tummy bugs. The reality is, though, I\u2019ve got 200 children at my school and about 20 sinks. Making sure each child washes their hands for 30 seconds four times a day (after they arrive, before snacktime, before lunchtime and before they go home) is quite a big ask. If we really try to enforce that, we will cut into learning time and break time. It\u2019s very hard, logistically, to get them all to the sinks and back quickly. A number of families at our school have recently returned from holidaying in Italy. None of them are feeling unwell and none are self-isolating. They did ask me for advice on what they should do. But there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s called \u201cself\u201d isolation. It\u2019s a tricky question for me to answer. First, I am not allowed to say you should keep your kids at home. Second, missing two weeks of school is massively detrimental to someone\u2019s learning. But on the other hand, we have immunocompromised children, parents and grandparents in our school community. If staff or children fell ill, I\u2019d feel awful and to some extent, responsible. On top of that, all the parents would be up in arms, criticising my decisions, bringing out the flaming torches and pitchforks, and the names of the children who didn\u2019t self-isolate will be mud. Already I\u2019ve had parents emailing, saying we should be bleaching the desks after every lesson. No matter how well we follow Public Health England\u2019s guidance, if someone does contract the coronavirus via a school, headteachers are liable to get the blame. My pharmacies are getting a hundred requests every day for hand sanitisers Olivier Picard, owner of four Newdays pharmacies in Berkshire We are getting about 100 requests every day for hand sanitisers, but we ran out of stock more than a week ago. We are also getting 20 people a day coming in to buy face masks, and we still have some of those left. My advice to people who come in for hand sanitisers is that washing your hands with soap and water is just as efficient as using the alcohol-based gel. Anxiety levels are definitely rising, because more people are talking about it, especially in the media. I have patients with long-term conditions and respiratory diseases who are genuinely worried that the coronavirus might infect them, and are thereforelooking for professional advice. A pharmacist is available to them without an appointment, in a way that a GP isn\u2019t.

He is opposed to the very concept of a permanent civil service impartially serving the government of the day whatever its political complexion.

      "body": "<p>In 2008, the world successfully pulled together \u2013 with Britain playing a catalytic role \u2013 when faced with the threat of financial collapse. In 2020, confronted with the threat of a global pandemic, it is every country for itself. There has been no international health summit of national leaders supported by the World Health Organization \u2013 although the World Bank has announced <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2020/03/03/world-bank-group-announces-up-to-12-billion-immediate-support-for-covid-19-country-response\" title=\"\">a $12bn package</a> of assistance. There are frantic national efforts to create a vaccine and no effort to ensure that, when found and produced in sufficient scale, it will go to the places of need \u2013 in all our interests. Britain, with no vaccine production capacity of its own, is especially vulnerable.</p> <p>Instead there are national bans on <a href=\"https://www.brusselstimes.com/belgium/98438/coronavirus-germany-bans-export-of-medical-protective-equipment/\" title=\"\">exports of key products</a> such as medical supplies, with countries falling back on their own analysis of the crisis amid localised shortages and haphazard, primitive approaches to containment. The standards on isolation, quarantine and contact tracing \u2013 medieval approaches to disease control in any case, according to Prof Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine \u2013 vary hugely between countries.</p> <p>The WHO, underfunded for decades, with the threat of further draconian loss of funds made only last month by Donald Trump, struggles to make itself relevant, undermined and ignored by its own members. China applies immense pressure so that its manipulated data or effectiveness are not challenged.

      "bodyText": "In 2008, the world successfully pulled together \u2013 with Britain playing a catalytic role \u2013 when faced with the threat of financial collapse. In 2020, confronted with the threat of a global pandemic, it is every country for itself. There has been no international health summit of national leaders supported by the World Health Organization \u2013 although the World Bank has announced a $12bn package of assistance. There are frantic national efforts to create a vaccine and no effort to ensure that, when found and produced in sufficient scale, it will go to the places of need \u2013 in all our interests. Britain, with no vaccine production capacity of its own, is especially vulnerable. Instead there are national bans on exports of key products such as medical supplies, with countries falling back on their own analysis of the crisis amid localised shortages and haphazard, primitive approaches to containment. The standards on isolation, quarantine and contact tracing \u2013 medieval approaches to disease control in any case, according to Prof Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine \u2013 vary hugely between countries. The WHO, underfunded for decades, with the threat of further draconian loss of funds made only last month by Donald Trump, struggles to make itself relevant, undermined and ignored by its own members. China applies immense pressure so that its manipulated data or effectiveness are not challenged. Trump has airily dismissed the WHO\u2019s warnings of an imminent pandemic because they do not conform to his \u201chunch\u201d that the health risks have been wildly overstated. In short, if you want to create a pandemic with wholesale abdication of global leadership, do what is happening now. The approach extends to the economy.

      "body": "<p>As profitable pitches go, they don\u2019t come much better than the one Abdul Daner has bagged for his ice-cream van. Parked opposite the London Eye, business is usually roaring, whatever the unpredictable British weather.</p> <p>On an average day excitable tourists thronging to one of the country\u2019s most popular visitor attractions snap up around 600 cones, 500 lollies and 100 hot dogs. Lately, however, Daner has had little to smile about at the end of an exhausting 12-hour shift, counting his bad luck rather than his cash with his thoughts dominated by the c-word: coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m really worried about what\u2019s going to happen over the next couple of months. My fear is that things are just going to get worse. Everyone is scared about catching it and the tourists aren\u2019t coming, which is hitting me in the pocket \u2013 and it hurts,\u201d he said.</p> <p>To allay customers\u2019 fears, Daner, 29, has started wearing latex gloves, while a large bottle of hand sanitiser has been strategically placed on the front shelf of his van, next to a stack of cones waiting to be filled. \u201cIt\u2019s not made any difference, only made me more paranoid. I\u2019m constantly washing my hands and I\u2019ve even started wearing the latex gloves to bed, which is a bit weird,\u201d he joked.</p> <p>Close by, tourists patiently waited to board the London Eye, but staff privately admitted that tickets were still available for the attraction, which is usually sold out at weekends and annually attracts 3.5 million people. But the very mention of the virus prompted security officials to intervene, asking the<em> Observer</em> to leave the area because \u201cjournalists are spreading panic\u201d.</p> <p>With the number of coronavirus cases rising in Britain, the capital is a barometer for the impact the disease \u2013 or the fear of it \u2013 is having on everyday life. High-profile shops were not as packed as usual, traffic was much lighter and even public transport felt pleasantly spacious as fewer passengers boarded buses and the tube.</p> <p>Two miles north of the London Eye, in Chinatown, there was a strange silence, despite its prime location in the heart of the West End.

      "bodyText": "As profitable pitches go, they don\u2019t come much better than the one Abdul Daner has bagged for his ice-cream van. Parked opposite the London Eye, business is usually roaring, whatever the unpredictable British weather. On an average day excitable tourists thronging to one of the country\u2019s most popular visitor attractions snap up around 600 cones, 500 lollies and 100 hot dogs. Lately, however, Daner has had little to smile about at the end of an exhausting 12-hour shift, counting his bad luck rather than his cash with his thoughts dominated by the c-word: coronavirus. \u201cI\u2019m really worried about what\u2019s going to happen over the next couple of months. My fear is that things are just going to get worse. Everyone is scared about catching it and the tourists aren\u2019t coming, which is hitting me in the pocket \u2013 and it hurts,\u201d he said. To allay customers\u2019 fears, Daner, 29, has started wearing latex gloves, while a large bottle of hand sanitiser has been strategically placed on the front shelf of his van, next to a stack of cones waiting to be filled. \u201cIt\u2019s not made any difference, only made me more paranoid. I\u2019m constantly washing my hands and I\u2019ve even started wearing the latex gloves to bed, which is a bit weird,\u201d he joked. Close by, tourists patiently waited to board the London Eye, but staff privately admitted that tickets were still available for the attraction, which is usually sold out at weekends and annually attracts 3.5 million people. But the very mention of the virus prompted security officials to intervene, asking the Observer to leave the area because \u201cjournalists are spreading panic\u201d. With the number of coronavirus cases rising in Britain, the capital is a barometer for the impact the disease \u2013 or the fear of it \u2013 is having on everyday life. High-profile shops were not as packed as usual, traffic was much lighter and even public transport felt pleasantly spacious as fewer passengers boarded buses and the tube. Two miles north of the London Eye, in Chinatown, there was a strange silence, despite its prime location in the heart of the West End. Officials at a community centre which offers classes in Chinese culture reported that many students had not turned up for the past two weeks. Staff in a local betting shop moaned about the dearth of punters willing to risk their money. Restaurants reported a dramatic drop in bookings. The Beijing Dumpling restaurant, close to Leicester Square, usually has queues of diners waiting to get in for lunch and dinner. \u201cNobody is interested in Chinese food at the moment or visiting Chinatown. People seem to think that if you come here to eat, then you\u2019ll catch the virus. It\u2019s racist and it\u2019s pathetic,\u201d said a waiter. \u201cHow long this goes on for, nobody knows.

      "body": "<p>The <em>Stage</em> has been conducting an online survey asking whether people would stay away from the theatre because of coronavirus. The latest voting, close as a Brexit referendum, shows a majority (small sample but of ardent theatregoers) answering yes.</p> <p>Absenteeism is not yet evident on press nights. There will, though, be other consequences: on the stage as well as in the auditorium. How will the coronoviral period be suggested by future designers and directors? With masks, shoulder squeezes and foot nudges? What today would an innocent eye make of Lady Macbeth\u2019s thorough hand washing? Would she seem disturbed \u2013 or prudent?</p> <p>I often catch myself underestimating the influence of silent movement and gesture on stage \u2013 in conveying a period touch, in contradicting a spoken word or in telling a truth. Until I am brought up against their power, intricately but firmly insisted on \u2013 as it is at the wonderful <a href=\"https://www.chickenshed.org.uk/theatre-changing-lives\" title=\"\">Chickenshed</a>, and in Amy Leach\u2019s production of <strong><a href=\"%E2%80%A8https://leedsplayhouse.org.uk/events/oliver-twist/\" title=\"\">Oliver Twist</a></strong>. Bryony Lavery\u2019s stripped-back adaptation is a collaboration with Ramps on the Moon, a consortium of theatres committed to putting deaf and disabled artists and audiences at the centre of their work. Some actors use sign language, some speak aloud \u2013 some do both. Surtitles are displayed bang in the middle of the stage where anyone can see them without giving herself a neck injury. There is audio description for the visually impaired: in a programme essay, Benjamin Wilson, who is blind, laments how rotten such description often is.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff00fc259e2f0898650d6d84490da3ab95ddddbe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff00fc259e2f0898650d6d84490da3ab95ddddbe/0_306_5897_3538/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brooklyn Melvin in the title role of Oliver Twist.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brooklyn Melvin in the title role of Oliver Twist.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Robling</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lavery\u2019s punchy script responds to the shaming similarities between the impoverished and abused in the London of Dickens and 2020 and puts the hero in a further circle of exclusion: this Oliver is deaf, at a time when sign language was banned in schools \u2013 in one scene his hands are tied behind his back to stop him signing. The boy famous for asking for more cannot talk aloud.</p> <p>Yet, as Oliver, Brooklyn Melvin can speak with his hands. As a hearing non-signer, I watch this rather as someone who cannot hear might watch people speaking. I am aware of the delicacy of expression in these fingers, and also their force \u2013 some actors seem able to throw their hands as surely as others throw their voices. Yet I don\u2019t understand the inflections, the intricacies. Cleverly, British sign language is made the secret argot of Fagin\u2019s gang \u2013 presided over by a roistering Caroline Parker, got up with Vivienne Westwood swagger in spiky hair and enormous crimson dress.</p> <p>The action is occasionally slowed by too much narration, but mostly moves like hyper-Dickens (with a gorgeous bull terrier puppet). The dialogue is more headline than subtlety: but the novelist painted in broad strokes, and nuance is there in those hands and the shrug of bodies. Hayley Grindle\u2019s menacing industrial design \u2013 an iron framework with dangling cables that is both scaffold and skeleton theatre, with the screen for captions at its centre \u2013 is harsh blacks and whites, the shades of institutional life, and of negatives. The colour scheme has another purpose: its high contrasts are easily seen by the visually impaired. How beautifully these considerations feed into each other. It is a production that made me realise how much of the time a sighted, hearing audience is experiencing only two- dimensional theatre.</p> <p>Dynamic physicality is the galvanic force behind the Frantic Assembly company. Its influence has rippled throughout the stage over the past 25 years: it supplied the movement direction on the National\u2019s <em>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time</em>. In<strong> <a href=\"https://www.stratfordeast.com/whats-on/all-shows/i-think-we-are-alone\" title=\"\">I Think We Are Alone</a></strong>, it celebrates its anniversary with an episodic show about loneliness, separation and reconciliation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"44e50ffbc262b721a73161303049c31c995a2d11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44e50ffbc262b721a73161303049c31c995a2d11/0_0_2882_1815/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sally Abbott\u2019s I Think We Are Alone.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"630\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sally Abbott\u2019s I Think We Are Alone.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sally Abbott\u2019s script is unerringly generous, though sometimes over-explicit. Co-directed by Kathy Burke and Scott Graham, the snippets of scenes gradually coalesce, with a cast who tumble, shin up heights and wind around one another in a perpetual dance of pain and partnership. The evening goes directly to the emotions. I sat amid rapt teenagers \u2013 their teacher explained that the school are Frantic fans \u2013 who gasped and winced and wept as the story twisted.</p> <p>Strength of feeling is transmitted by Morgan Large\u2019s design and Paul Keogan\u2019s lighting, which flushes colourful warmth into clinical whiteness. Glass screens, wheeled around the stage like transparent, elongated hospital trolleys, divide mother and son, sister from sister. They close in on the woman who, wine bottle in hand, is struggling with childhood memories. They make smudgy silhouettes of people standing behind them, who seem to have vaporised into ghosts or fears.</p> <p>I have never seen a pair of white socks do so much work as those worn by Thalissa Teixeira in<strong> <a href=\"https://www.shakespearesglobe.com/whats-on/women-beware-women-19-20/\" title=\"\">Women Beware Women</a></strong>. Pulled over her knees, they make her look gangly as the young heroine \u2013 and yell that Thomas Middleton\u2019s Jacobean tragedy is being transplanted to the 20th century; after her rape, one sock has slipped down round her ankle.

      "bodyText": "The Stage has been conducting an online survey asking whether people would stay away from the theatre because of coronavirus. The latest voting, close as a Brexit referendum, shows a majority (small sample but of ardent theatregoers) answering yes. Absenteeism is not yet evident on press nights. There will, though, be other consequences: on the stage as well as in the auditorium. How will the coronoviral period be suggested by future designers and directors? With masks, shoulder squeezes and foot nudges? What today would an innocent eye make of Lady Macbeth\u2019s thorough hand washing? Would she seem disturbed \u2013 or prudent? I often catch myself underestimating the influence of silent movement and gesture on stage \u2013 in conveying a period touch, in contradicting a spoken word or in telling a truth. Until I am brought up against their power, intricately but firmly insisted on \u2013 as it is at the wonderful Chickenshed, and in Amy Leach\u2019s production of Oliver Twist. Bryony Lavery\u2019s stripped-back adaptation is a collaboration with Ramps on the Moon, a consortium of theatres committed to putting deaf and disabled artists and audiences at the centre of their work. Some actors use sign language, some speak aloud \u2013 some do both. Surtitles are displayed bang in the middle of the stage where anyone can see them without giving herself a neck injury. There is audio description for the visually impaired: in a programme essay, Benjamin Wilson, who is blind, laments how rotten such description often is. Lavery\u2019s punchy script responds to the shaming similarities between the impoverished and abused in the London of Dickens and 2020 and puts the hero in a further circle of exclusion: this Oliver is deaf, at a time when sign language was banned in schools \u2013 in one scene his hands are tied behind his back to stop him signing. The boy famous for asking for more cannot talk aloud. Yet, as Oliver, Brooklyn Melvin can speak with his hands. As a hearing non-signer, I watch this rather as someone who cannot hear might watch people speaking. I am aware of the delicacy of expression in these fingers, and also their force \u2013 some actors seem able to throw their hands as surely as others throw their voices. Yet I don\u2019t understand the inflections, the intricacies. Cleverly, British sign language is made the secret argot of Fagin\u2019s gang \u2013 presided over by a roistering Caroline Parker, got up with Vivienne Westwood swagger in spiky hair and enormous crimson dress. The action is occasionally slowed by too much narration, but mostly moves like hyper-Dickens (with a gorgeous bull terrier puppet). The dialogue is more headline than subtlety: but the novelist painted in broad strokes, and nuance is there in those hands and the shrug of bodies. Hayley Grindle\u2019s menacing industrial design \u2013 an iron framework with dangling cables that is both scaffold and skeleton theatre, with the screen for captions at its centre \u2013 is harsh blacks and whites, the shades of institutional life, and of negatives. The colour scheme has another purpose: its high contrasts are easily seen by the visually impaired. How beautifully these considerations feed into each other. It is a production that made me realise how much of the time a sighted, hearing audience is experiencing only two- dimensional theatre. Dynamic physicality is the galvanic force behind the Frantic Assembly company. Its influence has rippled throughout the stage over the past 25 years: it supplied the movement direction on the National\u2019s The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time. In I Think We Are Alone, it celebrates its anniversary with an episodic show about loneliness, separation and reconciliation. Sally Abbott\u2019s script is unerringly generous, though sometimes over-explicit. Co-directed by Kathy Burke and Scott Graham, the snippets of scenes gradually coalesce, with a cast who tumble, shin up heights and wind around one another in a perpetual dance of pain and partnership. The evening goes directly to the emotions. I sat amid rapt teenagers \u2013 their teacher explained that the school are Frantic fans \u2013 who gasped and winced and wept as the story twisted. Strength of feeling is transmitted by Morgan Large\u2019s design and Paul Keogan\u2019s lighting, which flushes colourful warmth into clinical whiteness. Glass screens, wheeled around the stage like transparent, elongated hospital trolleys, divide mother and son, sister from sister. They close in on the woman who, wine bottle in hand, is struggling with childhood memories. They make smudgy silhouettes of people standing behind them, who seem to have vaporised into ghosts or fears. I have never seen a pair of white socks do so much work as those worn by Thalissa Teixeira in Women Beware Women. Pulled over her knees, they make her look gangly as the young heroine \u2013 and yell that Thomas Middleton\u2019s Jacobean tragedy is being transplanted to the 20th century; after her rape, one sock has slipped down round her ankle. The soaring (and finely singing) Teixeira is the main reason to see Amy Hodge\u2019s production; she plucks reflection from an otherwise hectically knowing evening. Joanna Scotcher\u2019s design manages with sleek economy to bring the gloss of Trump Towers to the Sam Wanamaker, but what would be startling \u2013 upskirting! \u2013 in a period production looks predictable here, and the gabble of Middleton\u2019s plotting looks not so much threatening as incompetent. Good names, though: Sordido is a character who can move seamlessly through centuries.

      "body": "<p>Obituaries of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/03/jack-welch-obituary\" title=\"\">Jack Welch</a>, the former boss of US conglomerate General Electric (GE) who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/02/jack-welch-former-ge-boss-and-manager-of-the-century-dies-at-84\" title=\"\">died last week</a>, have struggled to conclude whether he was a titan of business or ultimately a figurehead who exemplified the worst traits of modern capitalism.</p> <p>As a business celebrity, there is no doubt he ranks as one of the most praised executives of his era, not least by US presidents. Following his death on 1 March, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1234483443712561157?s=20\" title=\"\">Donald Trump said</a>: \u201cThere was no corporate leader like \u2018Neutron Jack\u2019. He was my friend and supporter. We made wonderful deals together.\u201d</p> <p>Picture archives show him on the golf course with Trump\u2019s predecessors, Democrat and Republican, who marvelled at the transformation wrought by Welch between 1981 and 2001, when he was chairman and chief executive of GE.</p> <p><a href=\"https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1999/11/22/269126/index.htm\" title=\"\">In 1999, <em>Fortune </em>magazine</a> went so far as to name him its manager of the century, saying: \u201cHe showed business people everywhere a method of attacking change of any kind.\u201d</p> <p>GE, which during Welch\u2019s reign made everything from plastics and to aircraft engines to televisions and fridges, wasn\u2019t the only company to champion management as a skill to be learned, with its own training centre that Welch would often attend as a lecturer. Firms such as Mars were also lauded for superior management training and supplying much of US commerce with highly regarded leaders; it was just that Welch liked a public fight and the coverage that came with it.</p> <p>Such was his fame that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,568020,00.html\" title=\"\">publishers paid $10m</a> for a self-penned book, <em>Jack: Straight from the Gut</em>. The \u201cNeutron\u201d moniker, which he disliked, stuck with him after he followed through, year after year, with a policy of shutting businesses and clearing out staff who failed to meet his demand for high returns.</p> <p>He assessed staff annually and ranked them according to their ability to generate profits. The bottom 10% of managers were regularly let go in a cull that also included more than 170,000 employees in his first 10 years in charge.</p> <p>Not only did this attitude drive unions to despair, it arguably sowed the seeds of the company\u2019s decline. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/dec/01/general-electric-titan-american-industry-lost-spark\" title=\"\">GE today is worth a fifth of the value</a> on the New York Stock Exchange that it enjoyed in 1999, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2001/sep/07/12\" title=\"\">shortly before Welch stepped down</a>.</p> <p>Where he came unstuck was a strict adherence to shareholder value and a policy of slavishly following what the management accounts told him were his best performing businesses.</p> <p>In his book <em>Obliquity</em>, the economist John Kay argues that the most successful companies and people focus on being the best they can at producing particular goods and services, with profits sure to follow. A microscopic focus on numbers will only lead to short-term returns.</p> <p>Welch would criticise his more paternalistic rivals, including Rolls-Royce, for being nothing more than state-subsidised playthings run by book-keepers. Yet it was his obsession with figures that led him into financial services, a move that soaked up the company\u2019s reserves and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/sep/26/generalelectric.dowjones\" title=\"\">came unstuck</a> in the 2008 financial crash. GE Capital was a huge lender before the crisis and was forced to retrench in its aftermath.</p> <p>In his book, Welch pointed to his achievement in building a company with revenues of $27bn at the start of the 1980s into one with sales of $130bn in 2000, during a period of globalisation that put low-cost south-east Asian countries and China in the ascendancy. His legacy, however, must be offset against GE\u2019s treatment of employees, an embrace of debt that symbolised the excesses of the pre-crash era, and the fostering of a short-termist culture that appears to linger in the present-day White House. The rock-star manager of this century will have to behave differently.</p> <h2>John Lewis needs a master of the retail universe<br></h2> <p>D<em>octor Who</em> has Jodie Whittaker and Bond\u2019s producers brought in Phoebe Waller-Bridge to rescue its latest script from disaster. Can a bit of female empowerment help that venerable British institution, the John Lewis Partnership, fight of the forces of change that threaten its very existence? Profits are down by nearly a quarter, led by a gobsmacking 65% dive at the group\u2019s John Lewis department stores.</p> <p>The new chairman (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/02/sharon-white-gets-set-live-troubled-john-lewis-dream\" title=\"\">her chosen title</a>), Sharon White, is facing the kind of challenge that even a master of the universe might quake at. How does one regenerate a retailer in the face of the uncertainty around Brexit and the coronavirus, while consumer habits shift rapidly towards online shopping and away from \u201cstuff\u201d in general? Clothing has dropped down shopping lists, while homewares are in the doldrums as housing sales remain slow and new competitors such as Dunelm and Made.com vie for attention.</p> <p>White\u2019s comments last week showed she has been quick to grasp the issues at hand and is prepared to bring fresh thinking on, for example, the department store\u2019s \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d price-matching policy. She has been brave in admitting that jobs are likely to go and underperforming stores could shut.</p> <p>With rivals such as Debenhams, House of Fraser and Beales on the ropes, there is clearly an opportunity for a well-funded and well-run department store to survive. But can it thrive? Shutting shops is likely to lead to negative publicity that may put a further dampener on sales. Walking the line between efficiency and protecting an ethos of care for staff and customers will be tricky.</p> <p>White will need to find a balance between new ideas and capitalising on the knowledge and experience of her team.

      "bodyText": "Obituaries of Jack Welch, the former boss of US conglomerate General Electric (GE) who died last week, have struggled to conclude whether he was a titan of business or ultimately a figurehead who exemplified the worst traits of modern capitalism. As a business celebrity, there is no doubt he ranks as one of the most praised executives of his era, not least by US presidents. Following his death on 1 March, Donald Trump said: \u201cThere was no corporate leader like \u2018Neutron Jack\u2019. He was my friend and supporter. We made wonderful deals together.\u201d Picture archives show him on the golf course with Trump\u2019s predecessors, Democrat and Republican, who marvelled at the transformation wrought by Welch between 1981 and 2001, when he was chairman and chief executive of GE. In 1999, Fortune magazine went so far as to name him its manager of the century, saying: \u201cHe showed business people everywhere a method of attacking change of any kind.\u201d GE, which during Welch\u2019s reign made everything from plastics and to aircraft engines to televisions and fridges, wasn\u2019t the only company to champion management as a skill to be learned, with its own training centre that Welch would often attend as a lecturer. Firms such as Mars were also lauded for superior management training and supplying much of US commerce with highly regarded leaders; it was just that Welch liked a public fight and the coverage that came with it. Such was his fame that publishers paid $10m for a self-penned book, Jack: Straight from the Gut. The \u201cNeutron\u201d moniker, which he disliked, stuck with him after he followed through, year after year, with a policy of shutting businesses and clearing out staff who failed to meet his demand for high returns. He assessed staff annually and ranked them according to their ability to generate profits. The bottom 10% of managers were regularly let go in a cull that also included more than 170,000 employees in his first 10 years in charge. Not only did this attitude drive unions to despair, it arguably sowed the seeds of the company\u2019s decline. GE today is worth a fifth of the value on the New York Stock Exchange that it enjoyed in 1999, shortly before Welch stepped down. Where he came unstuck was a strict adherence to shareholder value and a policy of slavishly following what the management accounts told him were his best performing businesses. In his book Obliquity, the economist John Kay argues that the most successful companies and people focus on being the best they can at producing particular goods and services, with profits sure to follow. A microscopic focus on numbers will only lead to short-term returns. Welch would criticise his more paternalistic rivals, including Rolls-Royce, for being nothing more than state-subsidised playthings run by book-keepers. Yet it was his obsession with figures that led him into financial services, a move that soaked up the company\u2019s reserves and came unstuck in the 2008 financial crash. GE Capital was a huge lender before the crisis and was forced to retrench in its aftermath. In his book, Welch pointed to his achievement in building a company with revenues of $27bn at the start of the 1980s into one with sales of $130bn in 2000, during a period of globalisation that put low-cost south-east Asian countries and China in the ascendancy. His legacy, however, must be offset against GE\u2019s treatment of employees, an embrace of debt that symbolised the excesses of the pre-crash era, and the fostering of a short-termist culture that appears to linger in the present-day White House. The rock-star manager of this century will have to behave differently. John Lewis needs a master of the retail universe Doctor Who has Jodie Whittaker and Bond\u2019s producers brought in Phoebe Waller-Bridge to rescue its latest script from disaster. Can a bit of female empowerment help that venerable British institution, the John Lewis Partnership, fight of the forces of change that threaten its very existence? Profits are down by nearly a quarter, led by a gobsmacking 65% dive at the group\u2019s John Lewis department stores. The new chairman (her chosen title), Sharon White, is facing the kind of challenge that even a master of the universe might quake at. How does one regenerate a retailer in the face of the uncertainty around Brexit and the coronavirus, while consumer habits shift rapidly towards online shopping and away from \u201cstuff\u201d in general? Clothing has dropped down shopping lists, while homewares are in the doldrums as housing sales remain slow and new competitors such as Dunelm and Made.com vie for attention. White\u2019s comments last week showed she has been quick to grasp the issues at hand and is prepared to bring fresh thinking on, for example, the department store\u2019s \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d price-matching policy. She has been brave in admitting that jobs are likely to go and underperforming stores could shut. With rivals such as Debenhams, House of Fraser and Beales on the ropes, there is clearly an opportunity for a well-funded and well-run department store to survive. But can it thrive? Shutting shops is likely to lead to negative publicity that may put a further dampener on sales. Walking the line between efficiency and protecting an ethos of care for staff and customers will be tricky. White will need to find a balance between new ideas and capitalising on the knowledge and experience of her team. She has no experience of running a retailer \u2013 can she listen as well as preach? There can be no \u2018levelling up\u2019 if British employers shun regions The news for regional jobs in Britain was not good last week. The collapse of Flybe will have severe consequences for economic prosperity in smaller communities, with about 2,000 jobs at risk at the regional airline. Barclays announced last week it would close a major office in Leeds, with the outright loss of more than 200 jobs. Both of these developments over the past week are instructive of a wider trend in Britain, the most unequal country for regional prosperity among large wealthy nations. While Boris Johnson has pledged to \u201clevel up\u201d poorer regions to bring them closer into line with the rest of the country, it is equally important that the country\u2019s biggest companies play their part. Lloyds Banking Group has a slogan that risks sounding as empty as Johnson\u2019s: \u201cHelping Britain Prosper\u201d. Yet the UK\u2019s biggest mortgage lender has announced plans over recent weeks to axe about 780 jobs and close 56 branches across the country. The news adds to a disappointing trend since the financial crisis, as the bank has effectively halved the size of its workforce to about 70,000. Thousands of regional roles have vanished. Banks and other big firms have offshored regional British jobs to eastern Europe, India and elsewhere, under pressure from shareholders to boost their profits at the expense of local communities. Virgin Money \u2013 which has merged with the soon-to-be rebranded Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank \u2013 is in the process of sacrificing 500 roles and 52 branches on the altar of shareholder value. Direct Line will cut 800 jobs from its 11,000-strong workforce as part of a \u00a360m cost-saving drive. All these illustrate the increasingly lopsided nature of the UK economy, exacerbating divisions between small towns and big cities. For too long, jobs have been lost in regional communities as big business pulls back to metropolitan centres. Levelling up should be about more than just the public sector \u2013 private enterprise must play its part.",

      "bodyText": "Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has promised to give the NHS \u201cwhatever it needs\u201d to tackle the coronavirus crisis, as he looks at loosening the fiscal rules to allow for more borrowing and spending. Before this week\u2019s budget, Sunak did not say how much in additional resources the NHS would get, but indicated the government was potentially willing to write a blank cheque to help the health service cope with a pandemic. Sunak refused to deny several times that he was looking at getting rid of the fiscal rules from the Conservative election manifesto, which commits him to balancing the books on day-to-day spending midway through this parliament. There is speculation that the coronavirus crisis gives the government a reason to throw out the fiscal rules set just a few months ago by Sunak\u2019s predecessor Sajid Javid. Sunak told the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: \u201cI can say absolutely categorically the NHS will get whatever resources it needs to get us through this and to respond to the health crisis.\u201d Sunak\u2019s assurance comes after warnings from doctors and other medical professionals that the NHS is already under too much pressure to be able to deal with a serious worsening of the coronavirus outbreak. There are worries about whether enough beds for critically ill patients will be available, about staff falling ill and others having to take time off to care for children if schools across the country close down. Over the weekend, the government said people could be asked to volunteer in the NHS at the peak of the outbreak. Speaking earlier on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Sunak said he would be outlining further measures at the budget to help businesses hit by short-term financing problems as a result of trade slowing down or large sick pay bills. \u201cYou\u2019re right this could be a challenging period for businesses but it will be an impact for a temporary period of time,\u201d he said. The government would be looking at helping businesses find bridging financing rather than providing bailouts, Sunak added. He said the impact on businesses \u201ccould be significant\u201d so the government was actively looking at how to support them through difficult periods for cashflow. Despite dire predictions about the effects of coronavirus on the world economy, Sunak said the government would not extend the Brexit transition period beyond December. The Scottish first minister and SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, told Ridge it was \u201cpretty much inevitable that we will need additional resources\u201d in the NHS to cope with coronavirus. She also called for a \u201crelaxation of universal credit rules\u201d to ensure people stayed in isolation if they had suspected coronavirus rather than trying to make appointments at job centres. \u201cWe don\u2019t want people who have been advised to self-isolate to minimise the risk of passing the infection on to others to be sanctioned on their benefits,\u201d she said. Labour\u2019s John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said the government\u2019s spending in this week\u2019s budget would be \u201cit\u2019s nowhere near the scale we need\u201d. He told the Marr show it \u201cwill not deliver what we need in terms of the NHS\u201d and warned it \u201chas got to be the most important budget since the second world war\u201d to deal with coronavirus, climate change and the crisis in public services.",

      "body": "<p>Not since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/mar/03/budget1999.budget26\">Denis Healey in 1974</a> has a chancellor had so little time to prepare for a budget. With just four weeks in his new role \u2013 only a week more than Healey had to prepare \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rishi-sunak\">Rishi Sunak </a>had been expected to deliver one of the most important budgets since the financial crisis. Here at last was a Conservative majority, the biggest since Margaret Thatcher in 1987, affording him the space to define Boris Johnson\u2019s brand of Toryism.</p> <p>Not for the first time, the Treasury\u2019s freedom will be distinctly limited. Faced with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">unfolding economic crisis from the coronavirus</a>, the new chancellor has been forced to rip up his plans and start again. For now, the flagship budget once envisaged must wait.</p> <p>Reassurance over ideology is needed. Yet Sunak\u2019s big challenge will be to shore up confidence at the same time as providing some clues about the identity of Johnson\u2019s government. A series of emergency spending measures to support households and businesses are expected. But such is the weight of expectation after vast election promises that a boom in transport spending, plans to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/11/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnsons-levelling-up-theres-no-quick-fix\">level up</a>\u201d the regional imbalances of Britain and funding to tackle the climate emergency are required. It is a tricky balancing act for the second youngest chancellor for at least a century.</p> <p>At a minimum, economists at Deutsche Bank expect the chancellor to announce emergency support worth between \u00a33bn to \u00a35bn for companies struggling to stay afloat as the virus disrupts supply chains or drags down demand for goods and services. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/04/next-bank-of-england-governor-calls-for-funds-for-coronavirus-hit-firms\">Bank of England is expected to be called</a> in with coordinated support. More substantial measures, such as 2.5% cut to VAT or even a delay to VAT payments for businesses \u2013 as implemented during the financial crisis - could be used, but come with a significant price tag: around \u00a310bn of additional public borrowing this year.</p> <p>In some respects, the crisis has a silver lining for Sunak. There <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/feb/14/cabinet-reshuffle-boris-johnson-to-chair-first-meeting-of-new-cabinet-after-reshuffle-live-news?page=with:block-5e4659d28f0811db2faf7882\">had been doubts</a> whether the budget would happen this week after his rapid promotion to replace <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/sajid-javid\">Sajid Javid</a>, with speculation that fiscal events later in the year \u2013 such as the spending review and the autumn statement \u2013 would be used instead to define the new Toryism. Covid-19 helps Sunak duck some of the big decisions about the future shape of the state, downgrading the budget from box office curtain raiser to disaster relief statement.</p> <p>Even before the global health crisis hit, he faced bad news from the public finances, with borrowing already on a spiralling trajectory. Promises made by Javid to balance day-to-day spending by the middle of the parliament already looked to be dangerously at risk. Crisis conditions will allow Sunak to relax the fiscal rules, or to put off some of the big tax and spending decisions until a later date.</p> <p>Despite this, the longer-term direction of travel is clear: Johnson\u2019s big promises will require greater spending than his Tory predecessors, as the fetish for deficit reduction and a smaller state of prime ministers past is jettisoned. Public spending is expected to rise above <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/24/uk-public-spending-to-top-1tn-a-year-thinktank-forecasts\">\u00a31tn a year</a>, outstripping the size of the state under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tonyblair\">Tony Blair</a>. Alongside the emergency support to tackle the coronavirus, there will be fresh funding for the NHS, schools and police as promised at the election. To renege would be political suicide.</p> <p>The spree though comes at a time when the economy looks increasingly weak. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/office-for-budget-responsibility\">Office for Budget Responsibility</a> was expected to significantly downgrade Britain\u2019s growth prospects even before the coronavirus hit, as already weaker global growth and Brexit uncertainty dampen activity. Now it is likely to look much worse.

      "bodyText": "Not since Denis Healey in 1974 has a chancellor had so little time to prepare for a budget. With just four weeks in his new role \u2013 only a week more than Healey had to prepare \u2013 Rishi Sunak had been expected to deliver one of the most important budgets since the financial crisis. Here at last was a Conservative majority, the biggest since Margaret Thatcher in 1987, affording him the space to define Boris Johnson\u2019s brand of Toryism. Not for the first time, the Treasury\u2019s freedom will be distinctly limited. Faced with the unfolding economic crisis from the coronavirus, the new chancellor has been forced to rip up his plans and start again. For now, the flagship budget once envisaged must wait. Reassurance over ideology is needed. Yet Sunak\u2019s big challenge will be to shore up confidence at the same time as providing some clues about the identity of Johnson\u2019s government. A series of emergency spending measures to support households and businesses are expected. But such is the weight of expectation after vast election promises that a boom in transport spending, plans to \u201clevel up\u201d the regional imbalances of Britain and funding to tackle the climate emergency are required. It is a tricky balancing act for the second youngest chancellor for at least a century. At a minimum, economists at Deutsche Bank expect the chancellor to announce emergency support worth between \u00a33bn to \u00a35bn for companies struggling to stay afloat as the virus disrupts supply chains or drags down demand for goods and services. The Bank of England is expected to be called in with coordinated support. More substantial measures, such as 2.5% cut to VAT or even a delay to VAT payments for businesses \u2013 as implemented during the financial crisis - could be used, but come with a significant price tag: around \u00a310bn of additional public borrowing this year. In some respects, the crisis has a silver lining for Sunak. There had been doubts whether the budget would happen this week after his rapid promotion to replace Sajid Javid, with speculation that fiscal events later in the year \u2013 such as the spending review and the autumn statement \u2013 would be used instead to define the new Toryism. Covid-19 helps Sunak duck some of the big decisions about the future shape of the state, downgrading the budget from box office curtain raiser to disaster relief statement. Even before the global health crisis hit, he faced bad news from the public finances, with borrowing already on a spiralling trajectory. Promises made by Javid to balance day-to-day spending by the middle of the parliament already looked to be dangerously at risk. Crisis conditions will allow Sunak to relax the fiscal rules, or to put off some of the big tax and spending decisions until a later date. Despite this, the longer-term direction of travel is clear: Johnson\u2019s big promises will require greater spending than his Tory predecessors, as the fetish for deficit reduction and a smaller state of prime ministers past is jettisoned. Public spending is expected to rise above \u00a31tn a year, outstripping the size of the state under Tony Blair. Alongside the emergency support to tackle the coronavirus, there will be fresh funding for the NHS, schools and police as promised at the election. To renege would be political suicide. The spree though comes at a time when the economy looks increasingly weak. The Office for Budget Responsibility was expected to significantly downgrade Britain\u2019s growth prospects even before the coronavirus hit, as already weaker global growth and Brexit uncertainty dampen activity. Now it is likely to look much worse. Britain is ripping up the relationship with its biggest trade partner and going it alone as a global recession looms. Government borrowing is set to hit \u00a363bn next year, according to estimates from the Institute for Fiscal Studies \u2013 about \u00a323bn more than anticipated. Yet Sunak has his hands tied by Tory manifesto promises not to raise income tax, national insurance and VAT \u2013 the three largest sources of income for the exchequer. Some tweaks are expected. Corporation tax will be frozen, saving around \u00a36bn a year, while entrepreneurs relief \u2013 at an annual cost of \u00a32.3bn and benefitting the richest in society most \u2013 will either be reformed or scrapped. Despite protests from backbench Tories, fuel duty could be unfrozen, allowing the tax on motorists to rise in-line with inflation for the first time in a decade. But these efforts are sticking plasters. A more fundamental rethink of taxation is required. Raising taxes has never been popular. For the Conservatives, even less so. We are told it is Labour that drops tax bombshells. For Tories, raiding the pockets of wealthy pensioners is a \u201cmoral disgrace\u201d that doesn\u2019t bear thinking about. At its last assessment, the OBR projected tax receipts as a percentage of GDP would rise to 34.6% this year \u2013 the highest tax burden for Britain since the late 1960s. But there is growing support for tax to fund public services, after a decade of damaging austerity. New research from the RSA think tank suggests the public want a decisive break with the era of cuts \u2013 and appears prepared to pay for it. Around half of people in a survey it commissioned thought taxes should rise, while 40% said that higher borrowing was the answer. As few as 12% thought promises to raise spending on the NHS, education and police should be ditched. Even a majority of Tory voters backed income tax hikes, mansion taxes and cuts to pensions tax relief for the wealthiest in society. Britain, despite appeals to morality from Tory MPs, is on a path away from the low-tax, small-state country of the past four decades. If the Tory identity as the party of the small state is gone as we are led to believe, Sunak must also recognise he must be more honest with voters that taxes should rise to fund this new settlement. When he delivers the budget this week, a quote attributed to the great economist John Maynard Keynes might sum up his actions: \u201cWhen the facts change, I change my mind.\u201d It is the right path for reacting to the coronavirus.

All of the matches had already been postponed from last weekend. Italy announced a sweeping quarantine early on Sunday for its northern regions, igniting travel chaos as it restricted the movements of a quarter of its population in an attempt to halt the new coronavirus\u2019s spread across Europe. Shortly after midnight, the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, signed a decree affecting 16m people in the country\u2019s north, including the Lombardy region and at least 14 provinces in neighbouring regions.

The night\u2019s main story is coronavirus, a \u201cdeceitful, dishonest and frankly gay smear campaign\u201d cooked up by liberals. Ingraham welcomes a stream of guests, including the always-soused Judge Jeanine Pirro and the dimwitted Trump brothers.</p> <p>Pivoting to the Democratic primaries, she\u2019s joined first by Fox\u2019s newest anchor, Chris Matthews (Darrell Hammond, doing a killer impression of the insufferable former MSNBC pundit) and later by the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren. The night\u2019s big surprise comes early, with the real Warren showing up to poke some fun at herself (while also taking one more dig at humiliated rival Mike Bloomberg for good measure). Asked whether she\u2019ll endorse Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders, Warren waffles, saying that \u201cmaybe I\u2019ll just pull a New York Times and endorse them both\u201d. Warren is surprisingly natural, acquitting herself much better than most politicians who have appeared on the show.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/1236515663587487745\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Please welcome Sen.

He introduces a clip from the upcoming James Bond film (recently delayed due to public health concerns over the coronavirus): doing reconnaissance in a casino, 007 loses track of his mission once he starts winning at craps. He quickly turns from a suave secret agent into an overexcited tourist D-bag, swapping his usual drink (vodka, shaken, not stirred) for a \u201cvodka and Red Bull in a pint glass\u201d. It\u2019s a good showcase for Craig\u2019s goofy comedic chops, even if it runs a bit too long.</p> <p>Daytime soap The Sands of Modesto plays up coronavirus fears by having the actors jump through hoops to keep from touching one another. It\u2019s mostly flat and, again, overlong, but it includes some decent slapstick, especially a bit where Craig\u2019s quaffed lothario attempts to make out with McKinnon\u2019s desperate housewife only after wrapping her head-to-toe in plastic wrap.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/1236537526384570368\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude5d, \ud835\ude6e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude67 \ud835\ude60\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude5f\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude60\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude44 \ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SNL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SNL</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/GUQLnH6Srx\">pic.twitter.com/GUQLnH6Srx</a></p>&mdash; Saturday Night Live - SNL (@nbcsnl) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/1236537526384570368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 8, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>On the Couch Tonight is a smooth R&amp;B single from Kenan Thompson, Chris Redd and the night\u2019s musical guest, The Weeknd, about a trio of lovers consigned to the couch by their partners for various transgressions such as infidelity, potential matricide, and stalking their ex.</p> <p>Next, we\u2019re treated to some welcome weirdness on the daytime talk show The Diedre Show, in which the celebrity guest, musical diva Cookie LaFloo (Ego Nwodim) takes offense at Craig\u2019s visiting chef after he innocently warns her not to eat the foil on an hors d\u2019oeuvre. Her nonstop berating grows increasingly threatening \u2013 as well as shockingly homophobic \u2013 until the pitch-perfect punchline.</p> <p>Former cast member Rachel Dratch returns as one of her most popular characters, Debbie Downer. The vibe-killing uber-pessimist bums out the tablemates at her cousin\u2019s wedding reception by bringing up coronavirus, #MeToo, feline Aids and, of course, Trump. It\u2019s a welcome return for the character and her accompanying foghorns, although as good as Dratch is, it\u2019s Thompson who steals the sketch with one perfectly delivered line, furiously asking a fellow tablemate who engages Debbie: \u201cNow why would you delve?!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/1236529020575121408\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">You can&#39;t stop Debbie Downer. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SNL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SNL</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/gUMrMCa1Vy\">pic.twitter.com/gUMrMCa1Vy</a></p>&mdash; Saturday Night Live - SNL (@nbcsnl) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/1236529020575121408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 8, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The Weeknd, sporting a bloody and battered face, performs his single Blinding Lights.</p> <p>On Weekend Update, Colin Jost ponders potential presidential debates between Biden and Donald Trump, predicting: \u201cThey\u2019ll be the first debates that have to be moderated by a Jamaican nurse.\u201d Michael Che doesn\u2019t care who wins the Democratic nomination so long as they beat Trump: \u201cDemocrats are like condoms.

He brings along his accent coach, Franklin Hughes (Beck Bennett), a mulletted, rhinestone-clad lunatic whose accent work is based entirely on cartoons like Yosemite Sam and Foghorn Leghorn.

      "bodyText": "Saturday Night Live opens with a spoof of the Fox News show The Ingraham Angle, hosted by \u201dthe Joey Fatone of Fox News\u201d, Laura Ingraham (Kate McKinnon). The night\u2019s main story is coronavirus, a \u201cdeceitful, dishonest and frankly gay smear campaign\u201d cooked up by liberals. Ingraham welcomes a stream of guests, including the always-soused Judge Jeanine Pirro and the dimwitted Trump brothers. Pivoting to the Democratic primaries, she\u2019s joined first by Fox\u2019s newest anchor, Chris Matthews (Darrell Hammond, doing a killer impression of the insufferable former MSNBC pundit) and later by the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren. The night\u2019s big surprise comes early, with the real Warren showing up to poke some fun at herself (while also taking one more dig at humiliated rival Mike Bloomberg for good measure). Asked whether she\u2019ll endorse Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders, Warren waffles, saying that \u201cmaybe I\u2019ll just pull a New York Times and endorse them both\u201d. Warren is surprisingly natural, acquitting herself much better than most politicians who have appeared on the show. Daniel Craig is back hosting for the first time in eight years. He introduces a clip from the upcoming James Bond film (recently delayed due to public health concerns over the coronavirus): doing reconnaissance in a casino, 007 loses track of his mission once he starts winning at craps. He quickly turns from a suave secret agent into an overexcited tourist D-bag, swapping his usual drink (vodka, shaken, not stirred) for a \u201cvodka and Red Bull in a pint glass\u201d. It\u2019s a good showcase for Craig\u2019s goofy comedic chops, even if it runs a bit too long. Daytime soap The Sands of Modesto plays up coronavirus fears by having the actors jump through hoops to keep from touching one another. It\u2019s mostly flat and, again, overlong, but it includes some decent slapstick, especially a bit where Craig\u2019s quaffed lothario attempts to make out with McKinnon\u2019s desperate housewife only after wrapping her head-to-toe in plastic wrap. On the Couch Tonight is a smooth R&amp;B single from Kenan Thompson, Chris Redd and the night\u2019s musical guest, The Weeknd, about a trio of lovers consigned to the couch by their partners for various transgressions such as infidelity, potential matricide, and stalking their ex. Next, we\u2019re treated to some welcome weirdness on the daytime talk show The Diedre Show, in which the celebrity guest, musical diva Cookie LaFloo (Ego Nwodim) takes offense at Craig\u2019s visiting chef after he innocently warns her not to eat the foil on an hors d\u2019oeuvre. Her nonstop berating grows increasingly threatening \u2013 as well as shockingly homophobic \u2013 until the pitch-perfect punchline. Former cast member Rachel Dratch returns as one of her most popular characters, Debbie Downer. The vibe-killing uber-pessimist bums out the tablemates at her cousin\u2019s wedding reception by bringing up coronavirus, #MeToo, feline Aids and, of course, Trump. It\u2019s a welcome return for the character and her accompanying foghorns, although as good as Dratch is, it\u2019s Thompson who steals the sketch with one perfectly delivered line, furiously asking a fellow tablemate who engages Debbie: \u201cNow why would you delve?!\u201d The Weeknd, sporting a bloody and battered face, performs his single Blinding Lights. On Weekend Update, Colin Jost ponders potential presidential debates between Biden and Donald Trump, predicting: \u201cThey\u2019ll be the first debates that have to be moderated by a Jamaican nurse.\u201d Michael Che doesn\u2019t care who wins the Democratic nomination so long as they beat Trump: \u201cDemocrats are like condoms. I use them because they\u2019re safer, I guess, but it don\u2019t feel good.\u201d Next, Craig rehearses his southern accent in preparation for his role as Detective Benoit Blanc in the recent hit Knives Out. He brings along his accent coach, Franklin Hughes (Beck Bennett), a mulletted, rhinestone-clad lunatic whose accent work is based entirely on cartoons like Yosemite Sam and Foghorn Leghorn. Bennett is great here, gyrating and ranting (mostly about \u201chot butts\u201d) and puking on cue. In Game Night, an awkward party guest (Heidi Gardner) suggests a group of friends play Quote, a simple game in which they guess movie quotes. She quickly hits it off with Craig\u2019s married host (a fellow movie buff, or \u201cflick daddy\u201d) over their shared ability to guess vague quotes such as \u201cHey, hi, I didn\u2019t know you were here\u201d (from Failure to Launch, obviously). It\u2019s all a bit awkward and jumbled \u2013 thanks mostly to McKinnon constantly breaking \u2013 but it has a weird energy that makes it one of the night\u2019s winners. The Weeknd \u2013 still sporting a broken mug \u2013 returns and debuts a moody new song (no title available as of yet). Overnight Salad is a poppy (and legitimately catchy) tune from Aidy Bryant\u2019s bubbly housewife about her salad recipe made from \u201cgallons of mayo\u201d, \u201cso many raisins\u201d, hot dogs, pizza, quarters and \u201cmore mayo\u201d. The towering end result horrifies her family and nearly kills the dog, before actually killing her once she takes a bite. Craig, solid throughout the episode, absolutely smashes it here with his furious and unhinged rant. The final sketch of the night, it\u2019s also by far the best.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s been a long, wet winter. Everybody has got colds, and now we are braced for a coronavirus epidemic. Boosting our immune system has rarely felt more urgent, but, beyond eating more tangerines and hoping for the best, what else can we do?</p> <p>Sheena Cruickshank, a professor of immunology at the University of Manchester, has a \u201cshocking cold\u201d when we speak at a safe distance, over the phone. To know how to take care of your immune system, she says, first you need to understand the weapons in your armoury \u2013 a cheeringly impressive collection, it turns out.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you come into contact with a germ you\u2019ve never met before,\u201d she says, \u201cyou\u2019ve got various barriers to try to stop it getting into your body.\u201d As well as skin, we have mucus \u2013 \u201csnot is a really important barrier\u201d \u2013 and a microbiome, the collective noun for the estimated 100tn microbes that live throughout our bodies, internally and externally. Some of these helpful bugs make antimicrobial chemicals and compete with pathogens for food and space.</p> <p>Beneath these writhing swamps of mucus and microbes, our bodies are lined with epithelial cells which, says Cruickshank, \u201care really hard to get through. They make antimicrobial products including, most relevant to coronavirus, antiviral compounds that are quite hostile.\u201d</p> <p>If a pathogen breaches these defences, it has to deal with our white blood cells, or immune cells. One type, called macrophages, inhabit all our body tissue and, says Cruickshank, \u201chave all these weapons ready to go, but they\u2019re not terribly precise\u201d. They report to the cleverer, adaptive white blood cells known as lymphocytes. They are the ones that remember germs, \u201cso if you meet that germ again,\u201d says Cruickshank, \u201cthey\u2019ll just deal with it probably without you even knowing. That\u2019s when you\u2019ve got immunity and is the basis of vaccination. It\u2019s trying to bypass all the early stuff and create the memory, so you don\u2019t have to be sick.\u201d</p> <p>Our immune systems may have blind spots. \u201cThis might mean that our immune response doesn\u2019t recognise certain bugs,\u201d she says, \u201cor the bugs have sneaky evasion strategies. Personally, my immune system is not necessarily very good at seeing colds.\u201d But a healthy lifestyle will ensure your defences are as good as they get.</p> <p>Seeing as our bodies contain more cells belonging to microbes, such as bacteria and yeasts, than human ones, let\u2019s start with the microbiome. \u201cWe live in a symbiotic relationship with our gut bacteria,\u201d says Prof Arne Akbar, the president of the British Society for Immunology and a professor at University College, London. \u201cHaving the right ones around, that we evolved with, is best for our health. Anything we do that alters that can be detrimental.\u201d</p> <p>Not only do our microbes form protective barriers, they also programme our immune systems. Animals bred with no microbiome have less well developed immune responses. Older people, and those with diseases that are characterised by inflammation, such as allergies, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes, tend to have less varied gut microbiomes.</p> <p>To feed your gut flora, Cruickshank recommends \u201ceating a more varied diet with lots of high-fibre foods\u201d. Being vegetarian isn\u2019t a prerequisite for microbiome health, but the more plant foods you consume, the better. \u201cThe microbiome really likes fibre, pulses and fermented foods,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>Kefir yoghurt and pickles such as sauerkraut and kimchi are among the fermented delicacies now fashionable thanks to our increasing knowledge of the microbiome. But the evidence for taking probiotic supplements, she says, \u201cis mixed\u201d. It\u2019s not a dead cert that they will survive the journey through your digestive tract, or that they will hang around long enough if they do. \u201cIt\u2019s more effective to change your diet,\u201d says Cruickshank.</p> <p>The skin microbiome is important, too, but we know less about it. High doses of ultraviolet light (usually from the sun) can affect it negatively, weakening any protective functions (as well as triggering immune suppression in the skin itself). Overwashing with strong soaps and using antibacterial products is not friendly to our skin microbiomes. \u201cCombinations of perfumes and moisturisers might well also have an effect,\u201d says Cruickshank.</p> <p>To be immunologically fit, you need to be physically fit. \u201cWhite blood cells can be quite sedentary,\u201d says Akbar. \u201cExercise mobilises them by increasing your blood flow, so they can do their surveillance jobs and seek and destroy in other parts of the body.\u201d The NHS says adults should be physically active in some way every day, and do at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity (hiking, gardening, cycling) or 75 minutes of vigorous activity (running, swimming fast, an aerobics class).</p> <p>The advice for older people, who are more vulnerable to infection, is to do whatever exercise is possible. \u201cAnything\u2019s better than nothing,\u201d says Akbar. But a lifetime\u2019s exercise could significantly slow your immune system declining with age. In 2018, a <a href=\"https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/latest/2018/03/regular-exercise-slows-down-ageing.aspx\" title=\"\">study</a> by University of Birmingham and King\u2019s College London found that 125 non-smoking amateur cyclists aged 55 to 79 still had the immune systems of young people.</p> <p>The other side of the coin, says Akbar, \u201cis elite athletes who become very susceptible to infections because you can exercise to a point where it has a negative impact on your immune system.\u201d This problem is unlikely to affect most of us unless, says Cruickshank, \u201cyou\u2019re a couch potato and suddenly try and run a marathon, this could introduce stress hormones and be quite bad for your immune system\u201d.</p> <p>One of the many happy side-effects of exercise is that it reduces stress, which is next on our list of immune-boosting priorities. Stress hormones such as cortisol can compromise immune function, a common example of which, says Akbar, is when chickenpox strikes twice. If you have had it, the virus never completely goes away. \u201cDuring periods of stress,\u201d he says, \u201cit can reactivate again and we get shingles.\u201d</p> <p>Forget boozing through the coronavirus crisis, because heavy drinking also depletes our immune cells. \u201cSome studies have suggested that the first-line-of-defence macrophages are not as effective in people who have had a lot of alcohol,\u201d says Cruickshank. \u201cAnd there\u2019s been suggestions that high alcohol consumption can lead to a reduction of the lymphocytes as well. So if the bug gets into you, you\u2019re not going to be as good at containing and fighting it off.\u201d</p> <p>Cruickshank says that vitamin D has become a hot topic in immunology. \u201cIt is used by our macrophages, and is something that people in Britain can get quite low on in the winter.\u201d Necking extra vitamin C, however, is probably a waste of time for well-fed westerners. It\u2019s not that vitamin C isn\u2019t crucial to immune function (and other things, such as bone structure). \u201cAll the vitamins are important,\u201d says Cruickshank, \u201cbut vitamin C is water soluble, it\u2019s not one that your body stores.\u201d Eating your five a day of fruits and vegetables is the best way to maintain necessary levels.</p> <p>Exercising and eating well will have the likely knock-on effect of helping you sleep better, which is a bonus because a tired body is more susceptible to bugs. One <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324432\" title=\"\">study</a> last year found that lack of sleep impaired the disease-fighting ability of a type of lymphocyte called T cells, and research is demonstrating the importance of our natural biorhythms overall.</p> <p>Janet Lord, a professor at the University of Birmingham, recently showed that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/apr/26/morning-flu-jabs-could-save-thousands-of-lives-study-suggests\" title=\"\">vaccinating people</a> in the morning is more effective than doing so in the afternoon. \u201cYour natural biorhythms are, to some extent, dictated by sleep,\u201d says Akbar. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a regular sleep pattern, you have natural body rhythms and everything\u2019s fine. If they go out of kilter, then you\u2019ve got problems.\u201d</p> <p>The seriousness of an infection largely depends on the dose you are hit with, which could in turn depend on how contagious the carrier is when they cough near you. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly exposed to germs, and we only get sick from a handful of those,\u201d says Cruickshank.</p> <p>If you\u2019re reasonably young and healthy, says Akbar, the mild benefits you may achieve from being extra good probably won\u2019t fend off a severe dose of coronavirus or flu. The likely scenario if you catch the infection is, he says, \u201cyou\u2019ll be sick for a while and you will recover\u201d.</p> <p>From a public-health perspective, when nasty viruses such as coronavirus are doing the rounds, Akbar\u2019s priority is not boosting already healthy people\u2019s immune systems, \u201cbut protecting the vulnerable people. Older people don\u2019t respond that well to the flu jab, though it\u2019s better for them to have it than not. It\u2019s a general problem of immune decline with ageing.\u201d</p> <p>When we get older, he says, the barrier function in the gut doesn\u2019t work that well, \u201cso you have something called leaky gut syndrome, where bugs creep into our bodies causing mild infections\u201d. This causes inflammation around the body, as does the natural accumulation of old \u201czombie\u201d cells, called senescent cells, and inflammation compromises the immune response.</p> <p>Akbar is working on developing drug treatments to reduce inflammation in older people but they are a way off yet. Age 65 is when, medically, one is considered older, \u201cbut that\u2019s arbitrary\u201d, says Akbar. \u201cSome old people might get problems much earlier. And there are older people who are totally healthy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of coronavirus,\u201d says Cruickshank, \u201cit\u2019s mostly spread by droplet transmission, as far as we can tell, so the biggest thing is hygiene.\u201d So wash your hands, and sneeze and cough into tissues, she suggests, between sniffles. No one can completely avoid getting sick, not even top immunologists.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been a long, wet winter. Everybody has got colds, and now we are braced for a coronavirus epidemic. Boosting our immune system has rarely felt more urgent, but, beyond eating more tangerines and hoping for the best, what else can we do? Sheena Cruickshank, a professor of immunology at the University of Manchester, has a \u201cshocking cold\u201d when we speak at a safe distance, over the phone. To know how to take care of your immune system, she says, first you need to understand the weapons in your armoury \u2013 a cheeringly impressive collection, it turns out. \u201cWhen you come into contact with a germ you\u2019ve never met before,\u201d she says, \u201cyou\u2019ve got various barriers to try to stop it getting into your body.\u201d As well as skin, we have mucus \u2013 \u201csnot is a really important barrier\u201d \u2013 and a microbiome, the collective noun for the estimated 100tn microbes that live throughout our bodies, internally and externally. Some of these helpful bugs make antimicrobial chemicals and compete with pathogens for food and space. Beneath these writhing swamps of mucus and microbes, our bodies are lined with epithelial cells which, says Cruickshank, \u201care really hard to get through. They make antimicrobial products including, most relevant to coronavirus, antiviral compounds that are quite hostile.\u201d If a pathogen breaches these defences, it has to deal with our white blood cells, or immune cells. One type, called macrophages, inhabit all our body tissue and, says Cruickshank, \u201chave all these weapons ready to go, but they\u2019re not terribly precise\u201d. They report to the cleverer, adaptive white blood cells known as lymphocytes. They are the ones that remember germs, \u201cso if you meet that germ again,\u201d says Cruickshank, \u201cthey\u2019ll just deal with it probably without you even knowing. That\u2019s when you\u2019ve got immunity and is the basis of vaccination. It\u2019s trying to bypass all the early stuff and create the memory, so you don\u2019t have to be sick.\u201d Our immune systems may have blind spots. \u201cThis might mean that our immune response doesn\u2019t recognise certain bugs,\u201d she says, \u201cor the bugs have sneaky evasion strategies. Personally, my immune system is not necessarily very good at seeing colds.\u201d But a healthy lifestyle will ensure your defences are as good as they get. Seeing as our bodies contain more cells belonging to microbes, such as bacteria and yeasts, than human ones, let\u2019s start with the microbiome. \u201cWe live in a symbiotic relationship with our gut bacteria,\u201d says Prof Arne Akbar, the president of the British Society for Immunology and a professor at University College, London. \u201cHaving the right ones around, that we evolved with, is best for our health. Anything we do that alters that can be detrimental.\u201d Not only do our microbes form protective barriers, they also programme our immune systems. Animals bred with no microbiome have less well developed immune responses. Older people, and those with diseases that are characterised by inflammation, such as allergies, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes, tend to have less varied gut microbiomes. To feed your gut flora, Cruickshank recommends \u201ceating a more varied diet with lots of high-fibre foods\u201d. Being vegetarian isn\u2019t a prerequisite for microbiome health, but the more plant foods you consume, the better. \u201cThe microbiome really likes fibre, pulses and fermented foods,\u201d she adds. Kefir yoghurt and pickles such as sauerkraut and kimchi are among the fermented delicacies now fashionable thanks to our increasing knowledge of the microbiome. But the evidence for taking probiotic supplements, she says, \u201cis mixed\u201d. It\u2019s not a dead cert that they will survive the journey through your digestive tract, or that they will hang around long enough if they do. \u201cIt\u2019s more effective to change your diet,\u201d says Cruickshank. The skin microbiome is important, too, but we know less about it. High doses of ultraviolet light (usually from the sun) can affect it negatively, weakening any protective functions (as well as triggering immune suppression in the skin itself). Overwashing with strong soaps and using antibacterial products is not friendly to our skin microbiomes. \u201cCombinations of perfumes and moisturisers might well also have an effect,\u201d says Cruickshank. To be immunologically fit, you need to be physically fit. \u201cWhite blood cells can be quite sedentary,\u201d says Akbar. \u201cExercise mobilises them by increasing your blood flow, so they can do their surveillance jobs and seek and destroy in other parts of the body.\u201d The NHS says adults should be physically active in some way every day, and do at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity (hiking, gardening, cycling) or 75 minutes of vigorous activity (running, swimming fast, an aerobics class). The advice for older people, who are more vulnerable to infection, is to do whatever exercise is possible. \u201cAnything\u2019s better than nothing,\u201d says Akbar. But a lifetime\u2019s exercise could significantly slow your immune system declining with age. In 2018, a study by University of Birmingham and King\u2019s College London found that 125 non-smoking amateur cyclists aged 55 to 79 still had the immune systems of young people. The other side of the coin, says Akbar, \u201cis elite athletes who become very susceptible to infections because you can exercise to a point where it has a negative impact on your immune system.\u201d This problem is unlikely to affect most of us unless, says Cruickshank, \u201cyou\u2019re a couch potato and suddenly try and run a marathon, this could introduce stress hormones and be quite bad for your immune system\u201d. One of the many happy side-effects of exercise is that it reduces stress, which is next on our list of immune-boosting priorities. Stress hormones such as cortisol can compromise immune function, a common example of which, says Akbar, is when chickenpox strikes twice. If you have had it, the virus never completely goes away. \u201cDuring periods of stress,\u201d he says, \u201cit can reactivate again and we get shingles.\u201d Forget boozing through the coronavirus crisis, because heavy drinking also depletes our immune cells. \u201cSome studies have suggested that the first-line-of-defence macrophages are not as effective in people who have had a lot of alcohol,\u201d says Cruickshank. \u201cAnd there\u2019s been suggestions that high alcohol consumption can lead to a reduction of the lymphocytes as well. So if the bug gets into you, you\u2019re not going to be as good at containing and fighting it off.\u201d Cruickshank says that vitamin D has become a hot topic in immunology. \u201cIt is used by our macrophages, and is something that people in Britain can get quite low on in the winter.\u201d Necking extra vitamin C, however, is probably a waste of time for well-fed westerners. It\u2019s not that vitamin C isn\u2019t crucial to immune function (and other things, such as bone structure). \u201cAll the vitamins are important,\u201d says Cruickshank, \u201cbut vitamin C is water soluble, it\u2019s not one that your body stores.\u201d Eating your five a day of fruits and vegetables is the best way to maintain necessary levels. Exercising and eating well will have the likely knock-on effect of helping you sleep better, which is a bonus because a tired body is more susceptible to bugs. One study last year found that lack of sleep impaired the disease-fighting ability of a type of lymphocyte called T cells, and research is demonstrating the importance of our natural biorhythms overall. Janet Lord, a professor at the University of Birmingham, recently showed that vaccinating people in the morning is more effective than doing so in the afternoon. \u201cYour natural biorhythms are, to some extent, dictated by sleep,\u201d says Akbar. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a regular sleep pattern, you have natural body rhythms and everything\u2019s fine. If they go out of kilter, then you\u2019ve got problems.\u201d The seriousness of an infection largely depends on the dose you are hit with, which could in turn depend on how contagious the carrier is when they cough near you. \u201cWe\u2019re constantly exposed to germs, and we only get sick from a handful of those,\u201d says Cruickshank. If you\u2019re reasonably young and healthy, says Akbar, the mild benefits you may achieve from being extra good probably won\u2019t fend off a severe dose of coronavirus or flu. The likely scenario if you catch the infection is, he says, \u201cyou\u2019ll be sick for a while and you will recover\u201d. From a public-health perspective, when nasty viruses such as coronavirus are doing the rounds, Akbar\u2019s priority is not boosting already healthy people\u2019s immune systems, \u201cbut protecting the vulnerable people. Older people don\u2019t respond that well to the flu jab, though it\u2019s better for them to have it than not. It\u2019s a general problem of immune decline with ageing.\u201d When we get older, he says, the barrier function in the gut doesn\u2019t work that well, \u201cso you have something called leaky gut syndrome, where bugs creep into our bodies causing mild infections\u201d. This causes inflammation around the body, as does the natural accumulation of old \u201czombie\u201d cells, called senescent cells, and inflammation compromises the immune response. Akbar is working on developing drug treatments to reduce inflammation in older people but they are a way off yet. Age 65 is when, medically, one is considered older, \u201cbut that\u2019s arbitrary\u201d, says Akbar. \u201cSome old people might get problems much earlier. And there are older people who are totally healthy.\u201d \u201cIn terms of coronavirus,\u201d says Cruickshank, \u201cit\u2019s mostly spread by droplet transmission, as far as we can tell, so the biggest thing is hygiene.\u201d So wash your hands, and sneeze and cough into tissues, she suggests, between sniffles. No one can completely avoid getting sick, not even top immunologists.",

      "body": "<p>It has taken until the last year of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency for the existential risk this narcissistic authoritarian poses to be fully exposed. There have been other tests: the unconstitutional squeezing of immigration; the brief week or so when war with Iran felt inevitable; the imprisoning of children in cages along the United States\u2019 southern border; not to mention the engagement with foreign governments in seeking personal gain. But it is the arrival of Covid-19, the infectious respiratory virus, that threatens a presidency reliant on a strategy of all narrative and no truth.</p> <p>Trump has a core support base of people who are most vulnerable to Covid-19. Older people \u2013 particularly those who might resist taking the kind of interventionist measures being suggested \u2013 are very much at risk. Trump may have to halt his famous rallies in the middle of election season. More alien to him even than that, if containment of the virus is ever going to work he will have to build a good-faith alliance with the press to push out a unified and coherent message.</p> <p>Recent epidemics such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/26/flu-pandemic-flu\" title=\"\">H1N1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sars\" title=\"\">Sars</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/sep/15/mers-next-global-pandemic\" title=\"\">Mers</a> \u2013 none of which reached the spread or numbers of Covid-19 \u2013 showed that frequent, accurate press coverage and information is a central part of effective response. When Sars appeared as the first pandemic of the 21st century, Hong Kong was thrown into a state of panic by a 14-year-old school pupil who spread a false rumour that the city was being placed under quarantine. His method was to mimic a local newspaper website, in tactics which are still favoured by disinformation campaigns today.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/05/trump-coronavirus-who-global-death-rate-false-number\">Trump calls WHO's global death rate from coronavirus 'a false number'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Vietnam was struck by a measles outbreak in 2014, citizens became frustrated by the lack of information and started organising and protesting on Facebook.

America might be about to find out.</p> <p>From the moment Trump pointed his finger and roared \u201cYou\u2019re fake news\u201d at journalists attending his first press conference in January 2017, the president has bludgeoned away at the credibility of mainstream news and dispensed with a necessity for the truth. Now, in an election year, with the appearance of a fast-moving epidemic that can only be contained by the speedy transmission of reliable information, Trump\u2019s tactical warfare on the media could finally catch up with him.</p> <p>Studies have shown that reliable news and information during an epidemic can help to change behaviour and limit the spread of disease. The importance of an alignment in openness and accuracy between health agencies, governments and the media can be measured in lives saved.</p> <p>So broken, however, is the relationship of the US presidency to the truth that even when, on Fox News, Trump relayed accurately that the death rate from the disease was likely to be lower than the 3.4% of reported cases thus far, the press jumped on what they perceived as an attempt to improve a dire picture.</p> <p>In his first Covid-19 press conference last month, Trump rambled around the subject, suggesting the infection was like the flu, that the administration was doing \u201can incredible job\u201d and that one day the virus \u201cwas going to disappear\u201d. A week later, 11 people were dead, a hundred more cases confirmed, more than 2,700 people were quarantined in New York and entire school districts in the Pacific north-west had been closed, at least in part because of the government\u2019s unpreparedness.</p> <p>The trail of incompetence includes a lack of testing at ports of entry, a bungled quarantine operation for infected cruise passengers, a shortage of testing kits, and an epidemic task force that had been assembled by Barack Obama\u2019s government only to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/04/donald-trump-obama-administration-coronavirus\" title=\"\">disbanded and fired by Trump</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/trump-coronavirus-cuts-robert-reich\">Coronavirus is bad enough \u2013 Trump's cuts have made the danger far worse | Robert Reich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From the overly dense and difficult-to-navigate Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, to the confusing press conferences, the US government\u2019s official media response has been endangeringly poor.

      "bodyText": "It has taken until the last year of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency for the existential risk this narcissistic authoritarian poses to be fully exposed. There have been other tests: the unconstitutional squeezing of immigration; the brief week or so when war with Iran felt inevitable; the imprisoning of children in cages along the United States\u2019 southern border; not to mention the engagement with foreign governments in seeking personal gain. But it is the arrival of Covid-19, the infectious respiratory virus, that threatens a presidency reliant on a strategy of all narrative and no truth. Trump has a core support base of people who are most vulnerable to Covid-19. Older people \u2013 particularly those who might resist taking the kind of interventionist measures being suggested \u2013 are very much at risk. Trump may have to halt his famous rallies in the middle of election season. More alien to him even than that, if containment of the virus is ever going to work he will have to build a good-faith alliance with the press to push out a unified and coherent message. Recent epidemics such as H1N1, Sars and Mers \u2013 none of which reached the spread or numbers of Covid-19 \u2013 showed that frequent, accurate press coverage and information is a central part of effective response. When Sars appeared as the first pandemic of the 21st century, Hong Kong was thrown into a state of panic by a 14-year-old school pupil who spread a false rumour that the city was being placed under quarantine. His method was to mimic a local newspaper website, in tactics which are still favoured by disinformation campaigns today. When Vietnam was struck by a measles outbreak in 2014, citizens became frustrated by the lack of information and started organising and protesting on Facebook. At the beginning of the current coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China, whistleblowers were punished and citizen journalists who tried to report from within the city were arrested for allegedly spreading false information. A draconian crackdown that effectively contained the virus might have been avoided with an earlier and clearer picture of what was happening. So how does a government manage a health crisis when it has persistently persuaded people to distrust the press? America might be about to find out. From the moment Trump pointed his finger and roared \u201cYou\u2019re fake news\u201d at journalists attending his first press conference in January 2017, the president has bludgeoned away at the credibility of mainstream news and dispensed with a necessity for the truth. Now, in an election year, with the appearance of a fast-moving epidemic that can only be contained by the speedy transmission of reliable information, Trump\u2019s tactical warfare on the media could finally catch up with him. Studies have shown that reliable news and information during an epidemic can help to change behaviour and limit the spread of disease. The importance of an alignment in openness and accuracy between health agencies, governments and the media can be measured in lives saved. So broken, however, is the relationship of the US presidency to the truth that even when, on Fox News, Trump relayed accurately that the death rate from the disease was likely to be lower than the 3.4% of reported cases thus far, the press jumped on what they perceived as an attempt to improve a dire picture. In his first Covid-19 press conference last month, Trump rambled around the subject, suggesting the infection was like the flu, that the administration was doing \u201can incredible job\u201d and that one day the virus \u201cwas going to disappear\u201d. A week later, 11 people were dead, a hundred more cases confirmed, more than 2,700 people were quarantined in New York and entire school districts in the Pacific north-west had been closed, at least in part because of the government\u2019s unpreparedness. The trail of incompetence includes a lack of testing at ports of entry, a bungled quarantine operation for infected cruise passengers, a shortage of testing kits, and an epidemic task force that had been assembled by Barack Obama\u2019s government only to be disbanded and fired by Trump. From the overly dense and difficult-to-navigate Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, to the confusing press conferences, the US government\u2019s official media response has been endangeringly poor. By contrast, the World Health Organization\u2019s daily briefings, including its social media presence (it even has a large following on TikTok), provide a useful source of information, as do university research websites and some regional governments. For the press, coronavirus is its own test. The riveting circus of the Democratic primaries has absorbed the national news in the drama and spectacle of a wide and historically diverse field being whittled down to two elderly white men, Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, duelling for the privilege of challenging another elderly white man for the presidency. But the heat of the race inevitably cools as shelves empty of goods and travel restrictions throttle both the economy and the population. The national US press now has a duty to deliver consistent, accurate information, in a fractured media landscape, to many different audiences \u2013 and where it matters most, at the local level, on limited resources. What threatens to be an \u201cinfodemic\u201d of incorrect or partial information, hoaxes and panic-inducing coverage adds to the burden of responsible reporters in both correcting and quashing the mass of misconceptions. Epidemiologists traditionally relied on news reporting to help identify and model how cases spread during epidemics, and for the most part this means local news. News organisations such as the Seattle Times dropped their paywall and went into overdrive reporting on the centre of the west coast outbreak; but for other communities where there are fewer or no local reporting organisations, relaying timely and detailed messages will be more challenging.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson will decide whether to bring in tougher measures to delay the spread of coronavirus on Monday, after the number of British cases increased by a third to 278 and the number of deaths in the UK rose to three. The prime minister is to chair his first emergency Cobra meeting on the virus since last Monday, which will look at possible measures if the UK formally moves from trying to contain the outbreak to delaying its impact. The government\u2019s coronavirus plan, published last week, included suggestions such as social distancing and increased home working at the milder end of the spectrum, to cancelling mass-attendance events and cutting back on essential police and fire services at the more extreme end. The UK saw its biggest one-day increase in coronavirus cases on Sunday, with 69 new cases confirmed. A man in his 60s, who had underlying health problems, became the third patient to die after testing positive for Covid-19 in the UK. The man, who died at North Manchester general hospital, had recently returned from Italy, NHS England said. As the government prepared emergency legislation to allow some court proceedings to be heard by phone or video, GPs warned that hospitals would have to cut back on work not related to coronavirus in order to tackle the outbreak. Ahead of the Cobra meeting, Johnson insisted the UK was \u201cwell-prepared and will continue to make decisions to protect the public based on the latest scientific advice\u201d. \u201cTackling coronavirus will require a national and international effort. I am confident the British people are ready to play their part in that,\u201d he said. \u201cThe most valuable thing people can do is wash their hands with soap and water for 20 seconds.\u201d The government is considering plans to let more people volunteer in the NHS, and the health service said it had already trained about 500 additional initial call responders to help deal with increased demand for the 111 service. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the government would do \u201ceverything in its power\u201d to delay and mitigate the coronavirus threat as he set out plans contained in emergency legislation to deal with the impact of the virus. The bill, which is likely to go through parliament by the end of the month, is expected to include measures to allow some court proceedings to be conducted via telephone or video. The news came as 32 people who had been aboard a cruise ship in Japan were released from quarantine in Wirral, and two people who had recently returned to Wales from Italy tested positive for the illness. The Foreign Office said it was \u201cworking intensively\u201d with US authorities to arrange a flight for British nationals on the coronavirus-hit Grand Princess cruise ship, which is due to arrive in Oakland, California, on Monday. A healthcare worker at University Hospital Southampton NHS foundation trust has tested positive for coronavirus. The surgical high-dependency unit, where the person worked a single nightshift on Friday, has been temporarily closed to new admissions as a result. Prof Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, warned that the Covid-19 outbreak was a \u201csignificant crisis\u201d for the health service but said that estimates that 100,000 could die were a \u201cworst-case scenario\u201d. \u201cIf we are going to try to continue doing what we are doing at the health service and tackle coronavirus, it will require a significant amount of resources,\u201d he told Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday. \u201cI expect we will cut down in terms of the other work we do.\u201d Marshall welcomed plans to call upon recently retired doctors to expand the workforce. He said: \u201cI think it is a good idea as long as we do it carefully \u2026 and people are estimating that 20% of the workforce might be out of action at any one time when the crisis reaches its peak \u2013 people are talking about some time in late April for that. If that happens, then we do need to expand the workforce in whatever way we can.\u201d World Health Organization representative Dr Margaret Harris warned that government must ensure that supporting health workers is their \u201cnumber one priority\u201d. She said: \u201cThey need backup, they need other people to come and do the shifts. If they\u2019re working massively, they are tremendously at risk.\u201d Asked if army field hospitals could play a role in the response to the coronavirus outbreak, Harris said: \u201cCertainly the army has great experience of putting up field hospitals. I\u2019ve worked on Ebola and I\u2019ve seen what the British army can do. It\u2019s quite incredible. \u201cSo this is the sort of planning you should be thinking about. Can you set up a field hospital? Where do you set it up? What equipment have you got and what staff have you got and how can you protect everybody working in those conditions?\u201d Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has promised to give the NHS \u201cwhatever it needs\u201d to tackle the coronavirus crisis, as he looks at loosening the fiscal rules to allow for more borrowing and spending ahead of this week\u2019s budget. The Scottish first minister and SNP leader, Nicola Sturgeon, told Ridge it was \u201cpretty much inevitable that we will need additional resources\u201d in the NHS to cope with coronavirus. A total of 18 people have tested positive for the virus in Scotland. Government figures released on Sunday morning revealed 64 new coronavirus cases in the UK, with more than 23,513 people tested as of 9am. A further five cases were reported as Sunday wore on. Three people had died as of Sunday night. Prof Tom Solomon at the Walton Centre NHS foundation trust said that this increase was \u201cnot really unexpected\u201d because \u201cit is likely that the number of cases in this country is going to double every few days\u201d. On Sunday, NHS England announced that 32 people have been given an all-clear for coronavirus after being held in isolation in Wirral after returning from the Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan. The group \u2013 made up of 30 Britons and two Irish people \u2013 had been held in quarantine since last month after the ship became a breeding ground for the virus. Seven people, including one UK citizen, who had been aboard the ship have died so far. Two further patients in Wales also tested positive for coronavirus after returning from northern Italy.",

The UK\u2019s post-Brexit membership of Erasmus is likely to hinge on the EU\u2019s stance on the cost of continuing membership, and whether the EU ties it to another top priority: continued access for UK universities to the EU\u2019s Horizon 2020 research programme, which is worth billions of euros. Losing access to either the Horizon or Erasmus programmes would be a further blow for universities struggling with student recruitment difficulties, including potentially huge losses in international tuition fees caused by the coronavirus disruption. A new report by the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) also suggests that the UK government will struggle to meet its targets for national research spending if universities suffer cuts to domestic or international fee income. \u201cIf the UK university sector is to continue thriving, then it is crucial that the chancellor recognises the interdependencies between teaching and research in the budget and subsequent spending review,\u201d said Nick Hillman, the HEPI\u2019s director and the author of the report. \u201cUniversities roughly break even on teaching home students but make a big loss on research. They fill in part of that gap from the surplus on teaching international students. But they now face a looming large loss on teaching home students, for example because of tweaks to tuition fees in England. If that happens, they will have to use international student fees to subsidise home students and there will be less money for covering gaps in research funding.\u201d",

Rishi Sunak has a history of staying up all night worrying about his charges\u2019 financial wellbeing. The new chancellor, who is preparing to deliver his first budget this week, is now running a \u00a32tn economy in which every member of the country has a stake. But the 39-year-old claims that mere hundred-million-pound decisions once caused him sleepless nights in his former life as a hedge fund manager, as he attempted to stem his clients\u2019 losses during the financial crisis. The stress Sunak admits to during his time in the City is instructive as \u2013 alongside Star Wars films, former Southampton football Matthew Le Tissier and Yorkshire Tea \u2013 the chancellor says finance is among his main loves. \u201cYou are highly accountable.

Tellingly, the paper was full of references to what is now called \u201clevelling up\u201d and entitled The Free Ports Opportunity: how Brexit could boost trade, manufacturing and the north. The north was by then an obvious focus, after Sunak had won the former seat of another former Tory rising star \u2013 William Hague\u2019s Richmond in North Yorkshire \u2013 where Sunak has joked that his family now accounted for the constituency\u2019s entire intake of immigrants.

The whole of Lombardy, including the financial capital of Milan, and 14 provinces across the worst-affected northern regions, have been shut down until 3 April as Italy grapples to contain the spread of a virus as deaths rose from 233 to 366, a rise of more than 50% in 24 hours, with the total number of cases so far at 7,375.

There is little margin for error as the race for fourth and fifth hots up, with Sheffield United, Wolves, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal and even 10th-placed Burnley among those jostling for European berths. Chelsea have won just one of their past six matches and were unconvincing at Bournemouth last weekend, when Lampard lamented Marcos Alonso again proving the saviour but they will surely be beaming with confidence after Barkley helped them to turnover the best team in the country on Tuesday.</p> <p><strong>Kick-off: </strong>2pm (GMT)</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-08T13:28:03.311Z\">at 1.28pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Read Jacob Steinberg\u2019s match report: Now, do join Simon Burnton for the Manchester derby: Some Chelsea reaction from Billy Gilmour, who was ruddy brilliant in midfield on his league debut. \u201cIt was amazing, a dream come true to make my full debut in the Premier League on my debut. I found out I was playing this morning in the team meeting.\u201d Giroud adds: \u201cHe\u2019s done very well again today, he\u2019s got a great maturity and he\u2019s got a nice future in front of him if he stays like that.\u201d After making so many positive strides in recent weeks, this afternoon Everton were absolutely atrocious from start to finish. In the end the scoreline almost flattered Everton, but try telling that to Carlo Ancelotti, who has just suffered his joint-heaviest league defeat as a manager, with this equalling a 4-0 defeat against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid as Real Madrid manager in February 2015. Kevin Friend finally puts Everton out of their misery. A resounding victory for Chelsea, with Mount, Pedro, Willian and then Giroud on the scoresheet. Ross Barkley was brilliant against his former club, while Billy Gilmour again belied his years with a masterful, mature performance in midfield. The 18-year-old oozes class. Chelsea remain fourth, within a point of third-placed Leicester. 90+2 min: ... Michael Keane heads clear Reece James\u2019s free-kick. 90+1 min: Holgate is booked for something of a reducer on the teenage substitute Broja. Chelsea get another opportunity to whip the ball into the box ... 90 min: There will be three added minutes. Chelsea are knocking the ball around for fun, the home crowd very much lapping it up. Everton? Not so much. 88 min: Chelsea are coasting. 86 min: Olivier Giroud is withdrawn to a standing ovation and receives a warm embrace from his manager, Frank Lampard. On in Giroud\u2019s place is the 18-year-old forward Armando Broja, who enters for his Premier League debut. 84 min: Pickford, who has been horribly exposed by some dreadful Everton defending, pulls off another save, this time to prevent C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta from getting in on the act. Again, it was Barkley at the heart of things, with the midfielder stroking the ball across to the Chelsea skipper, who arrowed a shot towards a crevice of Pickford\u2019s goal. But the Everton goalkeeper was alert and pushed the ball to safety. Pickford\u2019s goal has been peppered. 81 min: Chelsea should have added a fifth, but Djibril Sidib\u00e9 intervenes in the nick of time, just as Tino Anjorin was about to pull the trigger. Anjorin was slid in by the brilliant Billy Gilmour, who has been masterful in midfield. Anjorin is clean through on goal but dallied a little and that allowed the Everton defender to steal in. Gilmour had easily brushed a tired Andr\u00e9 Gomes aside. 78 min: Kepa smothers after Everton break! Reece James superbly blocks Richarlison\u2019s effort after the ball dropped in the 18-yard box. The ball cannoned to Djibril Sidib\u00e9, who played a marvellous through ball into Walcott. The Everton substitute delivered a low cross into the six-yard box but the Chelsea goalkeeper was on hand to gobble it up and take the sting out of a rare attack. 76 min: Dominic Calvert-Lewin is replaced by 19-year-old Everton academy graduate Anthony Gordon. Calvert-Lewin, like the rest of the Everton side, has had an off day. 72 min: Anjorin wellies one into Row L with his first touch! 71 min: Willian is withdrawn after a decent day\u2019s work; Willian has been directly involved in 10 goals in the Premier League this season (five goals and five assists);, one more than he managed in the whole of last season in the competition. The 18-year-old Tino Anjorin, wearing the No 55, is on for his league debut. 68 min: Everton supporters jeered Ross Barkley\u2019s every breath at the start of this mismatch, but the Chelsea midfielder has certainly had the last laugh, weighing in with two assists, and he almost helped himself to a goal a moment ago, firing a low drive at Pickford from an acute angle. Barkley, Gilmour and Mount, who has since departed as a precaution, have won the midfield battle 10 times over, totally nullifying Sigurdsson and co. 65 min: Sigurdsson flashes in a cross , Kepa flaps it and it drops in the six-yard box ... but the assistant referee flags to indicate the ball had gone out of play; replays show the ball flickered out of play. Indeed, so Chelsea launch the subsequent goal-kick upfield. 62 min: Barkley slips in Gilmour, who darts into a pocket of space unmarked. He tries to pick out Pedro, but Everton clear the ball for a corner. R\u00fcdiger meets it but his header canons into Giroud. 59 min: Mount is withdrawn after picking up a knock at the start of this second half. He gets a hearty reception, walking off untroubled to be replaced by wing-back Reece James. 58 min: Kean replaced Tom Davies a moment ago. 57 min: Pickford denies Pedro! Willian rushes towards the byline, cuts the ball back for Barkley \u2013 who appears to be fouled in the box by Sidib\u00e9 \u2013 but it runs kindly for the winger. Pedro lets fly and Pickford requires two hands to palm the ball beyond his right post. It\u2019s a case of damage limitation for Everton at present. 56 min: Doesn\u2019t look like Walcott\u2019s introduction nor Ancelotti\u2019s half-time team-talk has had the desired effect. Meanwhile, a bit of housekeeping: Andr\u00e9 Gomes picked up a booking a moment ago for dissent. Ancelotti is readying another change, with 20-year-old Moise Kean stripped and ready for action. Chelsea are having a field day. Giroud applies the finishing touch after eluding Holgate and Sigurdsson at the back post. It stemmed from a well-worked corner, with Willian playing a simple give-and-go with Gilmour. When Willian received possession back, he whipped in a first-time cross towards Giroud, who did the rest. 53 min: Pedro scoops over after good work by Giroud! A rocket from distance by Willian. Barkley nudges the ball across to the Brazilian, who is beckoned to shoot by Digne and Holgate, neither of whom charge him down. Invited to take aim, Willian wellies it into the bottom corner from 20 yards. 47 min: A touch of class from Mason Mount, who toys with Djibril Sidib\u00e9 and Tom Davies before coolly laying the ball off. Mount jinked past the latter with ease. Everton are seeing a bit more of the ball but, other than that, Chelsea are still very much in pole position. Walcott is yet to have a whiff. 46 min: Theo Walcott replaces Bernard at the break. Goals by Mason Mount and Pedro give a commanding Chelsea a deserved lead. Everton have been very accommodating, lukewarm at best. Food for thought for Ancelotti but Frank Lampard will be delighted by his team\u2019s bossy performance. Billy Gilmour, Ross Barkley and Mount have been running midfield. \u201cSomething I\u2019m noticing about Gilmour is that he drops so deep to get the ball,\u201d emails Adam Kline-Schoder. \u201cThe de Jong-esque dynamism of that movement seems to be dragging one Everton midfielder forward and out of position, thus leaving Mount and Barkley to team up on the remaining one to dominate and link play through the midfield. There\u2019s a lot of promising balance in that midfield ... although Everton have, as you\u2019ve said, made it awfully easy for them.\u201d 45 min: There will be one added minute for Everton to endure. 44 min: Right on cue, Willian gifts the ball to Calvert-Lewin, leading to a sea of groans around Stamford Bridge, but Chelsea survive. Willian quickly raises his right hand to apologise. He knows he almost landed his team in the muck. 41 min: Sidib\u00e9 is not having his best game in an Everton shirt. Giroud wins a header to flick the ball on, allowing Willian to pile pressure on the Everton defender. Sidib\u00e9 seems to have the upper hand but then the Brazilian gets across the right-back to make life difficult, blocking his pass upfield. Clever play by Giroud and fine defensive work by Willian, who normally wreaks havoc in the opposite direction. Ancelotti and co just want half-time now. 39 min: ... Everton clear their lines, but from the subsequent goal-kick Andr\u00e9 Gomes gets off the hook after dawdling on the ball 25 yards from his own goal. Giroud was sniffing around and the striker nicked possession from the Everton midfielder, but the referee Kevin Friend deemed his challenge a little overzealous. That sums up Everton\u2019s toils this half, in truth. 37 min: Pedro crosses for Giroud, but the striker ends up on the turf, adamant that Mason Holgate hauled him to the floor. It looked a little clumsy by the Everton defender, who was at play with the dark arts. Moments before that, Giroud had a tame shot saved by Pickford. Everton have been dire, and now they have a corner to defend after Holgate clears Pedro\u2019s cross from the left ... 34 min: Moments before Chelsea wasted that free-kick, Ancelotti pulled Tom Davies over for a quick word. The Italian seemed to be signalling for a change of system. To say Everton have been overrun in midfield would be an understatement. Gilmour, Barkley and Mount have been finding acres of space. Something has to change \u2013 and fast \u2013 for the visitors. 32 min: Sidib\u00e9 gives away a cheap free-kick after a clumsy foul on Pedro. Mount has a chance to swing it in from the left flank, 25 yards out ... but it is too high, too deep and Pickford gathers. 30 min: \u201cThis is an enjoyable start to the game,\u201d says Lee Madden, via email. \u201cChelsea\u2019s central midfield is relatively inexperienced but bring a lot of intensity and attacking mindset to compliment the experience up front. That said, it looks like Chelsea\u2019s front three today won\u2019t be here next season, which gives the whole team a very much \u2018work in progress\u2019 feel.\u201d Keep them coming ... 28 min: Back to Willian for a moment. The Chelsea winger is in a bit of a contract stand-off with his club, who are reluctant to offer the Brazilian any kind of lengthy deal at this stage of his career. But the way the 31-year-old sped past Holgate a little earlier suggests Willian, for now at least, still very much possesses that lightning pace. He has been electric in the opening stages here. 26 min: Calvert-Lewin fluffs his lines! Richarlison pickpockets Zouma, who foolishly tries to dribble upfield. Zouma gets caught out on halfway and Richarlison drives forward before laying the ball on for Calvert-Lewin. The striker bears down on Kepa but scoops it painfully wide; he got his angles all wrong. Everton pass up a golden goalscoring opportunity at Stamford Bridge. 24 min: Ancelotti has put the hood up on his raincoat but he could do with a blindfold; Everton have been atrocious. Richarlison and Calvert-Lewin anonymous. Barkley is running midfield. Pedro rattles in another \u2013 and it\u2019s another brilliant Chelsea move. Gilmour springs a pass into Giroud, who nudges the ball into Barkley\u2019s path. Barkley then slides a wonderfully weighted first-time pass in behind Keane and Sidib\u00e9 for Pedro to latch on to. The finish was effortless. Everton are all over the shop. 19 min: Pickford denies Willian! Barkley releases the Brazilian into the right channel, where Willian has a ponderous Mason Holgate on toast. Willian arrows his shot across goal but Pickford gets a strong hand to it. Barkley gathered an aimless header by Michael Keane and effortlessly lifted the ball into Willian\u2019s path. And the Chelsea winger did well to test Pickford from such a tight angle. 18 min: That\u2019s Mount\u2019s first goal since December. It had been coming. A wonderful drilled finish to round off a beautiful Chelsea move. Billy Gilmour rolls the ball into Mount on halfway, Mount drives forward with it before spraying it wide to Pedro, who cuts inside Djibril Sidib\u00e9 before handing back possession to Mount. Then Mount instinctively swivels and drives the ball home, with his low strike squeezing just inside Pickford\u2019s right post. On the touchline, Ancelotti has his hands in his pockets. Everton have been sluggish at best, carved open far too easily. 11 min: Calvert-Lewin fouls Antonio R\u00fcdiger on halfway. Mount wallops it towards the back post, where R\u00fcdiger is lurking, but the move breaks down. Everton get a chance to compose themselves. 9 min: Pedro has a go at goal, but it\u2019s tame and Keane snuffs it out. Everton are yet to really get going, with Chelsea very much in the ascendency. Now, for some more Giroud talk. \u201cI have always been a Giroud sceptic,\u201d begins Mary Waltz. \u201cBut his response to demotion has been pitch perfect. No whiny leaks to the press, bided his time, quality performance when given a chance. Class act.\u201d 7 min: Pickford superbly denies Mount! Giroud nods the ball into the path of Willian, who gallops towards the byline before supplying a neat cross for the onrushing Mason Mount. The Chelsea midfielder gets plenty of power on his strike \u2013 but Pickford gets his body behind it and keeps it out. Nice move. 5 min: Keane\u2019s flailing arm inadvertently catches Giroud and the Chelsea man is briefly grounded, but he\u2019s fine to carry on. On the subject of Giroud, Charles Littleton declares his love for the striker. \u201cYes, I am a proud supporter of the Giroud fan club AND I am a Gunner no less,\u201d he emails. \u201cWhen he was with us, he always seemed to be popping up with last minute goals that salvaged games \u2013 we drew 3-3 with Bournemouth at the last minute thanks to him. I always thought he was underappreciated at Arsenal and then for some reason we sold him to our rivals, just when we were hitting the skids. I don\u2019t want to blame our present malaise just on that, though. Many, many other things to complain about.\u201d 2 min: Gilmour rolls the ball back to Kepa as Tom Davies lets the Chelsea teenager know he is on the beat. Willian then darts beyond Sigurdsson to the byline but Everton manage to shepherd away possession. Chelsea throw-in on the right flank. 1 min: Barkley takes hold of the ball on halfway and is immediately jeered by the travelling Everton supporters. Lovely stuff. Sigurdsson, in Everton\u2019s salmon strip, gets us under way at Stamford Bridge. Before kick-off, a warm embrace between Ancelotti and Lampard, who resisted the handshake. The Liquidator rings out as the teams trudge out on to the pitch ... A gentle reminder Ancelotti will be on the touchline: Believe it or not, it has taken almost 54 minutes for this afternoon\u2019s first mention of coronavirus. \u201cFor all the talk of preventing Covid-19 spreading, it\u2019s rather bemusing watching 40k cram into Stamford Bridge and 50k in Hamburg last night, while watching the Danish league play to empty stadiums,\u201d Kaspar Larsen says, getting in touch on Twitter. says. Do get in touch on Twitter or email. Anyone else a massive Olivier Giroud fan? The 33-year-old has started Chelsea\u2019s past four matches and, as much as injuries have afforded the Frenchman more game-time, he seems to Lampard\u2019s flavour of the month. \u201cI just spoke with the manager and I believed what he said, that I would get my chance and he has given me my chance. I have basically tried to give his confidence back on the pitch. My confidence is getting higher and higher because I am playing more games. I don\u2019t know how long Tammy [Abraham] will be out for. When he comes back, I will need him to be ready and then we can have a good competition again.\u201d Roy Keane, for one, has been waxing lyrical about Billy Gilmour: I was sitting at home with a cup of tea and a bit of chocolate in front of me and I didn\u2019t have the volume on. As the game started, I got out of my seat and I thought: \u2018Who is this kid in midfield?\u2019 He was fantastic, he looked like a world-class player. There are certain traits you want from a midfielder: quality on the ball, intelligence, composure \u2013 he had everything \u2013 it was one of the best performances I\u2019ve seen in a long, long time. The downside for the kid now is he\u2019s got to back it up. Everything he did throughout the game had quality written all over it. This is likely to turn into a bit of a Billy Gilmour love-in so, with that in mind, here\u2019s a wondrous stat, courtesy of Opta: Billy Gilmour is the first Scottish outfield player to start a Premier League match for Chelsea since Steve Clarke in May 1998, with that match taking place more than three years before Gilmour was born. As for Everton\u2019s revival under Carlo Ancelotti, things are looking pretty rosy; since the Italian\u2019s first game in charge on Boxing Day, only Liverpool (30) and Manchester City (19) have won more Premier League points than Everton. Lampard reckons former Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti is in for a warm welcome, and, frankly, why wouldn\u2019t he? \u201cHe\u2019s very well respected in-house and by the fans,\u201d Lampard said. \u201cHe is a gentleman, a great man-manager. On a personal level, he\u2019s great at striking up relationships. He\u2019s good tactically and has a great manner. I keep in touch with him now and again.\u201d As expected, Billy Gilmour makes his first Premier League start. The Scottish teenager helped Chelsea dump Liverpool out of the FA Cup at Stamford Bridge in midweek and is rewarded for his performance with another outing. \u201cHis family were here for the game,\u201d said Lampard. \u201cKnowing Billy, even at a young age he\u2019s a very determined young lad, he\u2019s very smart. He\u2019ll understand it was a very good game for him but that the hard work starts now. I think he should quite rightly enjoy the moment, and I\u2019m delighted for him. But in terms of how I\u2019ve seen him around the place, it\u2019s the same attitude, training, ethics, quality; so all good.\u201d Team news news: so ... Kepa Arrizabalaga and Billy Gilmour stay put from the Chelsea starting lineup against Liverpool on Tuesday, with Willian also in from the off after passing a late fitness test. Armando Broja, an 18-year-old forward who joined Chelsea as an under-nine, is in a matchday squad in the Premier League for the first time, alongside another teenager, midfielder Tino Anjorin. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who continues to step up his return to fitness, and Christian Pulisic, are both absent despite Lampard hinting they could play a part. As for Everton, three changes from their 1-1 draw with Manchester United, with Lucas Digne, Djibril Sidib\u00e9 and Bernard back in Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s starting XI. Chelsea (4-3-3): Kepa; Azpilicueta, R\u00fcdiger, Zouma, Alonso; Barkley, Gilmour, Mount; Willian, Giroud, Pedro Subs: Caballero, Christensen, Tomori, James, Broja, Anjorin, Batshuayi Everton (4-4-2): Pickford; Sidib\u00e9, Holgate, Keane, Digne; Sigurdsson, Gomes, Davies, Bernard; Calvert-Lewin, Richarlison Subs: Stekelenburg, Baines, Mina, Iwobi, Walcott, Kean, Gordon Referee: Kevin Friend Welcome to the Carlo Ancelotti/Ross Barkley derby, though it is Billy Gilmour who graces the front cover of the Chelsea programme. Coupled with Jorginho\u2019s two-match ban and Mateo Kovacic\u2019s achilles issue, Gilmour\u2019s star turn in the FA Cup victory over Liverpool in midweek has accelerated 18-year-old Glaswegian\u2019s first Premier League start. Ancelotti says it will be an emotional return to Stamford Bridge, which he called home for two years \u2013 \u201cI have fantastic memories of the period I was there, I\u2019m really excited to come back\u201d \u2013 but now the Italian, who twice won the Champions League with Milan and helped Chelsea to the league title 10 years ago, is making hay with Everton, who quietly fancy a push for Europe. There is little margin for error as the race for fourth and fifth hots up, with Sheffield United, Wolves, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal and even 10th-placed Burnley among those jostling for European berths. Chelsea have won just one of their past six matches and were unconvincing at Bournemouth last weekend, when Lampard lamented Marcos Alonso again proving the saviour but they will surely be beaming with confidence after Barkley helped them to turnover the best team in the country on Tuesday. Kick-off: 2pm (GMT)",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In the US, Anthony Fauci, the head of the infectious diseases unit at the National Institutes of Health, said Americans , and particularly those who are vulnerable, may have to stop attending big gatherings.

      "bodyText": "British supermarkets trying to prevent shoppers from stockpiling have put purchase limits on items including pasta, anti-bacterial wipes, hand soap, toilet paper and children\u2019s medications. Shelves across the country have been stripped of such goods after Public Health England urged members of the public to \u201cplan ahead\u201d in case they had to self-isolate for a couple of weeks. However, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, has said there is \u201cabsolutely no reason\u201d for the British public to panic-buy. Tesco has almost sold out of its own-brand dried pasta and tinned tomatoes online and has now limited many high-demand items to five per shopper. Categories include long-life milk, bleach, dried pasta, tinned vegetables, children\u2019s medications, water and anti-bacterial wipes, gels and sprays. The restrictions apply both online and in stores. Customers have been told by the supermarket: \u201cWe know there\u2019s demand for certain products at the moment and we\u2019re working really hard to maintain availability of those to help customers. We\u2019ve taken a commonsense approach to make sure everyone can access essentials.\u201d No other supermarket has yet resorted to rationing food, but the majority are limiting anti-bacterial gels to two per customer \u2013 if they have not sold out already. Ocado, the online supermarket, was rationing toilet rolls on Sunday evening, with customers able to buy a maximum of two 12-roll packs of Andrex. Commenting on reports of people panic-buying, Boris Johnson said on Sunday: \u201cWe\u2019ve had no advice from the scientific advisers or medical officers that there\u2019s any need for people to buy stuff in.\u201d As of 10pm on Sunday, 278 people in the UK had been diagnosed with Covid-19, an increase of 69 from the 209 cases confirmed on Saturday. It represents the largest day-on-day increase in diagnoses. On Sunday evening it was announced a third patient had died in the UK of coronavirus. Coronavirus concerns appear to have created an international rush for toilet paper. Two women have been charged after a fight broke out over toilet roll in an Australian supermarket, a video of which was shared widely online. One Asda customer complained that she had placed an online order for her elderly mother last Sunday, but that it had arrived on Saturday minus the toilet rolls. Liberty Marketing found hand-sanitiser products were selling for more than 5,000% their recommended retail price online, with bottles worth 49p selling for \u00a324.99. One eBay listing has sold a second-hand bottle of liquid soap for more than \u00a35, despite being only three-quarters full. The environment secretary, George Eustice, will meet food industry representatives on Monday. A Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson said: \u201cThe environment secretary will hold a further call with chief executives from the UK\u2019s leading supermarkets and industry representatives on 9 March to discuss their response to the coronavirus. The meeting will discuss support for vulnerable groups who may be in isolation.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 13 March 2020 because an earlier version omitted to credit Liberty Marketing for its research into the price of hand-sanitiser products.",

      "bodyText": "The chancellor is under pressure from industry groups to resist the temptation to fund coronavirus spending with tax hikes on business when he delivers the budget on Wednesday. The RAC said a majority of drivers wanted Rishi Sunak to freeze fuel duty for the 10th year following intense speculation that he plans to increase the duty on petrol and diesel by 2p a litre. A poll of 3,200 motorists indicated that 59% wants Sunak to reinvest 2p from every litre of petrol and diesel sold, while keeping duty at current levels. Twenty-six percent of respondents said they would like to see fuel duty reduced, while just 10% were in favour of an increase. Sunak is looking at ending the fuel duty freeze as the government looks to encourage motorists to switch to electric cars and other more sustainable transport. With new car sales significantly lower than just a year ago and many drivers switching to electric vehicles, the Treasury faces the prospect of falling revenues unless it increases the duty quickly. The Treasury fears a tax hike could be met by street protests in the same vein as the gilets jaunes riots in France last year, which were triggered by increases in fuel duty. But strategists in No10 believe this would be unlikely in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak.

The Federation of Small Businesses has warned the chancellor that a Tory manifesto commitment to scrap entrepreneurs tax relief, saving an estimated \u00a32.6bn, would harm the UK\u2019s reputation as a business-friendly economy. Rishi is know to be sympathetic to abolishing the tax break after it emerged it benefited just 5,200 people, most of them among the richest in Britain. Meanwhile, a group of MPs \u2013 including those on the all-party parliamentary wine and spirit group (APPG) \u2013 has written to the exchequer secretary to the Treasury, Kemi Badenoch, urging a cut to wine duty in the budget.

After last month\u2019s reshuffle, the first cabinet meeting began with a demeaning to-and-fro exchange about the hospitals, police officers and nurses the new ministers were pledged to deliver. Every week, Mr Johnson breezes through prime minister\u2019s questions with a similarly vacuous recitation.

But it is a moment that the government is approaching more on the back foot than it expected. Mr Johnson has lost his chancellor, Sajid Javid, in the run-up to the budget.

We will assist health officials to ensure the safety and health of all passengers and crew aboard, and will continue to collaborate with our interagency and industry partners as the whole of US government responds and mitigates risk of coronavirus.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/tourism-cruises/article241008101.html\">The Miami Herald reported</a> that the ship, which has a capacity of 3,500 passengers and 1,300 crew, was returning to Port Everglades from a 14-day Caribbean cruise but was ordered to stay at sea.</p> <p>The newspaper said passengers were awakened by a 5.30am announcement on Sunday informing them that the ship was being held while federal health authorities tested two crew members who joined from the Grand Princess at the beginning of the voyage.</p> <p>It reported that the crew members being tested had not shown symptoms of the virus that infected 21 people aboard the Grand Princess, 19 of them crew, and that the testing was expected to be completed within a few hours.</p> <p>A cruise by the Regal Princess scheduled to depart Port Everglades on Sunday was already canceled.</p> <p>The US death toll from the virus rose to 21 on Sunday, with most victims in Washington state. The number of infections, meanwhile, swelled to more than 550, scattered across 30 states, with Kate Brown, the governor of Oregon, the latest to declare a state of emergency on Sunday afternoon after 14 cases were confirmed there.</p> <p>Passengers aboard the Grand Princess holed up in their rooms awaiting news, with crew members wearing masks and gloves delivering food in covered plates on trays left outside cabin doors.</p> <p>Grant Tarling, chief medical officer for Carnival Corporation, said it is believed a 71-year-old Northern California man who later died of the virus was probably sick when he boarded the ship for a 11 February cruise to Mexico.</p> <p>The passenger visited the medical center the day before disembarking with symptoms of respiratory illness, he said. Others in several states and Canada who were on that voyage also have tested positive.</p> <p>The passenger likely infected his dining room server, who also tested positive for the virus, Tarling said, as did two people traveling with the man. Two passengers now on the ship who have the virus were not on the previous cruise, he said.</p> <p>Some passengers who had been on the Mexico trip stayed aboard for the current voyage \u2013 increasing crew members\u2019 exposure to the virus.</p> <p>Donald Trump, the US president, was playing golf near his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida on Sunday as the crisis continued to escalate. Earlier in the week he said he would prefer not to allow the passengers on to American soil but would defer to experts.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t need to have the numbers [of US cases] double because of one ship that wasn\u2019t our fault,\u201d Trump said Friday while touring CDC headquarters in Atlanta. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t the fault of the people on the ship either. And they are mostly American, so I can live either way with it.\u201d</p> <p>Another Princess ship, the Diamond Princess, was quarantined for two weeks in Yokohama, Japan, last month because of the virus. Ultimately, about 700 of the 3,700 people aboard became infected in what experts pronounced a public-health failure.</p> <p>Hundreds of Americans aboard that ship were flown to military bases in California and other states for two-week quarantines. Some later were hospitalized with symptoms.</p> <p>An epidemiologist who studies the spread of virus particles said the recirculated air from a cruise ship\u2019s ventilation system, plus the close quarters and communal settings, make passengers and crew vulnerable to infectious diseases.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not designed as quarantine facilities, to put it mildly,\u201d said Don Milton of the University of Maryland.</p> <p>Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 100,000 people and killed more than 3,400, the vast majority of them in China. Most cases have been mild, and more than half of those infected have recovered.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Thousands of passengers stranded aboard a cruise ship stricken by coronavirus have been told they can expect to finally dock in the port of Oakland, California, on Monday, as authorities ordered its sister ship to wait off the coast of Florida until two crew members were tested. The Grand Princess has been circling off California for four days having been refused permission to land in San Francisco amid evidence that the vessel was the breeding ground for a cluster of more than 20 cases that resulted in at least one death. Its captain, John Smith, told the 3,500 passengers from 54 countries that Princess Cruises, the ship\u2019s owners, had arranged for it to dock tomorrow. \u201cAn agreement has been reached to bring our ship into the port of Oakland,\u201d he said in a loudspeaker announcement late Saturday recorded by passengers. \u201cAfter docking, we will then begin a disembarkation process specified by federal authorities that will take several days.\u201d That process was expected to include passengers being taken into quarantine and crew members staying aboard. Meanwhile in Florida, the Regal Princess was refused permission to dock in Fort Lauderdale on Sunday morning pending results of tests on two crew members who transferred recently from the Grand Princess. Princess Cruises did not respond immediately to questions about how many passengers were on board or what measures were being taken as the ship stayed at sea between Fort Lauderdale and Miami, but travelers aboard posted social media pictures of what appeared to be a US Coast Guard cutter taking virus testing kits ashore. \u201cThe Coast Guard transmitted a no-sail order and information order issued by Health and Human Services and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),\u201d a spokesperson told the Guardian in a written statement that did not confirm the ship\u2019s identity. \u201cThis morning a Coast Guard Miami small boat crew, in support of that order, transported test kits to a vessel offshore southern Florida. We will assist health officials to ensure the safety and health of all passengers and crew aboard, and will continue to collaborate with our interagency and industry partners as the whole of US government responds and mitigates risk of coronavirus.\u201d The Miami Herald reported that the ship, which has a capacity of 3,500 passengers and 1,300 crew, was returning to Port Everglades from a 14-day Caribbean cruise but was ordered to stay at sea. The newspaper said passengers were awakened by a 5.30am announcement on Sunday informing them that the ship was being held while federal health authorities tested two crew members who joined from the Grand Princess at the beginning of the voyage. It reported that the crew members being tested had not shown symptoms of the virus that infected 21 people aboard the Grand Princess, 19 of them crew, and that the testing was expected to be completed within a few hours. A cruise by the Regal Princess scheduled to depart Port Everglades on Sunday was already canceled. The US death toll from the virus rose to 21 on Sunday, with most victims in Washington state. The number of infections, meanwhile, swelled to more than 550, scattered across 30 states, with Kate Brown, the governor of Oregon, the latest to declare a state of emergency on Sunday afternoon after 14 cases were confirmed there. Passengers aboard the Grand Princess holed up in their rooms awaiting news, with crew members wearing masks and gloves delivering food in covered plates on trays left outside cabin doors. Grant Tarling, chief medical officer for Carnival Corporation, said it is believed a 71-year-old Northern California man who later died of the virus was probably sick when he boarded the ship for a 11 February cruise to Mexico. The passenger visited the medical center the day before disembarking with symptoms of respiratory illness, he said. Others in several states and Canada who were on that voyage also have tested positive. The passenger likely infected his dining room server, who also tested positive for the virus, Tarling said, as did two people traveling with the man. Two passengers now on the ship who have the virus were not on the previous cruise, he said. Some passengers who had been on the Mexico trip stayed aboard for the current voyage \u2013 increasing crew members\u2019 exposure to the virus. Donald Trump, the US president, was playing golf near his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida on Sunday as the crisis continued to escalate. Earlier in the week he said he would prefer not to allow the passengers on to American soil but would defer to experts. \u201cI don\u2019t need to have the numbers [of US cases] double because of one ship that wasn\u2019t our fault,\u201d Trump said Friday while touring CDC headquarters in Atlanta. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t the fault of the people on the ship either. And they are mostly American, so I can live either way with it.\u201d Another Princess ship, the Diamond Princess, was quarantined for two weeks in Yokohama, Japan, last month because of the virus. Ultimately, about 700 of the 3,700 people aboard became infected in what experts pronounced a public-health failure. Hundreds of Americans aboard that ship were flown to military bases in California and other states for two-week quarantines. Some later were hospitalized with symptoms. An epidemiologist who studies the spread of virus particles said the recirculated air from a cruise ship\u2019s ventilation system, plus the close quarters and communal settings, make passengers and crew vulnerable to infectious diseases. \u201cThey\u2019re not designed as quarantine facilities, to put it mildly,\u201d said Don Milton of the University of Maryland. Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 100,000 people and killed more than 3,400, the vast majority of them in China. Most cases have been mild, and more than half of those infected have recovered.",

      "bodyText": "The Foreign Office faced a backlash on Sunday over its lack of clear advice for British people with holidays booked in northern Italy and those currently in quarantine as a result of the region\u2019s escalating coronavirus crisis. Hours after a decree was approved to lock down the Lombardy region, the department was still advising that it was safe to travel anywhere in Italy except for 11 towns where the outbreak originated. The advice was updated later on Sunday to warn against \u201call but essential\u201d travel to the whole Lombardy region, including its capital, Milan, as well as areas of Emilia Romagna, Marche, Piedmont and Veneto, including Venice. British holidaymakers had been left confused about whether they could still go to Lombardy and whether those already there could find themselves trapped in the quarantine zone. In the updated advice, the Foreign Office urged travellers to check flight details with airlines and said there were no restrictions on people leaving Italy. At about 8pm, the Department of Health advice about who should self-isolate for 14 days on their return was updated to include all those who had been to the locked-down area, rather than just the original 11 affected towns.

He said the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Australia had risen to 74, including two members of the Australian defence force.</p> \n  <p>He also commented on the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/08/coronavirus-live-updates-third-death-in-australia-as-cases-reach-more-than-70?page=with:block-5e6426bc8f087df56e4c446e#block-5e6426bc8f087df56e4c446e\">an 82-year-old man in Sydney</a>, one of the residents of the BaptistCare Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged care home, and the third person to die after testing positive to Covid-19 in Australia.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThat\u2019s just a great loss to him, his family, to all of the community, which will feel this loss,\u201d he said.<br></p> \n  <p><strong>Hunt urged people to be \u201ctheir best selves\u201d</strong> in what seems to be an oblique reference to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/07/it-isnt-mad-max-police-warning-after-shoppers-brawl-over-toilet-paper-in-sydney\">the toilet paper wars. </a></p> \n  <p>\u201cOnly two months ago, as a nation, we faced the great challenge of the bushfires,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we rose. We were our best selves, and this is the time to be our best selves and to let our better angels prevail.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd our job, working with the states and territory, but working with the community, is to make sure that we are not just prepared, but that we are unified.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd so there have been some things which have occurred in recent days which have not been our best selves. But it was only two months ago, as I say, that as a country, the spirit of the volunteer, the spirit of the CFA and the RFS and our emergency service.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Hunt returned to this point a lot, comparing the spirit required in response to the global coronavirus outbreak to that seen in response to the Australian bushfires. (You will recall the Australian government was heavily criticised for its management of that crisis.)</p> \n  <p>He also announced that the Australian government had secured an additional 54m face masks for its national reserve and said that no primary health network in Australia had exhausted its first round of masks.</p> \n  <p>So that means that, contrary to reports from GPs that they are struggling to get the appropriate personal protective equipment. Hunt said there may have been some miscommunications which meant that busy medical practices \u201cmay not have realised that they\u2019ve had that\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Hunt was asked to comment on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/doctor-who-had-coronavirus-demands-apology-from-victorian-health-minister-over-inaccuracies\">a spat unfolding in Victoria between the health minister, Jenny Mikakos, and GPs</a>, who were incensed at her comments that she was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d a GP who was later diagnosed with Covid-19 had gone to work with cold- and/or flu-like symptoms.</p> \n  <p>Hunt drew on the bushfire analogy again: \u201cOver summer our firefighters and our emergency service workers were our heroes. In the coming months it will be our health and medical service workers who will be our national heroes.

Thanks for following - here\u2019s a summary of the latest coronavirus developments. The UK has announced its third death from the virus. He was a man in his 60s who had underlying health problems. The decree imposing a lockdown for more than a quarter of Italy\u2019s population was officially approved by the government and checkpoints are expected to appear at toll booths, stations and other points of entry to Lombardy. Five more people have tested positive in Northern Ireland, bringing the UK total to 278. The UK Department of Health is now advising anyone who has returned from the lockdown areas in northern Italy to self-isolate for two weeks, even if they do not have coronavirus symptoms. The number of deaths from coronavirus in Italy has risen from 233 on Saturday to 366, officials have said. The 57% increase is the steepest daily rise in fatalities since the outbreak came to light. Deaths from coronavirus in France rise from 11 to 19. French health officials have confirmed 1,126 cases of coronavirus. Israel declared on Sunday that it will close its border with Egypt, beginning 5pm local time. The Taba border crossing between Egypt\u2019s Sinai region and the Israeli town of Eilat is a popular crossing point for tourists. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has not been tested for coronavirus, but her symptoms are improving, the Free Nazanin campaign has said. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, currently jailed in Iran, was taken to see a prison doctor earlier in the week who told her that her symptoms were consistent with coronavirus, the campaign said on Sunday evening. Five more people have tested positive for coronavirus in Northern Ireland, the Department of Health said. The new cases bring the UK total to 278. A statement on the website said: \u201cTesting of patients in Northern Ireland has resulted in five new presumptive positive results for coronavirus (Covid-19) bringing the total to 12 since testing began. \u201cContact tracing from these five cases is being conducted by Public Health Agency staff. \u201cA more detailed update will be provided on the situation tomorrow, when this contact tracing work is at a more advanced stage.\u201d Budget airline easyJet is cancelling flights to parts of northern Italy affected by the coronavirus lockdown. A spokesperson said: \u201cFollowing a decree issued by the Italian authorities implementing further restrictions for anyone living in Lombardy and 14 other central and northern provinces in Italy, easyJet in common with a number of other airlines is reviewing its flying programme to Milan Malpensa, Milan Linate, Venice and Verona airports for the period from now until April 3 2020. \u201cIn the short term, we will be cancelling a number of flights to and from these destinations on Monday March 9.\u201d The airline said affected passengers would be informed of cancellations by email and text message. \u201cCustomers on flights scheduled to operate to and from these airports will be given the option of a full refund or to change their flight,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cWe expect to continue to reduce the number of flights in and out of Milan Malpensa, Milan Linate, Venice and Verona airports in the period up to April 3 and will provide a further update on our schedule in due course.\u201d The Foreign Office says it is \u201cworking intensively\u201d with US authorities to arrange a flight for British nationals on the coronavirus-hit Grand Princess cruise ship, which is due to arrive in Oakland, California, on Monday. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe remain in close contact with the local authorities and will work with them on their plans. \u201cWe are also in contact with the Grand Princess\u2019 staff, and are ready to support any British nationals who need our assistance.\u201d A healthcare worker at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust (UHSFT) has tested positive for coronavirus.

A statement on the UHSFT website said: \u201cThe small number of patients and staff who came into close contact with this individual have been informed and will be appropriately isolated. \u201cThe surgical high dependency unit is temporarily closed to new admissions. Any patient affected by the temporary closure will be contacted directly. \u201cThe trust is following Public Health England and NHS guidance in respect of the virus and all other services are operating normally. \u201cPatients and staff should continue to attend appointments normally and come into work unless advised not to.\u201d A man in his 60s, who had underlying health problems, has become the third patient to die after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK. The man, who died at North Manchester general hospital had recently returned from Italy, NHS England said. England\u2019s chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said: \u201cI am very sorry to report that a third patient in England who tested positive for Covid-19 has sadly died. I offer my sincere condolences to their family and friends and ask that their privacy is respected. \u201cThe patient, who was being treated at the North Manchester General Hospital, was over 60 years old and had significant underlying health conditions. \u201cThey had recently travelled from an affected area. Contact tracing is already under way.\u201d An inmate died on Sunday after a riot at a prison in Modena that broke out when detainees were informed that the new emergency decree bans visits and contacts between prisoners and their relatives in order to reduce infections. Other jail riots were also sparked in Salerno and Frosinone when the news of the draft decree banning visits from relatives spread among inmates. A group of British travellers quarantined on the Grand Princess cruise ship said they have no idea when they will be able to return to the UK. Although the ship is due to dock in Oakland, California, on Monday, only passengers requiring treatment and state residents will be allowed to disembark. It is not known what will happen to passengers from other countries. Justine Griffin, of Leicestershire, was on board with her husband Dave and friends Jan and Allen Duffin, and Sharon and Steve Lane, when it was placed into quarantine. She told PA news agency: \u201cWe won\u2019t be getting off tomorrow as we are at the bottom of the list. First the sick, then Californians, then any other Americans. \u201cThey have no plans for international passengers yet - rumours going round about Texas but nothing concrete yet.\u201d The couple, who renewed their vows on board for their 25th wedding anniversary, have not been tested for coronavirus but believe they will have to enter quarantine in the UK for two weeks when they return home. The Department of Health is now advising anyone who has returned from the lockdown areas in northern Italy to self-isolate for two weeks, even if they do not have coronavirus symptoms. Travel and health advice was updated on Sunday evening after the entire Lombardy region and 14 other provinces were placed in quarantine. Anyone returning from anywhere in Lombardy, which includes Milan and Como, should self-isolate, as should those returning from Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia and Rimini (all in Emilia Romagna); Pesaro e Urbino (in Marche); Alessandria, Asti, Novara, Verbano-Cusio-Ossola and Vercelli (all in Piedmont) and Padova, Treviso and Venice (in Veneto). For the latest advice click here. France has banned gatherings of more than 1,000 people to try and contain coronavirus. It comes after the number of deaths rose from 11 on Saturday to 19 on Sunday, when officials also confirmed the number of cases had increased to 1,126. On Friday president Emmanuel Macron warned an epidemic was \u201cinevitable\u201d in the country. The Foreign Office has updated its travel advice for Italy after a backlash over a lack of clarity for people with holidays booked and those currently in locked-down areas. The department is now advising against all but essential travel to the whole of the Lombardy region, where 16 million Italians are in mandatory quarantine. British holidaymakers had been left confused because, hours after the quarantine was announced, it was still advising that it was safe to travel to anywhere apart from 11 towns where the outbreak originated. Travellers are now advised to check their flight details with airlines. The Foreign Office is also advising against travel to areas of Emilia Romagna, Marche, Piemonte and Veneto. For the full list of affected areas, click here. British nationals can still leave Italy without restriction. Portugal\u2019s president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, has cancelled his diary events for the next two weeks and will remain in quarantine at his residence after a case of the coronavirus was detected at a school whose students visited the presidential palace last Tuesday. A statement posted on the president\u2019s website on Sunday said the decision had been taken as a precaution even though neither the infected student or their class were among those who visited the Bel\u00e9m palace. \u201cHaving listened to health authorities, the president, who is not showing any symptoms of the virus, has decided to cancel all public engagements,\u201d the statement added. It said that while the president would continue to work from his private residence, he had decided to lead by example so as to underline the need for precautions during the outbreak. Twenty-five cases of the disease have been confirmed in Portugal, while the total over the border in Spain reached 617 on Sunday, which has recorded 13 deaths. Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel is considering broadening entry restrictions to include travellers from all countries, a move that would effectively cut off foreign tourism. At a news conference, the prime minister said the measure, if taken, would require anyone arriving in Israel to go into home quarantine for two weeks. A decision will be made on Monday. Israel already requires self-quarantine for travellers arriving from 15 countries in Europe and Asia. Over in the US, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders said his campaign was gauging when it may become necessary to cancel the large campaign rallies that public health experts say could be breeding grounds for coronavirus. As the virus hits more states, health officials have been advising older people and those with medical conditions to avoid crowded spaces. Music and arts festivals around the country have been cancelled as a result. Supermarkets have started rationing items to try and prevent people from stockpiling. Shelves across the country have been stripped of items after Public Health England urged members of the public to \u201cplan ahead\u201d in case they had to self-isolate for a couple of weeks. Read this by Helen Pidd for the full story. The number of deaths from coronavirus in Italy has risen from 233 on Saturday to 366, officials have said. The 57% increase is the steepest daily rise in fatalities since the outbreak came to light. The total number of confirmed cases in the country now stands at 7,375 - up from 5,883 on Saturday. French health officials have confirmed 1,126 cases of coronavirus, with the death toll increasing from 11 on Saturday to 19 on Sunday. The death toll in the northern Italian region of Lombardy has risen over the past day to 257 from 154, a local official has said. The latest national death toll figures are due to be released later on Sunday. On Saturday, the country-wide tally stood at 233. Berlin correspondent Kate Connolly has more on the latest from Germany after the first German death from coronavirus was announced earlier today: A 60-year-old man who travelled to Egypt a week ago has died of the illness, the Egyptian health ministry said. As the number of cases in Germany climbed to 1,028 on Sunday (Robert Koch Institute, 1.54pm local time), Germany\u2019s Bundesliga was forced to react to health minister Jens Spahn\u2019s recommendation that events drawing more than 1,000 participants, including football matches, conferences, trade fairs and concerts, should be cancelled. As Germany has a federal system, Spahn does not have the power to call off events, but his advice is likely to be taken seriously and has been welcomed by many who had complained the government\u2019s response to the virus has so far been too laid-back. Germany\u2019s football league, the DFL has said it will be in touch with all clubs to discuss how to deal with the current situation. \u201cThe coronavirus is bringing the entire society and with it, the game of football, into a difficult situation,\u201d DFL\u2019s manager, Christian Seifert, told German media. The DFL\u2019s leadership is due to meet shortly and will then meet with each club individually, Seifert said. He added, the aim had to be \u201cto find an appropriate middle way between justified precaution and exaggerated caution,\u201d Seifert said. But he said it was \u201cwithout question\u201d that the football season needed to carry on until mid May, when it is due to end. Peter Liese, health spokesman for the leading Christian Democrats said he was in favour of games being played in empty stadiums, the next scheduled one being a rearranged fixture between M\u00f6nchengladbach and Cologne on Wednesday. \u201cThe danger of contagion does not just apply to the stadium itself but to the full trains bringing the spectators to the match,\u201d he said. Announcing his recommendation on Sunday following an emergency government meeting, Spahn said he was depending on each individual to make sensible decisions. \u201cI encourage each and every individual to weigh up what\u2019s important to you in your own daily life, which you really cannot do without in the next two to three months, whether it\u2019s visiting a club, a birthday party with friends or an association meeting,\u201d he added. More countries will adopt Italy\u2019s measures \u2013 Austrian leader Here is my colleague Jon Henley\u2019s full report on comments made by Austria\u2019s chancellor Sebastian Kurz earlier today. The chancellor said other European countries will be forced to adopt containment measures as drastic as Italy\u2019s, after Rome placed a quarter of the population in lockdown in an effort to halt the rapid spread of the coronavirus. Egypt has reported its first death from coronavirus. The deceased is a German national, according to the Egyptian health ministry. In the UK, a number of supermarkets have placed restrictions on items including pasta, anti-bacterial wipes and hand soap in a bid to prevent shoppers from stockpiling. PA Media reports that the brands to restrict purchases so far include: Tesco: a five-item limit on a number of items including pasta, anti-bacterial wipes, gels and sprays, and long-life milk Waitrose: restrictions on certain anti-bacterial soaps and wipes when shopping online Asda: hand sanitiser restricted to two per person both in-store and online. No food restrictions. Many anti-bacterial products out of stock online. Sainsbury\u2019s, Lidl and Morrisons have no restrictions at the moment. Aldi and Ocado have not yet confirmed any restrictions. The government\u2019s chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said there is \u201cabsolutely no reason\u201d for the British public to panic buy. Airline Alitalia is reorganising air services at Milan and Venice airports from Monday following the Italian government\u2019s coronavirus measures. It will operate only domestic flights to and from Milan Linate airport and serve international routes from Rome airport. All national and international flights will be suspended to and from Milan Malpensa airport. \u2022 Italy has been plunged into chaos after details of a plan to quarantine more than 16 million people in the north amid an escalating coronavirus outbreak were leaked to the press, sending thousands into panic as they tried to flee south. The whole of Lombardy, including its financial capital of Milan, and 14 provinces across the worst-affected northern regions, have been shut down until 3 April as Italy grapples to contain the spread of a virus that has so far killed 233 people and infected 5,883. Thousands crowded train stations in Lombardy or jumped into their cars after details of a draft decree banning people from leaving or entering the region were revealed by Corriere della Sera late on Saturday afternoon. \u2022 As Italy\u2019s sports minister called for the cancellation of matches in Italy\u2019s topflight Serie A division, cycling authorities have postponed this month\u2019s Tirreno-Adriatico and Milan-San Remo races because of the coronavirus outbreak. The decision, which includes rescheduling the Tour of Sicily at the start of April, follows the Italian government\u2019s decision to suspend all sporting events that cannot be held in a closed arena until 3 April. \u2022 Britain\u2019s health secretary has insisted the UK government will do \u201ceverything in its power\u201d to delay and mitigate the coronavirus threat as the number of people in the country to test positive for Covid-19 rose from 209 to 273. Matt Hancock set out plans contained in emergency legislation to deal with the impact of the virus, as GPs warned hospitals will have to cut back on work not related to coronavirus in order to tackle the outbreak. The bill, which is likely to go through parliament by the end of the month, is expected to include measures to allow some court proceedings to be conducted via telephone or video. \u2022 Among other countries reporting increases in the number of cases, Spain confirmed 589, along with 17 deaths, while Iraq said there had been two further deaths on top of previous four. In the US, the number of people in New York state who have tested positive for the coronavirus has increased to 105 as of Sunday, up from 89 the day before, governor Andrew Cuomo told a news briefing. An EasyJet flight from Porto to Lyon was diverted to Toulouse airport this afternoon after a suspected coronavirus case on board. Passengers were confined to the aircraft for several hours and emergency services were called. Some interesting points about the usefulness of the latest UK figures, now up to 273, are made by one expert in epidemiology, who says it\u2019s going to be important to know if new cases are forming clusters. Martin Hibberd, Professor of Emerging Infectious Disease, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) said the numbers on their own are not very informative now. We need to know if these new cases are forming clusters or can be traced to known cases in other ways (such as imports from Italy) to understand if we have moved out of the initial containment stage. If they are clusters, we are sampling contacts of cases sufficiently and understanding the outbreak dynamics. If they are apparently randomly distributed, then we know there are more cases than are being reported and we can expect rapid increases in numbers over the coming days and weeks. The Department of Health says it ill be providing a regional breakdown later today. A number of International Women\u2019s Day events were cancelled across Asia in an attempt to halt the spread of the virus, with several events called off in South Korea, the country with the most severe outbreak outside of China. \u201cAlthough we can\u2019t be physically together, our minds for realising gender equality are stronger than ever,\u201d the country\u2019s gender equality minister Lee Jung-Ok said in a video message. A women\u2019s marathon set to take place in India was also postponed over fears that it could facilitate the spread of infection. However, marches went ahead in Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, whilst Chinese state broadcaster CCTV used the occasion to highlight the work of female medics tackling coronavirus. Events continued across the world, although many participants, particularly in Iraq, could be seen wearing face masks. While much of Italy remains in lockdown, the Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, released a video message in which he expressed his disappointment at the need to avoid large-scale gatherings. He said he was giving \u201ca grateful thought to the women \u2013 and there are many \u2013 who are working in hospitals ... in the red [quarantine] zones to fight the spread of the virus that worries us today.\u201d Israel declared on Sunday that it will close its border with Egypt, beginning 5pm local time. The Taba border crossing between Egypt\u2019s Sinai region and the Israeli town of Eilat is a popular crossing point for tourists. Egypt announced 33 new cases of coronavirus on Sunday on a cruise ship that travelled between the southern cities of Aswan and Luxor, bringing the total number on board to 45. Reports indicate the ship has since been quarantined, with infected passengers and crew flown to an isolation camp near the town of Marsa Matruh. Matt Swider, a passenger on board the Asara cruise ship named as the site of the COVID-19 outbreak tweeted his account as he and 32 others were flown by military plane to a hospital for quarantine. \u201cI was told I tested negative and then there was a mistake and I\u2019m positive for coronavirus,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is my home in Egypt for the foreseeable future, until I am cleared of #coronavirus,\u201d he added, including a picture of his hospital bed. Separately, Egypt\u2019s Minister of Health said Sunday that the first Egyptian to contract COVID-19 is now \u201cin a critical condition.\u201d The 44-year old is an Egyptian citizen who displayed symptoms of the virus after they returned home from a trip to Serbia. The number of coronavirus cases in the UK is going to double every few days, according to a British health expert who was reacting to the news earlier that a total of 273 people have now tested positive. Prof Tom Solomon, Walton Centre NHS foundation trust, and Institute of Infection &amp; Global Health, University of Liverpool, said 67 new cases in the UK was not that big an increase nor unexpected given it was likely the number of cases would double every few days. He added: As the numbers continue to grow we are moving from a phase of containment, where we hoped we could stop the outbreak completely, to one of delay. This means all our efforts are aimed at slowing the outbreak down. Ultimately perhaps 50 to 80% of the population may get infected with this virus. Currently about 5% of patients are needing hospitalisation. If all these people become infected in a short time window, eg a few weeks, then we will have a very large number who need to go to hospital all at the same time. And the health services will really struggle. However, If we can spread the outbreak over many months, the health services will be able to cope better with the same number of patients, because not everyone will need to care at the same time. The BBC have meanwhile carried this interview with a Briton who contracted coronavirus after travelling to northern Italy recently. The man said that he had a dry cough over the weekend and then suddenly had a headache and a fever, as well as \u201cstrange chills\u201d which seemed to reverberate around the body. It\u2019s worth stressing of course that most health experts have stressed that most people will not need to be hospitalised. Large numbers of people arriving in Israel for the Jewish holiday of Pessach could be affected by an Israeli government announcement later today on whether new arrivals will have to self-quarantine, reports the journalist Anshel Pfeffer A total of 150 cases of coronavirus in Singapore, which announced 12 new ones today, include one which health authorities there say is is likely to be an \u201cimported case\u201d involving a 37-year-old woman who had visited from 23 February to 27 February. The woman, a permanent resident in Singapore, was confirmed to have the disease on 6 March. Egypt is rushing to protect its important tourism sector and reassure travellers it is safe to visit after an outbreak of the coronavirus on a cruise ship on the River Nile. Officials said on Saturday the coronavirus had been detected in 45 people, including foreign tourists, after the vessel reached the southern city of Luxor. Until then, Egypt had reported only three confirmed cases of the virus. Reuters reports that the ministers of tourism, health and civil aviation toured a temple on Sunday in central Luxor, across the Nile from the Valley of the Kings where pharaohs were buried in tombs carved into rock. \u201cWe are here to respond to rumours saying that there are no tourists and people are afraid of coming. Thank God, people are here,\u201d Khaled al-Anani, the tourism and antiquities minister, told state television before the camera panned across to show tourists queuing to enter the site. The cruise boat struck by the virus has been towed outside Luxor and placed under quarantine, state media reported. Those who tested positive were flown by military plane for quarantine in northern Egypt. Football matches in Italy\u2019s topflight Serie A division have kicked off inside empty grounds this afternoon despite a call by the Italian Minister of Sport, Vincenzo Spadafora, for the cancellation of all games until further notice. Spadafora said that it made no sense to put at risk the health of players, officials, fans and others. The news filtered through as players from Parma and Spal were already on the pitch in their clash in Parma today. They were invited to return dressing room and the game has been delayed. The match eventually kicked off at 1.45 pm. Milan versus Genoa and Sampdoria vs Verona have instead started at 3 pm. The \u2018derby of Italy\u2019 between Juve and Inter is set to be played on Sunday night. Britain\u2019s National Health Service needs more money to deal with coronavirus as a total of 18 people test positive for coronavirus in Scotland, Scotland\u2019s First Minister has said. \u201cI think it is pretty much inevitable that we will need additional resources for our National Health Service,\u201d Nicola Sturgeon told \u2018Sophy Ridge on Sunday\u2019 on Sky News. She added that \u201cthe pressures that are likely to come from coronavirus in the weeks ahead means that we will need to see additional resources so I very much hope that the budget has positive things to say about that.\u201d A total of 18 people have tested positive for coronavirus in Scotland, an increase of one since yesterday. Health authorities have carried out a total of 1957 tests by Sunday 8th March. Sturgeon said that \u201ca wealth of preparation\u201d is underway to deal with the outbreak in Scotland: \u201cWe are prepared, we are preparing all the time\u2026 there is a wealth of preparation underway, looking at how we better support vulnerable people, people who might be asked to self-isolate and who will be in a position of not being paid for the work that they\u2019re doing.\u201d \u201cIt is a serious situation we face and that\u2019s true of all of the governments across the UK but we\u2019re taking it seriously and we\u2019re doing everything possible to mitigate it as far as we possibly can.\u201d At least two people people being held in a UK immigration facility have been tested for coronavirus and have tested negative, according to the campaign group Detention Action, which says that detention centres will not be able to cope with the virus. All public events with more than 1,000 participants should be called off, Germany\u2019s Health Minister, Jens Spahn, has said. Adding that up until now organisers had been too reluctant to do this, he told news agency DPA: \u201cGiven how fast things are developing, that should change quickly.\u201d Under Germany\u2019s federal system, the health minister does not have the power to call off individual events, but a strong lead from the federal government typically encourages federal states to follow suit. Spahn also called for European collaboration on a bulked up centre for research into the identification, surveillance and prevention of infectious diseases, similar to Germany\u2019s Robert Koch Institute. Spain has also called for a similar EU initiative. One of five new cases of coronavirus in Peru includes a patient who had recently travelled to London, Peruvian health authorities have said. Peru\u2019s Ministry of Health (Minsa) confirmed that cases of the disease had risen to six in less than 48 hours and the patients were under home isolation, Health Vice Minister Nancy Zerpa announced. They include a case in the city of Arequipa, a 29-year-old Peruvian student who arrived from London on February 29 without presenting symptoms The decree imposing a lockdown for more than a quarter of Italy\u2019s population has now been officially approved by the government and checkpoints are expected to appear at toll booths, stations and other points of entry to Lombardy. It also provides for measures for all of Italy. Weddings and funerals are suspended throughout the country Movement in and out of Lombardy and 14 other central and northern provinces is prohibited. People will be allowed in and out for serious reasons, including work reasons, upon the authorisation of local authorities. The decree also puts a ban on all public events, the closure of cinemas, theatres and gyms. However, the effects of the decree on flights and trains are still not yet clear. Under the new general guidelines, local judicial authorities could decide whether to suspend flights. At the moment, it is still possible to travel by train and plane to Lombardy but, in the next few hours, checkpoints should be placed at toll booths, stations and airports. Public transport within the cities will instead remain guaranteed. A total of 273 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, health authorities have said in their latest figures, updating a number which had stood at 209. A total of 23,513 people had been tested by 9am on Sunday morning. Two people have died. The Department of Health says it ill be providing a regional breakdown later today A group of people released from quarantine after returning from a coronavirus-hit cruise ship have praised by Britain\u2019s Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, has for setting a \u201cgood example\u201d to the public. The group of 30 Britons and two Irish nationals were released from isolation at Arrowe Park Hospital in the Wirral today after having been given the all-clear from infection. They were repatriated from Japan last month having been passengers on the coronavirus-stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship. Around 700 people caught the illness while the ship was held in quarantine for several weeks - more than a quarter of the 2,600 people on board. Thanking Arrowe Park\u2019s staff and the quarantined group, Mr Hancock said: \u201cTackling coronavirus is a national effort and they have set a good example for the rest of the public as more people may need to self-isolate themselves at home. \u201cPublic safety is our top priority and we all have a part to play in containing the spread of the virus.\u201d Tens of tourists who flew from London to Hanoi last week are being quarantined across Vietnam over fears they may have been exposed to the coronavirus, report the Guardian\u2019s Rebecca Ratcliffe and Lam Le in Hanoi A British traveller, who is among those being isolated, said that he and his luggage had been sprayed with disinfectant and quarantined in a hotel room. He said was not sure how long he would be required to stay in the room, but that he is awaiting a test. It was hoped that Vietnam, which hadn\u2019t reported any new cases for several weeks, had managed to contain the virus, but several cases linked to a flight from London have emerged over recent days. On Friday, officials confirmed that a 26-year-old Vietnamese woman had tested positive after returning from a trip to London, Milan and Paris. A relative and her driver have since tested positive, as have 10 passengers who were also on the flight, according to Vietnamese media. This includes, six British, a Mexican and an Icelandic citizen. Authorities have since reportedly quarantined tens of passengers from the flight, as well as a further 127 contacts who may have been exposed. This includes 40 foreign citizens who are being isolated in Qu\u1ea3ng Nam province, home to tourism hot spot H\u1ed9i An, an ancient riverside town, as well as several people being quarantined in Ho Chi Minh city, Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean-Hu\u1ebf province, Hai Phong city and Kh\u00e1nh H\u00f2a province. In H\u1ea1 Long, a popular tourist destination apparently visited by 52 passengers from the flight, around 300,000 residents have been told to undergo a health check and complete a health declaration. Most of the travellers from the flight are understood to have since left, though those remaining have been placed in isolation at hotels. The US Army has decided to restrict travel to and from Italy and South Korea due to coronavirus outbreaks, and will also prohibit foreign troops from participating in US exercises, exchanges and visits in the most affected nations. The decision, described to Reuters by an Army spokeswoman, follows the confirmation on Saturday that two additional US service personnel have tested positive for the virus: a sailor in Italy and a Marine at Fort Belvoir, Virginia - an important military base in a Washington DC suburb. The NHS \u201calmost certainly does\u201d need more money to deal with coronavirus, the chair of Britain\u2019s Royal College of GPs has said. Martin Marshall told \u2018Sophy Ridge on Sunday\u2019 on Sky News earlier: It almost certainly does. This is a significant crisis for the health service, the health service is already under pressure as we know and if we are going to continue doing what we are doing in the health service and deal with coronavirus, it requires a significant amount of resource. More likely I suspect we will cut down on some of the routine work that is done by the health service to allow the NHS to focus on dealing with the coronavirus. He added that bringing retired doctors back into work was \u201ca good idea as long as we do it carefully\u201d: I think it is a good idea as long as we do it carefully. People are estimating that maybe 20% of the workforce might be out of action at any one time when the crisis reaches its peak\u2026 If that happens then we do need to expand the workforce in whatever way we can. Cycling authorities have postponed this month\u2019s Tirreno-Adriatico and Milan-San Remo races because of the coronavirus outbreak. The decision, which includes rescheduling the Tour of Sicily at the start of April, follows the Italian government\u2019s decision to suspend all sporting events that cannot be held in a closed arena until 3 April. The Tirreno-Adriatico had been due to start on 11 March, with Milan-San Remo on 21 March but organisers are looking for alternative dates later in the year. Teams including CCC, Astana, Ineos and Mitchelton-Scott had already withdrawn from a number of races. Meanwhle, in golf, next week\u2019s European Tour event in Nairobi and the Asian Tour\u2019s Royal\u2019s Cup 2020 in Thailand have been postponed indefinitely. The event in Nairobi has been called off after the Kenyan government decided to postpone all international meetings and conferences in the country for at least a month. Italian football\u2019s response to the coronavirus outbreak was thrown into further confusion on Sunday when Parma\u2019s home match against Spal was delayed by 75 minutes following an intervention by Italy\u2019s sports minister. Both teams\u2019 players were standing in the tunnel at the Stadio Tardini, preparing to start the game behind closed doors, when the referee called them back into the dressing room, having received the call that the minister for sport, Vincenzo Spadafora, and the Italian FA (FIGC) were considering a total suspension of the Serie A season. Instead, after a 35-minute delay, it was announced the game would go ahead along with, it is assumed, the rest of this weekend\u2019s fixture list. The game kicked off at 12.45pm GMT. Spadafora had said he supported a call from the Italian footballers association president, Damiano Tommasi, to avoid putting players at risk from the virus outbreak. It is only a matter of time until more European countries adopt the kind of aggressive steps that Italy is taking to combat the spread of the coronavirus, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has said. Italy, Austria\u2019s southern neighbour, imposed a virtual lockdown across a swathe of its wealthy north on Sunday including the financial capital Milan, in a drastic new attempt to try to contain a rapidly growing outbreak. Kurz told broadcaster ORF the situation in Austria - where health authorities have reported 104 confirmed coronavirus cases so far - was under control and the measures it has adopted were proper, although probably not the final steps required. Here\u2019s footage of Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, announcing a range of tough new measures in the early hours of Sunday to try to contain Italy\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, including the virtual lockdown of the country\u2019s wealthiest and most populous region. We\u2019re speaking to people living in the lockdown zone but would also like to hear from people who are on holiday there. If you are in the second group you can get in touch by responding to our calloutor via WhatsApp by clicking here or adding the contact +44(0)7867825056. Rishi Sunak, the man in charge of the British government\u2019s purse strings as Chancellor of the Exchequer, has promised to give the NHS \u201cwhatever it needs\u201d to tackle the coronavirus crisis, as he looks at loosening the fiscal rules to allow for more borrowing and spending. Before this week\u2019s budget, Sunak did not say how much in additional resources the NHS would get, but indicated the government was potentially willing to write a blank cheque to help the health service cope with a pandemic. Sunak refused to deny several times that he was looking at getting rid of the fiscal rules from the Conservative election manifesto, which commits him to balancing the books on day-to-day spending midway through this parliament. There is speculation that the coronavirus crisis gives the government a reason to throw out the fiscal rules set just a few months ago by Sunak\u2019s predecessor Sajid Javid. Sunak told the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show: \u201cI can say absolutely categorically the NHS will get whatever resources it needs to get us through this and to respond to the health crisis.\u201d Saudia Arabia has announced a temporary lockdown on the Qatif region, the kingdom\u2019s state news agency reports. The mayor of the South Korean city hardest hit by that country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak expressed cautious hope on Sunday that the numbers of new cases may be dropping, after the rate of increase slowed to its lowest in 10 days, Reuters reports. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Sunday 272 new coronavirus cases, for a total of 7,313 in the country. Two further deaths took the toll to 50, it added. The increase in cases was lower than the same period a day before, though health officials have warned that numbers could fluctuate as more tests are processed. In the city of Daegu, which accounts for as much as 75% of all of South Korea\u2019s confirmed cases, mayor Kwon Young-jin told reporters the number of new cases has dropped below 300 for the first time since Feb. 29, Yonhap news agency reported. Police and officials have been waiting at southern Italian transport hubs people who have been travelling south from Lombardy, the region which is due to become subject to a lockdown, according to the Guardian\u2019s Lorenzo Tondo. The Corriere della Sera newspaper has footage of officials in Hazmat suits testing people near buses. However, there do not appear to be any checks on people moving by car and the police checks were apparently not in force this morning. The announcement about Serie A football matches and coronavirus was made by the Italian sports minister in a Facebook post in which he said that it did not make sense to put players, referees and fans at risk while the authorities were asking citizens to make \u201chuge sacrifices\u201d to stem the contagion. Until now Italy\u2019s soccer association FIGC has said Serie A matches could be played without spectators, adding that any events would be stopped should any player test positive for the virus. All matches in Italy\u2019s topflight Serie A division should be cancelled until further notice, the Italian Minister of Sport has said minutes before Serie A games were due to resume in empty stadiums. Vincenzo Spadafora said that it made no sense to put at risk the health of players, officials, fans and others. The news filtered through as players from Parma and Spal were already on the pitch in their clash in Parma today. They were invited to return dressing room and the game has been delayed. Five Serie A matches were scheduled for Sunday, beginning with Parma and Spal at 12:30 local time and concluding with Juventus versus Inter Milan at 8:45 p.m. The wife of South Africa\u2019s first novel coronavirus patient tested positive on Sunday becoming the third confirmed case in the country, the health authority said. The AFP news agency reports that all three of South Africa\u2019s confirmed cases were in a group of 10 people who had travelled to Italy. Spain has now confirmed 589 cases of the coronavirus - a rise of 159 from Saturday - along with 13 deaths, the Guardian\u2019s Sam Jones reports from Madrid On Sunday morning, the regional government of the southeastern region of Murcia reported its first case of the illness in a 27-year-old woman who had recently travelled to Madrid. The area in and around the capital has so far logged 175, cases - the highest regional count in the country. Residents in parts of the small town of Haro in the northern Spanish region of La Rioja remain in lockdownafter health authorities ordered them to stay at home following the discovery that 39 people in La Rioja had contracted the virus after attending a funeral in the nearby Basque country a fortnight ago. The regional and central government have deployed police to Haro to make sure that people in affected neighbourhoods observe the isolation protocol. Spain\u2019s health minister, Salvador Illa, sought to play down suggestions that parts of Haro were in quarantine when he provided an update on Sunday morning. \u201cThere\u2019s no quarantine in Haro,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat there is is an important number of people under active vigilance in their homes.\u201d Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health alerts and emergencies, said that the situation remained under control, pointing out that 60% of cases of the virus were confined to just three of Spain\u2019s 17 autonomous regions, while 70% were in four. Sim\u00f3n also said that Italy\u2019s drastic lockdown of million of people in the north of the country would help contain the spread of the virus. \u201cSo far, we don\u2019t have uncontrolled transmission chains in the majority of the situations. The only risk areas are the Basque country and Madrid, but investigations to date suggest that transmission isn\u2019t rising or that if it is, it\u2019s related to focal points that have already been detected.\u201d Ikea is reopening nine of its stores in China this weekend after reopening five last week. The furniture company closed all 30 in the country in January due to the coronavirus outbreak. Amid some criticism of the Italian government\u2019s handling of the situation in the north of the country, there is support for its actions from the head of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Tedros Ghebreyesus. He also points out today is the first time that 100 countries around the globe are reporting cases of the new virus. A major political row is breaking out in Italy, where the authorities fear people fleeing from Lombardy, formally locked down by decree but still not subject to a full enforcement, may spread the virus further. The Governor of Puglia, Michele Emiliano, has signed an order today, which obliges all inhabitants of Puglia, arriving from Lombardy in the coming hours, to quarantine. \u2018\u2019Get off at the first train station, don\u2019t take planes to Bari and Brindisi, go back by car, get off the bus at the next stop,\u2019\u2019 wrote Emiliano on Facebook, addressing Apulians, living in Lombardy. \u201cDo not bring the Lombard, Venetian and Emilian epidemic to your Puglia. You are carrying the virus into the lungs of your brothers and sisters, your grandparents, uncles, cousins and parents.\u201d Thousands of people are literally at risk of getting stuck in northern cities. \u2018\u2019My brother went to Brescia to look for work, a month ago,\u2019\u2019 says Primo Giarratano, a 32-year-old Sicilian. \u201cWe lived together. We rented a house in Brescia. I then returned to Sicily because I had finished my job, but he remained there, alone. And now he can\u2019t come back. We don\u2019t know what to do\u201d Like other states, the official travel advice from Britain\u2019s Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) still does not warn against all travel to Lombardy, the northern region of Italy that has been entirely \u2018locked down\u2019 but we\u2019re told that the guidance to travellers remains under review today. The FCO page currently states: \u201cThe FCO advise against all but essential travel to 10 small towns in Lombardy (Codogno, Castiglione d\u2019Adda, Casalpusterlengo, Fombio, Maleo, Somaglia, Bertonico, Terranova dei Passerini, Castelgerundo and San Fiorano) and one in Veneto (Vo\u2019 Euganeo), which have been isolated by the Italian authorities due to an ongoing outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19).\u201d Authorities have banned activities in Romania involving more than 1,000 people, according to Romanian media reports. The restrictions come into force today and are valid until March 31, when a new assessment will be made. The number of confirmed cases in the country is 13. Raed Arafat, Romania\u2019s secretary of state, reiterated a call to Romanians in Italy not to come home for a holiday period if they are in risk areas. Iran\u2019s health ministry has said that total coronavirus cases have risen to 6,566, while the death toll has reached 194, according to state television. On the other side of the Persian Gulf, Saudi Arabia\u2019s authorities have recorded four news cases of the coronavirus, taking the total of infections to 11, the kingdom\u2019s health ministry said on Twitter on Sunday. The new four individuals, which include three women, have interacted with another case reported previously who had been in Iran but did not disclose his travel details to the authorities. The individual traveled from Iran via the United Arab Emirates, the ministry said. A student at Oxford University student has tested positive for the new coronavirus, the institution\u2019s vice chancellor has told staff and students in an email. In an email, which someone has kindly passed on to me, Louise Richardson wrote to students and colleagues on Saturday to say that the English national public health agency, Public Health England (PHE), had confirmed the student had tested positive after returning from travel overseas. She added that she was constrained in what she could say but the student was currently self-isolating and did not attend any university or college events after they fell ill. \u201cAs a result, PHE has advised that the risk to other students and to staff is very low and that university and college activities can continue. They have also advised that we do not need to take any additional public health actions in light of this case. \u201cIt is important to bear in mind that PHE does not consider individuals infectious until they develop symptoms. Colleagues have been working with PHE to ensure that anyone who was in contact with the student after they fell ill has been notified and is able to gain access to both information and support. The university had anticipated this eventuality and had been preparing for it for some weeks now, added Richardson. \u201cMoreover, given the rate of infection across the country, there will in all likelihood be other cases. I know this news will be upsetting to some of you. Support will be available through Student Welfare and through Colleges and Departments.\u201d It\u2019s International Women\u2019s Day and participants in events on the streets largely don\u2019t seem to be letting coronavirus get in the way. You can follow our coverage here of a separate liveblog as millions of women around the world march and gather to protest against gender inequality and gender-based violence. In France, activists from the women\u2019s movement FEMEN in Paris, France, appeared to reference the outbreak of coronavirus in their demonstration. Many held placards comparing the virus to gender inequality, with slogans reading \u201cstop the patriarchal virus\u201d and \u201cstop the patriarchal pandemic\u201d, whilst dressed in outfits which resemble hazmat suits. IWD has taken place each year on March 8 since 1977, when the UN General Assembly invited member states to announce the day as the UN Day for women\u2019s rights and world peace. This year\u2019s theme is \u201cI am Generation Equality: Realizing women\u2019s rights\u201d. It is still unclear if flights to and from Lombardy will be banned but the Guardian\u2019s Lorenzo Tondo has more detail now on the Italian government decree that has locked down more than a quarter of its population in a bid to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. It will allow people to enter and exit the red zones for serious reasons, bans all public events and closes cinemas, theatres and gyms. Religious ceremonies such as funerals and weddings will be banned. Discos and pubs remain closed throughout the country. Anyone who violates the restriction on entering select provinces of northern Italy faces three months in jail. In all the areas covered by the decree, including towns in the northern regions of Emilia-Romagna, Veneto and Piedmont, schools will be closed at least until 3 April, as will museums, gyms and swimming pools. Leave is cancelled for all healthcare workers. The decree includes using the armed forces for border control and access points such as train stations and motorway entrances and exits in the region. So far the decree has been signed by the prime minister, but it will not be an official executive order until the council of ministers approves it. Further details on train and air service will be released in the coming hours. Conte signed the decree In the early hours of Sunday, enacting forced quarantine for the region of Lombardy \u2013 home to more than 10 million people and the financial capital, Milan \u2013 and 14 other provinces, totalling around 16 million residents. Thousands of people left Lombardy on Saturday night, before the decree was made official, crowding the motorways and train stations in the region, which will be locked down until 3 April. Indonesia confirmed on Sunday that two more people had tested positive for the coronavirus, taking the total of confirmed cases in the country to six. One of the Indonesians is a 36-year-old male, a crew member on the Japan-docked Diamond Princess cruise ship where he contracted the virus, Health Ministry official Achmad Yurianto told a news briefing, according to Reuters. The other Indonesian, a 55-year-old male, contracted the virus locally in Jakarta, Yurianto said. \u201cBoth of them are in stable condition. They do not have fever, don\u2019t need intravenous drip, oxygen, are not coughing, and don\u2019t have a cold,\u201d he said. Countries responding to a coronavirus outbreak should be prioritising support for their health workers, a World Health Organisation (WHO) doctor has said. Dr Margaret Harris told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show: \u201cThey should be your number one priority. All your health staff, your nursing staff, your allied professionals, the people cleaning the wards. \u201cI\u2019m a doctor myself, but it\u2019s not just the doctors who need special treatment, special consideration. \u201cThey need all the protective equipment, they also need training, they also need access, to know how to do the swab, when to do the swab, where the testing comes from. \u201cAnd they need back-up, they need other people to come and do the shifts. If they\u2019re working massively, they are tremendously at risk.\u201d Flights appear to be operating as normal from Milan\u2019s Linate Airport, the third international airport of the city. Ben Roeves, who is travelling back to the UK today from Italy and cleared security a little earlier at the airport, was able to change his British Airways flight in order to come back to the UK earlier than his scheduled flight later this evening after seeing the news this morning about the lockdown of Lombardy. He told me he had seen more airport staff, security and military than passengers although the numbers on the security front were no more than normal in comparison to other trips. Another reader, a retired teacher, 69, living in Milan with his wife, 68, has got in touch to say that their niece travelled to her family home in Naples yesterday and said that the train was so crowded that people were sitting and lying in the corridors. \u201cPanic in Milan does not seem to be widespread, however. While relatively few people can be seen on the streets, probably due to the fact that cinemas, theatres and museums, doctors\u2019s surgeries, even churches, are all closed, while caf\u00e9s and restaurants have limited opening hours, other signs of general panic (hoarding in supermarkets, etc) seem to have abated, thanks also to well-organised home delivery offered by several food chains, who are not suffering from any shortages.\u201d He was more concerned about the preoccupation with the risk of damage to the economy, rather than fear of the virus, which appears to be really dangerous mainly for elderly people with other health complications. Iran has stopped all flights to Europe, Iran\u2019s IRNA news agency reports. Customers can get refunds on their tickets. Here\u2019s a tweet from Iran\u2019s ISNA news agency announcing the suspension Speaking at a televised press conference on Friday, a spokesman for Iran\u2019s health ministry said the authorities had confirmed 4,747 cases of the virus, a rise of 1,234 on the day before. While he did not elaborate on the threat to use force, the spokesman acknowledged that the virus was present in all of Iran\u2019s 31 provinces. The British government is being urged by a transport union to convene an emergency transport sector summit on tackling the coronavirus outbreak and consider overnight \u201cdeep cleans\u201d of trains. Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) has written to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps to call for a co-ordinated response across the public transport network on how the threat posed by the virus is tackled. Cortes said the aim of the summit would be to put in place measures to reassure transport workers and passengers to keep trains, buses, trains and trams running. He said: \u201cWe want to ensure our transport networks are resilient in the face of a possible epidemic and urgently need consistent advice and a proactive plan of action for public transport.\u201d He also asked the Government to look into prevention measures across public transport, including the possibility of cleaning teams conducting overnight deep cleans of train carriages and stations, focusing on frequent touch areas such as handrails and ticket machines. The first confirmed case of someone with coronavirus on the Balearic island of Menorca is a doctor at the Mateu Orfila hospital, according to authorities quoted in local news reports. Across Spain, El Pais reports that at least 523 people have been infected, while two new deaths in Vitoria and Madrid raised the number of deaths to ten on Saturday. In the town of haro, northern Spain, the Civil Guard has been deployed to watch over the home isolation of several infected people after they attended a funeral held two weeks ago in Vitoria. In Italy, a big question mark remains today over flights and trains from Lombardy, the region which has gone into lockdown. The Italian government has formally locked down more than a quarter of the population after prime minister Giuseppe Conte signed a decree enacting forced quarantine for the region of Lombardy \u2013 home to more than 10 million people and the financial capital, Milan \u2013 and multiple other provinces, totalling around 16 million residents. Guardian readers have been getting in touch to ask about that and we\u2019ll be keeping an eye on developments in relation to transport. While the decree has been signed by PM but it needs the approval by the Council of ministers and those issues have not been detailed. People last night were tweeting images and video meanwhile of what they said were members of the public rushing to catch trains out of the region. Nicola Sturgeon was speaking after Britain\u2019s chancellor of the exchequer, Rishi Sunak, told Sky News that his upcoming budget on May 11 would have new resources, to assist the UK\u2019s National Health Service (NHS). Sunak didn\u2019t give much away in terms of specific details, adding: \u201cFirst and foremost, supporting public services but also helping vulnerable people and also businesses to get through anything that might be coming our way... we stand ready to give the NHS whatever it needs.\u201d He said that he would say outline measures this week support businesses that may face \u201ccash flow\u201d problems due to the outbreak. A report that the UK faces a potential coronavirus death toll as high as 100,000 is based on \u201cworst case scenarios\u201d rather than forecasts, according to Scotland\u2019s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Sturgeon had been asked by Sophie Ridge on Sky News about a Sunday Times report today that UK Ministers are preparing for a potential coronavirus death toll as high as 100,000. The newspaper reports that officials in Whitehall last week began describing a 100,000 figure as the \u201ccentral estimate\u201d of the potential death toll, according to a source involved in the preparations, rather than the previously publicised worst case scenario of 500,000 deaths if 80% of the population were infected. Sturgeon, who will take part tomorrow in another meeting of the British government\u2019s Cobra emergency planning committee, chaired by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, said: \u201cThese kinds of figures are broadly in terms of the worst case scenario that we face but they are not forecasts.\u201d The death toll from the collapse of a hotel in China which was being used to quarantine people suspected to have coronavirus has rised to 10, Reuters reports, quoting Chinese state media. Earlier, the Ministry of Emergency Management said that six of 43 victims pulled from the rubble had died, with all but one of the remainder requiring treatment in hospital, and that rescuers were still searching for 28 more people. Chinese state media later revised the death toll to seven. The Xinjia Express Hotel in the city of Quanzhou, Fujian province, collapsed suddenly around 7:30pm on Saturday, with more than 750 medics and rescuers and 20 ambulances responding to the disaster. Grandparents are expected to come under pressure to step in to provide childcare if schools shut as a result of the coronavirus, but this could increase their already heightened risk of contracting the illness. Boris Johnson last week played down the prospect of widespread school closures, saying they should stay open \u201cif possible\u201d. But Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, has warned that in the event of a major epidemic, schools may have to shut \u2013 and if they do it will be \u201cfor quite a long period of time, probably more than two months\u201d. Schools are making plans for online lessons in the event of closures, but for working parents the crucial issue will be childcare. Many are likely to ask grandparents to help, which would be risky for older people, for whom the impact of the illness is greater. Justine Roberts, founder and chief executive of the online parents\u2019 forum Mumsnet, said there would be a \u201cmassive knock-on effect, with many parents simply unable to go to work\u201d if schools closed. There just isn\u2019t enough childcare capacity in the system to cope with hundreds of thousands of school-age children, not to mention not enough capacity in parents\u2019 wallets to pay for it. And of course large childcare settings would carry the same risks as schools when it comes to spreading the virus. This is Ben Quinn picking up the live blog from London, from where we will be covering developments in the UK and around the world. As usual you can email me at ben.quinn@guardian.co.uk with any news tips or tweet me at @BenQuinn75 Britain\u2019s Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, is speaking today about his plans for upcoming budget, which has been overshadowed by planning for the outbreak, while Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s First Minister is also on the airwaves later. Elsewhere, a major spotlight continues to fall on Italy, where a lockdown decree is affecting millions of people in Lombardy. A busy few hours. An area containing about 16 million people is now facing lockdown in Italy, after the prime minister, Guiseppe Conte, signed a decree ordering the quarantining of the entire Lombardy region and 14 provinces. Anyone who breaks the lockdown on entering select provinces of northern Italy faces three months in jail. The legislation is expected to be approved later on Sunday, the head of the civil protection agency said earlier, after the number of infections rose by more than 1,200 in the past 24 hours. In all the areas covered by the decree, including towns in the northern regions of Emilia-Romagna, Veneto and Piedmont, schools will be closed at least until 3 April, all museums, gyms and swimming pools will be also shut and leave is cancelled for all healthcare workers. Organisers of the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, said an attendee at its annual Washington-area conference last month has tested positive for coronavirus. The conference was attended by Donald Trump and Mike Pence. A US man in Washington DC in his 50s has tested positive, with no immediately identifiable point of contact with the virus. US authorities are tracking another cruise ship for potential infections. The ship may have shared crew with the Grand Princess. Asked about the development later on Saturday, Trump told reporters in Florida he was not concerned and planned to continue to hold political rallies. All experts in Australia, from the chief medical officer and the prime minister down, have reassured people that panic buying is not necessary and they are at no risk of running out of essential supplies such as toilet paper. North Korea has reportedly released more than 3,600 people who were quarantined over coronavirus. At least seven people have died in the collapse of the Xinjia Express Hotel, which was being used as a quarantine centre in eastern China. The number of people who have died from the coronavirus in the United States has climbed to 19, with about 400 confirmed cases. Colombia, the Holy See, Peru, Serbia, Togo and Bulgaria have reported their first cases of Covid-19. A Middle East markets update via the AP: Stock markets in the Mideast suffered sharp drops in early trading Sunday over fears about the new coronavirus and falling demand for crude oil amid a failure by Opec and allied nations to cut production. The Dubai Financial Market saw stocks drop by over 8% in a steep selloff. Boursa Kuwait stopped trading as shares fell below 7%. The Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange dropped by 6%. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Tadawul stock exchange fell more than 6% as the market opened. Opec and key ally Russia failed to agree on a cut to oil production on Friday. That saw crude oil prices, the bedrock commodity of the Mideast, drop. Benchmark Brent crude sold on Sunday for around $45 a barrel, down some 11% from the year prior. The demand for oil has dropped as air travel has been affected by the outbreak of the virus. Professor Yuen Kwok-yung from the University of Hong Kong, has been advising authorities on control measures in the city. According to a report in the South China Morning Post, Yuen said the worry for mainland China and Hong Kong was reverse-imported cases, even as the situation there improved as they moved towards Summer. \u201cWe think the epidemic will probably not come to an end,\u201d Yuen said. \u201cThere will be what we call reversed imported cases. In the beginning other countries feared us, now we fear them [for bringing in the virus].\u201d Yuen urged Hong Kongers to avoid travelling for the rest of the year at least, and to continue to practise good hygiene. \u201cIf everyone washes his or her hand, wears a mask all the time and maintains social distancing, the risk of infection will be lowered. It\u2019s a matter of compliance,\u201d Yuen said. \u201cWe cannot guard against the virus forever, but the longer we delay its spread, the higher the chances of getting a vaccine in time.\u201d Protesters are gathering in a Hong Kong suburb, demonstrating against the setting up of a treatment facility for Covid-19 cases, according to Hong Kong Free Press. There is a live stream of the rally, where riot police have just ordered people to disperse, here. From Reuters: The Maldives has curbed movement on several resort islands, authorities said on Sunday, after the country reported its first two cases of coronavirus. The two infected people, who are both staff at the Kuredu Island Resort, tested positive late on Saturday. They are believed to have caught the disease from an Italian tourist who has returned to Italy and tested positive there. There are more than 1,400 people on the island, split equally between guests and staff, according to the tourism ministry. \u201cThese two cases which tested positive are from a resort. They are employees of the resort and are now quarantined,\u201d said Ali Waheed, the tourism minister of the island nation, the economy of which is heavily dependent on foreign tourists. \u201cThe period for the temporary restrictions will be decided by the medical teams. Right now, we have identified people who were in contact with the patients and they are in self-isolation along with secondary contacts. At this time we can say that these individuals will be monitored for 14 days.\u201d Waheed said the country was still deciding whether tourists who were not in contact with the patients would be allowed to leave. It has banned passengers originating from or who had transited through or spent any time in Italy in the preceding 14 days, effective from Sunday. Australia\u2019s federal minister for industry, science and technology, Karen Andrews, has just given an update on efforts by Australian scientists to create a vaccine. The country was the first outside of China to be able to replicate the virus, Andrews said. \u201cWe are now working as hard and fast as we can to develop a vaccine that\u2019s currently undergoing testing at our specialised laboratories in Victoria.\u201d She said they\u2019d fast track it as much as possible, but they need to make sure the vaccine is \u201cfit for purpose\u201d. Other nations, such as the US, are also working on vaccines. She also urges Australians to stop panic-buying items, especially toilet paper. \u201cYou do not need to go out and buy toilet paper,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are adequate stocks and adequate manufacturing capacity in Australia. That is not going to be an issue.\u201d Andrews said there were concerns for industry, including logistics in getting (other) products in from China, and government departments were working to minimise impacts. \u201cMany of our food manufacturers have an inventory of four weeks plus, and have increased the level of their manufacturing over the last week in particular.\u201d Reuters is reporting six people are now confirmed to have died in the collapse of the Xinjia Express Hotel, which was being used as a quarantine centre. The Ministry of Emergency Management said 43 people had been retrieved from the rubble. It said six people had died, 36 were taken to hospital, and one required no treatment. Authorities were still searching for 28 people, the ministry said, giving a figure higher than the earlier reported figure of 19 missing. According to state media outlet Xinhua, the owner of the building had been summoned by police. Some keen eyes have noticed discrepancies in the advice on the World Health Organization website about how not to treat Covid-19. Tens of millions of students are stuck at home because their schools have been closed due to the virus spread. Many of them are doing online lessons run by their schools, and on this unprecedented mass scale there are a huge variety of new technologies and apps being used. And according to this report, students in Wuhan have found a way to exploit one. A 12th diagnosis has been confirmed in the Australian state of Victoria, in a woman from Indonesia aged in her 50s, health authorities have said. She flew from Jakarta to Perth on 27 February, feeling well, and began developing symptoms two days later. On 2 March the woman flew to Melbourne on Virgin Australia flight VA682, and saw a GP on 6 March. The GP ordered Covid-19 tests, which confirmed her as positive on Saturday. The woman is well, and is in self-isolation being cared for by family. She had also visited a Vietnamese restaurant in Melbourne. These are the areas covered by the Italian lockdown. The gates at Milan\u2019s main train station were closed ahead of the order to lock down Lombardy and 11 northern provinces, including the cities of Milan and Venice, in an effort to stop the spread of coronavirus. North Korea has reportedly released more than 3,600 people who were quarantined over coronavirus, according to reports. More on this from AFP: Pyongyang has imposed strict restrictions and closed its borders to try to prevent an outbreak and insists it has not had a single case of Covid-19. About 3,650 people quarantined in Kangwon and Chagang provinces were released as of Thursday, North Korea\u2019s state radio reported, according to Yonhap news agency. It follows the official KCNA news agency stating on Friday that 221 out of 380 foreigners who were under \u201cstrict medical monitoring\u201d had been discharged from isolation. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, warned last month of \u201cserious consequences\u201d if the virus reaches his country, which has banned tourists and suspended international trains and flights. Pyongyang, subject to multiple international sanctions over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, has a weak medical infrastructure and analysts say prevention is its only option. Kim sent a personal letter to the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, on Thursday to \u201ccomfort\u201d South Koreans fighting the coronavirus outbreak raging in the country. South Korea \u2013 which reported 93 new cases on Sunday \u2013 has the largest number of cases in the world outside China, with 7,134. Two more people died, bringing the death toll to 50, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. New toilet paper limit in Australia due to panic buying Coles supermarket in Australia has introduced a new limit for toilet paper in response to widespread panic buying, which resulted in a number of scuffles in supermarket toilet paper aisles and two women being charged for fighting over roles. Last week the supermarket chain introduced a four packs per customer limit. As of Sunday, that limit has been lowered to one pack. In a statement, Coles said: We have asked our suppliers to focus on increasing production of larger pack sizes and we are prioritising the delivery of these packs to our stores, as a pack of 30 rolls should last an average family for around three weeks. The AMA president, Dr Tony Bartone, referred to the toilet paper wars in comments he made in Melbourne a short time ago about misinformation and inconsistent messaging causing panic around coronavirus: We have had situations around considerable amount of panic this week. Unexplained panic, hysteria bordering at times. We cannot have a situation where people are fighting in supermarket aisles for toilet paper and then at the same time look at the inconsistencies in messaging. We need to reassure the public and the community as a whole that the coronavirus is a virus with mild symptoms, largely. It is for small proportion of the population that is going to be a risk of any further complications. Meanwhile in Melbourne, the president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Tony Bartone, is addressing reporters in support of a Melbourne doctor who saw 70 patients in the week before he tested positive for Covid-19. The doctor had what he described as a mild cold when he returned from the US to Australia last Saturday and was still getting over that when he returned to work on Monday. He tested himself on Thursday, despite there being no requirement for people returning from the US to isolate themselves or test for coronavirus, and tested positive. The Victorian health minister, Jenny Mikakos, had said she was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d that a doctor would work with flu-like symptoms, given the global coronavirus outbreak, and suggested the medical regulator should review the doctor\u2019s actions. Dozens of doctors have since called for her to resign. Bartone said the doctor acted \u201cwithin good faith and informed clinical judgment to ensure he did not expose or did not cause any undue risk to the patients he was treating\u201d. So we have a doctor acting completely within the guidelines at the time. We have a doctor who made a decision in a good faith about the needs of his patients and we have a doctor here who acted within the available information at the time. It is clearly very unfortunate and disappointing that the minister saw fit to make the comments she made yesterday. He said the minister should apologise, and that the advice to Australian doctors was \u201cinconsistent\u201d. It is not yet clear what the Italian lockdown will mean for the Formula One season, which is due to open with the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne next weekend. Organisers of the Australian event have been adamant that the race would go ahead despite travel concerns around the Ferrari team, which is headquartered in Maranello, about 18km outside Moderna, within the area covered by the lockdown. Reuters has some more details: The Italian government will adopt tough measures to try to contain the spread of coronavirus, including telling people not to enter or leave the hardest-hit region of Lombardy, according to a draft decree seen by Reuters. So far only a few limited areas of northern Italy, known as \u201cred zones\u201d, have been quarantined, but in a dramatic escalation the draft tells people not to enter or leave Lombardy or 11 provinces in other regions. The legislation is expected to be approved later on Saturday, the head of the civil protection agency said earlier, after the number of infections rose by more than 1,200 in the past 24 hours. In all the areas covered by the decree, including towns in the northern regions of Emilia-Romagna, Veneto and Piedmont, schools will be closed at least until 3 April, all museums, gyms and swimming pools will be also shut and leave is cancelled for all healthcare workers. The lockdown confirmed by the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, applies to Lombardy, the capital of which is Milan, as well as areas around Venice, Parma, Moderna and other major northern cities and alpine ski resorts. Anyone who breaks the lockdown on entering select provinces of northern Italy faces three months in jail. There are reports the lockdown includes all public activities, including weddings and funerals. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, announced early on Sunday that the entire region of Lombardy and a number of provinces in other regions were put into lockdown as the coronavirus continued to spread throughout the country. Earlier reporting said the decree would ban all public events, closing cinemas, theatres, gyms, discos and pubs. The new measures will apply to more than a quarter of the Italian population \u2013 about 16m people \u2013 and will be in force at least until 3 April. The region of Lombardy is home to more than 10m people. Italy has confirmed 5,883 cases, with more than 1,200 reported in a single 24 hours. The spread shows no sign of slowing. The northern regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto are the hardest hit, representing 85% of cases and 92% of recorded deaths. On Chinese social media the hashtag #when will Hubei be unblocked has been read more than 100m times. From AFP: For days now, several cities at the heart of China\u2019s deadly coronavirus epidemic have not recorded any new infections, so residents such as factory worker Tang Wushan have a message for the authorities: it\u2019s time to lift their quarantine. Tang lives in central Hubei province, whose nearly 60m residents have been under lockdown since late January as the government rushed to put a lid on a virus that first emerged in the regional capital, Wuhan. He has not stepped out of his home in rural Xiangyang for more than 40 days. \u201cIt\u2019s been too long,\u201d the 30-year-old said, adding that he felt like he was \u201cgoing to have a breakdown\u201d. On Sunday there were no new cases in the province for a third consecutive day except in Wuhan, which recorded 41 fresh infections. It is the first time that has happened since daily figures were released in January. There have been no new cases in Xiangyang for 12 consecutive days. Xianning city and Shennongjia forest district have not had new confirmed patients for 15 straight days. \u201cThere are some areas with no virus cases since the start of the outbreak. I think these areas could gradually reopen,\u201d Tang said. At least two people have been killed in the hotel collapse in eastern China overnight. The building was being used as a quarantine facility for people infected with Covid-19. AFP earlier provided further details. (It appears the two dead are in addition to the 48 rescued, and there are still 19 unaccounted for.) Rescuers are still searching for 19 people who remain trapped in rubble, state media reported. A total of 48 people have been rescued out of the 67 initially trapped when the building first crumbled, state broadcaster CCTV said Sunday. Footage circulating on Twitter-like Weibo showed rescue workers combing through the rubble of the 80-room Xinjia hotel in coastal Quanzhou city in the dark as they reassured a woman trapped under heavy debris and carried wounded victims into ambulances. Other footage published by local media, purportedly from security cameras across the street, showed the entire hotel collapsing in seconds. The hotel\u2019s facade appeared to have crumbled into the ground, exposing the building\u2019s steel frame, and a crowd gathered as the evening wore on. China\u2019s ministry of emergency management said about 200 local and 800 Fujian province firefighters had been deployed, with 11 search and rescue teams and seven rescue dogs, according to Xinhua. Quanzhou authorities said ambulances, excavators and cranes had also been rushed to the site. Representatives from Beijing are also en route to Quanzhou, Xinhua reported. In the US, via Reuters: a man in his 50s has tested positive, with no immediately identifiable point of contact with the virus. A person in Washington, DC, has had a \u201cpresumptive positive test\u201d for the coronavirus, mayor Muriel Bowser said on Twitter on Saturday. In a news conference later on Saturday, Bowser said the affected person is a male in his 50s who is a resident of the district. He began exhibiting conditions in late February although he appears to have no record of international travel or close contact with persons known to have the virus, Bowser said. He remains in hospital. \u201cWith his test yielding a presumptive positive, DC health has begun investigating in keeping with the CDC\u2019s guidelines,\u201d Bowser said. The DC government is also aware of another unnamed person who recently visited DC and was diagnosed with the virus at a Maryland hospital. That case is also being investigated by health professionals to understand the person\u2019s exposure to other residents. \u201cOur message to DC residents continues to be: help us prevent the spread of germs and stay informed,\u201d she said. Also in DC, a marine at Virginia\u2019s Fort Belvoir became the first military case of coronavirus reported inside the US. The marine was being treated at Fort Belvoir community hospital, south of Washington, and had recently returned from an overseas assignment, a Pentagon spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, said on Twitter. A man who tested positive for Covid-19 in Tasmania, Australia, ignored an instruction to self-isolate after being tested at the Royal Hobart hospital on Friday, local media is reporting. Instead he went to public places and worked his Saturday shift at the Hotel Grand Chancellor. The man, aged in his 20, arrived in Hobart on 26 February after travelling from Nepal and Singapore and returned a positive test to the virus on Saturday. Authorities are working to determine if any of his colleagues need to self-isolate. In the US, via Reuters: Organisers of the conservative political action conference, or CPAC, said an attendee at its annual Washington-area conference last month has tested positive for coronavirus. \u201cA New Jersey hospital tested the person, and CDC confirmed the positive result,\u201d said a statement by the American Conservative Union, the host of the event. The conference was attended by numerous high-profile conservative political figures, including the US president, Donald Trump, and vice president Mike Pence. The organiser said the affected person had \u201cno interaction\u201d with Trump or Pence and did not attend events in the conference\u2019s main hall. The conference took place on 26-29 February in Fort Washington, Maryland, just outside the District of Columbia. Asked about the development later on Saturday, Trump told reporters in Florida he was not concerned and planned to continue to hold political rallies. AFP reports Bulgaria has confirmed its first cases of the virus: a 27-year-old man and a 75-year-old woman. Neither had travelled recently or been in contact with anyone who had returned from a country with a coronavirus outbreak, Bulgaria\u2019s chief state health inspector, Angel Kunchev, said. \u201cSamples from two patients \u2013 a man from the northern town of Pleven and a woman from the central town of Gabrovo \u2013 tested positive,\u201d the director of the national centre of infectious and parasitic diseases, Todor Kantardzhiev, said. Both were tested as a preventive measure after being hospitalised several days ago with severe respiratory problems. Their condition has improved and both will undergo further tests overnight to verify the result. Authorities said they had already tracked down and started testing anyone who had been in contact with the pair \u2013 about 40 people in total \u2013 to identify a possible \u201cpatient zero\u201d. US authorities are tracking another cruise ship for potential infections, according to vice-president Mike Pence, who is leading the US\u2019s response. The ship that may have shared crew members with a ship carrying people who tested positive for Covid-19, Pence said on Saturday. \u201cWe are tracking at this point a ship that may have shared crew with the Diamond Princess or the Grand Princess and we\u2019ve taken decisive action to hold until we do a full medical assessment of the crew on that ship,\u201d Pence said after a meeting with cruise line industry officials. He did not identify the ship being tracked. A 64-year-old man died in Argentina as a result of the new coronavirus, the first such death in Latin America, health authorities announced on Saturday. South Korea reported 93 new cases of the virus on late Saturday, bringing the total to 7,134. It is the largest outbreak outside of mainland China. Edit: This post was updated to clarify the 93 new cases were in addition to cases earlier reported for Saturday. The Australian health minister, Greg Hunt, has just addressed the media in Frankston, a suburb of Melbourne. He said the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Australia had risen to 74, including two members of the Australian defence force. He also commented on the death of an 82-year-old man in Sydney, one of the residents of the BaptistCare Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged care home, and the third person to die after testing positive to Covid-19 in Australia. \u201cThat\u2019s just a great loss to him, his family, to all of the community, which will feel this loss,\u201d he said. Hunt urged people to be \u201ctheir best selves\u201d in what seems to be an oblique reference to the toilet paper wars. \u201cOnly two months ago, as a nation, we faced the great challenge of the bushfires,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we rose. We were our best selves, and this is the time to be our best selves and to let our better angels prevail. \u201cAnd our job, working with the states and territory, but working with the community, is to make sure that we are not just prepared, but that we are unified. \u201cAnd so there have been some things which have occurred in recent days which have not been our best selves. But it was only two months ago, as I say, that as a country, the spirit of the volunteer, the spirit of the CFA and the RFS and our emergency service.\u201d Hunt returned to this point a lot, comparing the spirit required in response to the global coronavirus outbreak to that seen in response to the Australian bushfires. (You will recall the Australian government was heavily criticised for its management of that crisis.) He also announced that the Australian government had secured an additional 54m face masks for its national reserve and said that no primary health network in Australia had exhausted its first round of masks. So that means that, contrary to reports from GPs that they are struggling to get the appropriate personal protective equipment. Hunt said there may have been some miscommunications which meant that busy medical practices \u201cmay not have realised that they\u2019ve had that\u201d. Hunt was asked to comment on a spat unfolding in Victoria between the health minister, Jenny Mikakos, and GPs, who were incensed at her comments that she was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d a GP who was later diagnosed with Covid-19 had gone to work with cold- and/or flu-like symptoms. Hunt drew on the bushfire analogy again: \u201cOver summer our firefighters and our emergency service workers were our heroes. In the coming months it will be our health and medical service workers who will be our national heroes. So we need to support them equally.\u201d Still in Australia, authorities are asking people who travelled on two flights between Canberra and Sydney on 28 February and sat in particular rows to self-isolate and call the public health line on 1300 066 055. Flight one: 6.45am QF1509 Sydney to Canberra, rows 2-6 Flight two: 2.35pm VA651 Canberra to Sydney, rows 3-7 \u201cAnyone else travelling on these flights in other rows are not considered to be close contacts and should monitor their health until 13 March and to contact their GP for assessment and testing if they develop any symptoms.\u201d On Sunday health authorities in mainland China reported 44 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, and 27 deaths (all in the Hubei province). The previous day had seen 99 new cases and 28 deaths. China has now reported 80,695 confirmed cases, and 3,097 deaths since the start of the outbreak. A 38-year-old woman who recently travelled from London to Queensland via Dubai has been diagnosed with Covid-19. Health authorities in Gympie say the woman has been transferred to an isolation unit at a hospital. While other passengers are at low risk, authorities are tracing people who were on board her flight and sitting in the two rows in front and behind her, on Qantas flight QF2 departing on 29 February from London to Singapore, then QF52 from Singapore arriving in Brisbane on 2 March. They are also doing the same for passengers on the flight of another man since diagnosed, Thai Airways flight from Thailand to Brisbane TG473 on 26 February. The University of Oxford has revealed its first case of a student testing positive for Covid-19. Louise Richardson, Oxford\u2019s vice chancellor, announced to staff on Saturday evening (UK time) that a student has tested positive for the virus but ruled out closing any university facilities or accommodation. \u201cI am writing to let you know that Public Health England has confirmed that one of our students has tested positive for coronavirus (Covid-19) after returning from travel overseas,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cI am constrained in what I can say at the moment but I am glad to report that the student self-isolated as soon as they developed symptoms and did not attend any university or college events after they fell ill. As a result, PHE has advised that the risk to other students and staff is very low and that university and college activities can continue.\u201d Richardson said PHE advised the university not to take \u201cany additional public health actions\u201d as a result of the student\u2019s positive test. Last week Richardson warned that \u201cmany of our Chinese and other Asian students and staff have felt isolated or even suspect, especially when wearing face masks\u201d in Oxford. \u201cThis is a time for us to come together as a community and to support not shun one another,\u201d she said. Hello, this is Helen Davidson taking over the blog for the next few hours. Thanks to Calla for bringing us all the earlier updates. Johns Hopkins University, which has been tracking reports, says there have been 105,939 confirmed cases across 95 countries, with 3,559 deaths. More than 58,300 people have recovered. The World Health Organisation\u2019s dashboard has some slightly different numbers:103,168 cases of Covid-19 and 3,507 deaths. Italian authorities have announced they will lock down the whole region of Lombardy in their latest bid to stop the spread of Europe\u2019s worst outbreak of the virus. The northern regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto are the hardest hit, representing 85% of cases and 92% of recorded deaths. So far 5,883 people have been infected in the country and 233 have died. The number of cases jumped by more than 1,200 in 24 hours at the weekend. Australia\u2019s death toll has risen to three, with more than 70 confirmed cases of Covid-19. Five new countries \u2013 Colombia, the Holy See, Peru, Serbia, and Togo \u2013 have reported their first cases. Late last night a hotel in south-eastern China used as a quarantine centre for holding people who have arrived from coronavirus-hit regions collapsed, trapping dozens, according to the local government. The number of people who have died in the US has climbed to 19, with about 400 confirmed cases. There are fears for thousands of people on a cruise ship held off San Francisco where 21 people have been diagnosed with the illness. Police in New South Wales have charged two women over an altercation at a supermarket at Chullora in Sydney yesterday. The women allegedly fought over some of the supermarket\u2019s dwindling supplies of toilet paper. Toilet paper has been selling out across Australia in a wave of panic buying over coronavirus. Stocks of dried pasta, hand soap, and over-the-counter painkillers are also rapidly selling out. Here\u2019s the NSW police statement: Just after 7am (Saturday 7 March 2020), police were called to a Chullora supermarket following reports of an altercation in an aisle over toilet paper. Staff intervened, separating the women and police were notified. Officers from Bankstown police station attended and spoke to a 49-year-old woman, who had allegedly been assaulted. She was uninjured. About 8pm, two women attended Bankstown police station and spoke with investigators. Today (Sunday 8 March 20120), two Bankstown women, aged 23 and 60, were issued court attendance notices for affray. Both are due to appear at Bankstown local court on Tuesday 28 April 2020. All experts in Australia, from the chief medical officer and the prime minister down, have reassured people that panic buying is not necessary and they are at no risk of running out of essential supplies. If required to self-isolate for 14 days, the Red Cross and other organisations can deliver essential supplies to the homes of people who may not have two weeks worth of food and toilet paper on hand. We are only just starting to see the scale of the economic effect that the coronavirus will have on the tourism industry. Aaron Smith filed this report on what is happening on the ground in Cairns, a Queensland town that relies heavily on international tourism, particularly Chinese tourists. One travel agent told him: Without a doubt everyone is feeling the pinch of the coronavirus, 100%. I don\u2019t have any figures but just from conversations with people they are all suffering, a lot of suppliers are having problems. You just have to look at the number of specials businesses are offering at the moment. That tells you straightaway numbers are down and that people are struggling ... A lot of the hotels here are doing it tough. I know of one large hotel that is running at under 10% occupancy. This is normally a quiet time of year, but it\u2019s not normally this quiet. You can read Aaron\u2019s full story here. A not surprising phenomenon: A vaccine for Covid-19 is, at the most hopeful estimates, about 18 months away from being available for public use. But you can get a flu vaccine and you should. It could prevent you from having the double whammy of influenza and coronavirus at the same time, and will also help relieve pressure on the health system. There is not a lot of detail around about the second confirmed case of Covid-19 in Tasmania. Tasmanian public health authorities confirmed the case on Saturday, and said the patient had been admitted to the Royal Hobart hospital. The first case, a man who travelled to Launceston from Iran, was reported on Monday, and about 50 suspected contacts of his have been tested for the virus. Here\u2019s the full update: AAP reports that the man who died was a resident of the Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged care home in Macquarie Park who tested positive after an outbreak at that centre was discovered last week. That makes him the second resident from that home to die after testing positive to coronavirus. A 95-year-old woman who resided in the same part of the home also died. Here is the report from AAP: A NSW man in his 80s has died after contracting coronavirus in his Sydney aged care home, taking the nationwide death toll to three. On Wednesday the 82-year-old was confirmed to have Covid-19 after he picked up the virus from an infected aged care worker in her 50s at Baptist Care\u2019s Dorothy Henderson Lodge in Macquarie Park. He died overnight in hospital, the chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said. The man\u2019s death follows that of a 95-year-old woman and fellow Dorothy Henderson Lodge resident and a 78-year-old man in Perth. As of Friday, four residents and three staff members at the aged care home had tested positive for the virus. In a statement on Saturday night, BaptistCare, which runs Dorothy Henderson Lodge, said: There are currently no new cases of Covid-19 at Dorothy Henderson Lodge. Daily reviews of infection control procedures continue to be in place. The residents and staff members currently hospitalised with Covid-19 are reported as being in a stable condition. NSW Health confirmed one more case associated with \u2013 but not in \u2013 the lodge outbreak on Sunday morning. That is a female health care worker at Ryde hospital in her 30s, who \u201cis a contact of a previously confirmed case from an aged care facility\u201d. Health authorities in New South Wales have confirmed that a man in his 80s has died in hospital after testing positive to coronavirus. It is the third death of a person with the virus in Australia, and occurred as the number of people who have tested positive to Covid-19 in Australia grows to more than 70. The NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, passed on her sympathies to the man\u2019s family. This is how the situation stands on Sunday morning: New South Wales has announced two new confirmed cases of coronavirus. They are a female health worker in her 30s, who appears to have caught the virus as a result of the outbreak at the Dorothy Henderson aged care home in north west Sydney; and a woman in her 50s who is a contact of a previously confirmed case. A man in his 80s in hospital in NSW has become the third confirmed death of a person who has tested positive to Covid-19. Tasmania has reported its second confirmed case, reporting that the patient has been admitted to the Royal Hobart Hospital. A Melbourne GP who treated 70 patients before testing positive to Covid-19 has demanded an apology from the Victorian health minister, who said his decision to work with \u201cflu-like symptoms\u201d was \u201cirresponsible\u201d and should be investigated by the regulator. The number of people who have died from the coronavirus in the United States has climbed to 19, with about 400 confirmed cases. Five new countries \u2014 Colombia, the Holy See, Peru, Serbia, and Togo \u2014 have reported cases of COVID-19. The number of cases globally, according to the latest World Health Organisation figures, is 101,927.",
