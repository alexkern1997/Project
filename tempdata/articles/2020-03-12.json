While some countries are moving faster than others, the analysis by the Carbon Tracker Initiative, a climate finance thinktank, found renewable power was a cheaper option than building new coal plants in all large markets including Australia, and was expected to cost less than electricity from existing coal plants by 2030 at the latest. Solar photovoltaics and wind energy were already cheaper than electricity from about 60% of coal stations, including about 70% of China\u2019s coal fleet and half of Australia\u2019s plants, it said.

Within Australia, black and brown coal provide about two-thirds of the electricity used in the five eastern states, but this is expected to fall as old plants continue to close. According to federal government projections, renewable energy is expected to meet nearly 50% of national demand by 2030. In 2018 the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change examined how rapidly global coal power needed to be phased out to give the world a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5C , a goal referenced in the Paris agreement. It found this would require a cut of 59% to 78% below 2010 levels by 2030, before declining to zero.",

      "body": "<p>Women and girls face a \u201cgrowing crisis\u201d of online harms, with sexual harassment, threatening messages and discrimination making the web an unsafe place to be, Sir Tim Berners-Lee has warned.</p> <p>The inventor of the world wide web said the \u201cdangerous trend\u201d in online abuse was forcing women out of jobs, causing girls to skip school, damaging relationships and silencing female opinions, prompting him to conclude that \u201cthe web is not working for women and girls\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe world has made important progress on gender equality thanks to the unceasing drive of committed champions everywhere,\u201d Berners-Lee wrote in an open letter to mark the web\u2019s 31st birthday on Thursday. \u201cBut I am seriously concerned that online harms facing women and girls \u2013 especially those of colour, from LGBTQ+ communities and other marginalised groups \u2013 threaten that progress.\u201d</p> <p>The warning comes a year after Berners-Lee launched the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/24/tim-berners-lee-unveils-global-plan-to-save-the-internet\">Contract for the Web</a>, a global action plan to save the web from forces that threaten to drag the world into a \u201cdigital dystopia\u201d. Without tackling misogynistic online abuse, the aims of the contract cannot be achieved, he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s up to all of us to make the web work for everyone,\u201d the letter states. \u201cThat requires the attention of all those who shape technology, from CEOs and engineers to academics and public officials.\u201d</p> <p>Berners-Lee highlights three areas that need \u201curgent\u201d attention.

      "bodyText": "Women and girls face a \u201cgrowing crisis\u201d of online harms, with sexual harassment, threatening messages and discrimination making the web an unsafe place to be, Sir Tim Berners-Lee has warned. The inventor of the world wide web said the \u201cdangerous trend\u201d in online abuse was forcing women out of jobs, causing girls to skip school, damaging relationships and silencing female opinions, prompting him to conclude that \u201cthe web is not working for women and girls\u201d. \u201cThe world has made important progress on gender equality thanks to the unceasing drive of committed champions everywhere,\u201d Berners-Lee wrote in an open letter to mark the web\u2019s 31st birthday on Thursday. \u201cBut I am seriously concerned that online harms facing women and girls \u2013 especially those of colour, from LGBTQ+ communities and other marginalised groups \u2013 threaten that progress.\u201d The warning comes a year after Berners-Lee launched the Contract for the Web, a global action plan to save the web from forces that threaten to drag the world into a \u201cdigital dystopia\u201d. Without tackling misogynistic online abuse, the aims of the contract cannot be achieved, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to all of us to make the web work for everyone,\u201d the letter states. \u201cThat requires the attention of all those who shape technology, from CEOs and engineers to academics and public officials.\u201d Berners-Lee highlights three areas that need \u201curgent\u201d attention. First is the digital divide that keeps more than half of the world\u2019s women offline, largely because it is too expensive, or they do not have access to the equipment or skills to use it. Second is online safety: according to a survey by Berners-Lee\u2019s Web Foundation, more than half of young women have experienced violence online, including sexual harassment, threatening messages and having private images shared without consent. The vast majority believe the problem is getting worse. The third threat comes from badly designed artificial intelligence systems that repeat and exacerbate discrimination. \u201cMany companies are working hard to tackle this discrimination. But unless they dedicate resources and diversify teams to mitigate bias, they risk expanding discrimination at a speed and scale never seen before,\u201d he writes. Amalia Toledo, a lawyer and activist at Fundaci\u00f3n Karisma, a Colombia-based group that lobbies for a safer internet, said that women\u2019s rights defenders and female journalists were targeted for abuse more than most. \u201cIf they are talking about issues that are pressing in the country, questioning the status quo, or denouncing what the state is doing, they will receive a lot of attacks, and there are more and more coordinated attacks from trolls, attacking their bodies, their families or relationships, and insulting how they look,\u201d said Toledo. \u201cTheir opinions are not even discussed.\u201d Fundaci\u00f3n Karisma runs an online campaign, \u201cAlerta Machitroll\u201d, which calls out misogynistic attitudes and abuse online. \u201cWhat victims are told all the time is \u2018Oh, that\u2019s nothing, ignore it, or close your account. But this has a big impact on people\u2019s lives. They want to control women, they want women to be silent,\u201d Toledo said. Berners-Lee said the coronavirus outbreak showed how urgent it was to take action. As workplaces and schools are forced to close, the web should be a \u201clifeline\u201d that allows people to keep working and children to be educated. He called on companies and governments to tackle online abuse as a top priority this year. More data needs to be collected and published on women\u2019s experiences online, while products, polices and services should all be designed based on data and feedback from women of all backgrounds, he said.

      "bodyText": "The Morrison government will waive the one-week wait period for the taxpayer-funded sickness allowance, after it dismissed calls from unions to force employers to give casual workers paid sick leave to self-isolate and prevent the spread of coronavirus. Innes Willox, the chief executive of Australian Industry Group, has accused unions of \u201copportunistically\u201d pursuing permanent changes, while the finance minister Mathias Cormann said the government would not \u201cfundamentally change the industrial relations system\u201d. But as the government unveiled its stimulus package worth $17bn on Thursday, the prime minister Scott Morrison announced the one-week waiting period for existing sickness benefits will be waived. Casual employees and independent contractors, including gig economy workers, do not receive paid sick leave in Australia but may qualify for the sickness allowance, a means-tested payment that provides up to $560 for singles without children and $1,010 for couples out of work due to illness. Currently, sick claimants face a waiting period of one week, plus an extra period if they have financial assets of $5,500 or more, up to 13 weeks for those with $18,000 or more. Morrison told reporters in Canberra the payment is \u201cgoing through a change of name\u201d \u2013 as it will be consolidated into the jobseeker payment \u2013 \u201cbut it\u2019s the same payment\u201d. \u201cIt is a Newstart-level payment and people who are casual employees that wouldn\u2019t be able to go to work or because they have to self-isolate or, indeed, have the virus, they would be able to access that payment,\u201d he said. Morrison said the \u201cnormal asset test rules\u201d will still apply \u2013 meaning those with liquid assets will face a wait list \u2013 as will the \u201cnormal processing time\u201d, which Anne Ruston has told him is \u201cabout five days\u201d. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has called for 3.3 million casual workers to receive paid sick leave from their employers, after similar moves in the UK to allow workers to self-isolate. Morrison noted the changes in the UK, but suggested Australia did not need to follow its lead because \u201cwe already have a system that deals with that\u201d. The ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, said the government announcement \u201cfalls far short of what is required\u201d. \u201cIn order for our country to slow down the spread of the virus and to stop infecting at-risk people, workers will need to make decisions to self-isolate,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must remove the financial penalty for people to make this decision. \u201cNewstart payments are far less than what nearly all casual workers are currently paid, so the financial penalty remains.\u201d The industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, met employers and unions on Tuesday and noted that casuals receive a loading of between 15% and 25% above the normal base rate of pay, in part to compensate for losing other benefits such as paid sick leave. On Wednesday the Greens federal party room decided that when parliament returns it will introduce a private member\u2019s bill to provide 14 days of paid sick leave for all workers, including casual employees, if they are unable to work due to Covid-19. That would include workers diagnosed with the virus, those required to self-isolate, people who are unable to attend their workplace as it has been shut down due to Covid-19, and those caring for another person. Anthony Albanese has said casual workers \u201cneed support\u201d because they \u201cshouldn\u2019t have to choose between doing the right thing by their coworkers and being able to afford to live and eat\u201d. Labor\u2019s shadow government services minister, Bill Shorten, told Sky News on Thursday that casual workers were \u201cin a terrible bind where they either self-isolate and starve or go to work sick\u201d. Shorten said although \u201cit\u2019s a cooperative effort\u201d the government \u201cshould be helping business, particularly small business, with this cost\u201d. \u201cIf you\u2019re on $20 an hour, and only get 25 hours a week \u2013 all of a sudden you\u2019re in the hole for $1,000 and you\u2019re got to pay your rent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to make sure casuals and part-timers don\u2019t get forgotten.\u201d Asked about union calls for paid sick leave, Cormann told Radio National: \u201cSome unions are seeking to fundamentally change the industrial system in the context of this and that\u2019s not something we\u2019ll be able to do.\u201d The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said the government \u201cmust not leave Australian workers to fend for themselves during this crisis\u201d. \u201cWorkers should be able to follow government advice to self-isolate without losing their income or their job,\u201d he said. Willox said the ACTU\u2019s proposal \u201cfor ongoing changes to workplace laws to provide an entitlement to special leave should be quickly ruled out\u201d. \u201cWhat is needed at this time is for the community to pull together, not for unions to use the coronavirus outbreak to opportunistically pursue ongoing changes to workplace laws,\u201d he said. \u201cEmployees who need to be absent from work due to the effects of the coronavirus outbreak already have a range of entitlements and protections to ensure that they are not treated unfairly. \u201cThese include various forms of paid and unpaid leave, as well as unfair dismissal laws and the general protections in the Fair Work Act.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "French Polynesia has announced the first case of Covid-19 in Tahiti, the first confirmed case of the coronavirus across the Pacific Islands. President Edouard Fritch, said that French Polynesian politician Maina Sage had been confirmed with the virus after returning from Paris on 7 March. Sage is resting at home in self-isolation in Papeete. French Polynesia, which comprises more than 100 islands, the largest of which is Tahiti, is a French overseas collectivity. Sage is French Polynesia\u2019s representative in the French National Assembly. During her time in Paris, Sage served on a National Assembly commission with France\u2019s culture minister Franck Riester, who has also been confined in France after contracting Covid-19. Announcing the first confirmed case of the coronavirus in Tahiti, President Fritch reassured people about government plans for monitoring, testing and isolation. He stated, however: \u201cI invite the population to avoid travel outside the country.\u201d Last month, French president Emmanuel Macron postponed a long-scheduled visit to French Polynesia because of the international health crisis. Macron was due to visit between 16-18 April for a summit with Pacific Island leaders, but his trip has been delayed until later this year. Regional organisations and Pacific governments are preparing for more cases of Covid-19 in the islands region, as the World Health Organisation declares a global pandemic. But many citizens in small island developing states are fearful of the potential stress on medical services. An epidemic of measles across the Pacific last year highlighted the potential for transmission of infectious diseases, adding to existing burdens on public health systems from non-communicable diseases. The international spread of the virus is starting to affect tourism in the islands \u2013 a vital source of revenue and employment. Many island nations have restricted visits by cruise ships and changed air schedules for their national airlines: Air Cal\u00e9donie International has announced it will reduce the number of scheduled flights to Melbourne and Osaka from May, while Air Tahiti Nui has reduced flights to Japan. In an unprecedented step, the Republic of the Marshall Islands restricted all airline travel into the country for two weeks, until 22 March.",

Ainhoa Moraza, having won the ball on the halfway line, cut past McManus and Houghton but onrushing goalkeeper Carly Telford, bidding to make the No 1 shirt her own, blocked the shot with her face. There was a late flurry of changes which included England and North Carolina player Alessia Russo picking up her first minutes of the tournament but it was perhaps wrong for Neville to throw on the youngsters in a game he needed to win. While they did that, Spain turned to an experienced duo on the bench, and they combined for the goal. A Jenni Hermoso corner was turned in powerfully by Alexia Putellas.",

      "bodyText": "In response to the coronavirus pandemic, the federal government has announced a $17.6bn economic stimulus package, equivalent to 0.9% of GDP. The package is \u201cfront loaded\u201d to ensure as much money as possible flows into the economy as quickly as possible, with $11bn of the package to be \u201cout the door\u201d by June. There are four elements of the stimulus package targeted at different areas of the economy, but the Coalition says it may spend more \u201cif more is needed\u201d. Who gets household stimulus payments? Around 6.5 million lower income Australians will receive a one-off $750 payment aimed at boosting domestic demand in the economy, costing the budget $4.76bn. The payment will be made to all social security, veteran and other income support recipients and eligible concession card holders. This includes those on Newstart, those who have commonwealth seniors health cards, and families receiving family tax benefits. Around half of those that will benefit are pensioners. Full details of which payment recipients are eligible are available here. What if I get more than one social security payment? Will I get more? No. There will be one $750 payment per eligible recipient. The payment will be tax-free and will not count as income for social security, farm household allowance and veteran payments. When will I get it? The payment will be made from 31 March this year. What if I am an employee and not receiving any social security benefits? Will I get anything? No. The government has focused most of the package on supporting business, with wage subsidies for small and medium-sized business and support for apprentices. It has targeted the household stimulus at low-income earners, as they are most likely to spend it. What does business get? Small and medium-sized businesses will receive up to $25,000 to cover the costs of employee wages and salaries, paid by the Australian Taxation Office based on tax withheld. This measure will cost $6.7bn and will happen automatically based on the business activity statements lodged by business. About 690,000 businesses employing around 7.8 million people are expected to be eligible for this payment. What about apprentices? Again, the government has focused its funding to employers, with the aim to keep people in jobs. This will see $1.2bn made available as a wage subsidy of 50% of the apprentice\u2019s or trainee\u2019s wage for up to nine months from 1 January 2020 to 30 September 2020. Where a small business is not able to retain an apprentice, the subsidy will be made available to a new employer that employs that apprentice, whether that is a large business or a registered training organisation. How many people will that help? The government estimates that up to 70,000 small businesses will access the incentive to support around 117,000 apprentices. What if I am a sole trader? Will I get anything? No. The government says those who don\u2019t employ anyone will benefit indirectly from the money flowing to low-income earners that they expect will quickly enter the economy. They will also be able to access business investment incentives. What are the business investment incentives? The government is allocating $3.9bn in incentives to encourage businesses to spend. This includes increasing the instant asset write-off, by lifting the threshold to $150,000 (from $30,000) \u2013 and making more businesses eligible to use it. It will also introduce a time-limited 15-month incentive to invest, by accelerating depreciation deductions. Who is eligible and how do these incentives work? Businesses with a turnover of less than $500m will be able to deduct 50% of the cost of an eligible asset on installation, with existing depreciation rules applying to the balance of the asset\u2019s cost. The investment measures are expected to support more than 3.5 million businesses (over 99% of businesses) employing more than 9.7 million employees. What is the point of this? The government wants business to keep spending by offering incentives to buy things such as cars and industrial equipment. The aim is to bring forward planned spending in the economy to help stave off recession and hopefully boost consumption to ensure people stay in work. What is the fund for severely affected regions? The government has also announced a $1bn fund to support regions most significantly affected by the coronavirus outbreak. It says that those \u201cdisproportionately affected\u201d include those heavily reliant on industries such as tourism, agriculture and education. How will this be spent? Can I apply to the fund? The government says details still need to be nutted out with the states, but has outlined a number of things that it will be used for. First, it will be used to waive fees and charges for tourism businesses that operate in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and for waiving entry fees for commonwealth national parks. It will also include additional assistance to help businesses identify alternative export markets or supply chains. Targeted measures will also be developed to further promote domestic tourism. The Australian Taxation Office is also providing administrative relief for some tax obligations for people affected by the coronavirus outbreak, on a case-by-case basis. The ATO will set up a temporary shop front in Cairns within the next few weeks with dedicated staff specialising in assisting small business. In addition, it will consider ways to enhance its presence in other significantly affected regions, making it easier for people to apply for relief. The ATO is considering further temporary shopfronts and face-to-face options. When asked how the fund would work, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said he envisaged that affected small businesses may be able to access grants similar to those provided to businesses in bushfire-affected regions. When will this fund be operational? The fund will be discussed with state and territory leaders at a meeting of the Council of Australian Governments on Friday, with money to be spent \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d, according to Treasury. Is that it? For now, yes. But the government is flagging that more stimulus may be necessary, with most of the measures \u201cscaleable\u201d. Morrison has flagged that the package could be updated in the May budget, depending on how the coronavirus plays out, and how severely the economy is affected as a result. \u2022 On 13 March 2020 this article was amended to clarify that it is holders of commonwealth seniors health cards \u2013 rather than seniors cards \u2013 who will get the $750 payments.",

      "bodyText": "Australia should immediately close schools and cancel mass events, the federal opposition has said, arguing the \u201cpublic health emergency\u201d requires urgent, even \u201cdraconion\u201d action. Shadow cabinet minister Bill Shorten said Australia needed to implement social distancing \u201cnot in weeks and months but in days\u201d. \u201cThe only way to make sure this pandemic is not worse than it otherwise could be is to have more drastic social distancing measures,\u201d he told Sky News. \u201cSingapore and Japan and parts of China, they are putting in more draconian reactions. As a result it would appear that some of their pandemic numbers are not going to be as bad as other countries who are doing too little too late.\u201d Shorten demurred on the question of Melbourne\u2019s Formula One Grand Prix, saying it was \u201cstarting already today\u201d. Enforced \u201csocial distancing\u201d \u2013 the closure of schools, universities, workplaces and cancelling of mass events \u2013 appears inevitable in Australia. Victoria\u2019s premier, Daniel Andrews, has been the most forthright in forecasting this, saying earlier this week, \u201cwe are going to reach a phase where there is such significant transmission of this virus \u2026 that we will need to take extreme measures\u201d. \u201cPart of that plan is the inevitability that we will get to the point that rather than one school being closed, all of our schools will be closed,\u201d he said. \u201cRather than people simply distancing themselves and quarantining themselves, we may have entire sectors, entire workforces, where people are working from home.\u201d But public health experts are arguing governments around Australia need to be enforcing these measures sooner, rather than waiting for the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic to worsen. They have warned consistently that Covid-19 has the potential \u2013 unchecked \u2013 to spread exponentially \u201cgradually, and then suddenly\u201d. Successive bodies of research suggest the sooner social distancing measures are implemented the more effective they are, and that leaving them too late can have catastrophic consequences. China \u2013 the centre of the global pandemic \u2013 had suffered more than 114,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 to the end of February 2020. But modelling by population mapping group WorldPop at the University of Southampton suggests that figure would have been 67 times higher \u2013 more than 7 million infections \u2013 without interventions such as early detection, isolation of the infected, and travel restrictions. But if the interventions could have been brought in a week earlier, 66% fewer people would have been infected, the analysis found. The same measures brought in three weeks earlier could have reduced cases by 95%. \u201cFrom a purely scientific standpoint, putting in place a combination of interventions as early as possible is the best way to slow spread and reduce outbreak size,\u201d Prof Andrew Tatem, at the University of Southampton, said. The WorldPop models simulated different outbreak scenarios in cities in mainland China. The models reveal how combinations of interventions, and when they are introduced, affects the speed and transmission of the disease. \u201cOf the three types of intervention we looked at, the early detection and isolation of cases likely had the strongest impact, and this is something that seems to have been in place early and been done effectively in the UK, compared with other countries such as the US,\u201d Tatem said. \u201cThe other two types of interventions \u2013 social distancing and travel restrictions \u2013 I think do need to be looked at seriously in the coming days.\u201d The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, found that early detection and isolation of cases had the largest impact in reducing cases. It also found that social distancing, such as cancelling large public events, working from home and closing schools, were predicted to have a much greater impact on containing the virus than travel restrictions.

Some countries are struggling with a lack of resolve.\u201d The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, is poised to move Britain to a critical new phase of the coronavirus action plan on Thursday, paving the way for social distancing, a day after the UK recorded its biggest single-day increase in Covid-19 cases. The UK government\u2019s Cobra emergency committee is expected to approve a decision to move the UK from a \u201ccontain\u201d phase of coronavirus response to \u201cdelay\u201d. The delay phase of the plan involves much of the same advice to people as the contain phase, including washing hands, quarantining and testing. But the government\u2019s coronavirus plan also states that possible actions include \u201cpopulation distancing strategies such as school closures, encouraging greater home working, reducing the number of large-scale gatherings\u201d.",

Questions raised about effectiveness The Trump administration has faced a raft of criticism over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, from the shortage of testing kits available in the US to Trump\u2019s own lack of urgency and downplaying the severity of the situation. The latest announcement is unlikely to quell that criticism, with questions lingering as to its effectiveness. Daniel Drezner, a professor of international politics at Tufts University, told the Guardian that limiting travel from Europe would \u201cbe a drop in the bucket\u201d compared with the number of cases that are already in the US. \u201cIt seems to me that Stephen Miller was looking for a boogeyman and he found one in Europe,\u201d he said, referring to Trump\u2019s aide, who is an anti-immigration hardliner and reportedly played a key role in crafting the speech.

Confusion at the airport Trump\u2019s sudden announcement sparked confusion among travelers from New York to California, some of whom were readying to board their flights as the president spoke. In San Francisco, a quiet confusion hung over the airport\u2019s international terminal on Wednesday night. Many who planned on flying to Europe that evening had no guarantee that they would be able to return to the United States once their trips had concluded, forcing some to make last-minute calls on dream vacations. Tulio Mello, 51, was preparing to board his flight to Istanbul when his friend called and told him not to get on the plane. \u201cThey had started announcing group one,\u201d he said.

They did not know when they cancelled the trip they had been planning since October that the ban did not apply to them, but looking back, they still think they made the right decision. \u201cIt\u2019s too much risk,\u201d Goundar said. \u201cEven if the vacation goes well, and we come back, either way you stay two weeks on vacation and then stay isolated for two weeks. It\u2019s too much.\u201d The couple felt a mixture of disappointment and anger over the whole ordeal \u2013 Chand had been on hold with Turkish Airlines for more than an hour, looking to get a refund for their tickets. Jennifer Tseeng, 36, and her husband were planning on flying to Valencia, Spain, for the Las Fallas festival. But then the festival was canceled because of coronavirus fears \u2013 and then came the travel restriction. \u201cThings are changing so quickly and you don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going to happen in the next hour or two hours,\u201d she said. The couple tried calling the airline, Lufthansa, but the customer service line was overrun, Tseeng said. They ended up driving to the airport to cancel their flight to Spain in person, but after Tseeng canceled the flight, they learned that the rule did not apply to American citizens like them. In the end, they felt it was best that they postponed their trip for now. \u201cIn one day, the whole situation completely changed,\u201d Tseeng said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t want to risk not being able to come back.\u201d Agencies contributed reporting",

At least, not yet.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt this point in time, today [12 March], the risk of getting it in the community is still very low,\u201d Collignon told Guardian Australia. \u201cThat may be different next week or the week after. My advice to people today is, there are risks from isolation too.\u201d</p> \n<p>Australia has, so far, had very low rates of community transmission, Collignon says. Strategies of detection and containment broadly appear to be working.

      "bodyText": "For those who are most at risk of severe illness from the coronavirus, it can be distressing to see the oft-quoted figure that 80% of people who contract Covid-19 experience only mild symptoms. Some people who are in vulnerable groups, or caring for people who are, have suggested they may go into preventative isolation to protect themselves and their family from a broader community that does not appear to be taking the threat seriously. We asked an infectious diseases expert if that was a recommended approach. Who is at greater risk from Covid-19? The groups with the highest risk of serious illness from Covid-19 are the elderly, people with suppressed immunities, and people with relevant co-morbidities. Data from China\u2019s national health commission shows that 80% of deaths were in people aged over 60, and 75% of people who died had preexisting health conditions. The risk increases for people aged over 70, and again for people aged over 80. People with chronic health conditions \u2013 heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, hypertension \u2013 are also at higher risk, as are people with suppressed immunity. In severe cases, the World Health Organisation says, the infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome and kidney failure. These can cause death. The three people who have died after testing positive for Covid-19 in Australia were aged over 70. Should people who are vulnerable go into preemptive isolation? No, says Australian National University professor of infectious diseases Peter Collignon. At least, not yet. \u201cAt this point in time, today [12 March], the risk of getting it in the community is still very low,\u201d Collignon told Guardian Australia. \u201cThat may be different next week or the week after. My advice to people today is, there are risks from isolation too.\u201d Australia has, so far, had very low rates of community transmission, Collignon says. Strategies of detection and containment broadly appear to be working. If that changes, a more aggressive approach to containment may be warranted. \u201cAt the moment the risk here is much lower than if you lived in Italy,\u201d Collignon says. \u201cThat may change in a week or in three weeks time. But it\u2019s not reasonable for people to become hermits for the next year. We don\u2019t know how long this is going to persist.\u201d It is possible, says Collignon, that the virus will not peak in Australia until the winter flu season. He says people should continue to go about their lives with a reasonable level of precaution, proportionate to the current risk. If a person is in an at-risk group, or caring for someone who is, he says they can practice social distancing rather than going into full home isolation. What is social distancing? Social distancing is one step back from home isolation. It means you avoid gathering where there are likely to be large groups of people, stand at least one metre away from people who are showing signs of being sick or who have recently travelled overseas, and generally pull back on non-essential mingling. Both the Victorian and New South Wales governments have indicated they might move to cancel mass gatherings, or close schools, if the spread of community transmission necessitates those kind of containment measures. The most important advice for people who face a higher risk of a serious illness from Covid-19, and people caring for others in those groups, is to wash their hands frequently and distance yourself if you become sick. Surely it\u2019s about more than washing your hands? When it comes to protecting people from getting the virus, washing your hands (with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds) and not coughing or sneezing on people is the best defence. Collignon says if you are in a vulnerable group or caring for someone who is, the most important advice is to wash your hands frequently and clean any surfaces they might tough with a disinfectant that kills viruses, like an alcohol wipe. If you are unwell \u2013 whether your illness is confirmed to be Covid-19 or not \u2013 stay at least one metre away from people and ensure the vulnerable person has a separate bedroom and bathroom, if possible. Another way to protect vulnerable people in the community is to ensure that healthy people do not overwhelm the public health system. Unless you have been overseas or in contact with someone, you do not need a test for Covid-19 To date Australia has kept on top of demand for testing of Covid-19, Collignon says. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, said this week that there had been a number of people seeking testing for Covid-19 who did not need to be tested and that was \u201cputting an unnecessary burden\u201d on the health system. Murphy says the only people who need to be tested are people with cold or flu-like symptoms who have travelled overseas within the past 14 days, or been in contact with a confirmed case in the past 14 days. He there was \u201cno value\u201d in testing people who do not have respiratory symptoms because that could produce a false negative result. Unless rates of community transmission accelerate in Australia, testing people outside that narrow group for Covid-19 is an unnecessary clog on the system, Collignon says. That could affect the early detection and control of other cases. \u201cEverybody who has a sore throat does not need the test,\u201dhe says. \u201cIf the system is overwhelmed then we risk the cases that have a high risk not getting seen.\u201d If you think you may have coronavirus, contact your state or territory health department, call your GP, or find your closest respiratory clinic.

      "bodyText": "The decision not to pump much cash, relatively speaking, into the wallets of ordinary Australians is the biggest gamble in the Morrison government\u2019s stimulus package. By directing three-quarters of the $17.6bn stimulus into corporate coffers, Scott Morrison and his treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, are betting that the main economic evil of the coronavirus outbreak will be interruptions to the cash flow of businesses. The handout of up to $25,000 in cash should be enough to buy bosses a new car \u2013 a prospect made more attractive by the fact it can be instantly written off against company tax. The instant write-off threshold was increased to $30,000 last year. The stimulus package lifts it even higher, to a whopping $150,000, and allows bigger businesses to use it. Medium to big businesses will also be allowed to instantly write off half the cost of buying new equipment. Morrison is hoping these measures will result in business bringing spending forward, pumping money into the economy while it is suffering the worst of the effects of the outbreak. He also talked about business investing in productive assets. This would be mean a restaurant bought a new kitchen, rather than snapping up a secondhand RAV4 as a \u201ccompany car\u201d. Ultimately, moral judgments about what people spend money on don\u2019t matter, so long as the economy benefits. But what isn\u2019t clear is if businesses have the desire or capacity to spend on anything, even with the lure of big tax breaks. Whether business owners feel they need a new vehicle right now remains to be seen, given the anecdotal evidence that many already went out and bought one back when government introduced a $20,000 instant write-off threshold back in 2015. And the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, who was something of an economic optimist until the bushfires and coronavirus wiped the smile from his dial, has consistently worried about the reluctance of companies to invest in their businesses. The measures needed to contain the virus don\u2019t seem likely to make spending more likely. If, as seems likely, major events are cancelled, people are working from home and your restaurant is shut, why would you buy a new kitchen? This is where putting money in the bank accounts of ordinary Australians could have helped. Back in 2009, as Australia faced the global financial crisis, the then prime minister, Kevin Rudd, gave $900 in cash \u2013 more than $1,100 in today\u2019s money \u2013 to more than 8 million people earning $80,000 a year or less. High income earners got smaller amounts. Morrison\u2019s handout is more miserly, at $750, and restricted to people on welfare benefits or receiving family tax benefits. There\u2019s also no increase in the Newstart rate, which economists say would have immediately pumped cash into the economy through increased spending. The market\u2019s verdict on the package was clear: thumbs down. As soon as Morrison opened his mouth at 10.35am on Thursday morning, the benchmark ASX200 index, which was already down about 2%, began falling. Within half an hour it was down another percentage point. And that was before Donald Trump announced he was closing the US to most of Europe. By 12.30pm, the index was down more than 4%.",

Importantly, 60% of the spend will land in 2Q, boosting GDP growth sizeably in the quarter. Cash payments to welfare recipients will support consumption, as should the increase in the instant asset write-off for business. The transfer/subsidy to business is also reasonably generous, and should go some way to insulating the labour market by providing an offset to any liquidity issues.</p> \n<p>Generally we view this package as a step in the right direction, and it is worth noting that the government retains the option to scale or add to these measures in the May budget if required. The government has been reasonably short term in dictating the duration of stimulus, with all of it to be spent or distributed before mid-2021. This should go some way to insulating budget estimates in the out years from too much deterioration.</p> \n<p><em><strong>\u2013 Sally Auld is the head of Australia and New Zealand economics and markets research at JP Morgan.</strong></em></p> \n<h2>Handing money to the lowest earners is effective</h2> \n<p>The government\u2019s decision to provide cash payments and incentives to the supply side of markets, helping companies continue to fund their payrolls (including apprenticeships) and in other ways negotiate supply-chain disruptions, is welcome news. This support could have been even more targeted to sectors that are worst affected. Extra support to the health sector \u2013 an obviously affected industry \u2013 is also welcome, though the opportunity was missed to underscore facts about hygiene habits, bug virulence, and our country\u2019s preparedness, that would reduce public panic.</p> \n<p>The decision to write cheques to welfare recipients seems sourced in the notion, valid or not, that such people are most likely to feel the pinch of supply-side disruptions. Handing out money to our lowest earners is a more effective spending stimulus than handing it out to the highest earners, due to the former\u2019s higher marginal propensity to spend. While a once-off handout to Australia\u2019s worst-off gets my vote, as with the infusions for suppliers the tailoring of this government response to the Covid-19 virus disruption could be better.

The stimulus boost is equivalent to 0.9% of GDP in the March quarter, and follows initial estimates from Treasury that the effect of the coronavirus downturn in the March quarter would be 0.5%, on top of a 0.2% hit from the summer bushfire crisis. Three-quarters of the $17.6bn package will be directed to businesses, with a $6.7bn cashflow payment pegged to employee wages, $4bn tied to new investment incentives, $1.2bn to support apprentices, and a $1bn fund for hard-hit sectors such as tourism.

The government has targeted low-income earners as they are most likely to spend the stimulus payment, with Treasury understood to have estimated a 150% return to the economy for every dollar spent. Morrison said the cash payments had a dual purpose \u2013 to benefit those who received them and to stimulate the economy. \u201cFrankly, it is about a cash injection into the Australian economy, which supports small businesses and supports medium businesses,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThat, in turn, supports the jobs, which means people can continue to participate positively in the economy and have greater confidence going forward.\u201d Facing calls to use the package to also provide sick leave for casual workers, the government has announced it will waive waiting periods for the taxpayer-funded sickness allowance, but has dismissed calls to make employer-funded sick leave mandatory. However, the sickness allowance takes five days to process, and people forced to self-quarantine will still be subject to an asset test that will make many people ineligible. Morrison said the package had been deliberately designed to ensure that $11bn of the $17.6bn package would be \u201cout the door\u201d by the end of June. \u201cThat\u2019s when it\u2019s needed,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThis is very front-end-loaded.

The lower deeming rate will be cut from 1% to 0.5% for financial investments up to $51,800 for single pensioners and $86,200 for pensioner couples. The upper rate, which only impacts about 40% of payment recipients with deemed assets, will decrease from 3% to 2.5%. Under the new rates, payment recipients whose income is assessed using deeming could receive up to $62 a fortnight for couples or $1,612 extra a year, and up to $50 a fortnight for singles or $1,300 a year. The extra money will start flowing through into people\u2019s bank accounts from 1 May. Along with the measures for wage assistance and investment incentives, the government has also announced a $1bn coronavirus fund, which will be targeted at regions disproportionately affected by travel bans arising from the disease. Morrison said details of how the fund would work still needed to be nutted out with the states, but it would include money to waive national park fees and to boost domestic tourism. Labor welcomed aspects of the stimulus package, but raised concerns about the sickness allowance and the impact on casual workers. \u201cThere are some welcome measures in this stimulus package that are worthy of our support and we will not stand in the way of them being implemented as soon as possible,\u201d a statement from leader Anthony Albanese and shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers said. \u201cIt remains to be seen whether these measures will be big enough or deployed quickly enough to prevent job losses, business failures or a more serious downturn.\u201d But the opposition said it had concerns about the lack of more substantial support for casual workers who are required to self-isolate, and said there was a risk that the sickness allowance may not be accessible, sufficient or timely enough to support casual workers. \u201cThe government must move to implement this package quickly and properly, and be prepared to take additional steps if it becomes clear that this response has been insufficient.\u201d The Greens and the Australian Council of Social Service said the government\u2019s one-off boost to welfare recipients did not go far enough, calling on the government to increase Newstart permanently. \u201cThis is an insult to all those people condemned to living below the poverty on Newstart and Youth Allowance,\u201d the Greens senator Rachel Siewert said. \u201cAny additional payment to those living in poverty will get spent but this is simply not enough. Newstart and Youth Allowance needs to be increased immediately.\u201d Business groups, however, said the stimulus package would support small business, which would bear the brunt of restrictions on the movement of people and an economic downturn. \u201cThese businesses have endured challenging trading conditions for a long time due to sluggish growth in consumer spending and difficulties in accessing finance, which makes them extremely vulnerable to further deterioration in the economy,\u201d the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry\u2019s chief executive, James Pearson, said. Master Builders Australia also welcomed the package, saying it was a confidence boost for the building sector. \u201cRight now what our industry most needs is confidence and this clear signal from the government that they are determined and committed to doing whatever it takes is extremely welcome,\u201d the chief executive of MBA, Denita Wawn, said.",

A number of passengers on Mello\u2019s Turkish Airlines flight left with him, waiting by the airline\u2019s counter for their luggage, some on hold with customer service. <br></p> <p>\u201cThere are just so many differentials that can happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there is one case (of coronavirus) in Turkey, but imagine in five days they find 400 people and then they say you have to stay 14 days in quarantine. It just wouldn\u2019t be great to go for five days and then end up stuck for 30 days.\u201d<br></p> <p>Reggie Chand, 34, and Esther Goundar, 32, were flying through Istanbul to Athens for a two-week trip to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe got checked in, we got our boarding tickets from here to Turkey, from Turkey to Athens,\u201d Goundar said. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting in the lounge area and then I got a text message from my friend: \u2018Hey, are you going to get stuck in Europe?\u2019\u201d <br></p> <p>Chand and Goundar are American citizens. They did not know when they canceled the trip they had been planning since October that the ban did not apply to them, but looking back, they still think they made the right decision. \u201cIt\u2019s too much risk,\u201d Goundar said. \u201cEven if the vacation goes well, and we come back, either way you stay two weeks on vacation and then stay isolated for two weeks. It\u2019s too much.\u201d<br></p> <p>The couple felt a mixture of disappointment and anger over the whole ordeal -- Chand had been on hold with Turkish Airlines for more than an hour, looking to get a refund for their tickets. <br></p> <p>\u201cI am kind of mad,\u201d Chand said. \u201cHe could have said, OK you have two days or three days, or I\u2019m going to talk to airlines so you can have something planned so nobody is stuck in Europe. What if we had gone and we were now stuck there?\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cThat would have pissed me off,\u201d Goundar said. \u201cIf we were already on the flight and we were told you cannot go home for the next 29 days, we would not have enjoyed our vacation.\u201d<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e69af688f08c2df6d277ffe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T03:44:13.733Z\">3.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The president apparently misstated a number of things</strong> during his televised address.

As a result, the campaign is arguing that it\u2019s \u201cnearly impossible\u201d for Vermont senator Bernie Sanders to catch up to Biden\u2019s delegate lead. </p> <p>That\u2019s according to an internal campaign memo obtained by The Guardian. The memo comes a day after Biden trounced Sanders in the latest round of Democratic primary contests on Tuesday. </p> <p>\u201cVotes are still being counted, but it appears that we will net somewhere around 70-80 delegates from March 10 contests alone,\u201d the memo reads. \u201cFor context, on a day we expected would be the toughest day for us in the March calendar, we netted approximately the same number of delegates that we netted on Super Tuesday. This brings our total projected delegate lead to approximately 160.\u201d</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 path forward is precarious. He trails Biden by over 150 delegates. Biden beat Sanders in Michigan on Tuesday, the most delegate-rich state of the six and one that Sanders surprisingly won in 2016. Sanders in a press conference on Wednesday said he planned to still stay in the race but conceded the path is difficult for him. In a fundraising email to supporters, Sanders said: \u201cwe are winning \u2014 very clearly \u2014 the ideological debate, we are losing, right now, the electability debate.\u201d</p> <p>According to the memo, the Biden campaign sees the next few states as advantageous for the former vice president. \u201cThe states that vote next - Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, and Georgia - have been some of our strongest, and we expect to significantly expand our delegate lead in those highly-supportive, delegate-rich states. Of 682 delegates awarded in those states, conservative estimates have us winning more than 400 delegates and netting more than 150 delegates.\u201d</p> <p>The memo concludes: \u201cShould our broad base of support remain - and we have seen no signs that would indicate otherwise - it will be nearly impossible for Sanders to recoup his current delegate disadvantage.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e69714b8f08c2df6d277e76\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-11T23:19:58.485Z\">11.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It\u2019s unclear what, exactly, Donald Trump will say when he addresses the coronavirus threat tonight.

They favor universal healthcare. They don\u2019t trust billionaires and think the system is rigged against average people. But they didn\u2019t agree that the Vermont senator is their best bet to beat Donald Trump. The establishment didn\u2019t lock Bernie out. Black voters across the south made the pragmatic decision that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> is the man to unseat the US president. A broad coalition of voters, from suburban women to white men without a college degree, took their cue from South Carolina and flocked around Biden. It was a flood on Tuesday. Florida and Georgia are ready to pile on the bandwagon.</p> <p>Turnout is up across the nation, especially in Michigan, where Biden and not Sanders is the beneficiary. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a> are declaring they cannot tolerate any more Trump. They believe Biden can manage a panic. The wave has laid Sanders asunder. The hope for the republic is that Sanders supporters can quickly come to terms with the urgency of throwing their support behind the presumptive nominee, Biden.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a389c5da038c9724a329403381e1ac47f9152e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a389c5da038c9724a329403381e1ac47f9152e3/0_128_3840_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Democratic presidential hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden walks out after speaking at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on March 10, 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Democratic presidential hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden walks out after speaking at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on March 10, 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/katie-herzog\">Katie Herzog</a>: \u2018Voters want a safe choice: they chose Biden\u2019</strong></p> <p>Tuesday\u2019s decisive victories for Joe Biden show me a few things: debates don\u2019t matter, media endorsements don\u2019t matter, grassroots campaigns don\u2019t matter, money doesn\u2019t matter, big promises don\u2019t matter, scandal doesn\u2019t matter, gaffes don\u2019t matter and having the support of the Democratic Socialists of America\u2019s Brooklyn branch and everyone under 30 doesn\u2019t matter either.</p> <p>So what matters to the majority of Democrats at this moment? Getting Donald Trump out of office, which is why, I suspect, primary voters went for what they see as the safe choice instead of the candidate promising free healthcare, free college, free puppies and pizza every Friday (and who\u2019s going to pay for it? Billionaires!). That, or young people were too busy making TikToks to show up.</p> <p>What I\u2019m curious about is what comes next: will the legions of young people who knocked on doors and memed their hearts out for Sanders become so disillusioned by the Democratic party that they sit out the general election, write in Bernie Sanders, lodge a protest vote for Trump or leave the party altogether? It\u2019s possible, which means the Biden vote might not be the safe vote after all.<br></p> <p>Read the full piece:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/mar/10/what-do-bidens-wins-mean-our-panelists-weigh-in\">What do Joe Biden\u2019s wins mean?

Bernie Sanders has staked his electability on his alleged unique ability to win swing states like Michigan, the so-called \u201crust belt\u201d states that had fallen to Donald Trump in 2016. In fact, some of the most questionable decisions of his 2020 campaign \u2013 doing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/16/bernie-sanders-draws-enthusiastic-cheers-in-surprising-fox-news-town-hall\">Fox News Town Hall</a> and touting a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/blog/meet-press-blog-latest-news-analysis-data-driving-political-discussion-n988541/ncrd1123066#blogHeader\">controversial endorsement</a> by Joe Rogan \u2013 were based on the rationale that Sanders alone could win back white working-class voters who had abandoned the Democratic party for Trump.</p> <p>Despite trailing in the polls by <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1153246\">25%</a>, he had eked out a narrow but significant win over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primaries. Sanders supporters hoped this would play out again on Tuesday night, but it was not to be. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/10/democratic-primaries-joe-biden-bernie-sanders\">loss to Joe Biden</a> might not shake the belief of Sanders and his supporters that he, and he alone, can defeat Trump in November, but it most likely does end his chance at winning the Democratic nomination.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7876bf7b6e72be13cbb23e887757d43718991067\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7876bf7b6e72be13cbb23e887757d43718991067/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders takes part in a FOX News Town Hall with co-moderators Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., March 9, 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders takes part in a FOX News Town Hall with co-moderators Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., March 9, 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This should not really have come as a surprise. Despite all the hype after the first three primaries, in wildly unrepresentative and largely irrelevant states, Sanders was winning by pluralities between one-quarter and one-third of the vote. In several cases his support was only half that of 2016, suggesting his surprise success last time was as much anti-Clinton protest as pro-Sanders support. Even when the field started to thin, Sanders only won a majority in his home state of Vermont, and only barely so.</p> <p>While Super Tuesday was brutal for the large size of the Biden wins, the modest Sanders wins were equally telling. Despite massive campaigning efforts in terms of both money and personnel and very favorable poll numbers for weeks, Sanders won just 34% of the vote in California. Biden, who had barely campaigned in the Golden State, came second with 27%, just seven points behind.</p> <p>Read the full piece:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/10/why-bernie-sanders-lost-michigan\">Why Bernie Sanders lost Michigan \u2013 and what it means for his campaign | Cas Mudde</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e68ea8c8f087df56e4c6778\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-11T13:47:53.821Z\">1.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6418fc535385d4f9d1cb31c6c5b6f3305ca286e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6418fc535385d4f9d1cb31c6c5b6f3305ca286e/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters of Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden attend a campaign rally at Renaissance High School in Detroit, Michigan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters of Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden attend a campaign rally at Renaissance High School in Detroit, Michigan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Kowalsky/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cc3c850ab6376882e40f5411cc896ddc4e1a21d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cc3c850ab6376882e40f5411cc896ddc4e1a21d/0_0_4377_2626/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Huntington Center is seen empty after Democratic presidential candidate Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders cancels his rally planned in Cleveland, Ohio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Huntington Center is seen empty after Democratic presidential candidate Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders cancels his rally planned in Cleveland, Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Megan Jelinger/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5fcb6c5d18cb1f45ad6032a3e6e449bd1dbb053\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5fcb6c5d18cb1f45ad6032a3e6e449bd1dbb053/0_280_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Democratic presidential hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden speaks, flanked by his wife Jill Biden, at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Democratic presidential hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden speaks, flanked by his wife Jill Biden, at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae97aced02c4960ba40596cf511002a6e4e1f4a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae97aced02c4960ba40596cf511002a6e4e1f4a6/0_195_5845_3507/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volunteers take down a rally stage for Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden in Cleveland, Ohio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volunteers take down a rally stage for Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden in Cleveland, Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Megan Jelinger/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e68e8668f087df56e4c6764\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/tom-perkins\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-11T13:36:17.574Z\">1.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">'Hard to comprehend\u2019: Sanders\u2019 loss in Michigan crushes staff and supporters</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the days leading up to a must-win Tuesday Michigan primary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders</a> criss-crossed the state, firing up thousands of supporters and taking the stage with star surrogates in a bid to repeat his momentum-shifting 2016 upset of Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>As the polls closed, it seemed to some that a surprise win might not be out of the question.

The next major slate of primaries is on March 17, and includes Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. </p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/fl/florida_democratic_presidential_primary-6847.html\">Florida</a>, Biden is 42.5 points ahead of his rival in polling averages, while recent polling in <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/az/arizona_democratic_primary-6898.html\">Arizona</a> shows Biden at +28. Sanders lost all four states to Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p> <p>But Sanders seems unlikely to go quietly \u2013 despite his decision not to speak after the results last night. His campaign said last night that he fully intended to take on Biden in Sunday\u2019s debate in Arizona, and he still has a fiercely loyal support base, especially among the young and Latinos. </p> <p>In 2016, his decision to stay in the race all the way to the bitter end \u2013 only endorsing Clinton in July of that year \u2013 was perceived by many of his supporters as helping push Clinton\u2019s platform to the left, for example on healthcare. He may well aim to do the same with Biden this year. </p> <p>Clinton supporters, of course, bitterly resent the fact Sanders stayed in the race so long, believing it weakened her in the general election, perhaps crucially. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"301d04393146ab86f669a693fd827b20d8a79fb2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/301d04393146ab86f669a693fd827b20d8a79fb2/91_0_2839_1703/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders: mulling next moves.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders: mulling next moves.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Sancya/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e68c2418f08c2df6d277546\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-11T10:50:36.469Z\">10.50am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Donald Trump\u2019s response to last night\u2019s primary results seemed a little off the pace, continuing to blame Elizabeth Warren for Bernie Sanders\u2019 defeats:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1237603152490147850\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Pocahontas, working in conjunction with the Democrat Party, totally destroyed the campaign of Bernie Sanders.

      "bodyText": "In a rare, televised Oval office address, Donald Trump announced a temporary travel suspension, limiting most travel from the EU to the US. The president\u2019s vague messaging, which included several misleading statements about the nature of the travel restrictions caused confusion among air travelers. The administration later clarified that the travel restrictions would not apply to US citizens and permanent residents, and most of their family members. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer criticized the president for focusing on travel while failing to address the shortage of test kits. They introduced a bill that would provide paid emergency leave for workers, guarantee free coronavirus testing, prevent price gouging on essential items and expand federal food assistance for low-income families and kids. Early indications are that Trump\u2019s speech isn\u2019t likely to stop further selloffs on the stock markets tomorrow. The White House has ordered health officials to treat top-level coronavirus meetings as classified, according to a Reuters report citing anonymous administration officials. The unusual step has restricted information about the scope of infections, quarantines and travel restrictions from those without security clearance. Reuters reports: The White House insistence on secrecy at the nation\u2019s premier public health organization, which has not been previously disclosed, has put a lid on certain information - and potentially delayed the response to the crisis. COVID19, the disease caused by the virus, has killed about 30 people in the United States and infected more than 1,000 people. The Guardian\u2019s West Coast reporter Vivian Ho writes: A quiet confusion hung overhead at San Francisco Airport\u2019s international terminal on Wednesday night, as travelers canceled flights and sought to make sense of Donald Trump\u2019s sudden coronavirus-related travel ban. Many of the travelers who planned on flying to Europe that evening had no guarantee that they would be able to return back to the United States once their trips had concluded, forcing some to make last-minute calls on dream vacations. Tulio Mello, 51, was preparing to board his flight to Istanbul when his friend called and told him not to get on the plane. \u201cThey had started announcing group one,\u201d he said. Turkey is not one of the countries included in the travel ban, but a mixture of misinformation, panic and precaution dominated the decisions made at San Francisco\u2019s airport. A number of passengers on Mello\u2019s Turkish Airlines flight left with him, waiting by the airline\u2019s counter for their luggage, some on hold with customer service. \u201cThere are just so many differentials that can happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there is one case (of coronavirus) in Turkey, but imagine in five days they find 400 people and then they say you have to stay 14 days in quarantine. It just wouldn\u2019t be great to go for five days and then end up stuck for 30 days.\u201d Reggie Chand, 34, and Esther Goundar, 32, were flying through Istanbul to Athens for a two-week trip to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary. \u201cWe got checked in, we got our boarding tickets from here to Turkey, from Turkey to Athens,\u201d Goundar said. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting in the lounge area and then I got a text message from my friend: \u2018Hey, are you going to get stuck in Europe?\u2019\u201d Chand and Goundar are American citizens. They did not know when they canceled the trip they had been planning since October that the ban did not apply to them, but looking back, they still think they made the right decision. \u201cIt\u2019s too much risk,\u201d Goundar said. \u201cEven if the vacation goes well, and we come back, either way you stay two weeks on vacation and then stay isolated for two weeks. It\u2019s too much.\u201d The couple felt a mixture of disappointment and anger over the whole ordeal -- Chand had been on hold with Turkish Airlines for more than an hour, looking to get a refund for their tickets. \u201cI am kind of mad,\u201d Chand said. \u201cHe could have said, OK you have two days or three days, or I\u2019m going to talk to airlines so you can have something planned so nobody is stuck in Europe. What if we had gone and we were now stuck there?\u201d \u201cThat would have pissed me off,\u201d Goundar said. \u201cIf we were already on the flight and we were told you cannot go home for the next 29 days, we would not have enjoyed our vacation.\u201d The president apparently misstated a number of things during his televised address. He said that goods and cargo would be blocked from Europe (it won\u2019t be), he said it would be all of Europe (it isn\u2019t) and he said all travel \u2014 but it seems American citizens and most family members will be excepted. Trump also said that insurance companies had agreed to waive copays for testing and treatment, when it seems they had only agreed to the former. Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi criticized the president for not addressing the lack of testing kits. \u201cWe have a public health crisis in this country and the best way to help keep the American people safe and ensure their economic security is for the president to focus on fighting the spread of the coronavirus itself,\u201d the Democratic leaders of the Senate and House said in a joint statement. \u201cAlarmingly, the president did not say how the administration will address the lack of coronavirus testing kits throughout the United States.\u201d They noted that they will urge Republicans to back a bill that includes provisions for free coronavirus testing, paid emergency leave and food assistance. Senator Maria Cantwell\u2019s office says an aide in DC tested positive for coronavirus. The senator has closed her office this week for \u201cdeep cleaning\u201d. The aide \u201chad no known contact with the senator or other members\u201d according to a statement from the office of the Democratic Washington senator. This appears to be the first positive case confirmed on Capitol Hill. Several lawmakers have taken preemptive measures to self-quarantine, and have staff work from home. The effectiveness of travel restrictions is limited once a disease has spread widely within a country, public health experts have found. On January 23, Chinese officials banned travel in and out of Wuhan, where the Covid-19 outbreak began. But by then, the virus had spread to other cities. The travel ban only delayed the progression of the outbreak by three to five days, according to a study published March 6 in Science. The study simulated the impact of restricting travel and disease transmission. The White House has clarified that the travel restriction will not apply to goods and cargo coming from the EU. During his televised address, Trump said that \u201cprohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo but various other things\u201d. It seems he stumbled on his words. The proclamation he signed only applies to human beings. Representative Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia who quarantined himself after he and his wife interacted with a friend who later tested positive for the coronavirus, is critical of the administration\u2019s focus on a travel ban. \u201cWe don\u2019t need walls and travel bans, we need TESTS,\u201d the representative tweeted. DHS acting secretary Chad Wolf: President Donald J. Trump signed a Presidential Proclamation, which suspends the entry of most foreign nationals who have been in certain European countries at any point during the 14 days prior to their scheduled arrival to the United States. These countries, known as the Schengen Area, include: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. This does not apply to legal permanent residents, (generally) immediate family members of U.S. citizens, and other individuals who are identified in the proclamation. The acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security has said that further guidance on the travel suspension will come within the next two days, outlining more details. In a statement, DHS secretary Wolf said that the travel restriction will be similar to the existing ones affecting individuals who\u2019ve been in China and Iran. Americans who\u2019ve been in the Schengen area may have to travel through specific airports with enhanced screening prosedures, he said. There are many details we\u2019re still unclear on regarding the temporary travel suspension. Outstanding questions we\u2019re working to answer: How will the travel suspension work? Will this be a ban on flights from the continent? Or on European nationals? If the UK is excluded from the travel suspension, how would the US account for travelers who often hop between the EU and UK? Early indications are that Trump\u2019s speech isn\u2019t likely to stop further selloffs on the stock markets tomorrow after today\u2019s rout. Futures contracts for the two most watched US stock indices, the Dow and S&amp;P 500, are both negative - an indication that there may be more selling tomorrow. Today\u2019s market fall marks the end of an 11-year bull run - a period of rising markets - for the Dow. While small businesses may be cheered that Trump is looking to help and the president also said he would look at aiding people put out of work by the virus, investors know any such moves will meet resistance in Congress. In the meantime a suspension on European travel, trade and cargo is likely to have major economic consequences that stock markets will be digesting tomorrow morning. We will get an early indication of which way the wind is blowing when Asian and Australian stock markets open in a few hours. Trump has canceled planned trips to Colorado and Nevada. He was scheduled to attend a fundraiser tomorrow, and address the Republican Jewish Convention on Saturday. The president appears to have abandoned his buisness as usual approach to his campaign amidst the coronavirus outbreak. In his brief address, the president continued to signal that the pandemic is mainly a threat outside American borders, without fully acknowledging that the coronavirus is spreading within the US. Trump said that the US is doing better than Europe. \u201cThe EU failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hot spots,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.\u201d But whereas European nations have rolled out widespread testing, it\u2019s still unclear how many cases we\u2019ve had in America. The president also said he\u2019ll take \u201cemergency action\u201d to provide relief to workers who are affected. He said he\u2019s asking Congress for $50bn for small business loans. He called for \u201cimmediate\u201d payroll tax cuts. \u201cWe made a life-saving move with early action on China. Now we must take the same action with Europe,\u201d Trump said, referring to earlier restrictions on travel between China and the US. He also downplayed warnings of a potential recession: \u201cThis is not a financial crisis, this is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome as a nation and as a world,\u201d he said. The restrictions will not apply to the UK, he said. The travel restriction will start Friday, and last for 30 days amid virus outbreak. Trump also encouraged older Americans to avoid travel if possible. Older people \u201cmust be very, very careful,\u201d he said, calling on nursing homes to suspend \u201cmedically unnecessary visits.\u201d He reviewed other measures his administration is taking to address the pandemic. \u201cThe vast majority of Americans, the risk is very, very low,\u201d he said. But he said that older Americans should avoid travel, and endorsed social distancing and avoiding large gatherings. \u201cEvery community faces different risks,\u201d he noted and encouraged Americans to listen to local officials. \u201cWe are marshaling the full power of the federal government and the private sector,\u201d Trump began. \u2018We will ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus\u201d The president is taking a somber tone and appears to be sticking to the teleprompter. Nancy Pelosi took a call from Mike Pence and Anthony Fauci, ahead of the president\u2019s address. Her chief of staff Drew Hammill said the spoke about \u201cforthcoming emergency House legislation and Administration efforts to combat coronavirus\u201d. As we await the president\u2019s address on the coronavirus threat and his administrations proposed response, the Guardian\u2019s Kenya Evelyn and Julian Borger report on where things stand: Two more states declared a state of emergency the number of US cases exceeded 1,000 nationwide. There have been a total of 37 confirmed deaths. Around the country authorities are undertaking the most sweeping efforts yet to contain the nation\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, with authorities banning large gatherings in the hard-hit Seattle area and San Francisco and closing Seattle\u2019s schools on Wednesday, while the NCAA announced it will hold March Madness basketball games around the country in near-empty arenas, off limits to most fans. In Oakland, California, restless passengers on a coronavirus-struck cruise ship awaited their turn to disembark. Efforts were underway to methodically take most of the 3,500 people on the Grand Princess off the ship and move them to quarantine in their home countries or at military bases in California, Texas and Georgia. California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, strongly warned the elderly to stay away from cruise ships. Meanwhile, Los Angeles reported its the region\u2019s first death from the virus, the second in the state. Chelsea Manning is recovering in the hospital after an attempted suicide, her attornies have said. Manning, a former intelligence analyst, was jailed for contempt after she declined to testify in the government\u2019s long-running investigation into WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange. Manning is still scheduled to appear in court on Friday, where a judge is expected to rule on whether to drop the contempt sanctions against her. \u201cIn spite of those sanctions \u2014 which have so far included over a year of so-called \u2018coercive\u2019 incarceration and nearly half a million dollars in threatened fines \u2014 she remains unwavering in her refusal to participate in a secret grand jury process that she sees as highly susceptible to abuse,\u201d her attorneys said in a statement. \u201cMs Manning has previously indicated that she will not betray her principles, even at risk of grave harm to herself.\u201d Manning objects to testifying because she sees the Wikileaks investigation as \u201can effort to frighten journalists and publishers, who serve a crucial public good\u201d her lawyers noted.

Joe Biden\u2019s campaign expects to net about the same number of delegates from the six contests on Tuesday as the campaign collected from the more than dozen states on Super Tuesday. As a result, the campaign is arguing that it\u2019s \u201cnearly impossible\u201d for Vermont senator Bernie Sanders to catch up to Biden\u2019s delegate lead. That\u2019s according to an internal campaign memo obtained by The Guardian. The memo comes a day after Biden trounced Sanders in the latest round of Democratic primary contests on Tuesday. \u201cVotes are still being counted, but it appears that we will net somewhere around 70-80 delegates from March 10 contests alone,\u201d the memo reads. \u201cFor context, on a day we expected would be the toughest day for us in the March calendar, we netted approximately the same number of delegates that we netted on Super Tuesday. This brings our total projected delegate lead to approximately 160.\u201d Sanders\u2019 path forward is precarious. He trails Biden by over 150 delegates. Biden beat Sanders in Michigan on Tuesday, the most delegate-rich state of the six and one that Sanders surprisingly won in 2016. Sanders in a press conference on Wednesday said he planned to still stay in the race but conceded the path is difficult for him. In a fundraising email to supporters, Sanders said: \u201cwe are winning \u2014 very clearly \u2014 the ideological debate, we are losing, right now, the electability debate.\u201d According to the memo, the Biden campaign sees the next few states as advantageous for the former vice president. \u201cThe states that vote next - Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, and Georgia - have been some of our strongest, and we expect to significantly expand our delegate lead in those highly-supportive, delegate-rich states. Of 682 delegates awarded in those states, conservative estimates have us winning more than 400 delegates and netting more than 150 delegates.\u201d The memo concludes: \u201cShould our broad base of support remain - and we have seen no signs that would indicate otherwise - it will be nearly impossible for Sanders to recoup his current delegate disadvantage.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what, exactly, Donald Trump will say when he addresses the coronavirus threat tonight. But after seeking to downplay the severity of the situation for weeks, it seems something has shifted. The New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman reports one potential reason why: We\u2019ll see the extent to which Trump will continue to play down the outbreak, and introduce plans to mitigate the spread of the disease and its impact. Sanders now faces a dramatic choice about the future of his candidacy: to continue leading a grinding, uphill battle or to bow to pressure to drop out for the sake of party unity as it faces up to Donald Trump in the November election. \u201cPrematurely writing him off is about the worst thing that we could do,\u201d Congressman Ro Khanna, one of Sanders\u2019 national co-chairs, said. Sanders \u201crepresents the least fortunate, the most vulnerable, and, in certain cases, the most angry about the economic system\u201d. \u201cWe need him to continue to express their voice, their needs and their concerns,\u201d he said. Donald Trump is scheduled to depart tomorrow for Las Vegas, where he will speak at a Republican Jewish Coalition event. UN Ambassador Nikki Haley is still on the agenda as well, despite concerns over coronavirus. The Trump campaign has held off on announcing any more rallies, but the president has otherwise tried a business-as-usual approach. Even as Joe Biden moved to virtual campaign events, Trump\u2019s 2020 team announce a \u201cCatholics for Trump\u201d event in Milwaukee next week. Trump said he hasn\u2019t been tested for a coronavirus infection. In Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, there have been five confirmed cases. Two Americans and a British soldier are reported to have been killed and 11 others injured, by a rocket attack on a coalition base in Iraq, according to US defense officials. Within hours airstrikes were reported on an area of the Iraqi-Syrian border used as a base by an Iran-backed militia, raising fears of a fresh round of US-Iranian escalation that brought both countries close to war in January. Camp Taji, just north of Baghdad, was hit by between 15 and 30 Katyusha rockets on Wednesday evening. The French Press Agency said that three dead were a US soldier, a US contractor and a British soldier. The administration celebrated the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to allow the enforcement of a policy that makes asylum seekers wait in Mexico for US court hearings. The \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy will be upheld while a lawsuit challenging it continues. In a statement, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said, \u201cToday\u2019s order from the Supreme Court is a major victory for the Trump Administration.\u201d \u201cThe Court has prevented dangerous chaos at the southern border, avoided a significant escalation in public health threats, and mitigated damage to foreign relations,\u201d she continued. \u201cOpen borders do not serve the American public, and we will always strongly enforce the laws at our borders and airports.\u201d The Trump administration has pushed border enforcement as a means of protecting Americans from the spread of coronavirus, despite evidence that chaos and fear at the border could hinder efforts to contain the diseases. The House approved a resolution to limit Donald Trump\u2019s ability to order direct military action against Iran without authorization from Congress. The Senate has also passed the bill, but it\u2019s expected to be vetoed by Trump. Lawmakers introduced the bill after Trump ordered a strike to kill Iranian general Qasem Suleimani, bringing the US to the brink of war, without consulting congress. Bernie Sanders has received the endorsement of the progressive Jewish group IfNotNow. \u201cAs a movement of young Jews fighting for freedom and dignity for all, we are proud to be the first Jewish organization to endorse Senator Bernie Sanders for President,\u201d said Dani Moscovitch, the group\u2019s co-founder. \u201cWe are inspired and moved to action by Bernie and the #NotMeUs movement, which deeply embodies the Jewish call to pursue justice and repair our broken world.\u201d The endorsement isn\u2019t too surprising. IfNotNow is a 35,000-member group advocating for the end of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Sanders, the only Jewish candidate in the race, has been an outspoken critic of the Israeli government, calling its policies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip \u201cracist\u201d. According to a poll by Tufts University Tisch College, Biden won a majority of young voters\u2019 support in Mississippi, as he cemented his frontrunner status yesterday. The key factor here appears to be race. According to the Tufts analyists: Exit poll data by age and race in Mississippi confirms the impact of young Black voters in the state. Black voters under 30 supported Biden over Sanders, 76% to 23%, and they made up 9% of the total primary electorate compared to just 3% for White youth. By contrast, in Missouri, young White voters made up 11% of the electorate, and Sanders won 72% of their votes, compared to 22% for Biden. During a press conference earlier today Bernie Sanders emphasized that while he\u2019s behind in the delegate count, he\u2019s consistently won over young voters. That still appears to be broadly true: but at least according to this poll, up close, the picture is a bit more complex. Hi there, it\u2019s Maanvi Singh taking over from the West Coast. Donald Trump is expected to announce an executive order that insists on the use of American made medical supplies in response to the coronavirus outbreak, according to the AP. The administration is considering more aggressive measures and funding in response to concerns that its initial reaction to the pandemic was insufficient, the AP reports, citing an anonymous source. The Guardian has not independently verified the news. Trump will be delivering a statement on the coronavirus outbreak tonight at 9pm ET. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Bernie Sanders said he would continue in the Democratic presidential primary, despite a string of disappointing losses last night. The Vermont senator said he looked forward to discussing his policy difference with Joe Biden during Sunday\u2019s debate. Trump said he would deliver a statement on coronavirus tonight, after the WHO declared the outbreak of the illness to be a pandemic. The president will address the nation at 9 pm ET. The Dow entered bear-market territory for the first time since the financial crisis, dropping more than 1,400 points amid intensifying fears about the spread of coronavirus. Campaign schedules are being altered in response to coronavirus. Biden and Sanders canceled their rallies yesterday in Clevleand, and Biden announced today that two upcoming events in Illinois and Florida would be made into virtual events. The Supreme Court decided the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy could stay in place as legal challenges to the rule played out. A lower court had recently blocked the policy, an order that was set to go into effect tomorrow. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Ever since the race narrowed to Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, activists hoping for diversity on the ticket have set their sights on the second-in-line. And the Veepstakes are in full swing. On Tuesday, She the People, a group focused on increasing political power among women of color, released the findings of a survey they conducted with members about their top choices for vice president. At the top of the list: Stacey Abrams and Kamala Harris. Women of color are the party\u2019s most loyal constituency and the remaining candidates \u2013 both white men \u2013 are facing mounting pressure to select a woman and/or a person of color as a running mate. The She the People poll included several elected officials and politicians \u2013 all women of color. Among them were: Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib, Val Demings and Tammy Duckworth. Earlier on Wednesday, a group of influential Democratic leaders sent a letter to the Democratic National Committee demanding that the next nominee commit to choosing a woman to be his vice president and to filling at least half of the administration\u2019s cabinet positions with women. Trump said he would deliver his statement on the coronavirus pandemic at 9 pm ET. The president had initially told reporters the statement would be delivered \u201cprobably at 8 o\u2019clock.\u201d Trump ignored questions on what he intended to say tonight, but he noted the address would include both economic and health announcements. Joe Biden has announced more campaign schedule changes due to coronavirus, after already canceling two events because of the pandemic. The presidential candidate announced a Friday event in Illinois and a Monday event in Florida would both become virrtual events in order to limit any potential spread of coronavirus. Biden\u2019s team announced earlier today that it had created a public health advisory committee to help make decisions about campaign logisitics as the number of US coronavirus cases rises. Biden is also scheduled to deliver remarks on the coronavirus pandemic tomorrow in his home state of Delaware. A spokesperson for Nancy Pelosi said the House speaker has talked to the treasury secretary twice today, as House Democrats craft a package to address the economic fallout of coronavirus. The administration has so far appeared open to Democratic proposals, such as paid sick leave and unemployment insurance for those whose work has been disrupted by coronavirus Trump has repeatedly called for a payroll tax cut to stimulate the economy amid the pandemic, but that\u2019s largely viewed as a non-starter on Capitol Hill. The Dow closed down more than 1,400 points, or 5.9%, as fears intensified over the increasing number of US coronavirus cases. The drop means the Dow has fallen into a bear market for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis. For more updates and anlaysis on the market drop, follow the Guardian\u2019s business blog: Trump would not answer questions about what he would announce in his coronavirus statement tonight. But the president told the White House press pool that the address would include both economic and health announcements. The statement comes as lawmakers discuss a package to address economic fallout from the pandemic and reports emerge that the administration is considering moving all of Europe to a Level 3 travel advisory. Trump said he would deliver his coronavirus statement tonight \u201cprobably at 8 o\u2019clock,\u201d according to the White House press pool. It\u2019s still unclear what Trump intends to announce in the statement, but reports had surfaced earlier today that the president was considering delivering an Oval Office address on coronavirus. The statement will come hours afer WHO declared the outbreak of coronavirus to be a pandemic. Trump said he would make a statement tonight, as the number of US coronavirus cases continues to increase. The president made the announcement during a meeting with bankers and business leaders at the White House. Michael Corbat of Citibank told the White House press pool, \u201cThis is not a financial crisis. The banks and the financial system are in strong shape, and we are here to help.\u201d Joe Biden announced the creation of a public health advisory committee, which will help his campaign make decisions aimed at limiting the spread of coronavirus. \u201cThe campaign\u2019s top priority is and will continue to be the health and safety of the public,\u201d the Biden campaign said in a press release. \u201cMembers of the committee will provide ongoing counsel to the campaign, which will in turn continue to update the public regarding operational decisions.\u201d The panel is made up of six members, including former surgeon general Vivek Murthy and former FDA commissioner David Kessler. Biden has already canceled at last two events, a Cleveland rally last night and a Tampa event scheduled for tomorrow, because of the pandemic. Trump is going on a coronavirus-related tweetstorm, promising to use the \u201cfull power of the Federal Government\u201d to combat the pandemic. The White House press pool has just been called in to Trump\u2019s meeting with business leaders, which was previously lsited as closed to the press, so Trump will likely be asked about what executive actions he is considering. This will also be the president\u2019s first chance to speak about the government\u2019s handling of coronavirus since the WHO declared it a pandemic earlier today. Trump also assured Americans that the US would develop a coronavirus vaccine. \u201cAmerica will get it done!\u201d Trump tweeted. However, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during a congressional hearing today that the development of a vaccine is still at least a year to a year and a half away. \u201cI can say we will see more cases, and things will get worse than they are right now,\u201d Fauci told the House oversight committee. Trump lashed out against Democrats as the number of US coronavirus cases increases. The president\u2019s tweet comes as the Democratic-controlled House is working on another bill to contain the economic fallout from the pandemic. So far, the Trump administration has appeared open to Democrats\u2019 proposals, even as the president tries to pin blame for the handling of the outbreak on them. The US Capitol continues to receive crowds of tourists, even as presidential campaigns and some cities are limiting large gatherings such as rallies and parades. The picture of the crowded Capitol sparked questions about whether Washington needs to take further steps to try to limit the spread of coronavirus. One lawmaker, senator Dianne Feinstein, suggested earlier today that the Capitol may have to shut down during the pandemic. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the fact that we need to close this place down,\u201d Feinstein said. \u201cI\u2019ve got constituents by the hundreds that come across the country, and I don\u2019t think they should right now.\u201d Mike Pence\u2019s meeting with hospital executives was unexpectedly closed to the press, amid concerns about how the administration is making information on coronavirus publicly available. A press pool was orginally supposed to go in to the vice president\u2019s meeting with the executives, but that was abruptly canceled without explanation. Reuters reported earlier today that the White House has ordered officials to treat top-level coronavirus meetings as classified, raising concerns of the administration trying to restrict access to information about the pandemic. However, the office of the vice president, who leads the coronavirus task force, said he was holding meetings in the Situation Room at the unclassified level. The Supreme Court has ruled the Trump administration may continue enforcing a policy that forces asylum seekers to wait in Mexico as their cases are processed. The AP reports: The justices\u2019 order, over a dissenting vote by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, overturns a lower court order that would have blocked the policy, at least for people arriving at the border crossings in Arizona and California. The high court action came a day before the lower court order was to have taken effect. Instead, the \u2018Remain in Mexico\u2019 policy will remain in force while a lawsuit challenging it plays out in the courts. The lower court ruling had offered a brief ray of hope to asylum seekers who have had to stay in camps along the US-Mexico border, where they have been frequently targeted by criminal gangs. Joe Biden\u2019s campaign said they were looking ahead to the general election, after Bernie Sanders said he would continue on in the presidential primary. \u201cOur campaign is focused on the task at hand: defeating Donald Trump so we can make real, lasting progressive change in this country and in people\u2019s lives,\u201d a Biden spokesperson told BuzzFeed News. Biden has already notched four victories from last night\u2019s contests, while Sanders won North Dakota and Washington state remains too close to call. Considering the four states voting next Tuesday are all states that Sanders lost in 2016, there appear to be very few roadblocks in Biden\u2019s path to the nomination. Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley said the Democratic debates should continue, even as some Democrats have started referring to Joe Biden as the presumptive nominee. Bernie Sanders similarly said at his press conference today that he looked forward to debating Biden on Sunday and pushing him on some issues where they diverge. Pressley, one of four progressive congresswomen who make up \u201cthe Squad,\u201d endorsed Elizabeth Warren in the primary, but the fellow Massachusetts lawmaker dropped out of the race last week. Coronavirus continues to impact the US government, with one senator suggesting the Capitol may need to be shut down amid the pandemic. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the fact that we need to close this place down,\u201d said senator Dianne Feinstein, who is 86 and thus particularly susceptible to the virus. \u201cI\u2019ve got constituents by the hundreds that come across the country, and I don\u2019t think they should right now,\u201d Feinstein said on Capitol Hill. For the latest updates on coronavirus, follow the Guardian\u2019s live blog: Bernie Sanders did not drop out of the Democratic presidential primary, but the candidate spoke as if Sunday\u2019s debate is meant more as a test for Joe Biden as the presumptive nominee. Sanders rattled off a list of issues he feels Biden is weak on, such as health care, climate change and student debate, and he said he intended to press Biden on those issues on Sunday. One Washington Post reporter said Sanders\u2019 speech felt like he was \u201cproviding his rival with a take-home exam\u201d for the Sunday debt. Considering how much Sanders emphasized the need to defeat Trump in November, he may see the upcoming, one-on-one debate as an opportunity for Biden to prepare for the general election rather than a chance to reverse the course of the nominating contest. Although Bernie Sanders said he was winning the \u201cideological debate\u201d and the \u201cgenerational debate,\u201d he acknowledged he was losing the \u201celectability debate.\u201d Sanders said he had spoken to a number of voters who supported his policy proposals but backed Joe Biden because they feared Sanders could not defeat Trump. The Vermont senator then previewed the issues he will press Biden on in the days to come, most notably during the Sunday debate. \u201cJoe, what are you going to do to end the absurdity of the United States of America being the only major country on Earth where health care is not a human right? Are you really going to veto a Medicare for All bill if it is passed in Congress?\u201d Sanders rhetorically asked. He concluded by reiterating the need to defeat Trump and looking ahead to Sunday\u2019s debate, the first one-on-one debate between him and Biden of this election cycle. \u201cOn Sunday, I very much look forward to the debate in Arizona with my friend Joe Biden,\u201d Sanders said. The candidate then left the press conference without taking any questions from reporters. Despite his disappointing performance yesterday, Bernie Sanders said his campaign platform is broadly popular with the Democratic party, pointing to exit polls. \u201cBut it is not just the ideological debate that our progressive movement is winning,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe are winning the generational debate.\u201d The Vermont senator pointed out that he has won the majority of younger voters, while Joe Biden is more popular with older voters. However, because older Americans vote in larger numbers than their younger counterparts, Sanders has seen disappointing results in recent weeks. \u201cToday I say to the Democratic establishment: in order to win in the future, you need to win the voters that represent the future of our country,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cYou cannot simply be satisfied by winning the votes of people who are older.\u201d This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Tom McCarthy. Bernie Sanders is addressing reporters at his campaign headquarters in Burlington, Vermont. He opened by denouncing Trump and emphasizing the need to defeat him in November. Sanders called the president a \u201cpathological liar\u201d who is running a \u201ccorrupt administration.\u201d \u201cIn my view, he is a racist, a sexist, a homophobe, a xenophobe, and religious bigot, and he must be defeated, and I will do everything in my power to make that happen,\u201d Sanders said. But Sanders acknowledged last night, when he lost at least four of six primaries to Joe Biden, was \u201cnot a good night for our campaign.\u201d Additional outlets are standing up the Washington Post report, that Sanders is not quitting today: The Washington Post reports that Sanders is expected to announce that he is staying in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination and looks forward to Sunday\u2019s debate with Biden: A coalition of liberal women\u2019s organizations are calling on the next Democratic presidential nominee to select a female running mate and appoint women to half the cabinet positions. \u201cWe know that the only way to guarantee that women\u2019s issues stay on the agenda is if women are the ones setting it,\u201d the groups said in a letter sent to the Democratic National Committee on Wednesday. The letter is signed by officials at EMILY\u2019s List, the American Federation of Teachers, Working Families Parties, Planned Parenthood Action Fund and several other organizations that seek to mobilize women and issues related to women\u2019s rights. The groups are asking the next nominee to appoint women who \u201cshare our values of justice and equality to at least half of all presidential appointments including the Cabinet\u201d; select a woman for VP and ensure \u201cracial, religious, and gender identity representation for all presidential appointments.\u201d The letter comes after a historically diverse field of women and candidates of color has narrowed to a race between two white men in their 70s. The departure of Elizabeth Warren was a particularly devastating blow to many Democratic women who had watched her surge to the front of the pack and best her rivals in the debates only to finish no higher than third in any primary contest, including in her home state of Massachusetts. \u201cOver the past three years, we have seen more women running for and winning elected office than at any time in our entire history. We\u2019ve seen them best men on the debate stage and we\u2019ve seen them persist through sexist attacks in the media and among their peers,\u201d the letter said. \u201cAlthough we have elected a historic number of women to public office, it is evident that women are not afforded the platform we deserve in public service.\u201d You can watch Sanders at the link below (and we\u2019ll have a video feed in the blog): Silent since last night\u2019s results, Sanders plans to speak in one hour: Former attorney general Jeff Sessions, who is running to regain his Alabama Senate seat, has tweeted that nothing Donald Trump can say will sway him, Sessions, from standing foursquare behind the Donald Trump agenda: Trump has endorsed Sessions\u2019 opponent in a Republican primary runoff. The president still has not gotten over Sessions\u2019 decision as attorney general to recuse himself from oversight of the Russia investigation. As a former Trump campaign official, Sessions figured he could not properly oversee an investigation of the Trump campaign. Trump considered the notion of such a conflict of interest absurd. For the latter months of his tenure as attorney general, Sessions demonstrated an ability to put up with abuse by Trump, who frequently attacked Sessions on Twitter, without losing his smile. The winner of the Alabama runoff gets to face Doug Jones, the most vulnerable Democratic senate incumbent in the country, in November. The runoff election is scheduled for 31 March. The polling is murky. Is it too early to talk veepstakes? Klobuchar, Abrams, Harris, or \u2013 who? The big money is swinging behind Biden. Here\u2019s a trio of announcements since last night from the three large Democratic fundraising shops, who had held their fire to this point. The Biden campaign was reportedly nearly broke before his South Carolina win and there were doubts that he would be able to keep pace with the pack over the long haul. Now depending on what Sanders (whose grassroots funding would allow him to stay in the race as long as he wants) decides, there might not be a long haul. Not for the nomination at least. What is Sanders\u2019 plan? Here\u2019s a sample from our post-election-night panel: Art Cullen: \u2018Voters think Biden is most electable\u2019 Democratic voters in exit polls agree with Bernie Sanders on the issues. They favor universal healthcare. They don\u2019t trust billionaires and think the system is rigged against average people. But they didn\u2019t agree that the Vermont senator is their best bet to beat Donald Trump. The establishment didn\u2019t lock Bernie out. Black voters across the south made the pragmatic decision that Joe Biden is the man to unseat the US president. A broad coalition of voters, from suburban women to white men without a college degree, took their cue from South Carolina and flocked around Biden. It was a flood on Tuesday. Florida and Georgia are ready to pile on the bandwagon. Turnout is up across the nation, especially in Michigan, where Biden and not Sanders is the beneficiary. Democrats are declaring they cannot tolerate any more Trump. They believe Biden can manage a panic. The wave has laid Sanders asunder. The hope for the republic is that Sanders supporters can quickly come to terms with the urgency of throwing their support behind the presumptive nominee, Biden. Katie Herzog: \u2018Voters want a safe choice: they chose Biden\u2019 Tuesday\u2019s decisive victories for Joe Biden show me a few things: debates don\u2019t matter, media endorsements don\u2019t matter, grassroots campaigns don\u2019t matter, money doesn\u2019t matter, big promises don\u2019t matter, scandal doesn\u2019t matter, gaffes don\u2019t matter and having the support of the Democratic Socialists of America\u2019s Brooklyn branch and everyone under 30 doesn\u2019t matter either. So what matters to the majority of Democrats at this moment? Getting Donald Trump out of office, which is why, I suspect, primary voters went for what they see as the safe choice instead of the candidate promising free healthcare, free college, free puppies and pizza every Friday (and who\u2019s going to pay for it? Billionaires!). That, or young people were too busy making TikToks to show up. What I\u2019m curious about is what comes next: will the legions of young people who knocked on doors and memed their hearts out for Sanders become so disillusioned by the Democratic party that they sit out the general election, write in Bernie Sanders, lodge a protest vote for Trump or leave the party altogether? It\u2019s possible, which means the Biden vote might not be the safe vote after all. Read the full piece: Does Sanders still have a path to the Democratic nomination? The Associated Press has published this analysis: Sanders stayed in the race until June four years ago, fueled in no small part by his Michigan primary victory. This time, the path going forward looks much different. The Vermont senator faces a fraught choice. Does he try something new: going after Biden even more aggressively as an establishment figure, a relative foreign policy hawk, a budget centrist who threatens Social Security? There\u2019s little evidence over the last two weeks that any of that would change the fundamentals of the contest. Another option: Sanders can continue advocating for the issues that his supporters hold dear, like \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and free college, not explicitly ceding the nomination but using his base to pressure a Biden-led party to move as far left as possible. He was back at his home in Vermont Tuesday night. Just like he planned? With the Democratic primaries down to two real candidates, only one state really mattered on mini-Super Tuesday: Michigan. Bernie Sanders has staked his electability on his alleged unique ability to win swing states like Michigan, the so-called \u201crust belt\u201d states that had fallen to Donald Trump in 2016. In fact, some of the most questionable decisions of his 2020 campaign \u2013 doing a Fox News Town Hall and touting a controversial endorsement by Joe Rogan \u2013 were based on the rationale that Sanders alone could win back white working-class voters who had abandoned the Democratic party for Trump. Despite trailing in the polls by 25%, he had eked out a narrow but significant win over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primaries. Sanders supporters hoped this would play out again on Tuesday night, but it was not to be. His loss to Joe Biden might not shake the belief of Sanders and his supporters that he, and he alone, can defeat Trump in November, but it most likely does end his chance at winning the Democratic nomination. This should not really have come as a surprise. Despite all the hype after the first three primaries, in wildly unrepresentative and largely irrelevant states, Sanders was winning by pluralities between one-quarter and one-third of the vote. In several cases his support was only half that of 2016, suggesting his surprise success last time was as much anti-Clinton protest as pro-Sanders support. Even when the field started to thin, Sanders only won a majority in his home state of Vermont, and only barely so. While Super Tuesday was brutal for the large size of the Biden wins, the modest Sanders wins were equally telling. Despite massive campaigning efforts in terms of both money and personnel and very favorable poll numbers for weeks, Sanders won just 34% of the vote in California. Biden, who had barely campaigned in the Golden State, came second with 27%, just seven points behind. Read the full piece: In the days leading up to a must-win Tuesday Michigan primary, Bernie Sanders criss-crossed the state, firing up thousands of supporters and taking the stage with star surrogates in a bid to repeat his momentum-shifting 2016 upset of Hillary Clinton. As the polls closed, it seemed to some that a surprise win might not be out of the question. But not for long. The crushing reality of defeat hit the Michigan Sanders campaign staff at a downtown Detroit watch party by 9pm. News outlets called the race for Joe Biden, all but sealing the former vice-president\u2019s nomination and Sanders\u2019 now likely defeat in the race overall. Several staffers shed tears. Others left the party early. Sanders supporter Kevin Neems called the results \u201cdepressing\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s just hard to understand. Hard to comprehend. Hard to wrap your head around,\u201d he said. While the loss crushed Sanders\u2019 staff and supporters, many maintained an optimistic tone, choosing to view the candidate\u2019s progressive campaign as part of a longer game that went beyond any single election season. \u201cHe got millions of votes and his message resonates with young voters, but there were things that couldn\u2019t necessarily be controlled,\u201d Neems added. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the progressive movement is growing even if this is a setback.\u201d Read the full piece here: While Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders have been cancelling rallies because of the coronavirus, Donald Trump has booked in a new one. He will launch a \u201cCatholics for Trump\u201d coalition on March 19 in Milwaukee. Trump has consistently played down the risks of the coronavirus and the state of the epidemic, and claimed Democrats are exaggerating its impact in order to damage the economy and hurt his chances of re-election. In addition, the president seems to get a galvanising effect from appearing live on stage in front of large gatherings of his supporters, and views his rallies in 2016 as having played a key role in his election. He often works out attack lines and policy positions on stage. Whether in the next week he will have to cancel this Milwaukee event \u2013 and book in far fewer public appearances over the next few months \u2013 remains to be seen. Polling earlier this week seemed to suggest that efforts by Trump and his allies to play down the threat of the virus were having a real-world impact. A Reuters/Ipsos poll found that \u201cDemocrats are about twice as likely as Republicans to say the coronavirus poses an imminent threat to the United States,\u201d and \u201cMore Democrats than Republicans say they are taking steps to be prepared, including washing their hands more often or limiting their travel plans.\u201d Another poll, by Axios/SurveyMonkey, found that 62% of Republicans thought news reports about the seriousness of the novel coronavirus were \u201cgenerally exaggerated,\u201d double the percentage of Democrats saying the same (31%). Joe Biden had an interesting exchange with a worker at an assembly plant in Detroit on Tuesday, telling the man he was \u201cfull of shit\u201d and a \u201chorse\u2019s ass\u201d after he claimed the former vice-president was planning to \u201ctake away our guns\u201d. Donald Trump\u2019s team saw it as a gaffe, with his deputy director of communications for rapid response quickly tweeting out the clip: Trump\u2019s team usually has brutally effective instincts for honing in an opponent\u2019s weak spots \u2013 although of course they often post misleading material too. In this instance though they may have miscalculated. The clip shows Biden at ease with a working-class crowd in a way that previous Democratic candidates \u2013 whether Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama or John Kerry \u2013 have often found difficult. Winning over working-class voters in the rust belt is seen to be key to Biden\u2019s strategy for beating Trump. It also shows him giving as good as he gets, defending his position aggressively \u2013 something that may be reassuring to many Democrats nervous about Trump steamrollering over their candidate in the presidential debates and elsewhere. And it sets out his stall as a moderate \u2013 opposed to the extremes of gun ownership but not gun ownership itself. \u201cI support the second amendment \u2026 I have a shotgun, I have a 20-gauge, a 12-gauge. My sons hunt,\u201d Biden said, before asking, presumably to suggest there are limits to what ordinary gun owners should be allowed: \u201cYou need 100 rounds? ... Are you able to own a machine gun?\u201d It seems unlikely to me that Biden\u2019s team will be disappointed if the video continues to do the rounds today. North Dakota has been called for Bernie Sanders. He won 53% of the vote, to Biden\u2019s 40%. The state only offers 14 delegates, however. Washington is the only state not to have been called yet from last night\u2019s crop. Democratic stalwarts such as James Carville called for Bernie Sanders to drop out of the race yesterday, and South Carolina congressman Jim Clyburn \u2013 whose support for Biden in his state was instrumental there \u2013 even called for the DNC to \u201cshut this primary down\u201d and cancel all future debates. The path ahead looks very difficult for the Vermont socialist. The next major slate of primaries is on March 17, and includes Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. In Florida, Biden is 42.5 points ahead of his rival in polling averages, while recent polling in Arizona shows Biden at +28. Sanders lost all four states to Hillary Clinton in 2016. But Sanders seems unlikely to go quietly \u2013 despite his decision not to speak after the results last night. His campaign said last night that he fully intended to take on Biden in Sunday\u2019s debate in Arizona, and he still has a fiercely loyal support base, especially among the young and Latinos. In 2016, his decision to stay in the race all the way to the bitter end \u2013 only endorsing Clinton in July of that year \u2013 was perceived by many of his supporters as helping push Clinton\u2019s platform to the left, for example on healthcare. He may well aim to do the same with Biden this year. Clinton supporters, of course, bitterly resent the fact Sanders stayed in the race so long, believing it weakened her in the general election, perhaps crucially. Donald Trump\u2019s response to last night\u2019s primary results seemed a little off the pace, continuing to blame Elizabeth Warren for Bernie Sanders\u2019 defeats: Good morning. Joe Biden last night continued to cement his extraordinary comeback in the race to become the Democratic presidential nominee and take on Donald Trump in November. The former vice-president to Barack Obama won at least four states in last night\u2019s primaries \u2013 most significantly Michigan. Leftwing senator Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton there in the 2016 race, and last night\u2019s disappointing result for Sanders suggested that his victory four years ago may have had more to do with dislike for the former secretary of state than his own strength in the rust belt. Last night Biden beat Sanders 53% to 37%. The centrist ex-VP also won in Idaho, Missouri and Mississippi \u2013 where he took in 81% of the vote to Sanders\u2019 15%. Sanders is leading in North Dakota with 78% of the vote in. In Washington state, the two candidates are neck and neck on 33% with 67% in. Full results are here: The results put Biden on 823 delegates to Sanders\u2019 663 and suggest the former vice-president is now pulling decisively ahead. His polling lead over the Vermont senator has skyrocketed since the withdrawal from the race of fellow moderates Michael Bloomberg, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. By contrast Sanders seems only to have seen a slight polling bump from the departure of his fellow leftwinger Elizabeth Warren. Biden gave a measured victory speech before a small crowd, praising Sanders and his supporters for their \u201ctireless passion\u201d and calling on them to help him defeat Donald Trump together. Sanders did not give a speech and returned to Vermont. There was a signal yesterday of how the race might be transformed by the coronavirus outbreak, which has now affected over 1,000 people in the US. Both the Biden campaign and the Sanders campaign had cancelled scheduled election night rallies in Ohio as a precaution against spreading the virus. Biden\u2019s campaign also cancelled an event in Florida, and tthe Sanders campaign said it would evaluate future events on a \u201ccase by case basis\u201d. The impact on Trump \u2013 who seems to draw such energy from live events and uses them to hone attack lines \u2013 remains to be seen. Biden also said he would deliver a speech on the virus this week. Here\u2019s more on the primary results: Today Trump is meeting secretary of state Mike Pompeo and Mike Pence, as well as bankers with whom he will discuss the coronavirus. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chief Dr Robert Redfield and infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci testify before the House oversight and reform committee at 9.30am ET.",

      "bodyText": "The Greek government has been warned by the EU executive that it must uphold the right to asylum, as leaders from Brussels travel to Athens for talks on the migrant crisis at the EU\u2019s borders. Ylva Johansson, EU commissioner for home affairs, said she wanted to discuss a detention centre where asylum seekers were reported to have been captured and beaten, before being expelled from Greece without the chance to speak to a lawyer or claim asylum. The New York Times reported on Tuesday of \u201ca black site\u201d in north eastern Greece where migrants are held without legal recourse before being expelled to Turkey. Johansson, a Swedish social democrat who took charge of EU migration policy a little more than 100 days ago, said she would raise the issue of the detention centre with Greek government ministers on Thursday. \u201cThese kind of temporary detentions that they have set up \u2013 is one of the things I would like to know more about \u2026 Of course you can have detention for some period of people that have come, but of course you can\u2019t beat them,\u201d she said. The commission has been accused of failing to uphold EU law since Greece announced earlier this month it was suspending asylum applications for one month, a move at odds with European law and the Geneva convention. While the UN agency for refugees has said the Greek decision has no legal basis, the commission has said it needs time to assess the situation. Sidestepping whether Greece\u2019s decision was illegal, Johansson said: \u201cWe are going to discuss actually what they are doing, but they have to let people apply for asylum.\u201d She also said the commission did not plan to suspend the right to asylum by invoking a little-known clause of the EU treaty that allows Brussels to propose \u201cprovisional measures\u201d, to help a member state facing an emergency because of large numbers of migrant arrivals. Greece\u2019s prime minister Kyri\u00e1kos Mitsot\u00e1kis announced he was involving article 78.3 earlier this month when he said all asylum applications would be suspended. That measure requires a proposal from the commission that is agreed by EU member states. Johansson said the commission would not propose suspending the right to asylum. \u201cIndividuals in the European Union have the right to apply for asylum.

Von der Leyen later postponed her meeting with the Greek prime minister, in order to focus on the coronavirus. Speaking in the European parliament this week, the leader of the Socialists and Democrats, Iratxe Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez, said: \u201cShields are used to protect ourselves against weapons, but we are talking about the lives of vulnerable people, of human beings.\u201d The Spanish socialist also accused the commission of ignoring the Geneva convention. Tensions erupted earlier this month when Turkey opened its borders and began sending migrants towards the EU, creating a stand-off that adds to pressure on Greece, where thousands of refugees and migrants are living in squalid camps on the islands.

Confusion following Trump\u2019s address later forced officials to clarify that cargo, as well as non-Schengen countries in Europe, would also be exempt from the ban.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-outbreak-us-trump-latest\">Trump to suspend travel from Europe, excluding UK, amid coronavirus outbreak</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Observers said the speech, in which Trump gave the sense of resisting a foreign invasion, struck a strange tone. David Litt, who wrote speeches for Barack Obama, said: \u201cAs a former presidential speechwriter, my careful rhetorical analysis is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/donald-trump-us-coronavirus-address\">he\u2019s gonna get us all killed</a>.\u201d</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, Italy saw its restrictions on daily life increase after the government ordered the closure of all shops apart from pharmacies and grocery stores and other essential stores. The whole country of 60 million people was placed into lockdown on Tuesday and is the second-worst affected nation with more than 12,000 cases.</p> \n<p>The outbreak also claimed its most high-profile cases so far when Hollywood superstar Tom Hanks announced that he and wife, Rita Wilson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/tom-hanks-coronavirus-actor-and-wife-rita-wilson-test-positive-in-australia\">have tested positive for the coronavirus</a>.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has banned travel to the US from most of Europe \u2013 apart from the UK and Ireland \u2013 for 30 days in an attempt to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The move failed to stem heavy losses on financial markets and prompted one top economist to warn that a global recession was now \u201chighly probable\u201d. In a sombre primetime address from the Oval Office on Wednesday evening, the US president boasted that the travel ban and series of other measures designed to cushion the economic blow of the outbreak amounted to \u201cthe most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in history\u201d. But Asian stock markets and Wall Street futures trading plunged deep into the red even as Trump laid out his plans, with investors betting that the $250bn package would not be enough to reverse the creeping shutdown of the world\u2019s largest economy. The US suspension will not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland, and does not apply to American citizens, Trump said, as he attempted to blame the European Union for \u201cseeding\u201d hotspots in America. Confusion following Trump\u2019s address later forced officials to clarify that cargo, as well as non-Schengen countries in Europe, would also be exempt from the ban. Observers said the speech, in which Trump gave the sense of resisting a foreign invasion, struck a strange tone. David Litt, who wrote speeches for Barack Obama, said: \u201cAs a former presidential speechwriter, my careful rhetorical analysis is that he\u2019s gonna get us all killed.\u201d Elsewhere, Italy saw its restrictions on daily life increase after the government ordered the closure of all shops apart from pharmacies and grocery stores and other essential stores. The whole country of 60 million people was placed into lockdown on Tuesday and is the second-worst affected nation with more than 12,000 cases. The outbreak also claimed its most high-profile cases so far when Hollywood superstar Tom Hanks announced that he and wife, Rita Wilson, have tested positive for the coronavirus. The pair are in Australia where the 63-year-old actor is making a film about Elvis directed by Baz Luhrmann. An unidentified UK cabinet minister has also gone into voluntary self-isolation pending test results after contact with infected health minister Nadine Dorries. In other developments, the NBA basketball league was suspended indefinitely after a Utah Jazz player tested positive, and New York and Chicago cancelled their St Patrick\u2019s day parades next week, the first time it has happened in more than 250 years. Global infections have now risen above 126,000 and there have been 4,600 deaths caused by what the World Health Organization has now officially declared a pandemic. China still accounts for the majority of victims but official figures from the country on Thursday said there had been just 15 new infections in the past 24 hours. The number of US cases has risen to more than 1,300, with the sharp increase in recent days one of the factors forcing Trump to respond more forcefully to the outbreak after consistently trying to play down the threat. But he still attempted to deflect blame, calling it a \u201cforeign\u201d virus and saying that there had been \u201cdramatically fewer cases\u201d in the US than in Europe. \u201cThe European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hotspots. As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travellers from Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter consulting with our top government health professionals, I have decided to take several strong but necessary actions to protect the health and wellbeing of all Americans.\u201d The US state department later issued revised guidance advising Americans to reconsider all overseas travel. The US economic measures revealed by Trump include financial relief for workers who are ill, quarantined or caring for others due to the illness, Trump said, adding that the US treasury would defer tax payments without interest or penalties for certain businesses and individuals. The financial system would be bolstered by an extra $200bn in liquidity, he said, and small businesses would be given access to more capital and liquidity.

Wilson and her husband, Tom Hanks, were diagnosed with coronavirus while in Australia and are in isolation at a Gold Coast hospital. Campbell, Russell and a number of unnamed Nine staff who came into contact with the visiting singer and producer have gone into self-isolation and are being tested. Campbell told 2GB Wilson had not shaken hands when she visited Nine on Monday. \u201cShe came into the Today Extra studios on Monday and she was delightful and really nice and she didn\u2019t have any symptoms of anything,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cShe was cautious. She actually made a joke coming into the studios, saying we shouldn\u2019t shake hands, we should bump elbows. So we bumped elbows.\u201d Nine said A Current Affair\u2019s host, Tracy Grimshaw, had not been in contact with Wilson but would not front the program on Thursday \u201cas a precautionary measure\u201d. Grimshaw, 59, is recovering from surgery. \u201cNine today has taken action in line with our crisis response plan around a visit to our studio by Ms Rita Wilson on Monday this week, for an appearance on Today Extra with David Campbell and Belinda Russell,\u201d Nine said on Thursday, hours after news broke about Hanks and Wilson. \u201cOur actions are in line with the guidelines set out by the government and health authorities. \u201cThose who were in prolonged contact with Ms Wilson have been tested and are self-isolating for 14 days.\u201d Nine would not detail how many staff are affected but it\u2019s understood that Campbell, Russell and Grimshaw are the only on-air personnel to have been sent home. Areas of the network\u2019s northern Sydney studios in Willoughby are being disinfected. The Today show co-host Karl Stefanovic will host ACA on Thursday and presenters for Today Extra are yet to be confirmed.

In particular, the first two crucial goals \u2013 reducing the mortality rate and economic impact \u2013 are incompatible. There are <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30567-5/fulltext\" title=\"\">\u201cdifficult decisions ahead for governments\u201d</a>, Anderson and colleagues wrote in the Lancet last week.</p> <p>China\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/23/coronavirus-panic-spreads-in-china-with-three-cities-in-lockdown\" title=\"\">draconian approach</a> \u2013 essentially bringing normal life to a standstill in affected cities and regions \u2013 paid off, says Anderson. But whether that would be possible in western democracies is another matter. Italy\u2019s strategy \u2013 which is now to close all schools and universities, impose travel restrictions and prohibit large public gatherings \u2013 could work, but it doesn\u2019t seem to have the rigour of the Chinese model: flights are still coming and going in Milan, and the trains are running.</p> <p>The truth, Anderson adds, is that we just don\u2019t know what the best strategy is. There are too many unknowns for mathematical models and predictions to be reliable. \u201cIt\u2019s more suck it and see,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In part, this is because we don\u2019t have enough information about the biology of the virus. One crucial factor is the degree of infectiousness: how many people, on average, will catch the virus from an infected individual. The coronavirus Covid-19 is more contagious than influenza: every person who gets coronavirus will typically pass it on to 2.5 people (at least in the early stages of an epidemic), compared to an infection rate of around 1.3 for ordinary flu.</p> <p>A big unknown is how readily children \u2013 who seem to contract only mild symptoms \u2013 can pass on the infection. No child seems yet to have been at the start of a chain of transmission, although that doesn\u2019t negate the possible benefits of closing schools. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/health/coronavirus-china-aylward.html\" title=\"\">\u201cYou don\u2019t take chances with children,\u201d</a> Bruce Aylward, an epidemiologist and assistant director general of the World Health Organization, who observed the Chinese response in Wuhan in February, told the New York Times.</p> <p>The problem is worsened by the fact that people who have the virus may start to feel ill only after they have already been infectious for a day or two, whereas people with Sars were hardly infectious at all before they felt ill. And people with coronavirus remain infectious for a relatively long time, perhaps around seven days, whereas this period was just a few days for the H1N1 swine flu that led to a pandemic in 2009. What\u2019s more, we don\u2019t know how many infected people are virtually free of symptoms.</p> <p>The only way to know that, says Anderson, is with intensive testing of a large random sample of the population, looking not for evidence of a live virus but for antibodies in the bloodstream that signify they have at some point been infected. Such studies are now being done in China, but there are no results yet.</p> <p>The key objective is clear enough: to reduce the period from the first appearance of symptoms to the isolation of the individual.</p> <p>\u201cChina got it down to two days,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cThat\u2019s what you need to aim for.\u201d The Chinese were also good at tracing people contacted by infected individuals, and testing them. That\u2019s a labour-intensive task, and Anderson thinks such efforts are probably understaffed here. \u201cThe critical thing is to have very strong surveillance systems that will give you early warning of infection,\u201d says Anne Johnson, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at University College London. And then to \u201cachieve rapid contact tracing and testing, and rapid isolation\u201d.</p> <p>Anderson thinks the trajectory of the outbreak may depend not so much on how governments respond but on how we all do as individuals. For example, most clusters of infection occur in families, so quick self-isolation from relatives can be crucial. So you should know the most common symptoms \u2013 fever and dry cough \u2013 and observe basic hygiene: hand-washing, wearing masks, not shaking hands (still my instinctive gesture when I met Anderson, which he politely reminded me to avoid). It\u2019s about maintaining \u201chigh levels of respiratory hygiene\u201d, says Johnson, and \u201creally cutting down the numbers of contacts you have.\u201d \u201cWe are all in this together,\u201d Johnson says, a point that couldn\u2019t be more apparent from the news that the health minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/health-minister-nadine-dorries-diagnosed-with-coronavirus\" title=\"\">Nadine Dorries</a> has tested positive for the virus.</p> <p>But some of these measures come at a cost. \u201cAll along the line we\u2019re going to have to balance the biomedical impact against the social impact,\u201d says Johnson. It may mostly affect those who are the most needy, she says, such as older people.</p> <p>Anderson thinks the places to learn from are not so much China or Italy but Hong Kong and Singapore. Both are, of course, very crowded places, yet they have kept case numbers in the hundreds. How? \u201cThe population reacted very differently to Europeans,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cThey had seen Sars\u201d in 2003, and so knew what was needed. They stopped going to restaurants and public events; they wore face masks.</p> <p>To bring about such changes in behaviour here, Anderson says, requires clear and responsible public information. We can assume this excludes floating the \u201ctheory\u201d that it could be best just to <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/health/boris-johnson-coronavirus-this-morning/\" title=\"\">\u201ctake it on the chin\u201d</a> and let the infection move through the population, as Boris Johnson suggested on breakfast television.</p> <p>Information should be targeted in particular at the most vulnerable groups \u2013 the over-50s \u2013 and should make use of social media, and it\u2019s important to get the tabloid press on board to communicate accurate information. So: an information campaign that leverages the power of Facebook and other social media, as well as the tabloids, to deliver information tailored to the individual. Aren\u2019t these the kind of skills the government has boasted of? Let\u2019s hope they can put them to good use.</p> <p>\u2022 Philip Ball is a science writer</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 March 2020.

And then to \u201cachieve rapid contact tracing and testing, and rapid isolation\u201d. Anderson thinks the trajectory of the outbreak may depend not so much on how governments respond but on how we all do as individuals. For example, most clusters of infection occur in families, so quick self-isolation from relatives can be crucial. So you should know the most common symptoms \u2013 fever and dry cough \u2013 and observe basic hygiene: hand-washing, wearing masks, not shaking hands (still my instinctive gesture when I met Anderson, which he politely reminded me to avoid). It\u2019s about maintaining \u201chigh levels of respiratory hygiene\u201d, says Johnson, and \u201creally cutting down the numbers of contacts you have.\u201d \u201cWe are all in this together,\u201d Johnson says, a point that couldn\u2019t be more apparent from the news that the health minister Nadine Dorries has tested positive for the virus. But some of these measures come at a cost. \u201cAll along the line we\u2019re going to have to balance the biomedical impact against the social impact,\u201d says Johnson. It may mostly affect those who are the most needy, she says, such as older people. Anderson thinks the places to learn from are not so much China or Italy but Hong Kong and Singapore. Both are, of course, very crowded places, yet they have kept case numbers in the hundreds. How? \u201cThe population reacted very differently to Europeans,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cThey had seen Sars\u201d in 2003, and so knew what was needed. They stopped going to restaurants and public events; they wore face masks. To bring about such changes in behaviour here, Anderson says, requires clear and responsible public information. We can assume this excludes floating the \u201ctheory\u201d that it could be best just to \u201ctake it on the chin\u201d and let the infection move through the population, as Boris Johnson suggested on breakfast television. Information should be targeted in particular at the most vulnerable groups \u2013 the over-50s \u2013 and should make use of social media, and it\u2019s important to get the tabloid press on board to communicate accurate information. So: an information campaign that leverages the power of Facebook and other social media, as well as the tabloids, to deliver information tailored to the individual. Aren\u2019t these the kind of skills the government has boasted of? Let\u2019s hope they can put them to good use. \u2022 Philip Ball is a science writer \u2022 This article was amended on 13 March 2020. The Sars outbreak in Singapore was in 2003, not in 2007 as an earlier version had said.",

Whether you have 5,000 or 10,000 people at a rally makes no difference. There are probably 10 people in the United States who don\u2019t know what they think of Trump and they\u2019re so out of it they might not even bother to vote.\u201d John Zogby, a Democratic pollster, acknowledged: \u201cThe campaign rallies have been very important to him and he always scheduled them strategically. They give him a boost. He\u2019s a showman and this is Trump at his best.\u201d But he added: \u201cHe has other effective ways of communicating and he will use them. His support base will move along with these changes. The campaign are very sophisticated in their use of data and being able to adjust.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Top story: Britain to move from \u2018contain\u2019 to \u2018delay\u2019 strategy Good morning. Warren Murray bringing you the latest on what is now being called a pandemic \u2013 some big developments overnight \u2013 and selected other matters of moment. Donald Trump has closed the US to travellers from EU countries in the Schengen zone (which excludes Britain and Ireland), declaring: \u201cWe made a life-saving move with early action on China. Now we must take the same action with Europe.\u201d He made a point of drumming up nationalism by calling it a \u201cforeign virus\u201d. Markets have found Trump\u2019s announcement less than reassuring as losses continue to mount and one top economist warns a global recession has become \u201chighly probable\u201d. In Washington the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, unveiled an economic assistance plan that was gaining bipartisan backing, with votes possibly taking place today. The NBA has suspended its basketball season. In Britain, Boris Johnson is poised to move Britain from the \u201ccontain\u201d phase of coronavirus to \u201cdelay\u201d, focused on mitigating the spread and paving the way for \u201csocial distancing\u201d and \u201cpopulation distancing\u201d. The PM will chair a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee at lunchtime. The number of coronavirus patients in the UK rose by 87 to 460 on Wednesday, while the number of deaths rose to eight, and the World Health Organization officially called the spread of Covid-19 a pandemic. The latest developments are at our live blog. The actor couple Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson have announced they have tested positive to coronavirus while on the Gold Coast in Australia, where Hanks is due to film a Baz Luhrmann movie about Elvis. Hanks wrote: \u201cWell, now. What to do next? The medical officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks\u2019 will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?\u201d Those are the big developments \u2013 let\u2019s plunge into some other news for the moment. More on the Covid-19 pandemic further down \u2026 and here\u2019s where you can find all our coverage of the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 from breaking news to fact checks * * * Women and girls \u2018still at risk online\u2019 \u2013 Women and girls face a growing crisis of online harms with sexual harassment, threatening messages and discrimination making the web an unsafe place to be, the web\u2019s founder, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, has warned. A year ago he launched the Contract for the Web, a global action plan to clean up the web, but now warns that without tackling misogynistic abuse the aims of the contract cannot be achieved. \u201cThat requires the attention of all those who shape technology, from CEOs and engineers to academics and public officials.\u201d Berners-Lee is calling on companies and governments to strengthen laws and tackle online abuse as a top priority this year, and for the public to speak up if they witness abuse online. * * * Dom\u2019s new toy \u2013 An \u00a3800m \u201cblue skies\u201d science research agency has been announced as part of Rishi Sunak\u2019s first budget as chancellor. The brainchild of Boris Johnson\u2019s closest political adviser, Dominic Cummings, it will fund \u201chigh-risk, high-reward science\u201d and model itself on the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) in the US. In other help for business, Sunak will expand a tax allowance on new structures and buildings; cut business rates; and increase employment allowance to reduce employers\u2019 national insurance bills. To save money the Treasury has scrapped plans to cut corporation tax. The national living wage will rise to more than \u00a310.50 an hour in 2024 compared with \u00a38.21 at present. On coronavirus, Sunak promised to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to support households and businesses. Treasury is making \u00a312bn of emergency spending firepower available, with Sunak warning the virus will have a dramatic short-term impact on families, jobs and growth. There is an initial \u00a35bn to help the NHS, local authorities and the public sector cope with the outbreak. * * * Courts not done with Weinstein \u2013 After Harvey Weinstein was handed a 23-year prison sentence for rape and sexual assault, details from unsealed court papers reveal how he wrote in an email that Jennifer Aniston \u201cshould be killed\u201d after a reporter asked him about her allegations of sexual assault. The documents also revealed that actor-director Ben Affleck was one of many industry figures on a \u201cred flag list\u201d compiled by Weinstein. When it became clear in October 2017 that the board of the Weinstein Company was about to fire him, Weinstein sent a string of emails to powerful corporate figures, including Michael Bloomberg, Jeff Bezos, Netflix\u2019s Ted Sarandos and Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, asking for their intervention and \u201ca private letter of support\u201d. Weinstein, who throughout has appeared bewildered at his downfall, has been hit with a further blow: the district attorney in Los Angeles has announced extradition proceedings on two charges relating to two more west coast accusers. Coronavirus extra Our Science Weekly team received a great response to their Covid-19 episode last week \u2013 and they\u2019re back with another special, this time exploring what exactly happens once someone is infected. While scientists are racing to figure that out, insights can be gleaned from other viruses like influenza. There is talk \u2013 with some basis in evidence \u2013 that spring in the northern hemisphere should slow the spread of coronavirus. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has affirmed this but science journalist Kate Ravilious writes that no one knows exactly how this particular strain will behave. Researchers in many fields are working furiously on all aspects of the pandemic, and there are early findings that containment measures such as early detection, isolation of the infected and travel restrictions are having a big impact. But it would have been better had China acted sooner. Science writer Philip Ball says that in terms of how to get the response right, Britain should look to Hong Kong and Singapore. In the US, things are edging towards shutdown \u2013 there are already more than 1,000 schools closed, some airlines are cutting routes amid a travel downturn, various locations are banning large gatherings and St Patrick\u2019s Day festivities are being called off. Election campaigns are in disarray \u2013 Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden will hold their next TV debate without a studio audience. But Donald Trump, fresh from announcing emergency measures, is still due to summon thousands to a \u201cCatholics for Trump\u201d rally next week, as if it were business as usual. In countries including Hong Kong and the US, there are human rights concerns as prisoners are pressed into service making hand sanitiser and protective masks \u2013 seen as \u201cironic and exploitative\u201d when they are among populations most susceptible to the spread of the virus. Wall Street\u2019s record-breaking 11-year \u201cbull market\u201d came to an end on Wednesday as fears about the pandemic hit stock markets again. That could herald a \u201cbear market\u201d \u2013 enter Steven Poole to explain the origin of the term. Today in Focus podcast: The never-ending prison sentences A spate of deaths of people serving indeterminate prison sentences has led to calls for such sentences to be revoked. The Guardian\u2019s Jamie Grierson investigates. Plus: Larry Elliott on Rishi Sunak\u2019s coronavirus budget. Lunchtime read: \u2018A fun movie, I promise\u2019 Craig Zobel, the director of The Hunt \u2013 a controversial schlocky satirical thriller about liberals hunting Trump voters \u2013 talks to Benjamin Lee about intention, assumptions and how it feels when the president tweets about you. Sport The basketball world was in shock after the NBA announced it was suspending the season as the coronavirus outbreak tightened its grip on the United States. Two more Formula One team members have been tested for the coronavirus at the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne, taking the total having undergone checks for the infection to five. Diego Simeone\u2019s Atl\u00e9tico Madrid completed a heist at Anfield to end Liverpool\u2019s Champions League defence after the holders squandered a 2-0 lead in extra-time. In Paris, goals from Neymar and Juan Bernat saw PSG overturn a 2-1 first-leg deficit against Borussia Dortmund and reach the quarter-finals for the first time since 2016. The Juventus defender Daniele Rugani has tested positive for coronavirus, while the knockout stages of the Europa League have been thrown into disarray after two of the last-16 fixtures were postponed the day before the first legs were scheduled to take place. But Olympic organisers have insisted the Tokyo Games will go ahead as planned in July despite the sharp spike in Covid\u201119 cases across the globe. England\u2019s SheBelieves Cup campaign crawled to a close after a thumping header from Alexia Putellas gave a rising Spain team a 1-0 win. Tiger Roll put in a tame display in the cross-country race at Cheltenham, in which he ceded his crown to the French raider, Easysland, without much of a scrap. Danny Care has come to the defence of Joe Marler by suggesting he would not be facing a season-ending suspension had Alun Wyn Jones ended up on the winning side last weekend. And the England and Wales Cricket Board has softened its recreational drugs policy and dropped the clandestine 21-day ban that led to Alex Hales missing out on the World Cup last year. Business There\u2019s more trouble ahead for the British high street after retail experts warned that the big retail chains, which are closing stores and shedding jobs, had been overlooked by the budget\u2019s emergency business rates cuts. Wall Street entered bear market territory on Wednesday, but stocks still look like they have further to fall after Donald Trump\u2019s swingeing ban on European travel to the US heightened fears of a global recession. Shares in the Asia-Pacific were pulverised once more overnight and the FTSE100 is set to drop nearly 5% this morning. The pound is worth $1.281 and \u20ac1.134. The papers If there\u2019s one thing some editors are happy to see spread around today, it\u2019s your pound. \u201cNerves of steel\u201d, says the Express, oddly and inexplicably \u2026 going on to say, \u201cRishi\u2019s \u00a330bn war on virus\u201d.

His warning came as a rift appeared to be opening up among Olympic officials and senior politicians in Japan, where 620 cases of Covid-19 have been recorded, along with 12 deaths, according to the health ministry. Those figures exclude nearly 700 infections and seven deaths connected to the Diamond Princess cruise liner, which was quarantined at the Japanese port of Yokohama last month. Tokyo\u2019s governor, Yuriko Koike, said on Thursday that cancelling the Games, due to open on 24 July, would be \u201cunthinkable,\u201d but added that the World Health Organization\u2019s decision to declare the outbreak a pandemic would have some impact on the event. \u201cIt can\u2019t be said that the announcement of a pandemic would have no impact ... but I think cancellation is unthinkable,\u201d Koike told reporters, without explaining how the pandemic classification might affect the Games. On Wednesday, Haruyuki Takahashi, a member of the Olympic organising committee\u2019s executive board, angered colleagues when he suggested in a newspaper interview that postponing the Games by a year or two might be the \u201cmost feasible\u201d option if the virus made it impossible to hold them this summer. The organising committee\u2019s chief, Yoshiro Mori, quickly dismissed Takahashi\u2019s remarks as \u201coutrageous\u201d, adding that the Games would go ahead as scheduled. Takahashi reportedly apologised for the comments, but again raised the prospect of major disruption to the Games when he said any decision on their future would have to be made before May \u2013 a timeline previously dismissed by Tokyo 2020 organisers. Speaking to the TBS network after Mori had publicly rebuked him, Takahashi said: \u201cIf you think about the athletes, May would seem too late (to make a decision on any delay). We need to think about taking the first step, before the IOC.\u201d Takahashi said that the organising committee would probably discuss postponement at its next meeting later this month, TBS reported. The coronavirus outbreak has already disrupted preparations. The the traditional flame-lighting ceremony in Olympia, Greece, is expected to be held without spectators, and an event to mark the torch\u2019s arrival in Japan on 20 March will be scaled down. Olympic qualifying tournaments in several different sports have also been cancelled, postponed or moved to different countries due to the outbreak.",

Race fees are one of the three biggest revenue streams for F1. When asked why he thought it was going ahead Hamilton pointedly noted: \u201cCash is king. I can\u2019t add much more to it. I don\u2019t feel like I should shy away from my opinion.\u201d</p> <p>Ferrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel insisted that the drivers would act collectively to desist from racing were there to be any fatalities associated with F1 from the coronavirus. \u201cWe hope it doesn\u2019t get that far.

This would have a huge impact on the ability of any team to function. Mechanics and engineers all work in close proximity to one another and to drivers.

      "bodyText": "As fears grow that the coronavirus is already spreading in the Formula One paddock at the Australian Grand Prix, the world champion, Lewis Hamilton, has admitted he is \u201cshocked\u201d the race is going ahead. Up to eight team members have now been tested for the coronavirus and placed into self-isolation as further doubt is cast over the running of the race on Sunday. Hamilton delivered a withering assessment of why he believed the meeting was taking place, commenting that \u201ccash is king\u201d. Hamilton, the six-time world champion, goes into the season opener at Albert Park as strong favourite to take a record-equalling seventh title. However he was uncompromising in his criticism that F1 was putting its personnel and fans at risk in holding a meeting that is set to attract at least 100,000 people on race day just as the WHO has declared a pandemic. \u201cI am really very, very surprised that we are here,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s really shocking that we are all sitting in this room. There are so many fans here today and it seems like the rest of the world is reacting, probably a little bit late, but we have already seen this morning that [US president Donald] Trump has shut down the borders with Europe to the States and you are seeing the NBA being suspended, yet Formula One continues to go on. \u201cIt\u2019s a concern I think for the people here \u2013 it\u2019s quite a big circus that\u2019s come here and it\u2019s definitely concerning for me.\u201d Despite doubts being expressed about whether holding the race was suitable given the global spread of the infection, promoters, the FIA and F1 have insisted there is no reason as yet to cancel the meeting. Race fees are one of the three biggest revenue streams for F1. When asked why he thought it was going ahead Hamilton pointedly noted: \u201cCash is king. I can\u2019t add much more to it. I don\u2019t feel like I should shy away from my opinion.\u201d Ferrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel insisted that the drivers would act collectively to desist from racing were there to be any fatalities associated with F1 from the coronavirus. \u201cWe hope it doesn\u2019t get that far. If it were to get that far, then for sure you would pull the handbrake,\u201d he said. \u201cWe share a common opinion on big decisions and that would qualify as a very big decision. Ultimately, as I said before, you look at yourself and I think we would be mature enough to look after yourselves and pull the handbrake in that case.\u201d Two members of the Haas team and one from McLaren, who were identified with fever symptoms on Wednesday, underwent tests for the coronavirus before going into self-isolation. No results have yet been made available. On Thursday morning Guenther Steiner, the team principal of Haas, confirmed that two more members of his team had shown symptoms and undergone a test before leaving the circuit, while the deputy chief health officer of Victoria, Annaliese van Diemen, later said a total of eight people from various teams had now been tested. Steiner expects the results from Wednesday\u2019s tests to be available on Thursday evening but McLaren warned that the results could take anything between 24 and 72 hours to be distributed. An FIA representative explained that Melbourne has only only one facility for testing for the virus, which can only process 500 cases at a time and is currently dealing with a backlog. Van Diemen stated if any were to return positive results, their close contacts would be placed into \u201cimmediate quarantine\u201d. This would have a huge impact on the ability of any team to function. Mechanics and engineers all work in close proximity to one another and to drivers. Van Diemen said the test results had been made a priority. She added that if the tests were positive, it would be a matter for the chief health officer and the health minister to decide if the event could go ahead. \u201cIt will depend on how many people have tested positive and how many potential contacts they may have exposed in the days running up to their illness,\u201d she said. The Victorian health minister, Jenny Mikakos, said she had not received any advice from the chief health officer, Dr Brett Sutton, to suggest the Australian Grand Prix should be cancelled.

      "body": "<p>Sleepless parents, hard-partying students and anyone who works antisocial hours or is on a tight budget will know that a well-stocked kitchen cupboard is your best friend and that if you look after it, it will look after you. Now, however, the rest of us are getting a reminder, as the coronavirus outbreak forces thousands of us into self-isolation. Here are some ideas for what to cook if you are forced to rely on what you already have, rather than popping to the shops for ingredients.</p> <h2><strong>Pilaf</strong><br></h2> <p>Yotam Ottolenghi <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/23/pilaf-recipes-yotam-ottolenghi\" title=\"\">once pointed out</a> that there are as many variations on pilaf as there are nations in south and west Asia, the Middle East, India, the Balkans and large swathes of Africa. He was focusing on rice cooked with broth and other ingredients, but the cookbook writer Vicky Boghal has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/apr/18/chef-vicky-bhogal-interview-kitchen-encounters\" title=\"\">an even simpler go-to</a> using cooked rice. Sautee it briskly with whatever you have to hand: finely chopped veg (fresh or from a can), sliced leftovers, tinned fish or cured meat and a drizzle of oil. To flavour, add your favourite condiment (soy sauce, Marmite, fish sauce, ketchup), spices (cumin, coriander), pickles (capers, jalapenos), dried fruit or herbs (dried parsley, thyme, rosemary) and a splash of water, and cover to steam for 10 minutes. Finish with seeds (I like sesame), fresh herbs if you have any or chopped nuts. Just to prove how eminently adaptable this dish is, Nigel Slater makes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/13/nigel-slater-simple-supper-recipes\" title=\"\">a bacon and mushroom version</a> with bulgur wheat in place of rice: even the grain can be replaced ...</p> <h2><strong>Flatbread pizza</strong><br></h2> <p>Caroline Craig and Sophie Missing have perfected cooking from basics. Their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/10/rice-krispie-scotch-eggs-turkish-pizza-recipe-caroline-craig-sophie-missing-cook-residency\" title=\"\">pizza base</a> mixes 160g self-raising flour with 150g Greek yoghurt, some salt and some cumin. But the Awesome Green\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theawesomegreen.com/very-green-vegan-flatbread-pizza/\" title=\"\">vegan version</a> will do just as well \u2013 230g whole wheat flour mixed with 125 ml water, 1 tbsp oil, salt and nigella or some other kind of seed. Knead into a dough, then halve and roll out to the size of an oven-proof frying pan (or else transfer once fried to a baking sheet). Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas mark 7, and heat your frying pan on a high heat. Once hot, add a tiny splash of oil and carefully place the rolled-out dough in it. Fry on both sides for about five minutes, then top with whatever you have on your shelves. Pesto, tomato paste, even ketchup will work; olives, capers, tinned peppers or aubergine; any grated cheese, any cured meat. Transfer to the oven and bake for five to 10 minutes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"02302c9e602625ffca4a53e01df9876658104147\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02302c9e602625ffca4a53e01df9876658104147/0_246_4287_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flatbread pizzas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flatbread pizza is simple to make and can be topped with things you find in your cupboard.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claudia Totir/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Chilli</strong><br></h2> <p>The writer and campaigner Jack Monroe is, of course, the undisputed queen of cooking with canned goods, and not out of affectation. Her resourcefulness is exemplary, as demonstrated in <a href=\"https://cookingonabootstrap.com/2019/11/03/budget-chilli-recipe/\" title=\"\">this bootstrap chilli</a> (to serve four), adapted from a Gordon Ramsay beef dish. Drain and rinse two cans of beans (Monroe uses red kidney and baked beans \u2013 you could try any others, or cook your own from scratch. The website Serious Eats says you can cook 130g of dry beans in place of a standard 400g tin). Cover with water and boil for 10 minutes, then simmer until soft. In a pan, fry some chopped onion in oil with cumin and paprika (hot sauce and dried or fresh chilli would work, too). Add a tin of chopped tomatoes, a stock cube and a splash of red wine. Add the drained beans and some dark chocolate and stir to combine. Serve with rice, or cold in a burrito, and any add-ons you have lying around: more hot sauce or salsa, jalapenos, sour cream or Greek yoghurt, fresh green leaves, grated cheddar \u2026</p> <h2><strong>Coconut milk bread pudding</strong><br></h2> <p>Author Emily Han <a href=\"https://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-coconut-bread-pudding-137917\" title=\"\">has made this</a> with every kind of bread. Arrange torn pieces of bread in a buttered baking dish and sprinkle with your choice of dried fruit (candied ginger, golden raisins, dates, you name it) and nuts. Pour over a mixture of one can of coconut milk (or other plant milk), three eggs (3 tbsp flax or chia seeds mixed with 9 tbsp water are a handy vegan substitute), sugar (Han\u2019s recipe says 200g, which is a lot; replace with honey, maple syrup, jam or date syrup to the quantity you are comfortable with), sweet spice (cardamom goes wonderfully with pistachios), vanilla if you like it and a pinch of salt. Bake at 170C (150C fan)/325F/gas mark 3 for 45 minutes.</p> <h2><strong>Store cupboard noodles</strong><br></h2> <p>Dried noodles are the perfect quick fix, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jan/19/best-budget-recipes-store-cupboard-ingredients\" title=\"\">Fuchsia Dunlop puts it</a>. All you need is something to make a sauce (oil, salt and heat), and something crunchy to put on top. She has an excellently simplified version of a Sichuan sauce (to serve four) mixing 4 tbsp peanut butter (in place of sesame; you could easily substitute with tahini or another nut butter) with 2 \u00bd tbsp soy sauce and a dash of vinegar (she uses Chinkiang, but says red wine vinegar works fine, too). She mixes in oil (chilli and sesame; olive would work just as well, with chilli flakes, chopped fresh chilli or a dash of hot sauce) and minced garlic, and whisks with enough stock or water to get the consistency of single cream.

      "bodyText": "Sleepless parents, hard-partying students and anyone who works antisocial hours or is on a tight budget will know that a well-stocked kitchen cupboard is your best friend and that if you look after it, it will look after you. Now, however, the rest of us are getting a reminder, as the coronavirus outbreak forces thousands of us into self-isolation. Here are some ideas for what to cook if you are forced to rely on what you already have, rather than popping to the shops for ingredients. Pilaf Yotam Ottolenghi once pointed out that there are as many variations on pilaf as there are nations in south and west Asia, the Middle East, India, the Balkans and large swathes of Africa. He was focusing on rice cooked with broth and other ingredients, but the cookbook writer Vicky Boghal has an even simpler go-to using cooked rice. Sautee it briskly with whatever you have to hand: finely chopped veg (fresh or from a can), sliced leftovers, tinned fish or cured meat and a drizzle of oil. To flavour, add your favourite condiment (soy sauce, Marmite, fish sauce, ketchup), spices (cumin, coriander), pickles (capers, jalapenos), dried fruit or herbs (dried parsley, thyme, rosemary) and a splash of water, and cover to steam for 10 minutes. Finish with seeds (I like sesame), fresh herbs if you have any or chopped nuts. Just to prove how eminently adaptable this dish is, Nigel Slater makes a bacon and mushroom version with bulgur wheat in place of rice: even the grain can be replaced ... Flatbread pizza Caroline Craig and Sophie Missing have perfected cooking from basics. Their pizza base mixes 160g self-raising flour with 150g Greek yoghurt, some salt and some cumin. But the Awesome Green\u2019s vegan version will do just as well \u2013 230g whole wheat flour mixed with 125 ml water, 1 tbsp oil, salt and nigella or some other kind of seed. Knead into a dough, then halve and roll out to the size of an oven-proof frying pan (or else transfer once fried to a baking sheet). Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas mark 7, and heat your frying pan on a high heat. Once hot, add a tiny splash of oil and carefully place the rolled-out dough in it. Fry on both sides for about five minutes, then top with whatever you have on your shelves. Pesto, tomato paste, even ketchup will work; olives, capers, tinned peppers or aubergine; any grated cheese, any cured meat. Transfer to the oven and bake for five to 10 minutes. Chilli The writer and campaigner Jack Monroe is, of course, the undisputed queen of cooking with canned goods, and not out of affectation. Her resourcefulness is exemplary, as demonstrated in this bootstrap chilli (to serve four), adapted from a Gordon Ramsay beef dish. Drain and rinse two cans of beans (Monroe uses red kidney and baked beans \u2013 you could try any others, or cook your own from scratch. The website Serious Eats says you can cook 130g of dry beans in place of a standard 400g tin). Cover with water and boil for 10 minutes, then simmer until soft. In a pan, fry some chopped onion in oil with cumin and paprika (hot sauce and dried or fresh chilli would work, too). Add a tin of chopped tomatoes, a stock cube and a splash of red wine. Add the drained beans and some dark chocolate and stir to combine. Serve with rice, or cold in a burrito, and any add-ons you have lying around: more hot sauce or salsa, jalapenos, sour cream or Greek yoghurt, fresh green leaves, grated cheddar \u2026 Coconut milk bread pudding Author Emily Han has made this with every kind of bread. Arrange torn pieces of bread in a buttered baking dish and sprinkle with your choice of dried fruit (candied ginger, golden raisins, dates, you name it) and nuts. Pour over a mixture of one can of coconut milk (or other plant milk), three eggs (3 tbsp flax or chia seeds mixed with 9 tbsp water are a handy vegan substitute), sugar (Han\u2019s recipe says 200g, which is a lot; replace with honey, maple syrup, jam or date syrup to the quantity you are comfortable with), sweet spice (cardamom goes wonderfully with pistachios), vanilla if you like it and a pinch of salt. Bake at 170C (150C fan)/325F/gas mark 3 for 45 minutes. Store cupboard noodles Dried noodles are the perfect quick fix, as Fuchsia Dunlop puts it. All you need is something to make a sauce (oil, salt and heat), and something crunchy to put on top. She has an excellently simplified version of a Sichuan sauce (to serve four) mixing 4 tbsp peanut butter (in place of sesame; you could easily substitute with tahini or another nut butter) with 2 \u00bd tbsp soy sauce and a dash of vinegar (she uses Chinkiang, but says red wine vinegar works fine, too). She mixes in oil (chilli and sesame; olive would work just as well, with chilli flakes, chopped fresh chilli or a dash of hot sauce) and minced garlic, and whisks with enough stock or water to get the consistency of single cream. Cook four servings of noodles to packet instructions, then drain and divide between four bowls, top with the sauce, chopped chives or spring onions if you have any and a sprinkling of sesame seeds or chopped cashews. Tinned fish would add bulk, as would any finely sliced salad vegetables (cucumber, tomato, celery, lettuce). Squash stew Slater does an excellent pumpkin dish that could work just as well with butternut squash or sweet potato. Fry 800g of chopped squash with some oil until golden brown. Remove then fry a chopped onion until brown, stir in some tomato puree, add a tin of chopped tomatoes, a canful of water and season with the spice or dried herb of your choice (he uses oregano; thyme, parsley, rosemary or fennel would be lovely, too, as would cumin, coriander etc) and salt and pepper. Return the squash to the pan and simmer until soft \u2013 about 25 minutes. Serve with some kind of grain (bread, pasta, rice) and top with what you like: a dollop of something creamy, hot sauce or chilli flakes, fresh herbs, green leaves, a squeeze of lemon \u2026 Patties One of the most adaptable things around : you need a base (cooked potato or sweet potato, mashed carrots or beans, tofu), bulk (cooked grains, more veg, chopped nuts, breadcrumbs) and flavour (spices, cheese, herbs, onion, garlic, lemon zest, seeds). Mix to obtain something that holds together nicely, then shape into balls and flatten before refrigerating for one hour. Heat some oil in a pan and fry for three to four minutes on both sides. Serve as you would a burger pattie. Chocolate and olive oil cake Meera Sodha\u2019s vegan take on the sticky Swedish kladdkaka is mouthwatering.

Chickpea and bread soup Ottolenghi makes this from scratch, cooking dried chickpeas with some cinnamon and dried chilli. You could just as easily make it with drained canned chickpeas, and add the spice with the other ingredients: garlic, cumin and coriander seeds, tomato paste, harissa (or other chilli paste), some olive oil and season with salt and pepper and some water.

      "bodyText": "Panic selling drove Australian shares down 7.36% on Thursday after the market gave the thumbs down to a government stimulus package before being electrified by a sweeping US ban on European travel imposed by Donald Trump. More than 25% of the market\u2019s value, or more than $520bn, has been wiped from the value of Australian shares since 21 February, when coronavirus chaos began to grip the market. Thursday\u2019s steep fall \u2013 the second of more than 7% this week and the worst single-day plunge since the global financial crisis \u2013 once again battered airlines, travel agents and mining stocks, but no sector of the economy was immune to the punishment. Trump\u2019s announcement is likely to further devastate already ravaged US and European markets overnight, setting the Australian exchange up for a further fall on Friday that will bring to an end one of the most miserable weeks of trade in a decade. Just two stocks in the Australian top 200 finished up for the day: medical imaging company Pro Medicus, which bounced back from a fall of more than 7% on Wednesday, and construction contractor Cimic, formerly known as Leighton Holdings. The benchmark ASX200 index began the day down about 2%, and began sliding further as the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, began outlining a $17.6bn stimulus package that focused on helping businesses get through the crisis and had relatively little in it for households. By the time the pair finished speaking, the index had fallen 3%. Asked on ABC TV if he was expecting a better reaction to the announcement, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said there was a lot of \u201cuncertainty\u201d in the market. \u201cThe market\u2019s volatility is not unexpected in the circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fundamentals of the Australian economy are strong as we go into this and we are confident they will be strong on the other side of this.\u201d Panic selling set in at about 1pm, as traders began to understand the potentially devastating consequences for the world economy of Trump\u2019s ban on travel to the US from Europe (except the UK) began to sink in. The index immediately plummeted to be down 7% for the day. Prices fluctuated wildly over three manic hours of trade but any hope some of the losses could be clawed back were dashed when buying support evaporated at the closing bell, leaving the index down 7.36% for the day. Lithium and tantalum miner Pilbara Minerals was the worst performer in the top 200, shedding one fifth of its value \u2013 a fall that came on top of a 13% fall on Wednesday. As a whole, mining stocks are down about 40% over the past month. Online air ticket sales company Webjet, which on Wednesday withdrew its profit forecasts because of the coronavirus pandemic, was not far behind Pilbara Mining, crashing 19.7%, while travel agency network Flight Centre was the third biggest loser, diving 18.2%. Both companies have lost about half of their market value since 20 February. Other stocks to have more than 15% of their value ripped away included troubled financial services group IOOF, down 15.8%, and Sydney casino operator Star, which fell 15.4%. Star\u2019s rival, James Packer\u2019s Crown Resorts, fell 8%. Webjet is not the only company struggling to grasp the damage wrought by the Covid-19 outbreak. Building supplies company Brickworks told the market its profit for the first half of the year would be down 50% compared to the same time last year while Wilson Asset Management scrapped a share offering for investors in its listed WAM Active fund. New Zealand\u2019s Auckland Airport, which is listed on the Australian exchange, went into a trading halt, saying it needed time to consider the effects of Trump\u2019s announcement on its business.",

Slight fevers too. To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the coronavirus, and were found to be positive.</p> <p>\u201cWell, now. What to do next? The medical officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks\u2019 will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian understands that early on Thursday morning cast and crew attached to the film received an email instructing them to stay away from set after a member of the production tested positive for the virus.</p> <p>The couple are now in isolation in a Gold Coast hospital. The premier of Queensland, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said on Thursday that health officials would conduct contact tracing to determine who had been in close contact with Hanks and Wilson.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who have come in close contact with Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson will now need to self isolate and quarantine,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Famously approachable, Hanks had regularly posed for photos with fans at Coolangatta Beach on the Gold Coast and a cafe near Mount Warning on the New South Wales far north coast.</p> <p>But the premier said she did not believe a selfie would constitute close contact.</p> <p>\u201cTom has been having a wonderful time on the Gold Coast and we are so lucky to have Tom in Queensland,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cBut what it is, is people who have come in very close contact with him in recent days [our] experts will now work very closely with him with Baz [Luhrmann] and all the cast the crew and then they will isolate those people who have been in that close proximity.</p> <p>\u201cFrom what the chief health officer has told me it\u2019s over 15 minutes of being in very close contact, so a selfie wouldn\u2019t count as that.\u201d</p> <p>She said Hanks and Wilson would receive \u201cthe best treatment in our hospital\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very confident with the physicians that we have that will be treating Tom and his wife and like I said we wish them all the very best for a speedy recovery,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cI know the thoughts of Queenslanders and all Australians are with Tom and Rita during this time.\u201d</p> <p>In a video posted to Instagram Chet Hanks, the couple\u2019s son, said he\u2019d spoken to his parents who were \u201cnot tripping\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s up everyone, um, yeah it\u2019s true my parents got coronavirus. Crazy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI just got off the phone with them, they both are fine, they\u2019re not even that sick, they\u2019re not worried about it, they\u2019re not tripping, but they\u2019re going through the necessary health precautions obviously.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything to be too worried about, I appreciate everyone\u2019s concern and the well wishes but I think it\u2019s all going to be alright.\u201d</p> <p>In the lead up to shooting, normal practice would involve lead actors to have close contact with wardrobe and hair and makeup departments for screen tests and sound tests. These often involve close physical contact with potentially dozens of crew.</p> <p>Production on the Luhrmann film had been set to begin filming on Monday. In a statement the US production company behind the film, Warner Bros, said it was \u201ctaking precautions\u201d to protect its employees.</p> <p>\u201cThe health and safety of our company members is always our top priority, and we are taking precautions to protect everyone who works on our productions around the world,\u201d the company said in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been made aware that a company member from our Elvis feature film, which is currently in pre-production in The Gold Coast, Australia, has tested positive for Covid-19 (coronavirus).</p> <p>\u201cWe are working closely with the appropriate Australian health agencies to identify and contact anyone who may have come in direct contact with the individual.</p> <p>\u201cThe individual who tested positive for Covid-19 is currently receiving treatment.\u201d</p> <p>Hanks and Wilson, who is an American singer and actor, had been travelling to different locations in Australia and had posted photos from Sydney and Brisbane on Instagram.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B9duHWNHcs6/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "The US actor Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson, have been diagnosed with coronavirus while filming in Australia. The 63-year-old Academy Award-winning actor is currently on the Gold Coast in Queensland filming Baz Luhrmann\u2019s untitled production about Elvis Presley. Hanks wrote on Instagram on Thursday that after he and Wilson had been feeling \u201ca bit tired, like we had colds\u201d they arranged to be tested for the virus and had been \u201cfound to be positive\u201d. \u201cWe felt a bit tired, like we had colds and some body aches,\u201d he wrote on his official Instagram page. \u201cRita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too. To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the coronavirus, and were found to be positive. \u201cWell, now. What to do next? The medical officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks\u2019 will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?\u201d The Guardian understands that early on Thursday morning cast and crew attached to the film received an email instructing them to stay away from set after a member of the production tested positive for the virus. The couple are now in isolation in a Gold Coast hospital. The premier of Queensland, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said on Thursday that health officials would conduct contact tracing to determine who had been in close contact with Hanks and Wilson. \u201cPeople who have come in close contact with Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson will now need to self isolate and quarantine,\u201d she said. Famously approachable, Hanks had regularly posed for photos with fans at Coolangatta Beach on the Gold Coast and a cafe near Mount Warning on the New South Wales far north coast. But the premier said she did not believe a selfie would constitute close contact. \u201cTom has been having a wonderful time on the Gold Coast and we are so lucky to have Tom in Queensland,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what it is, is people who have come in very close contact with him in recent days [our] experts will now work very closely with him with Baz [Luhrmann] and all the cast the crew and then they will isolate those people who have been in that close proximity. \u201cFrom what the chief health officer has told me it\u2019s over 15 minutes of being in very close contact, so a selfie wouldn\u2019t count as that.\u201d She said Hanks and Wilson would receive \u201cthe best treatment in our hospital\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m very confident with the physicians that we have that will be treating Tom and his wife and like I said we wish them all the very best for a speedy recovery,\u201d she said. \u201cI know the thoughts of Queenslanders and all Australians are with Tom and Rita during this time.\u201d In a video posted to Instagram Chet Hanks, the couple\u2019s son, said he\u2019d spoken to his parents who were \u201cnot tripping\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s up everyone, um, yeah it\u2019s true my parents got coronavirus. Crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cI just got off the phone with them, they both are fine, they\u2019re not even that sick, they\u2019re not worried about it, they\u2019re not tripping, but they\u2019re going through the necessary health precautions obviously. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything to be too worried about, I appreciate everyone\u2019s concern and the well wishes but I think it\u2019s all going to be alright.\u201d In the lead up to shooting, normal practice would involve lead actors to have close contact with wardrobe and hair and makeup departments for screen tests and sound tests. These often involve close physical contact with potentially dozens of crew. Production on the Luhrmann film had been set to begin filming on Monday. In a statement the US production company behind the film, Warner Bros, said it was \u201ctaking precautions\u201d to protect its employees. \u201cThe health and safety of our company members is always our top priority, and we are taking precautions to protect everyone who works on our productions around the world,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe have been made aware that a company member from our Elvis feature film, which is currently in pre-production in The Gold Coast, Australia, has tested positive for Covid-19 (coronavirus). \u201cWe are working closely with the appropriate Australian health agencies to identify and contact anyone who may have come in direct contact with the individual. \u201cThe individual who tested positive for Covid-19 is currently receiving treatment.\u201d Hanks and Wilson, who is an American singer and actor, had been travelling to different locations in Australia and had posted photos from Sydney and Brisbane on Instagram. Wilson performed at the famous Sydney Opera House over the weekend and had appeared on the Nine breakfast morning show Today earlier in the week. A Sydney Opera House spokesperson said Wilson\u2019s performance was attended by approximately 207 people, including Hanks, and that following the news the pair had tested positive for coronavirus the Opera House was in touch with NSW Health and Queensland Health and will be acting on their advice. \u201cThis includes getting in touch with anyone, including patrons and staff, who may have been in contact with the couple while at the Opera House,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cFor some time the Opera House has had a number of health and safety measures in place, including additional on-site cleaning with hospital-grade disinfectant and providing hand sanitiser throughout the building. Dedicated venue cleaning is in operation \u2013 a process which was followed after Saturday\u2019s performance in the Utzon Room.\u201d The Opera House remains open and tours and performances will proceed as planned, unless otherwise advised.",

Rita and I are down here in Australia. We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too. To play things right, as is needed in the world right now,  we were tested for the Coronavirus, and were found to be positive. Well, now. What to do next? The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks\u2019 will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires.  Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no? We\u2019ll keep the world posted and updated. Take care of yourselves!

      "bodyText": "They are one of the highest profile Hollywood couples who attract wellwishers and autograph hunters in droves. So when it was discovered that Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson had tested positive for coronavirus while in Australia, the premier of Queensland let it be known that anyone who came into close contact with them should self-isolate. Social media shows the celebrity couple came into contact with quite a few people, though how many of those would qualify as \u201cclose contact\u201d is unclear. Close contact is defined as being face to face with someone for at least 15 minutes, or being in the same enclosed space for at least two hours, so it is highly unlikely any quick chance encounters would lead to a transmission. Here is a timeline sourced from publicly available information of where Hanks and Wilson had been in the days leading up to their diagnoses. 12 March \u2013 Gold Coast hospital On Thursday, Hanks and Wilson confirmed that they had tested positive for Covid-19, and were currently in a hospital on the Gold Coast. Hanks had been in Queensland filming for an as yet untitled project about Elvis Presley, directed by Baz Luhrmann. \u201cTom has been having a wonderful time on the Gold Coast and we are so lucky to have Tom in Queensland,\u201d Palaszczuk said on Thursday. 9 March \u2013 Sydney harbour Three days earlier, the couple shared multiple shots of a cruise they took on Sydney harbour. Despite the pair posting photos with fans, Palaszczuk said that only people with \u201cover 15 minutes of being in very close contact\u201d were at risk, and \u201ca selfie wouldn\u2019t count as that\u201d. 9 March \u2013 Channel Nine\u2019s Today Extra studio Wilson also appeared on Channel Nine\u2019s Today Extra show, as seen in this photo posted by hosts David Campbell and Belinda Russell. 8 March \u2013 Bondi Beach Hanks was at Sydney\u2019s Bondi Beach on 8 March. 7 March \u2013 Sydney Opera House Wilson performed at the iconic venue on the night of 7 March. The Opera House confirmed that Wilson performed in the Utzon Room, a performance attended by approximately 207 people, including Hanks. \u201cFollowing news that the couple have tested positive for coronavirus in Queensland, the Opera House is in touch with NSW Health and Queensland Health and will be acting on their advice,\u201d a spokeswoman said. 6 March \u2013 North Bondi RSL Hanks and Wilson walked along the beach and then had a drink at the North Bondi RSL, according to footage captured by photographers. 5 March \u2013 The Emporium Hotel, Brisbane Two days earlier, Wilson had also performed in Brisbane\u2019s South Bank. 29 February \u2013 Gold Coast, Queensland A week earlier, Hanks was spotted by fans while on a Gold Coast beach. 28 February \u2013 Wilson in Los Angeles, US It\u2019s as yet unknown when Hanks and Wilson entered Australia, but it is clear the Wilson was in Los Angeles as of 28 February \u2013 at a charity event for breast cancer research. 24 February \u2013 Hanks in LA Similarly, Hanks and Wilson were in Los Angeles on 24 February. 11 February \u2013 Hanks and Wilson at Oscars Hanks and Wilson attended the Oscars awards ceremony in LA, where Hanks was nominated for best supporting actor for A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. However, it is unlikely he had contracted the virus at this point, a month before his diagnosis. 5 February \u2013 Hanks eats 50c wings at Gold Coast restaurant However, it is clear that Hanks was also in Australia prior to his attendance at the Oscars, with Brisbane\u2019s Courier Mail reporting that he shared a meal of 50c chicken wings on the Gold Coast with some fans. Again, it is unlikely the Oscar-winning actor had contracted Covid-19 at this point. 2 February \u2013 Mt Warning in NSW Similarly, the actor posed for this photograph at a restaurant in NSW as early as 2 February.",

Rita and I are down here in Australia. We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too. To play things right, as is needed in the world right now,  we were tested for the Coronavirus, and were found to be positive. Well, now. What to do next? The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks\u2019 will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires.  Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no? We\u2019ll keep the world posted and updated. Take care of yourselves!

Do your concerns around the ineffectiveness of lower interest rates bear much on the size of the stimulus that you\u2019re announcing today?</p> <p><strong>Josh Frydenberg: </strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, I think one important aspect of all of this is the alignment between monetary and fiscal policy. </p> <p>That\u2019s really important because, as the prime minister said, this is a $17.6 billion package, the bulk of which is going out the door before June 30, and we did welcome the fact that the interest rates were passed on by the banks. </p> <p>I\u2019ve spoken to <strong>Phil Lowe</strong> actually today. And he continues to watch very closely what\u2019s happening with debt yields, what\u2019s happening with bond yields, what\u2019s happening with credit spreads, what\u2019s happening with liquidity in global markets. </p> <p>He\u2019s made some comments about that and obviously monetary policy is the remit of the independent Reserve Bank of Australia. </p> <p>But I think it\u2019s important to understand that this is very different to the GFC in a number of respects. </p> <p>This is not a financial system problem. This is not a liquidity crisis. This is a health crisis. But one of the other differences is that with the GFC, there was a lot more room with monetary policy to respond. </p> <p><strong>This time, monetary policy globally is pretty much exhausted</strong> and we did see the Bank of England substantially reduce their rates down to, I think, 0.25% overnight. So it\u2019s a different situation, but there is an alignment between this government and the Reserve Bank about getting money out the door to support jobs and growth.</p> </blockquote> <p>That is an acknowledgement that the economy is in worse shape, globally, then when the GFC hit.

      "bodyText": "And with that, we\u2019ll be wrapping up the blog for the day. Thanks to Amy Remeikis and Paul Karp for their work earlier. The global coronavirus coverage continues on our international liveblog here: Thanks for reading. He adds that there is a special $1bn fund for places like north Queensland to help tourism recover. \u201cI know many Australians are anxious about this, and we still have a long way to go. But be assured we are taking action,\u201d, he said. And that concludes his address. A short message of calm, and a reiteration of the details of today\u2019s economic stimulus package, but no major announcements otherwise. The PM also said that there were three key aims of Australia\u2019s coronavirus response. \u201cI want to reassure your family tonight that while Australia is not immune to this virus, we are well-prepared. And we are well-equipped to deal with it. \u201cOur plan has three goals. One, to protect Australians\u2019 health. Two, secure Australians\u2019 jobs and livelihoods. And three, set Australia up to bounce back stronger when the crisis is over.\u201d Morrison is talking about the economic stimulus package announced today. To recap, that is a $17.6bn package, including cash handouts of $750 to 6.5 million people on low incomes, cash payments for businesses, wage subsidies for apprentices and a lifting of the threshold of the instant asset write-off. He says the package will help Australia\u2019s economy \u201cbounce back\u201d after the virus. Morrison has begun his address to the nation. He says 140 people in Australia have contracted the virus. He says the majority of symptoms are mild but \u201cfor those Australians whose health is more vulnerable, especially the elderly, the risks are more severe. \u201cThere are very real and significant economic impacts. For all of these reasons we have been taking the coronavirus very seriously.\u201d Scott Morrison\u2019s press conference was announced earlier on Thursday morning \u2013 the last time a PM did a similar prime time address to the nation was during the global financial crisis in 2008. Welcome back to our politics live blog special edition. I\u2019m Naaman Zhou and I will be your blog host for this evening as the prime minister, Scott Morrison, addresses the nation on the coronavirus outbreak. Where to leave it as we conclude for the evening? Well, I think the first thing people will want to know is whether they are getting any money from the stimulus package \u2013 so start with this handy explainer. I didn\u2019t get anything. Did you? Well, if you have your job and have your health, maybe that should be enough. Oh, and a large palette of toilet paper. Only one. These are the necessities in tough times. Thanks to Amy Remeikis for blogging through the blizzard of announcements and my colleagues Sarah Martin and Katharine Murphy for carrying the news and commentary. If dear readers haven\u2019t got their politics fix for today, Scott Morrison is due to make a televised address to the nation at 7pm. It\u2019s the Australian equivalent of one of those Oval Office set-pieces. They don\u2019t happen very often, so get excited. We\u2019re also recording a politics live podcast on the first stretch of the political year but you\u2019ll have to wait a little longer for that. Until next time! Let\u2019s take a moment to assess the sum of known parts for today: The Morrison government announced a $17.6bn coronavirus stimulus package including $750 payments to low-income earners and welfare recipients and $8.7bn of measures for businesses Experts welcomed the package but suggested further cash payments may be needed further down the line Labor has indicated it will support the package, to help it reach workers and the economy as soon as possible Australian unions are not pleased casuals will not get paid leave but will have to apply for the existing sickness allowance, which has had one week trimmed from the wait period Donald Trump announced a suspension of travel to the US from Europe The Australian government has asked its panel of medical experts whether Australia should follow the US lead and ban travel from Europe The existing travel ban on China, South Korea, Iran and Italy was extended by a further week Further cases of coronavirus were confirmed in Victoria, and the first for the Australian Capital Territory Australian authorities are still not advising people to self-isolate unless they have come into contact with people with coronavirus The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, has been asked on ABC TV about the US decision to impose a travel ban on people coming from mainland Europe. Cormann compares the decision to escalating trade tensions between China and the US in 2019, because the Australian government \u201cmade the point then that decreased global growth will impact Australia\u201d. Similarly, the travel ban \u201cwill have consequences in terms of our domestic economic outlook\u201d and the Australian government will \u201ccontinue to respond\u201d when facts change in an evolving situation. Asked if Australia should follow Donald Trump\u2019s lead, Cormann replies \u201cthat is not the advice we have in front of us\u201d (that travel from Europe should be banned). He also notes \u201cwe don\u2019t have direct flights between Australia and the Schengen area of mainland Europe\u201d. Labor\u2019s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has told ABC TV Labor will be \u201cas supportive as possible\u201d of the stimulus package and help ensure it reaches the economy as soon as possible. He said it \u201cremains to be seen whether it is enough and whether it will be deployed fast enough\u201d. Chalmers said it\u2019s not Labor\u2019s job to \u201cquibble with what\u2019s out there \u2013 we\u2019ve been supportive of what\u2019s been proposed\u201d. But Chalmers does quibble: \u201cIt\u2019s self-evident most Australians won\u2019t be receiving support in this package today\u201d \u201cThere is a role for cash payments\u201d \u2013 and the Coalition is wrong to play down the extent to which they helped avert a recession after the global financial crisis There are issues with casual workers that don\u2019t have access to sick leave \u2013 Labor is worried compensating them through the sickness allowance \u201cwill be a deterrent\u201d because people will have to \u201cget into the Newstart system\u201d to receive the payment; Chalmers also noted there is no guarantee that small and medium businesses will spend their $25,000 grants on maintaining their workforce Chalmers said the government has to be held accountable for saying the budget is \u201cback in the black and the economy is back on track \u2013 neither of which turned out to be true\u201d but the \u201chighest priority\u201d is to help workers and the economy. Anthony Albanese is in Mackay speaking about a McKell Institute report on casualisation in the mining industry. He has also responded to the government stimulus package. Albanese: What we have is a government defined by its complacency: whether it\u2019s last year in terms of \u2013 the economy was very flat, we had three interest rate decreases, monetary policy was doing all the heavy lifting, the Reserve Bank said there was a need for fiscal policy to do some assistance, we had consumer demand down, productivity growth going backwards, wages that are stagnant. What we needed at that time was greater government concern. Then the bushfires came along, they were complacent there \u2013 they said \u2018we\u2019ve seen fires before, it\u2019s a states issues, no need to act\u2019. Now on coronavirus we\u2019ve seen, after just days ago they said that cash payments were inappropriate and should never occur \u2026 today we have an announcement of cash payments to pensioners and people who are Newstart recipients. That\u2019s a good thing. We need to stimulate the economy and it needs to be done right now. Asked whether sickness allowance will be insufficient to stop people going to work, Albanese replied \u201cI haven\u2019t said that\u201d. That is, however, the ACTU and the Greens\u2019 position, so it will be interesting to see if Labor steps up its attack in coming days. With less than half an hour of trade left to go on the Australian market, it looks likely to finish the day down between 5% and 6%. But it\u2019s hard to be sure because the market is extremely volatile today. It was about 2% down in early trade before sliding a percentage point as Australian prime minister Scott Morrison and treasurer Josh Frydenberg announced details of a $17.6bn stimulus package. President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement that most travel from Europe to the US would be banned sent the market into panic selling mode, with the benchmark ASX200 index diving to be as much as 7% down for the day. It has recovered slightly since then. At about 3.45pm it was down 5.4%. On Thursday the national security committee of cabinet met and decided to extend the existing ban on travel from China, Iran, South Korea and Italy by one week. Under the rules of the travel ban: Foreign nationals are not allowed to enter Australia for 14 days from the time they left the affected country; Australian citizens and permanent residents are able to enter Australia but are required to self-isolate at home for 14 days from the day they left the affected country. Australia is still reviewing whether to extend a travel ban to Europe. AAP reports that the Australian Capital Territory has its first confirmed case of coronavirus: The man aged in his 30s was tested for Covid-19 at the Weston Creek Walk-in Centre clinic on Wednesday, with the positive result confirmed on Thursday. He\u2019s being treated at Canberra hospital and precautions are being taken to ensure the safety of staff and the broader community. ACT chief minister Andrew Barr says more cases are expected in coming weeks. \u201cThis, however, is not cause for alarm,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re asking Canberrans to work with us to minimise the spread of the virus.\u201d ACT chief medical officer Kerryn Coleman said the man had been overseas but outside the 14-day window. However, he has been interstate. \u201cWe need to spend a little bit of time looking at this person\u2019s movements in the 14 days prior to when he first became unwell to see whether we can identify any linkages with any other cases,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cI think it\u2019s most likely he has been in contact with someone domestically.\u201d The man first felt unwell on Tuesday with a fever and fatigue. Every state and territory now has at least one case of the coronavirus, which has been declared a global pandemic. Another noteworthy aspect of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry\u2019s response to the stimulus package is the prediction that the worst is yet to come as far as the impact on tourism is concerned. ACCI\u2019s chief executive, James Pearson, said $1bn of assistance to tourism-dependent areas is welcome but: These regions have already seen falls of 40% or more in their normal revenue, yet most of the nationwide economic impact from Covid-19 is still ahead of us. Without assistance, businesses in these regions will find it impossible to survive and are likely to cut jobs. In addition to travel, cancellation of major events, exhibitions and even smaller conferences and meetings will hit tourism and event businesses very hard. Businesses such as travel agents are also already feeling the pain and hopefully the cash injections will help, although the extent of their revenue loss will be too great for some. More may be needed if this crisis continues. Jenny Mikakos says Victoria now has 27 cases of Covid-19, with six new cases confirmed overnight. Five of the six have international travel histories, and the sixth was known to the others. Hunt says that so far the expert body of chief medical officers has not changed its advice on mass gatherings. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to listen to their advice, but at the same time we\u2019re planning for all contingencies,\u201d he says. Asked about the Formula One event in Melbourne, Mikakos reiterates that the advice at this stage is there is no need to cancel major events. She concedes \u201cextreme social distancing\u201d may be required when \u201csignificant community transmission\u201d occurs from unknown sources but \u201cwe have not reached that point yet\u201d. There is no update on the Formula One team members tested for Covid-19. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, is opening the National Drug Discovery Centre with Victorian health minister, Jenny Mikakos and providing an update on coronavirus. There are 118 countries with confirmed cases, a total of 125,000 globally with 4,600 lives lost. In Australia there are 128 cases \u201cconfirmed and reported\u201d, Hunt said. Hunt said Scott Morrison and the national security committee have met and decided to refer the question of travel from Europe to the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (composed of chief medical officers). So the Australian government is seeking expert advice on whether to follow Donald Trump\u2019s lead and put a travel ban on Europe. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, like other employer groups, is pleased with the stimulus package. ACCI chief executive, James Pearson, said: Small businesses across the country will bear the brunt of restrictions on the movement of people and an economic downturn. These businesses have endured challenging trading conditions for a long time due to sluggish growth in consumer spending and difficulties in accessing finance, which makes them extremely vulnerable to further deterioration in the economy. The changes to the instant asset write-off put more money in a small business owner\u2019s pocket today, representing a discount at the time of purchase of up to 30 per cent on the purchase of plant and equipment by a business in the current year ... The supply and demand shocks resulting from COVID-19 require immediate support for both business cash flows and consumer demand. More than ever, cash flow is king.\u201d Pearson called for grants of up to $25,000 for small and medium businesses \u201cto be delivered through the tax system, so as to minimise paperwork and red-tape for businesses to access the grants\u201d. ACCI also supports one-off direct payment of $750 to social security recipients, veterans and other income support recipients, because it will have a knock-on effect in the under-pressure retail sector. \u201cThis payment is targeted at those on low disposable incomes that are the most likely to spend any increase in income immediately. It will give them the confidence to spend rather than save their money,\u201d Pearson said. The fiscal stimulus announced today means the government and the Reserve Bank of Australia are pulling in the same direction, as RBA deputy governor Guy Debelle noted yesterday. But economic analysts such as Capital Economics still expect the RBA to cut the cash rate again to 0.25%. In an analysis of the measures, Capital Economics said: The stimulus package was larger than we had anticipated and includes total measures of $17.6bn The instant asset write-off \u201csweetener\u201d will only last until June this year, \u201cproviding a strong incentive for firms to invest in machinery and equipment in Q2\u201d The fiscal stimulus may prevent a recession by boosting business investment in the second quarter We doubt the RBA will wait until the effects of that stimulus becomes visible and we reiterate our forecast of another o.25% cut at the April meeting. The Business Council of Australia has responded positively to the stimulus package, which it has labelled \u201ctargeted and well thought through\u201d. The BCA chief executive, Jennifer Westacott, said: The fact that three in every four dollars of the package is directed to business recognises that it is business that will keep people working. Businesses need to bring forward their investments, particularly fast-track investments that generate economic activity and jobs, especially in regional areas. We have called for a focus on investment for some time and we welcome the government\u2019s response to that. We particularly commend the instant asset write off and accelerated depreciation initiatives which will encourage investment and allow small and medium-sized businesses to grow. We strongly support the direct assistance to business to allow them to keep people working. Moving to protect apprentices is also a positive move. We must keep apprentices working so we have the skills to run the economy post this crisis.\u201d Westacott suggested the budget in two months \u201cwill give us a chance to do the heavy lifting of making sure the recovery is permanent and the economy bounces back stronger than before, particularly given growth was below average before this series of crises\u201d. That\u2019s interesting \u2013 it picks up on a point the shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has made for a while: economic weakness predates coronavirus. It tends to suggest from the BCA\u2019s perspective, today\u2019s stimulus is the first response not the end of the story. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has had a fair bit to say about the government\u2019s decision to waive the one-week waiting period for sickness allowance instead of pushing for employers to grant casuals paid sick leave. ACTU secretary Sally McManus said: In order for our country to slow down the spread of the virus and to stop infecting at-risk people, workers will need to make decisions to self-isolate. We must remove the financial penalty for people to make this decision. Newstart payments are far less than what nearly all casual workers are currently paid, so the financial penalty remains. This announcement by the prime minister falls far short of what is required. Public health concerns must be put first, this response fails to do so ... We\u2019ve seen the Morrison government go from ignoring casual and contract workers to suggesting they should have been putting aside money just in case there was a pandemic to now putting them on poverty-level welfare payments. But on the plus side, Woolworths, Telstra, catholic schools in Wollongong, Macquarie University and Southern Cross University have decided to support casual workers with paid leave. We\u2019ll see which other employers join the bandwagon. Jim Chalmers and Anthony Albanese will give their \u201cconsidered\u201d position on the stimulus tomorrow from Brisbane at 9.30 (daylight saving time). Acoss has also responded: In response to the $750 one-off payments for people receiving payments including Newstart, Youth Allowance, Austudy, Disability Support Pension, Carers Payment, Family Tax Benefits, Commonwealth Senior Health Card Holders and the Age Pension, from March 31, 2020, with one payment per eligible person, Acoss CEO Cassandra Goldie said: \u2018People are doing it really tough, especially people on Newstart and Youth Allowance \u2013 the lowest payments \u2013 and pensioners who don\u2019t own their home. The payment will be welcome short-term relief but it\u2019s nowhere near enough. Leading economists urged the government to increase Newstart ongoing to build consumer confidence and to guarantee that the payment would be spent into the real economy. \u2018We know that increasing Newstart by $95 per week ongoing would inject $4 billion into the economy a year and generate more than 12,000 jobs, helping to deliver the ongoing confidence business is crying out for. \u2018We\u2019re calling on the government to urgently increase Newstart by $95 per week ongoing by the federal budget to help lift people out of poverty and prevent those facing job losses from falling into the poverty trap, while rebuilding the economy. Jim Chalmers has said Labor supports some of the measures, and will look at the package. The $750 payment is one of those measures they support. But they think the government needs to go further. Now, there is still the possibility that the parliament meeting scheduled at the end of this month could be cancelled if the coronavirus pandemic reaches the critical levels. If that happens, and the government needs to legislate it, there could potentially be a measure where, with bipartisan support, the parliament could do it administratively. But we haven\u2019t reached that bridge yet. All agencies are getting the social media \u201cgo\u201d treatment The Council on the Ageing has also welcomed the stimulus response: The $750 payment will help all pensioners with buying essentials that many aged pensioners are missing out on, and the cut in the deeming rate will help those affected cope better with low interest rates. Under the new deeming rate arrangements age pension recipients whose cash assets are assessed through deemed interest income could see up to $62 extra a fortnight for couples and up to $50 a fortnight for singles. Not sure if this will calm the ASX \u2013 but Donald Trump is clarifying his speech to take out the reference to what amounted to a trade war with Europe The housing industry has given the stimulus package a thumbs up: The Federal Government\u2019s stimulus package is a welcome step to rebuilding consumer confidence and business continuity during the coronavirus, according to the Urban Development Institute of Australia (UDIA). UDIA National \u2013 the nation\u2019s peak organisation for the urban development industry \u2013 said the stimulus should help maintain cash flow, jobs and business activity across the economy. It also urged Government to reserve the capacity to introduce a second round of stimulatory measures if the economic effects become worse. Wayne Swan has gone on an absolute re-tweeting spree. This is the gist of it The ATO has responded to the stimulus package: We understand this is a time of significant uncertainty and that we will need to be flexible in how we help businesses. Options available to assist businesses impacted by Covid-19 include: Deferring by up to four months the payment date of amounts due through the business activity statement (including PAYG instalments), income tax assessments, fringe benefits tax assessments and excise Allow businesses on a quarterly reporting cycle to opt into monthly GST reporting in order to get quicker access to GST refunds they may be entitled to Allowing businesses to vary Pay As You Go (PAYG) instalment amounts to zero for the April 2020 quarter. Businesses that vary their PAYG instalment to zero can also claim a refund for any instalments made for the September 2019 and December 2019 quarters Remitting any interest and penalties, incurred on or after 23 January 2020, that have been applied to tax liabilities Working with affected businesses to help them pay their existing and ongoing tax liabilities by allowing them to enter into low interest payment plans. Employers will still need to meet their ongoing super guarantee obligations for their employees. After the Trump announcement, the Australian stock market was down 4.8%. It was down 3% after the stimulus announcement. And the big concern from Senator Siewert is: Casual workers under 22 appear to be ineligible for the \u2018sickness allowance\u2019 the government says is an alternative to sick leave. The government must consider delaying the rollout of new Jobseeker payment, which will see the sickness allowance phased out and those who are sick put on a jobseeker payment and have to apply for an exemption from activity tests. Centrelink\u2019s workload will increase with the Covid-19 response rollout and the stimulus package and I am very worried about people falling through the cracks and not getting timely assistance and support from Centrelink. Centrelink is not fit for purpose and continued staff cuts, lack of appropriate investment and management of the robodebt debacle means that Centrelink is under strain with its current caseload, let alone the added load we are going to start seeing. Greens senator Rachel Siewert has put out her own statement response to the stimulus package: This is an insult to all those people condemned to living below the poverty on Newstart and Youth Allowance,\u201d Senator Rachel Siewert said. Any additional payment to those living in poverty will get spent but this is simply not enough. Newstart and Youth Allowance needs to be increased immediately. The Greens have made a further announcement on what Paul Karp reported a little earlier, about extending the stimulus package for those with unsecured work: The stimulus package outlined by the prime minister this morning falls far short of what the experts say is needed to weather the economic storm caused by the coronavirus pandemic and does little to stem the crisis facing people on Newstart and Youth Allowance as well as the 3.5 million casual workers in Australia, said leader of the Australian Greens Adam Bandt, MP. The Greens will move to expand the package when it reaches the Senate to lift Newstart and Youth Allowance as well as provide 14 days\u2019 paid coronavirus sick leave to all workers, including casual workers. Australian politicians are making the joke you\u2019ve already made: The social media campaign has begun The Greens had decided this prior to Scott Morrison\u2019s stimulus announcement (from Paul Karp): On Wednesday the Greens federal party room decided that when parliament returns it will introduce a private member\u2019s bill to provide 14 days of paid sick leave for all workers, including casual employees, if they are unable to work due to Covid-19. That would include workers diagnosed with the virus, those required to self-isolate, people who are unable to attend their workplace as it has been shut down due to Covid-19, and those caring for another person. Meanwhile, Tom Hanks has announced he and his wife have received positive coronavirus tests, while visiting Australia. He has been shooting a movie on the Gold Coast. The Australia Institute\u2019s senior economist, Matt Grudnoff, says the stimulus announcement is the right size \u201cbut the shape is wrong\u201d. The prime minister asserted $3 in every $4 dollars of stimulus would go to business \u2013 it should be the other way round. Commonsense and recent history tells us that businesses don\u2019t spend when their sales are falling. The best way to help Australian businesses right now is to get cash through the cash registers. Businesses with plenty of customers don\u2019t lay off staff. The most effective part of the package is the $750 to welfare recipients. We know people living on the brink spend any extra money they receive on essentials, and this will support demand in the economy. Scott Morrison encouraged people to keep living their life \u2013 which means heading to events, unless you are in a vulnerable group: Well, it\u2019s very simple. You follow the health advice. I\u2019m going to footy this weekend. I\u2019m looking forward to it. And I\u2019m sure many Australians would, and I encourage you unless you\u2019re ill, and unless there\u2019s a reason \u2013 if you\u2019re in self-isolation for medical reasons or you\u2019re actually ill \u2013 that I wouldn\u2019t suggest you go. But the health advice is not for that to happen at this point. On Melbourne\u2019s Grand Prix: Well, the organisers should take the health advice, both from state health officers, and that is available, and certainly at a commonwealth level, then Dr Murphy has been providing advice on those issues. And there have been no suggestions from those body of health advisors for that to occur at this point. Now, we can\u2019t know the future. And if at some point in the future, the health advice would have changed, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll give that advice. But right now, I would continue to say: I think there\u2019s 120-odd people who have contracted the coronavirus in Australia, about a fifth of those have already cleared the virus. Almost half close to clearing the virus, those numbers are a low compared to what we\u2019re seeing in other countries. But that\u2019s not to say it will stay that way. But as Dr Murphy has said on numerous occasions, for most Australians who might contract coronavirus, then they are likely to have a mild effect from that virus. Those who are more at risk, of course, the elderly, particularly those who are in aged care facilities, and potentially those in remote Indigenous communities. And that\u2019s why we put in place the health measures that I announced yesterday ... it\u2019s helpful not to speculate until things are known. And at this point, the health advice is not advising that, but obviously down the track, depending on how events unfold, then that advice might, you know, prove to the event organisers having different plans. Donald Trump echoes Scott Morrison: \u201cThis is not a financial crisis, this is a temporarily moment in time,\u201d he says. Donald Trump is addressing his nation \u2013 he is suspending all travel from Europe to the US for at least a month. That is going to have a pretty big hit on the economy. Australia won\u2019t be immune to these changes either. Right, so to answer some questions about the payments I can see popping up \u2013 with the caveat that this is what I know at this time: The sickness allowance will roll into the JobSeeker payment. So if you needed it after 20 March, you would apply for the JobSeeker payment. There will be no waiting period BEFORE you apply, but there will be at least a five day wait AFTER you apply, as the payment is processed. It IS means-tested. So if you have money in the bank, you most likely won\u2019t be eligible. It is the same amount as Newstart. That means singles \u2013 $559.00; singles with kids/over 60s \u2013 604.70, partnered $504.70. The $750 allowance is PER person, but not per PAYMENT*. So if you are eligible for multiple payments, you still only get the $750 once. But if you and your partner are eligible for payments, you should each receive it It appears to be open to anyone who receives a government payment currently \u2013 which includes the family tax benefit. Those payments will start following from 31 March and should just turn up in your bank account if you are eligible. *This previously said per household, but that advice has been clarified The stock market has given the thumbs down to the Morrison government\u2019s stimulus package. Shares, which were already down about 2% when Australian prime minister Scott Morrison and treasurer Josh Frydenberg began talking at around 10.35am, fell as the politicians spoke. Within 10.50am the benchmark ASX200 was down 3%. After some choppy trade, it was off by 2.9% at 11.30am. The package relies heavily on money for business, which gets around three quarters of the stimulus, and while there is cash for people on benefits, the amount is less than that handed out by the Rudd government during the global financial crisis and there is nothing for workers without families. Anthony Albanese gives his first response to the government stimulus package: Once again, because social media is taking off on this. The sickness allowance is one of the payments being ROLLED INTO the newly named \u201cJobSeeker\u201d payment after 20 March. So the NAME sickness allowance will cease to exist, but the payment won\u2019t. Yes, there are problems with the five day processing and things, and the means testing will mean people will miss out. But let\u2019s not scare people unnecessarily. Check where you are getting your information from. And as the prime minister finishes his press conference, the last territory without coronavirus, falls So that gives you a flavour of what the address to the nation will look like at 7pm tonight. Asked if whether he was \u201ccounting your chickens before they hatched\u201d by declaring the budget was \u201cback in black\u201d, Scott Morrison gets the most defensive he has been this press conference. Which of you understood the coronavirus was going to occur when we handed down the budget last year? A quick show of hands. Of course no-one did. Asked how Labor could have predicted the global financial crisis in that case, Morrison says: Let\u2019s be clear about what happened with Labor\u2019s four surpluses announced \u2026 that was in 2012, the GFC had passed. Labor promised four surpluses based on an iron ore price of US$180 a tonne forever! They didn\u2019t achieve a surplus because their forecasting and their estimates and the construction of their budget was flawed. What is occurring here, is the government has made a clear choice, having brought the budget back to balance, which was demonstrated in the mid-year statement, and the mid-year statement showed, even with more conservative forecasts, that we were on track, we were right on track, and the coronavirus has had the obvious impact and it has required the decision the government has taken to put in place their significant economic stimulus. I believe Australians believe with those priorities. We will always do what is right for the Australian economy, what is always right for the Australian people, their health, their wellbeing, their livelihood, and to ensure that whatever we face as a country we will always bounce back stronger. Thank you all very much. Asked if Centrelink would be able to handle the loan, Scott Morrison says while the government is waiving the waiting period (currently set at least a week) there is the \u201cnormal processing time\u201d, which Anne Ruston has told him is \u201cabout five days\u201d. \u201cWhat I am saying is it about a five-day period for processing, you put your application in and it takes about five days. Now previously there was a waiting period you would have to wait out and then make that application. We will be waiving that waiting period, and that will be provided for Newstart as well. \u201c... This is a good element about our system, there are many other countries in the world who don\u2019t have this and I can understand the concern that casual employees would have had. I am encouraged by the lead of the early response by large businesses and I would hope that other large businesses would follow the lead of Telstra, and I expect that they would from some of the messages that I have. \u201cThe government will be doing its bit by supporting that program and waiving the waiting periods to provide that support at the Newstart rate.\u201d Scott Morrison asks for a show of hands from the media of who saw the coronavirus happen and says that is one of the reasons it can\u2019t be embarrassed it called the budget \u201cback in black\u201d when clearly it is not (and hasn\u2019t been). And yet, Christian Porter seemed to suggest that casuals should have been prepared for an unexpected two weeks off, because they receive a higher hourly wage in exchange for giving up entitlements such as sickness leave, when asked on Monday, but it is amazing how quickly things can change. For anyone who may need the currently named sickness allowance, you will find the DSS information here The Australian food and grocery council (who knew such a thing existed?!) is quick off the mark to say thank-you to the government for the stimulus package: Our sector plays an integral role in Australia\u2019s economic and social fabric, with an annual turnover of $122.1 billion,\u201d said AFGC Acting CEO, Dr Geoffrey Annison in a statement \u2018The sector employs more than 273,300 Australians, representing almost 40 per cent of total manufacturing employment, and it is also the lifeblood of many regional and rural communities, where 39.3 per cent of these jobs are based. There will be no changes to the sickness allowance (which will roll into the JobSeeker payment on March 20) asset test. The only thing that will change is the waiting period. There have been issues with it in the past: For context, the office of Greens senator Rachel Siewert tells me that as of September 2019 4,966 people were on sickness allowance. The package is worth $18bn in this financial year and $22bn over the 15 months it will run The instant asset threshold is increased from $30,000 to $150,000 The Boosting Cash Flow for Employers measure will provide up to $25,000 back to small and medium-sized businesses, with a minimum payment of $2,000 for eligible businesses. Eligible employers can apply for a wage subsidy of 50 per cent of the apprentice\u2019s or trainee\u2019s wage for up to 9 months, from 1 January 2020 to 30 September 2020 Households which receive a government payment will receive $750 from March 31 $1bn \u201cCoronavirus fund\u201d 4. Assistance for severely affected regions This measure provides $1 billion to support regions most significantly affected by the Coronavirus outbreak. Support for coronavirus-affected regions and communities The government has set aside $1 billion to support those regions and communities that have been disproportionately affected by the economic impacts of the coronavirus, including those heavily reliant on industries such as tourism, agriculture and education. This will include the waiver of fees and charges for tourism businesses that operate in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the waiver of entry fees for commonwealth national parks. It will also include additional assistance to help businesses identify alternative export markets or supply chains. Targeted measures will also be developed to further promote domestic tourism. The Australian Tax Office (ATO) is also providing administrative relief for some tax obligations for people affected by the coronavirus outbreak, on a case-by-case basis. The ATO will set up a temporary shopfront in Cairns within the next few weeks with dedicated staff specialising in assisting small business. In addition, it will consider ways to enhance its presence in other significantly affected regions, making it easier for people to apply for relief. The ATO is considering further temporary shopfronts and face-to-face options. 3. Stimulus payments to households to support growth This measure will assist around 6.5 million lower income Australians, which will support confidence and domestic demand in the economy. The government will provide a one-off $750 payment to social security, veteran and other income support recipients and eligible concession card holders. Around half of those that will benefit are pensioners. There will be one payment per eligible recipient. For example, if a person qualifies for the one-off payment in multiple ways, they will only receive one payment. The payment will be tax free and will not count as income for Social Security, Farm Household Allowance and veteran payments. 2. Cash flow assistance for businesses This assistance will support businesses to manage cash flow challenges resulting from the economic impacts of the coronavirus and help businesses retain their employees. These two measures are designed to support employing small and medium enterprises and to improve business confidence. The Boosting Cash Flow for Employers measure will provide up to $25,000 back to small and medium-sized businesses, with a minimum payment of $2,000 for eligible businesses. The payment will provide cash flow support to businesses with a turnover of less than $50 million that employ staff. The payment will be tax free. This measure will benefit around 690,000 businesses employing around 7.8 million people. Supporting apprentices and trainees The government is supporting small business to retain their apprentices and trainees. Eligible employers can apply for a wage subsidy of 50 per cent of the apprentice\u2019s or trainee\u2019s wage for up to 9 months from 1 January 2020 to 30 September 2020. Where a small business is not able to retain an apprentice, the subsidy will be available to a new employer that employs that apprentice. This measure will support up to 70,000 small businesses, employing around 117,000 apprentices. 1. Business investment Delivering support for business investment the government is backing businesses to invest to help the economy withstand and recover from the economic impact of the coronavirus. The two business investment measures in this package are designed to assist Australian businesses and economic growth in the short term, and encourage a stronger economic recovery following the coronavirus outbreak. From today, the government is increasing the instant asset write-off threshold from $30,000 to $150,000 and expanding access to include businesses with aggregated annual turnover of less than $500 million (up from $50 million) until 30 June 2020. In 2017-18 there were more than 360,000 businesses that benefited from the current instant asset write-off, claiming deductions to the value of over $4 billion. The government is introducing a time-limited 15-month investment incentive (through to 30 June 2021) to support business investment and economic growth over the short term, by accelerating depreciation deductions. Businesses with a turnover of less than $500 million will be able to deduct 50 per cent of the cost of an eligible asset on installation, with existing depreciation rules applying to the balance of the asset\u2019s cost. These two measures will support over 3.5 million businesses (over 99 per cent of businesses) employing more than 9.7 million employees. And here is when it all starts flowing \u2013 remembering at this stage it is a 15 month program Treasury is prepared with the six step plan. Scott Morrison says the business package is aimed at businesses who employ workers, so not the sole traders. Question: Will this starve off a recession? Is that the job? Scott Morrison: The job is what I outlined when I stood here with the Treasurer just 10 minutes ago. And that is to ensure that we keep Australians in jobs, that we keep businesses in business, and that we ensure the Australian economy is in a position to bounce back strongly on the other side. That is the task. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve designed this package to do. If more is required, more will be done and we\u2019ll watch that closely, like you do with any plan, and you get the best information and you continue to make good decisions. I think we\u2019ve made some very good decisions here and this boost, as I said, 1.2% of GDP, particularly in the initial phase, and even stronger than that, actually, this year, as you look at - it was $11 billion going out the door effectively by 30 June - that\u2019s when it\u2019s needed. This is very front-end-loaded. Question: Treasurer, the Reserve Bank governor had an urgent meeting with central bankers from around the world into the early hours of this morning. Do your concerns around the ineffectiveness of lower interest rates bear much on the size of the stimulus that you\u2019re announcing today? Josh Frydenberg: Well, I think one important aspect of all of this is the alignment between monetary and fiscal policy. That\u2019s really important because, as the prime minister said, this is a $17.6 billion package, the bulk of which is going out the door before June 30, and we did welcome the fact that the interest rates were passed on by the banks. I\u2019ve spoken to Phil Lowe actually today. And he continues to watch very closely what\u2019s happening with debt yields, what\u2019s happening with bond yields, what\u2019s happening with credit spreads, what\u2019s happening with liquidity in global markets. He\u2019s made some comments about that and obviously monetary policy is the remit of the independent Reserve Bank of Australia. But I think it\u2019s important to understand that this is very different to the GFC in a number of respects. This is not a financial system problem. This is not a liquidity crisis. This is a health crisis. But one of the other differences is that with the GFC, there was a lot more room with monetary policy to respond. This time, monetary policy globally is pretty much exhausted and we did see the Bank of England substantially reduce their rates down to, I think, 0.25% overnight. So it\u2019s a different situation, but there is an alignment between this government and the Reserve Bank about getting money out the door to support jobs and growth. That is an acknowledgement that the economy is in worse shape, globally, then when the GFC hit. So the reserve banks have done all they can do this time around. It\u2019s pretty much up to governments now. Question: Prime Minister, can you explain a little more about how this fund for tourism and other businesses work? Scott Morrison: This fund is one that we\u2019ll have to work through with the states and territories. I\u2019m not saying that means it\u2019s a dollar-for-dollar fund. What I\u2019m saying is that there\u2019s a lot of work being done at the moment to identify those areas which are most critically impacted and, look, this is an unfolding story, day by day. We\u2019re obviously concerned about the impact in places like North Queensland, for example, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve made the decisions on things like the marine park fees and things like that nature. What we envisage is that the same type of assistance that you\u2019ve seen provided in the most affected bushfire areas - and there is a range of grants and other payments that have been paid into those environments - in those circumstances, then we would look at how those same types of grants and supports could be provided into designated areas that are more affected as a result of this coronavirus. Now, on top of that, as the Treasurer has said, there\u2019s things like domestic tourism promotion and things of that nature and so far, at least in relation to bushfires, we\u2019ve seen some positive results from that investment we did out of the national bushfire recovery fund. So it is applying a similar type of process that you would see in a disaster recovery arrangement being applied in specific areas that are particularly affected. That will make Queensland happy: Scott Morrison: The cash payments have two purposes. And they\u2019re both important. Of course, those who received them - that is obviously a benefit to them. But more importantly, frankly, it is about a cash injection into the Australian economy, which supports small businesses and supports medium businesses, so the cash payment works together with the cashflow support that we\u2019re putting into small businesses, and that, in turn, supports the jobs, which means people can continue to participate positively in the economy and have greater confidence going forward. Those household payments (for anyone who receives a government payment) will start flowing from 31 March. Josh Frydenberg: Yes. 6.5 million Australians will be getting a cheque for $750. Now it\u2019s not for us to tell those Australians how to spend their money but what we do know from experience is that they will spend that money and that money will encourage economic activity and the more economic activity that we see through the June quarter, in particular, will be important, because in the June quarter, just as we\u2019ve seen in the March quarter, the spread of the coronavirus has had an impact across the economy. It\u2019s disrupted end-to-end supply chains. It\u2019s obviously impacted on the tourism sector, on the international education sector, and more broadly. So raising the rate of say something like Newstart is GOOD for the economy? WHO KNEW The $17.6bn stimulus package revealed by the Australian government this morning has failed to stem losses on the stock exchange, with shares continuing to fall as prime minister Scott Morrison and treasurer Josh Frydenberg detailed the measures. A market that had fallen by 2% before Morrison began speaking at about 10.35am fell further to be off by almost 3% by 10.50am. Anne Ruston\u2019s office has released the information on the deeming rates: About 900,000 Australians will see an increase to their fortnightly social security payments following the Morrison government\u2019s decision to reduce deeming rates in response to changing economic conditions. Minister for Families and Social Services Anne Ruston said this was an important change for the 565,000 age pensioners and 323,000 other payment recipients with financial assets who were affected by deeming rates. \u2018The government is absolutely committed to ensuring the deeming rate is fair and is a reasonable reflection of the state of the market,\u2019 Minister Ruston said. \u2018The lower deeming rate will be cut from 1.0 per cent to 0.5 per cent for financial investments up to $51,800 for single pensioners and $86,200 for pensioner couples. \u2018The upper rate, which only impacts about 40 per cent of payment recipients with deemed assets, will decrease from 3.0 per cent to 2.5 per cent. \u2018Through this change and my July 2019 cut to deeming rates the government has boosted income support payments by more than $1.2 billion to ensure Australians with cash assets who rely on social security can maintain their quality of life.\u2019 Under the new rates payment recipients whose income is assessed using deeming could receive up to $62 a fortnight for couples, $1,612 extra a year, and up to $50 a fortnight for singles, $1,300 a year. On average, affected age pensioners would receive an additional $8.42 a fortnight, $219 a year. The extra money will start flowing through into people\u2019s bank accounts from 1 May. Question: How do you know people will spend this payment? Scott Morrison: I believe their common sense has demonstrated in the wake and in response to previous situations like this that it speaks for itself. The advice that we have on this has been proven by these experiences in the past. I think what\u2019s important is Australians go about their business \u2013 as Australians go about their business \u2013 is that they know, and they can see through what we\u2019ve announced today, that this is a comprehensive, a well-thought-through, a well-targeted plan, which is designed to support the Australian economy and jobs and businesses through the difficult months ahead. And in addition, the health plan that we\u2019ve announced, and the support we\u2019re providing to the states so people can go about their lives in response to the coronavirus, can give them that confidence. This is a very clear plan to see us through, and the plan is based on Australians also working together. We all have a role to play, whether it\u2019s the commonwealth government \u2013 I\u2019m looking forward to discussing these measures with the states tomorrow, and looking forward to their responses, as to what they would do in addition to this, with this information, they can now add to this with their own plans. But the health side of this is also critically important. The health plan, working together with the economic plan, I think, can give Australians the confidence they\u2019re seeking. Question: Prime Minister, the budget now is obviously back in the red. What\u2019s your promise on a surplus? When will Australia see one? Scott Morrison: (answering with \u201cwhy my stimulus, rather than the one I have spent a decade bagging Labor on) We\u2019ll update the budget when it\u2019s handed down in a couple of months\u2019 time. ... The budget will obviously be updated in May. And what we need to look carefully at over the next few years is how the broader global impacts will impact on the Australian economy out over the next three or four years. But importantly, these measures are designed to ensure that at the end of this next financial year, then there is actually a positive impact that comes from the bringing forward of expenditure on accelerated depreciation. We had positive impacts on the budget of 22-23 and $3.7 billion in 23-24. The way we\u2019ve designed this stimulus is to ensure that it doesn\u2019t have a fiscal hangover down the track, that it doesn\u2019t bury the budget for a decade. This is all designed to put the stimulus in now in a very efficient and effective way to deal with the problems that are here and now, and I\u2019ve got to say problems that we know to be the issue here in Australia. We\u2019re not looking to cut and paste from people\u2019s problems in other economies. This is based on our diagnosis of what is happening in the Australian economy, and the best way to deal with that. Question: Will this package be enough to save the nation? Scott Morrison: We have worked carefully, to make sure that we have got a proportionate response here to meet the challenge. Now, this is, as I said, 1.2% of GDP. To give you some comparison, when the initial stimulus was done for the GFC many years ago, those payments equated to some 0.88% of GDP in that package which was, as you know, supported by the Coalition, and that used similar measures - payments through the payment system. That was 0.88% of GDP. The difference with this package is - A - about $3 out of $4 of what\u2019s going into this is actually going into business cashflow, it\u2019s going into keeping people in work. It\u2019s going into ensuring that investment continues to be made in the economy, with purchasing of new equipment and the wheels of the economy turning. This is, I think, a key difference - is that we understand that, for the Australian economy to continue to move forward, businesses need to continue to go forward and do what they do each day, but that also requires the support of a demand stimulus as well, that is effectively and very efficiently delivered, and that\u2019s what the $4.6 billion payment is doing - sorry,$4.7 billion payment is doing. And it\u2019s going through to those people, which we know from past experience are most likely to churn that into the economy quite quickly. There will also be a \u2018coronavirus fund\u2019 established. Josh Frydenberg: A coronavirus fund is being established designed to target those areas and provide assistance that are most heavily by the spread of the virus. It initially will be a $1 billion fund. This will include the waiver of certain fees and charges for tourism businesses operating in Commonwealth National Parks, and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, increasing domestic tourism promotion, and additional assistance through Austrade to address supply chain breakdowns. Why those individuals? Because the government knows that they are the ones most likely to spend the money they receive, almost immediately. It is proven time and time again. It is one of the biggest reasons advocates have pushed the government to increase Newstart \u2013 because that money would flow straight back into the economy. Josh Frydenberg has a little bit more information on the welfare recipient payments: The Government will also deliver a one-off stimulus payment to households with 6.5 million Australians receiving a payment of $750. This includes recipients onNewstart, the disability support pension, carers\u2019 allowance, youth allowance, veterans support payments, family tax benefits, the Commonwealth senior health card-holders and 2.4 million aged pensioners. This one-off payment, which costs $4.8 billion, will flow automatically from 31 March and provide additional income to millions of Australians that will be spent across the economy. As expected though, business is the biggest beneficiary of the immediate measures. As Josh Frydenberg says: The package is worth $17.6 billion, $11 billion of which will go out the door before June 30. As the Prime Minister said, this is on top of the recent health package we announced of $2.4 billion in measures. Importantly, $3 out of every $4 spent will go to backing business and keeping Australians in a job. $3 out of $4 spent will go to backing business and keeping Australians in jobs. Scott Morrison: The Treasurer and I and the government want to be in the best possible position for our businesses, holding onto their employees, ensuring they\u2019re continuing to train up, ensuring that they\u2019re maintaining their investment plans because, on the other side, they\u2019re going to do well, and we\u2019re going to do everything we can to ensure they\u2019re best positioned to bounce back strongly on the other side The measures will expire on 30 June next year \u201cIt does have a finite life, there is another side to going through this issue and it will be stronger on the other side, and the global economy will recover on the other side,\u201d Morrison says. Scott Morrison announces the waiting period will be waived for what is currently called the \u2018sickness allowance\u2019 (On March 20, it becomes the JobSeeker payment) for casuals who have to self-isolate Here\u2019s something I prepared earlier (because honestly it made the most sense) Here we go: Households will receive a stimulus payment of $750 across the full gambit of those who receive all sorts of benefit payments. The biggest beneficiaries of that will be pensioners. They comprise around half of those who will receive those payments, but they also will be extended to those in family tax benefits, which obviously goes to those in earning households. And there will be a coronavirus regional and community fund. So if you currently receive a welfare payment, you will receive a payment. We\u2019ll bring you the details when we get them. Scott Morrison: This package over the course of the Budget and forward estimates will inject some $17.629 billion into the Australian economy in a series of measures which are designed to support cashflow, boost investment and provide immediate demand stimulus to the Australian economy. More specifically, both this financial year and in the next two financial years, the gross impact of that stimulus is $22.9 billion. That\u2019s 1.2% of GDP. This is a significant investment. We have taken the decision to put this stimulus in place that has the obvious impact on the Budget outcome for 2019-20 and Australians understand that, Australians know that this needs to be the priority* and our government agrees with that priority and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve taken the decision to put these measures in place. *This is Scott Morrison saying the surplus is dead and buried. All up, over the next two financial years, the stimulus package will cost $22bn The stimulus package is worth just under $18bn. Scott Morrison: We set this out very clearly two weeks ago when, as a government, I stood here in this courtyard and said we were preparing for pandemic. Today, the World Health Organisation has had that declaration. We called that two weeks ago. Back in January, we also called the coronavirus as an issue that warranted and needed our very careful attention and ever since that time, we have been preparing and responding with the travel bans and the other actions that the Government has taken. But the fiscal stimulus that would be necessary, and is necessary, to deal with the economic challenges that the country will face in the months ahead has been an important part of our plan for Australia to move through the challenges of the coronavirus in the months ahead. It\u2019s all about jobs, says Scott Morrison, as he launches into the government\u2019s stimulus package announcement. \u201cJobs provide people with choice, jobs are just so important,\u201d he says. Jobs are \u201cso important\u201d on how Australia deals with the \u201cdifficult months\u201d ahead, he adds. \u201cIt is a health crisis, but it is a health crisis with very significant economic impacts.\u201d As Mathias Cormann said earlier, (and as many of us had predicted, including all you good eggs BTL), you can \u2018do the maths yourself\u2019 and see the \u2018back in black\u2019 surplus is gone. \u201cObviously we already were under significant pressure given the impact on revenue from the economic impact of the coronavirus, so this is obviously not going to be a surplus year in 2019-20,\u201d Cormann said. The stimulus package at this stage looks to be close to $20bn \u2013 Scott Morrison said this morning it would be about 1% of GDP \u2013 and over the next two financial years. The government has also been at pains to say it supported the first stage of Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan\u2019s stimulus package, as it works to backtrack almost 10 years of criticism. This may not be the only stimulus package we see yet - they have told us it is \u201cscalable\u201d Katharine Murphy and Sarah Martin are both in the prime minister\u2019s courtyard (which, as you know, is the most fancy and serious of press conference locations) Scott Morrison went on an absolute media blitz this morning. Things are serious. Welcome to a special politics live. Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg are about to announce the details of the government\u2019s coronavirus economic response. What we know the surplus is dead and buried Small and medium businesses will benefit in ways that get them to spend as much cash as possible and keep on workers Casual workers and pensioners will most likely receive a boost Sarah Martin prepared this a littler earlier; What we don\u2019t know? Almost everything else. The prime minister is due to speak at 10.30 and we will bring you all the events live. He is also going to address the nation at 7pm. Ready? Too bad if you\u2019re not.",

      "bodyText": "Running water will be temporarily restored to thousands of poor Detroit residents disconnected due to unpaid bills, amid an outcry about the public health threat posed by the coronavirus outbreak. At least 141,000 Detroit households have been disconnected since 2014 as part of a widely condemned debt-collection programme, according to records obtained by Bridge, a news magazine. Just last year, taps were turned off in more than 23,000 homes, three-fifths of which were still without water by mid-January 2020. There is no vaccine or treatment for coronavirus, also known as Covid-19. According to the World Health Organization, good hygiene, specifically frequent hand-washing with soap, is crucial to prevent the virus spreading. Amid growing pressure to act, Michigan\u2019s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, and Detroit city officials this week announced plans to stop shutoffs and temporarily reconnect water services for all residents, as part of a plan to prevent spread of the coronavirus. \u201cThe state is stepping up to cover the cost of water restoration for the first 30 days, because it\u2019s the right thing to do to keep families safe and protect public health,\u201d Whitmer said. The governor later declared a state of emergency, after confirmation of the first two Covid-19 cases in the state. Both patients, an unrelated middle-aged man and woman from Detroit, were hospitalised. At least 12 states across the US have declared emergencies as cases have risen past 1,000, with 31 deaths confirmed. Church leaders and poverty campaigners had urged Whitmer to suspend water shutoffs. \u201cThe unconscionable act of depriving anyone of water because the cost is more than they can afford has resulted in a health crisis,\u201d said the Detroit People\u2019s Water Board, a coalition of social justice organizations, in February, adding that the coronavirus outbreak \u201chas the serious potential to be magnified and spread due to thousands not having access to water\u201d. Nicole Hill, 47, was disconnected in 2015, after falling behind with monthly bills which had quadrupled over five years. \u201cHaving your water shut off is horrendous,\u201d she said. \u201cI ended up in hospital with bacterial pneumonia when my water was shut off. Now with coronavirus, I\u2019m really frightened for people.\u201d \u2018A basic human right\u2019 Water affordability is a growing problem across the US, as low-income households struggle to pay increasingly expensive bills. Numerous public water utilities have increased shutoffs, ostensibly to encourage people to pay up on time. But many low-income households struggle to keep up with rent, gas and other bills too and in 2016, according to research by Food and Water Watch (FWW), an estimated 15 million Americans were disconnected from running water after failing to pay. \u201cThe United States has been facing a water affordability crisis for years,\u201d said Mary Grant, director of an FWW campaign which calls for federal action to stop shutoffs and introduce affordability programmes nationwide. \u201cNow, threats of the coronavirus are finally making it clear to our elected officials: water shutoffs are not only inhumane but also a public health nightmare. \u201cDetroit\u2019s plan to halt water shutoffs is long overdue. It should not have taken the coronavirus epidemic.\u201d Almost four in 10 Detroit residents live in poverty, the highest rate among the 20 largest US cities. Water rates have increased by as much as 400% in the last 20 years. In 2014, shortly after filing the largest municipal bankruptcy in US history, the city launched a massive shutoff programme. In its first year, 31,000 households had their water shut off. The UN described the shutoffs as \u201ccontrary to human rights\u201d and condemned the disproportionate impact on African Americans, who account for 80% of the city. Under this week\u2019s temporary plan, the state will cover water bills for the first month, after which customers can pay a reduced rate of $25 a month to stay connected until the crisis abates. But it is unclear how many households will be reconnected, and how quickly. Alice Jennings, a Detroit lawyer and member of the People\u2019s Water Board, told the Guardian the board welcomed \u201cthe acknowledgment by the governor and mayor to stop the water shutoffs and restore water services [but] this is crisis intervention and not a solution to a permanent problem\u201d. In Washington, Frank Pallone, chair of the House energy and commerce committee, and Peter DeFazio, chair of the transportation and infrastructure panel, urged water utility companies across the country to follow Detroit\u2019s lead. \u201cAccess to clean water is a basic human right at all times,\u201d they said, \u201cbut any action that restricts families\u2019 access to water during the current coronavirus outbreak would be reckless in the extreme.\u201d In Seattle, the worst-hit US city so far, water and electricity shutoffs have been suspended. \u2018It\u2019s a nightmare\u2019 For those still without water, Covid-19 poses a terrifying threat.

But in order to prepare, health departments need to perform some modelling, including taking into account worst-case scenarios.</p> <p>\u201cWe are not at this stage in a position to put out particular figures because the modelling has been evolving all of the time,\u201d the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, told reporters on Tuesday in a press conference with the deputy chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly.</p> <p>But NSW Health is nonetheless preparing for a first wave of illness lasting between 12 and 22 weeks, compared to 6-10 weeks for normal seasonal flu. However, a longer duration is more ideal as it means emergency departments and doctor clinics will not be inundated all at once.</p> <p>Between general practices, pharmacies and emergency departments, the state is expecting 272,000 presentations of people seeking health advice.</p> <p>Assuming a 22-week duration for the first wave of illness, NSW Health is preparing for coronavirus patients requiring 30% to 45% of hospital bed capacity for six weeks, and a 10-week surge on intensive care unit beds putting them at between 115% and 330% capacity. This would be on top of baseline demands, but the impact could be reduced by cancelling surgery and raising the threshold for admission.</p> <p>Patients will require between 145% and 300% of staffed ventilated bed capacity for up to nine weeks, the department predicts. Additional surge beds could come from using operating theatre staff and ventilators, the department told hospital staff.</p> <p>Guardian Australia has contacted NSW Health for comment.</p> <p>A professor of infectious disease and physician Prof Peter Collignon responded to the modelling by saying that it did not mean anyone knew what would happen or that the worst-case scenario would play out.</p> <p>\u201cHopefully, these scenarios won\u2019t happen, so we need to prepare in case it does, and looking at what\u2019s happening in Europe it\u2019s not unreasonable to,\u201d he said.</p> <p>However, he said evidence globally showed that countries such as South Korea and Taiwan that had acted early, as Australia, had done, demonstrated that the virus could be well contained and that people should take hope from that.</p> <p>\u201cPeople who will not be affected severely do need to worry because they\u2019re not immune and all of them have parents and grandparents, so they need to do all they can to minimise the risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means stay at home if you\u2019re sick, don\u2019t go out, wash your hands, and look after yourself. Because if you do you will decrease the risk to others.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Do you know more? melissa.davey@theguardian.com</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Up to 1.6 million people in New South Wales could be hit by the first wave of a statewide coronavirus outbreak with up to 80,000 people likely to require intensive care simultaneously. Health workers in NSW have been told to prepare for 8,000 deaths from Covid-19 over the duration of the epidemic, and that the \u201cfirst wave\u201d of the virus could last for up to 22 weeks. A presentation from the state\u2019s health department to hospital staff emphasises that the figures are \u201cpossible scenarios\u201d and that \u201cthere are many assumptions with still a lot of uncertainty\u201d. The chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, says preparations are under way for 20% of the state\u2019s eight million residents to catch Covid-19. Chant expects every person who becomes ill will pass it on to 2.68 others on average \u2013 although this could be reduced through self-isolation, social distancing and handwashing. \u201cWe\u2019re anticipating 20% of the population in the first wave to be affected,\u201d Chant told a NSW budget estimates hearing on Thursday. She said forecasts showed 5% of residents affected by coronavirus \u2013 or up to 80,000 people \u2013 would require intensive care. Assuming a 20% infection attack rate and a 1.2% case fatality rate, the state is preparing for 8,000 deaths, with a range of between 4,000 and 12,000. Experts have said the death rate may be much lower than 1.2%, given not all infections have been identified, and have also warned against reading too much into modelling before an epidemic is over and all data has been collected. But in order to prepare, health departments need to perform some modelling, including taking into account worst-case scenarios. \u201cWe are not at this stage in a position to put out particular figures because the modelling has been evolving all of the time,\u201d the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, told reporters on Tuesday in a press conference with the deputy chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly. But NSW Health is nonetheless preparing for a first wave of illness lasting between 12 and 22 weeks, compared to 6-10 weeks for normal seasonal flu. However, a longer duration is more ideal as it means emergency departments and doctor clinics will not be inundated all at once. Between general practices, pharmacies and emergency departments, the state is expecting 272,000 presentations of people seeking health advice. Assuming a 22-week duration for the first wave of illness, NSW Health is preparing for coronavirus patients requiring 30% to 45% of hospital bed capacity for six weeks, and a 10-week surge on intensive care unit beds putting them at between 115% and 330% capacity. This would be on top of baseline demands, but the impact could be reduced by cancelling surgery and raising the threshold for admission. Patients will require between 145% and 300% of staffed ventilated bed capacity for up to nine weeks, the department predicts. Additional surge beds could come from using operating theatre staff and ventilators, the department told hospital staff. Guardian Australia has contacted NSW Health for comment. A professor of infectious disease and physician Prof Peter Collignon responded to the modelling by saying that it did not mean anyone knew what would happen or that the worst-case scenario would play out. \u201cHopefully, these scenarios won\u2019t happen, so we need to prepare in case it does, and looking at what\u2019s happening in Europe it\u2019s not unreasonable to,\u201d he said. However, he said evidence globally showed that countries such as South Korea and Taiwan that had acted early, as Australia, had done, demonstrated that the virus could be well contained and that people should take hope from that. \u201cPeople who will not be affected severely do need to worry because they\u2019re not immune and all of them have parents and grandparents, so they need to do all they can to minimise the risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThat means stay at home if you\u2019re sick, don\u2019t go out, wash your hands, and look after yourself. Because if you do you will decrease the risk to others.\u201d Do you know more? melissa.davey@theguardian.com",

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The chancellor also acknowledged the impact of coronavirus on the government after two health ministers \u2013 Nadine Dorries and Edward Argar \u2013 and another unnamed cabinet minister were forced to self-isolate.</p> \n<p>But Sunak came under pressure to have a coronavirus test himself after telling the Sky News broadcaster Kay Burley that he had not done so when she suggested that it would be responsible for him to do so.</p> \n<p>\u201cClose proximity to that person [Dorries] would be defined as having been in two metres of them for about 15 minutes.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has announced that the US is temporarily suspending most travel from Europe to the US in an effort to contain the spread of coronavirus. In a rare Oval Office address, the president said the US would bar arrivals from 26 European countries for 30 days from midnight on Friday, accusing them of not acting quickly enough to address what he called the \u201cforeign virus\u201d. Details of how exactly the restrictions will work have yet to be fully clarified, and public health experts have questioned the effectiveness of the measure when the virus is already being transmitted person-to-person in the US. Here is what we know: Which countries does the ban apply to? According to the US Department for Homeland Security (DHS) and the president\u2019s proclamation, the ban applies to the countries belonging to the 26-member Schengen passport-free zone. These are: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. As non-members of Schengen, Britain and Ireland are not covered by the ban. Who is affected? The restrictions will cover \u201cmost foreign nationals\u201d who have been in any of the Schengen zone countries \u201cat any point during the 14 days prior to their scheduled arrival to the US\u201d, the DHS says. The ban does not apply to US citizens returning home, nor to foreign nationals who are legal permanent residents of the the US. Also exempted are foreign nationals who are: married to US citizens or legal permanent residents parents and guardians of US citizens or legal permanent residents aged under 21 brothers and sisters of US citizens or legal permanent residents, providing both are unmarried and under 21 children or foster children of US citizens or legal permanent residents It also does not apply to ship and plane crews; foreign nationals invited to the US to help tackle the virus; foreign government officials and their immediate family; and foreign nationals who work for the US armed forces, international organisations including Nato and the UN, or whose entry \u201cis deemed in the national interest\u201d. The ban resembles the restrictions imposed by the US on foreign nationals who have visited China in the 14 days before their arrival to the US. Washington has also issued restrictions on travellers from Iran, and \u201cdo not travel\u201d warnings to areas in Italy and South Korea. When does the suspension start and how long will it last? The restrictions will begin at 11.59pm ET on Friday and are scheduled to last for 30 days, but could be adjusted subject to conditions on the ground. How will it work in practice? There is little clarity on how the restrictions will be implemented beyond the statement that US authorities will take the necessary steps as regards visas and at point of entry to the US, while also ensuring that \u201cany alien subject to this proclamation does not board an aircraft travelling to the United States\u201d. The DHS has said it will issue practical guidance within 48 hours. What about British citizens travelling from outside the UK, and Europeans travelling to the US from Britain? It seems clear from the proclamation that as foreign nationals, Britons travelling to the US from within the Schengen zone \u2013 or who have spent any of the previous 14 days there \u2013 will be covered by the suspension, although it is not yet clear how that will work in practice. Nationals of the Schengen member states should be able to fly to the US from Britain but will have to have spent 14 days in the UK first. Again, how exactly this will be checked is not yet clear. Will the measure be effective? A study published in the Science journal found the effectiveness of travel restrictions in China was limited once the disease had spread widely within the country. On 23 January, Chinese officials banned travel in and out of Wuhan, where the Covid-19 outbreak originated, but by then the virus had spread to other cities and the travel ban only delayed its progression by three to five days, it suggested. Daniel Drezner, a professor of International politics at Tufts University\u2019s Fletcher School, questioned whether limiting travel from Europe would amount to anything more than \u201ca drop in the bucket\u201d, given the number of people who have already been infected with the virus in the US. According to the latest US figures, more than 1,250 people in 44 states and Washington DC, have tested positive for coronavirus and at least 30 have died. Democrats were also swift to criticie Trump\u2019s approach, saying the president had failed to address the shortage of testing kits that has hampered containment efforts across the country. \u201cThe best way to help keep the American people safe and ensure their economic security is for the president to focus on fighting the spread of the coronavirus itself,\u201d the Democratic leaders of the Senate and House said in a joint statement.",

Supreme court upholds Trump\u2019s \u2018Remain in Mexico\u2019 policy The US supreme court has said the Trump administration can maintain its controversial \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d immigration policy while a lawsuit challenging it plays out in the courts \u2013 most likely until after the end of Trump\u2019s current presidential term.

      "bodyText": "Wales and Scotland have prepared as normal this week for Saturday\u2019s match at the Principality Stadium, which is scheduled to go ahead despite the government stepping up its response to the spread of the coronavirus in the UK. It is the only one of the three matches on the final day that has not been called off, with the respective governments in Italy and France ordering the matches against England and Ireland not to go ahead as part of a policy to limit the size of crowd gatherings. \u201cWe are aware of the discussions going on at a higher level, but we are preparing as we usually do for a Test match,\u201d said the Wales head coach, Wayne Pivac. \u201cWe have had a briefing from our head of medical in terms of good practice and making sure we are hygienic in everything we do.\u201d The number of cases in Wales rose by 30% on Thursday to 25. Pivac, who like his Scotland counterpart, Gregor Townsend, has made three changes for the match, was asked if he felt comfortable about 75,000 fans being in Cardiff, packing public transport and bars. \u201cI have a huge responsibility to make sure the team is functioning as well as it can,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people who make those decisions and we will follow whichever way they go. That is just the way it is.\u201d Townsend, whose team are looking for a third successive victory in a Six Nations campaign for the first time, said he hoped the match went ahead, adding: \u201cWe understand that if that is not the case, it is for serious reasons. I do understand things move fast, but we are two days away and it would be a surprise if the game were called off this late.\u201d Wales are on a run of three successive defeats but two of the changes they made were enforced, with the uncapped Sale prop WillGriff John replacing the injured Dillon Lewis and the fit-again Cory Hill coming in for Jake Ball, who needs surgery after Twickenham. Rhys Webb replaces Tomos Williams, the third scrum-half to start for Wales in as many matches. Alun Wyn Jones, the captain, will equal Richie McCaw\u2019s record of 148 international caps.

Prof John Ashton, a former regional director of public health for north-west England, lambasted a lack of preparation and openness from the government and contrasted Britain\u2019s response to that of Hong Kong. \u201cRight at the beginning of February, they [Hong Kong] adopted a total approach to this, which is what we should have done five weeks ago ourselves. They took a decision to work to three principles \u2013 of responding promptly, staying alert, working in an open and transparent manner,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cOur lot haven\u2019t been working openly and transparently. They\u2019ve been doing it in a (non) smoke-filled room and just dribbling out stuff. The chief medical officer only appeared in public after about two weeks. Then they have had a succession of people bobbing up and disappearing. Public Health England\u2019s been almost invisible. \u201cBoris Johnson should have convened Cobra himself over a month ago and had regular meetings with the chief medical officer with the evidence.

      "body": "<p>Such is the reverse Midas touch of Donald Trump, that his attempt last night to face facts, steady nerves and reassure the public succeeded in spreading panic, sowing confusion and ratcheting up the anxiety.</p> <p>The fact that Trump delivered a rare, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/mar/12/trump-announces-travel-ban-from-europe-to-the-us-in-bid-to-stem-coronavirus-video\" title=\"\">live televised address</a> to the nation should, by itself, have induced calm. It suggested that the president was moving out of fantasyland, abandoning the denial that had led him to promise <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/28/politics/donald-trump-coronavirus-miracle-stock-markets/index.html\" title=\"\">a miracle</a> was on the way and that the threat of coronavirus was likely to recede as soon as next month, when the weather got warmer. (As recently as Tuesday, he was saying, \u201cIt will go away, just stay calm.\u201d) That he was ready to deploy one of the US presidency\u2019s most powerful tools, usually reserved for moments of war or disaster \u2013 a TV address from the Oval Office \u2013 seemed to signal that he was, at last, facing reality.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/us-cities-wuhan-coronavirus-covid-19\">Will American cities have a Wuhan experience? Only if they are lucky | Dr Renee C Wurth and Dr Nick Obradovich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sure enough, when he referred to the virus as a \u201chorrible infection\u201d, after weeks spent dismissing it as a glorified cold or flu, it fed the hope that Trump might finally be ready to acknowledge that his approach up until this moment had not worked \u2013 that this was not a problem that could be dealt with in the usual away, swatted aside with a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/08/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html\" title=\"\">tweet</a> or by hanging a comic nickname around the neck of one of his enemies.</p> <p>But no sooner had that hope appeared than it faded away. For in the course of nine minutes, Trump swiftly reverted to type. He described Covid-19 as a \u201cforeign virus\u201d, and took pains to point out that \u201ca large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travellers from Europe\u201d. His doctrine of \u201cAmerica first\u201d \u2013 a phrase he used once again \u2013 forever pits the US against the world, with its implication that America\u2019s purity is permanently under threat of contamination by alien hordes. Trump has used that imagery in the context of immigration for more than four years; it should hardly be a surprise that he uses it now in the context of disease.</p> <p>Equally in character was his preference for the vast, sweeping edict over the detailed, calibrated policy response. What the US needs most is a serious, extensive programme of testing. Currently, the US is bottom of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StewartWood/status/1238015271346020352?s=20\" title=\"\">global league</a> table for coronavirus testing, at a rate of just five people in every million. (South Korea is testing 3,692 people per million.) But that kind of announcement would require too much work, not least because Trump shut down the dedicated Obama-era, White House unit that had focused on preparedness against a global pandemic. It would be too dull and plodding for the man who made his name issuing orders on The Apprentice. Trump prefers the kingly diktat that makes instant headlines and good TV. In the 2016 campaign it was his call for a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting\" title=\"\">total and complete shutdown</a>\u201d on Muslims entering the US. This time it was a ban on travellers from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/trump-coronavirus-europe-travel-suspended\" title=\"\">26 European countries</a> in the Schengen area, starting on Friday. Once again, the would-be medieval monarch was ordering the drawbridge pulled up against the foreign menace.</p> <p>He surely hoped his subjects would be soothed by such a decisive show of leadership. But because this is Trump, his short speech was riddled with errors that had to be rapidly corrected \u2013 thereby spreading confusion rather than clarity. One example: he announced that his Europe ban would \u201capply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo\u201d across the Atlantic, prompting the White House to rush out a statement explaining that the president had got it wrong, and that the new policy would, in fact, only apply to people, not goods. If the plan was to project a White House coolly capable in the face of a crisis, that mix-up and Trump\u2019s halting discomfort in front of the teleprompter conveyed the precise opposite.</p> <p>Above all, the new policy lacked rhyme or reason. Why keep out almost all Europeans, as if this problem is exclusive to Europe (and China), rather than global, and when the US has a rising infection problem all its own? And why exempt the UK, which is hardly coronavirus-free? There was no explanation, so speculation filled the vacuum. Could it be a politically motivated swipe at the EU, which Trump once said he regarded as the US\u2019s greatest \u201cfoe\u201d, pointedly giving preferential treatment to Brexit Britain? Was it driven by a motive as base as the fact that Trump has <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/trumps-travel-ban-sidesteps-his-own-european-resorts/\" title=\"\">golf courses in the UK</a> (and Ireland), and he didn\u2019t want to harm his own businesses?

      "bodyText": "Such is the reverse Midas touch of Donald Trump, that his attempt last night to face facts, steady nerves and reassure the public succeeded in spreading panic, sowing confusion and ratcheting up the anxiety. The fact that Trump delivered a rare, live televised address to the nation should, by itself, have induced calm. It suggested that the president was moving out of fantasyland, abandoning the denial that had led him to promise a miracle was on the way and that the threat of coronavirus was likely to recede as soon as next month, when the weather got warmer. (As recently as Tuesday, he was saying, \u201cIt will go away, just stay calm.\u201d) That he was ready to deploy one of the US presidency\u2019s most powerful tools, usually reserved for moments of war or disaster \u2013 a TV address from the Oval Office \u2013 seemed to signal that he was, at last, facing reality. Sure enough, when he referred to the virus as a \u201chorrible infection\u201d, after weeks spent dismissing it as a glorified cold or flu, it fed the hope that Trump might finally be ready to acknowledge that his approach up until this moment had not worked \u2013 that this was not a problem that could be dealt with in the usual away, swatted aside with a tweet or by hanging a comic nickname around the neck of one of his enemies. But no sooner had that hope appeared than it faded away. For in the course of nine minutes, Trump swiftly reverted to type. He described Covid-19 as a \u201cforeign virus\u201d, and took pains to point out that \u201ca large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travellers from Europe\u201d. His doctrine of \u201cAmerica first\u201d \u2013 a phrase he used once again \u2013 forever pits the US against the world, with its implication that America\u2019s purity is permanently under threat of contamination by alien hordes. Trump has used that imagery in the context of immigration for more than four years; it should hardly be a surprise that he uses it now in the context of disease. Equally in character was his preference for the vast, sweeping edict over the detailed, calibrated policy response. What the US needs most is a serious, extensive programme of testing. Currently, the US is bottom of the global league table for coronavirus testing, at a rate of just five people in every million. (South Korea is testing 3,692 people per million.) But that kind of announcement would require too much work, not least because Trump shut down the dedicated Obama-era, White House unit that had focused on preparedness against a global pandemic. It would be too dull and plodding for the man who made his name issuing orders on The Apprentice. Trump prefers the kingly diktat that makes instant headlines and good TV. In the 2016 campaign it was his call for a \u201ctotal and complete shutdown\u201d on Muslims entering the US. This time it was a ban on travellers from 26 European countries in the Schengen area, starting on Friday. Once again, the would-be medieval monarch was ordering the drawbridge pulled up against the foreign menace. He surely hoped his subjects would be soothed by such a decisive show of leadership. But because this is Trump, his short speech was riddled with errors that had to be rapidly corrected \u2013 thereby spreading confusion rather than clarity. One example: he announced that his Europe ban would \u201capply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo\u201d across the Atlantic, prompting the White House to rush out a statement explaining that the president had got it wrong, and that the new policy would, in fact, only apply to people, not goods. If the plan was to project a White House coolly capable in the face of a crisis, that mix-up and Trump\u2019s halting discomfort in front of the teleprompter conveyed the precise opposite. Above all, the new policy lacked rhyme or reason. Why keep out almost all Europeans, as if this problem is exclusive to Europe (and China), rather than global, and when the US has a rising infection problem all its own? And why exempt the UK, which is hardly coronavirus-free? There was no explanation, so speculation filled the vacuum. Could it be a politically motivated swipe at the EU, which Trump once said he regarded as the US\u2019s greatest \u201cfoe\u201d, pointedly giving preferential treatment to Brexit Britain? Was it driven by a motive as base as the fact that Trump has golf courses in the UK (and Ireland), and he didn\u2019t want to harm his own businesses? Or did it spring from a crudely racist worldview that divides the globe into a clean, acceptable Anglosphere set against a tainted, diseased \u201cabroad\u201d? Whatever the explanation, the address did not work. The clearest proof came in the metric Trump understands best and that terrifies him most, because he believes it holds the key to his prospects of re-election.

However, there was concern that larger events used resources such as police and stewards at a time when they should be focused on the broader effort to counter the outbreak. On Thursday, Ireland became the latest European country to go further than the UK by shutting down all schools, colleges and childcare settings, and banning all indoor gatherings involving 100 people or more. Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, announced that she was minded to cancel large gatherings of more than 500 people to protect frontline services.

It\u2019s a nice line \u2013 but one budget can\u2019t undo the damage | Simon Wren-Lewis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In an assessment published a day after the coordinated response to the coronavirus outbreak from the Treasury and the Bank of England, the IFS said much of the longer-term spending rise designed to level up Britain was from previously announced measures for the NHS, schools, defence and overseas aid. \u201cThere is relatively little here for other departments,\u201d Johnson added.</p> <p>In an indication that a decade of austerity has had lasting effects, the IFS said spending per person for most public services will remain well below 2010 levels, despite Sunak\u2019s expansionary budget.</p> <p>Outside of the Department of Health and Social Care, which has had a protected budget, spending per head will still be about 14% lower than it was before the past decade of cuts began. </p> <p>The thinktank said the loss of EU funds spent in Britain would mean spending per person of about 19% lower. With health and social care included, spending per head returns to 2010 levels in 2025.</p> <p>Johnson said austerity was over in some respects, but that a decade of cuts to Whitehall departments had taken its toll. \u201cIf austerity is a process and a direction, then it\u2019s over. If it\u2019s spending above where we were in 2010, it\u2019s with us for a very long time. But my sense is austerity is a direction rather than a level,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Although broadly praising the chancellor\u2019s response to Covid-19, the head of the IFS said many self-employed workers would not get the support they might need and groups who may not be entitled to benefits could quickly face hardship.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/sunaks-spending-plan-will-increase-net-debt-by-125bn-says-obr\">Sunak's spending plan will increase net debt by \u00a3125bn, says OBR</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSunak will certainly want to monitor the effectiveness of the package and be ready to come back with more if necessary,\u201d he added.</p> <p>The IFS said the government\u2019s plans for a spending spree on transport projects and other public works was \u201cgenuinely very big\u201d, although cautioned that the scale of the increase meant it would be a significant challenge to ensure the money was well spent.</p> <p>The thinktank said Britain was more vulnerable to changes in interest rates, inflation and growth as the government pumps up borrowing levels and adds to the national debt. Sunak said at the budget he would balance day-to-day public spending with tax receipts by 2023, under rules set by his predecessor, Sajid Javid, with \u00a312bn of headroom to spare.</p> <p>However, the forecasts were drawn up by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government\u2019s independent tax and spending watchdog, before it could take full account of the coronavirus outbreak. The IFS warned that a downgrade in UK growth of just 0.3% a year over three years would eliminate all of Sunak\u2019s headroom.</p> <p>Johnson said: \u201cThis doesn\u2019t look consistent with George Osborne\u2019s mantra that the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/06/geiorge-osborne-roof-being-fixed-beware-house-crash-beneath\">should fix the roof while the sun is shining</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Analysis of the budget by the Resolution Foundation thinktank said the economic hit from weaker growth over the next five years, despite extra spending by the government, will be about \u00a3300 per household this year, rising to \u00a3575 per year by the middle of the parliament.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\ufeff\u201cThe budget does almost nothing to offset the considerable welfare cuts put in place by George Osborne in 2015,\u201d said the thinktank.</p> <p>Households with incomes just above the bottom 10th \u201cwill eventually be \u00a32,900 a year worse off, on average, thanks to benefit and tax changes announced since 2015.

      "bodyText": "Rishi Sunak\u2019s first budget is not as generous as it seems and many Whitehall departments will still be worse off than they were before the spending squeeze began in 2010, according to Britain\u2019s foremost economics thinktank. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the chancellor made the budget sound more substantial than it was, while relying on previously announced spending plans. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said Sunak delivered a timely and well-targeted government response to the coronavirus but warned voter \u201cexpectations may be disappointed\u201d from the promised increase in public spending. In an assessment published a day after the coordinated response to the coronavirus outbreak from the Treasury and the Bank of England, the IFS said much of the longer-term spending rise designed to level up Britain was from previously announced measures for the NHS, schools, defence and overseas aid. \u201cThere is relatively little here for other departments,\u201d Johnson added. In an indication that a decade of austerity has had lasting effects, the IFS said spending per person for most public services will remain well below 2010 levels, despite Sunak\u2019s expansionary budget. Outside of the Department of Health and Social Care, which has had a protected budget, spending per head will still be about 14% lower than it was before the past decade of cuts began. The thinktank said the loss of EU funds spent in Britain would mean spending per person of about 19% lower. With health and social care included, spending per head returns to 2010 levels in 2025. Johnson said austerity was over in some respects, but that a decade of cuts to Whitehall departments had taken its toll. \u201cIf austerity is a process and a direction, then it\u2019s over. If it\u2019s spending above where we were in 2010, it\u2019s with us for a very long time. But my sense is austerity is a direction rather than a level,\u201d he added. Although broadly praising the chancellor\u2019s response to Covid-19, the head of the IFS said many self-employed workers would not get the support they might need and groups who may not be entitled to benefits could quickly face hardship. \u201cSunak will certainly want to monitor the effectiveness of the package and be ready to come back with more if necessary,\u201d he added. The IFS said the government\u2019s plans for a spending spree on transport projects and other public works was \u201cgenuinely very big\u201d, although cautioned that the scale of the increase meant it would be a significant challenge to ensure the money was well spent. The thinktank said Britain was more vulnerable to changes in interest rates, inflation and growth as the government pumps up borrowing levels and adds to the national debt. Sunak said at the budget he would balance day-to-day public spending with tax receipts by 2023, under rules set by his predecessor, Sajid Javid, with \u00a312bn of headroom to spare. However, the forecasts were drawn up by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government\u2019s independent tax and spending watchdog, before it could take full account of the coronavirus outbreak. The IFS warned that a downgrade in UK growth of just 0.3% a year over three years would eliminate all of Sunak\u2019s headroom. Johnson said: \u201cThis doesn\u2019t look consistent with George Osborne\u2019s mantra that the government should fix the roof while the sun is shining.\u201d Analysis of the budget by the Resolution Foundation thinktank said the economic hit from weaker growth over the next five years, despite extra spending by the government, will be about \u00a3300 per household this year, rising to \u00a3575 per year by the middle of the parliament. \ufeff\u201cThe budget does almost nothing to offset the considerable welfare cuts put in place by George Osborne in 2015,\u201d said the thinktank. Households with incomes just above the bottom 10th \u201cwill eventually be \u00a32,900 a year worse off, on average, thanks to benefit and tax changes announced since 2015. With \u00a3900 of that yet to come as a result of welfare policies still being rolled out.\u201d It added: \u201cThese cuts mean the incomes of the poorest families have actually fallen over the past two years, and there is a risk that child poverty will reach record highs by the time of the 2024 election.\u201d",

How does the Covid 19 death rate compare to deaths through traffic accidents and traffic-caused respiratory illness, which we as a society seem to just accept as inevitable?</p></div> </div> </div>  </figure>  <p>Hi. For many people, the symptoms will be comparable to seasonal flu in terms of severity but the overall profile of the disease, including the death rate, look more serious. Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical officer, says he expects the death rate to be 1% or possibly a bit lower, once data from more widespread testing is available.

On Wednesday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, clarified this, saying that in the next couple of weeks we may see the numbers start to rise very quickly. </p> <p>Here\u2019s what he said to clarify: \u201cI just want to slightly correct the point about the deputy chief medical officer who said that in the next couple of weeks, we may see the numbers starting to rise fast to their peak. We do not expect numbers to peak in the next fortnight, we expect numbers to continue to rise after that and the peak would be in a matter of a couple of months, rather than a matter of a couple of weeks.

Closing schools also reduces groups of adults congregating. So most experts think that closing schools has a role, but that needs to be balanced with the disruption and potential for also taking health workers out of work as a result. Some are definitely of the opinion that the UK should follow moves by other European countries and be taking more extensive steps already.

There has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/japanese-woman-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-for-second-time\">one reported case</a> of a Japanese woman who tested positive, was given the all-clear and then tested positive again, suggesting that she had been re-infected. However, it is possible that one of these test results was inaccurate, and the broader picture, where we\u2019ve seen the outbreak brought under control in the Chinese city of Wuhan, suggests that people have short-term immunity. </p> <p>There are already four other coronaviruses circulating that cause about a quarter of common colds. For these viruses, people have immunity in the weeks or months after infection, but over time this begins to wane, meaning it is possible to catch the same strain again the following year. It is possible that Covid-19, which has more serious symptoms, also triggers a more enduring immune response, but we\u2019ll only know this for sure when scientists have had longer to test and re-test people. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T14:26:02.676Z\">at 2.26pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e6a2f398f087df56e4c73d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarahboseley\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T13:43:23.332Z\">1.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><em>Q: How long will the coronavirus last?

We don\u2019t yet know whether they are being spared. It may be that in low-income, poorly resourced countries in Africa, cases are being missed, although they are doing all they can, with support from the World Health Organization. The other possibility is that there may be something particular to Africa that reduces the transmissibility of the virus. That could include the outdoor life that people lead in many regions. Hi. For many people, the symptoms will be comparable to seasonal flu in terms of severity but the overall profile of the disease, including the death rate, look more serious. Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical officer, says he expects the death rate to be 1% or possibly a bit lower, once data from more widespread testing is available. That\u2019s still about 10 times higher than the proportion who die from seasonal flu. According to government figures, there are around 1,700 road deaths each year. Worst case scenario estimates suggest there could be up to 100,000 UK deaths from coronavirus \u2013 that is not what people expect to happen, but governments need to have contingency plans in place for a range of possible outcomes. Q: Why will the virus \u2018peak\u2019 in the next 2 weeks and then slowly get better? Why won\u2019t it continue to get worse and worse until everyone has it ? Tim, 34, self-employed courier, Somerset There\u2019s been a bit of confusion over this after the deputy chief medical officer, Dr Jenny Harries, said earlier this week that the start of the UK peak of the epidemic could come within the next fortnight. On Wednesday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, clarified this, saying that in the next couple of weeks we may see the numbers start to rise very quickly. Here\u2019s what he said to clarify: \u201cI just want to slightly correct the point about the deputy chief medical officer who said that in the next couple of weeks, we may see the numbers starting to rise fast to their peak. We do not expect numbers to peak in the next fortnight, we expect numbers to continue to rise after that and the peak would be in a matter of a couple of months, rather than a matter of a couple of weeks. This is a marathon and not a sprint.\u201d The Chinese government cracked down hard on the outbreak in Wuhan. You may remember that people in countries such as the UK and the US talked of \u201cdraconian measures\u201d. The city went into lockdown, everybody was off the streets and all workplaces were closed. They didn\u2019t act fast enough to stop the spread to other Chinese cities, but similar lockdowns were enforced once those also had cases. Experts now say that these measures worked and delayed the spread to other countries, although it couldn\u2019t stop it because of the amount of travelling everyone does these days. Some countries are now imitating China\u2019s actions. The lockdown in Italy is very reminiscent of what happened in Hubei. Q: How long does the virus stay \u2018alive\u2019 on a surface when touched by a carrier? Craig, semi-retired academic, Cammeray, NSW, Australia The virus can linger for 48 hours or possibly 72 hours on a hard surface, such as a hand rail on a bus or train, but less time on a soft surface. That is why the advice is to wash your hands regularly and to avoid touching your face, to prevent the virus getting into your nose, mouth or eyes. It\u2019s hard to completely avoid touching any surface, so keep washing your hands! The question of whether shutting schools is the right call is really tricky as there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty about how big a role children are having in spreading the virus. So far children have made up a tiny minority of positive test results, but there hasn\u2019t been widespread random testing so it\u2019s not known whether they\u2019re getting it and showing mild or no symptoms (this is likely) and, if so, how infectious they are. Early evidence suggests that a lot of asymptomatic transmission is going on in general and children could be a part of that. What we can be more confident of is that handwashing and social distancing do not work in school settings, so if children are passing it on then schools are basically the perfect breeding ground for infection and can act as a fountain of illness for the local area. Closing schools also reduces groups of adults congregating. So most experts think that closing schools has a role, but that needs to be balanced with the disruption and potential for also taking health workers out of work as a result. Some are definitely of the opinion that the UK should follow moves by other European countries and be taking more extensive steps already. See Sarah\u2019s interview with Prof John Ashton today. The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, both of whom are doctors, are advising the government. They get their data and information from the World Health Organization and a range of experts in public health and infectious diseases. What we don\u2019t know is exactly what Whitty, Vallance and other experts are telling the government. There are some critics who contend that there is a lack of transparency \u2013 see the story I have just written based on an interview with Prof John Ashton, which is here. Just under 15 minutes left to ask your questions on coronavirus \u2013 how to protect yourself, what the symptoms look like and what it might mean for you. Q: Can you catch the coronavirus more than once? Antony, 72, retired, Sheffield It is still unknown whether people have long-term immunity to the coronavirus once they\u2019ve been infected once. There has been one reported case of a Japanese woman who tested positive, was given the all-clear and then tested positive again, suggesting that she had been re-infected. However, it is possible that one of these test results was inaccurate, and the broader picture, where we\u2019ve seen the outbreak brought under control in the Chinese city of Wuhan, suggests that people have short-term immunity. There are already four other coronaviruses circulating that cause about a quarter of common colds. For these viruses, people have immunity in the weeks or months after infection, but over time this begins to wane, meaning it is possible to catch the same strain again the following year. It is possible that Covid-19, which has more serious symptoms, also triggers a more enduring immune response, but we\u2019ll only know this for sure when scientists have had longer to test and re-test people. Q: How long will the coronavirus last? Is it a few months or more like a year or two? Piper, 20, student, Sydney The epidemic in the UK will peak and then the numbers will start to drop, as has happened in China, but it\u2019s hard to say how long that will take. The UK strategy now is to try to delay the peak into the summer months. The numbers will fall \u2013 as they have in China and South Korea \u2013 but maybe not to zero. What we will almost certainly need is a vaccine to stop Covid-19 completely and we know that will take at least 18 months. Hi there. Yes, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Royal College of Midwives have set out some guidance on this. As case numbers increase, it might not be possible to isolate patients with coronavirus and instead hospitals are considering options such as organising pregnant or postnatal women admitted to hospital into cohorts, separating out women with symptoms to reduce the chances of transmission on wards. They also give advice saying that risks to the baby seem to be low, so at the moment, even if a woman gives birth while infected, they\u2019re not advising that she be separated from the baby or avoid breastfeeding because the downsides of this probably outweigh any potential risks. You can read my story on pregnancy from this week here. Most people who develop symptoms from the coronavirus get a dry cough, temperature, tiredness and shortness of breath. These tend to come on within two to 14 days of exposure. Some get aches and pains, nasal congestion, sore throat or diarrhoea, all of which are typically mild and come on gradually. One in six can become seriously unwell and develop breathing difficulties. It is typically older people and those with existing medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, that are hit hardest. Q: I can understand people panic-buying hand sanitiser and dried goods. But why are people around the globe stocking up on toilet paper in particular? Jim, Bristol The toilet paper buying craze began due to feared supply chain issues in Hong Kong, prompted by factory closures in mainland China. As rumours of impending shortages began to circulate, people in Hong Kong began stacking their shopping trolleys and there was even a reported armed robbery of hundreds of loo rolls. Images shared on social media and news reports spread the trend far beyond countries that rely on factories in the Hubei province for toilet paper supplies \u2013 basically, people see other people buying toilet paper and don\u2019t want to be the one that finds themselves left behind. Thanks for all the questions so far \u2013 keep them coming in. Our experts will be on hand to answer them until 2pm GMT. It\u2019s unlikely that the virus will be any less infective in the warmer weather, but the transmission rate may well go down as people spend more time outdoors. The virus is transmitted in water droplets from coughing, talking at close quarters, or touching surfaces where the virus has landed, usually in closed rooms. That\u2019s also why colds and flu go down in the summer \u2013 nothing to do with catching a chill! Hi innriver. There are lots of teams around the world working to develop a vaccine \u2013 and the first stages of development have been very quick compared with previous epidemics, such as Ebola. Some potential vaccines are already being tested and human trials are expected to be under way next month. However, it\u2019s still a long path from the first human tests to having something commercially available that can be given to large groups of healthy people. Testing needs to go through various iterations, increasing from groups of hundreds and then thousands of volunteers, to make sure a vaccine is effective and doesn\u2019t have any serious side effects. So we\u2019re looking at a time frame of a year to 18 months. Q: My questions is regarding soap substitutes. An acquaintance suggested using powdered laundry detergent for hand washing if hand soap, bar or liquid isn\u2019t available. What do you advise? Nancy Cadet, 68, retired, Pedasi, Panama Detergent is another form of soap and should work just as well, even if it\u2019s a bit harsh on the skin! You might like to take a read of this piece that we published. Q: Do people that die of coronavirus have normal funerals? Yaniv L, 42, software engineer, New York, USA Hi Yaniv. Yes, there isn\u2019t any need to cremate bodies as there is in the case of Ebola, where bodies can be very infectious postmortem. However, in some countries, such as Italy, public gatherings including funerals have been banned, meaning people have not been able to mourn the deaths of friends and family in the traditional way. Q: Like some of your other readers, I have a fever and a cough, and feel generally rubbish. But because I haven\u2019t been in any of the affected countries, and haven\u2019t (knowingly) had direct contact with anyone who has the virus, the NHS 111 advice is no use. In order to get further advice, it looks as though I\u2019d have to lie and claim to have visited one of the countries or had direct contact with someone testing positive for the virus. I may have as I travelled on the Eurostar last week, but how can I know? Feel in a bit of a bind. Mick Seals, 69, retired, Sheffield The government has said it is going to increase testing so they can do 10,000 a day. However, it is still going to be those people in the brackets you mention \u2013 plus those in hospital already with respiratory problems. They don\u2019t have plans to test everyone with a cough and fever \u2013 probably because those symptoms are very common and the NHS is going to be under serious pressure because of Covid-19. Probably the best plan is to try to self-isolate at home and get well, since 80% of people will have only mild disease \u2013 but call NHS 111 quickly if your symptoms worsen. Q: Is there an estimate for the number of intensive care beds that it will be possible to provide in the UK in, say, two months\u2019 time? Including the provision of ventilators? Rupert, Somerset There are more than 4,000 intensive care beds across the UK \u2013 but about four-fifths are occupied, according to the latest figures. As case numbers increase, the NHS will cut back on various types of surgery and treatment, to relieve some pressure on intensive care. NHS chiefs have said hospitals should aim to expand this capacity \u201cseveral-fold\u201d. But there is obviously a limit to how many ventilators are available and it won\u2019t be possible to dramatically increase the number of trained ICU doctors and nurses on wards. There will be a particular strain on staffing because health workers themselves are at higher risk of being infected. Q: If you get Covid-19 does that make you immune? Ilana, 60, Brazil Yes, we think so, although it\u2019s not absolutely certain. There have been reports of one or two people apparently getting the virus more than once. But it\u2019s quite possible that they were not correctly diagnosed the first time, or that they were not completely free of the virus by the second time they had the test. Q: I\u2019m involved in organising an event of 100\u2013150 people next week in Scotland. Should we cancel? Anonymous, Fife It\u2019s a difficult call and one that many people are having to make. There isn\u2019t public health guidance that suggests you should call this off at the moment, but this could change very quickly so as well as the health risks, you\u2019ll need to calculate the costs of calling it off now versus at the last moment, and also whether it is something that could easily be postponed. Q: My colleague has tested positive for coronavirus and I have been told to self-isolate as I had contact with him. Does my partner and other people I have been in contact with also need to self-isolate? Anonymous, Liverpool You need to talk to Public Health England about that \u2013 they should advise depending on the circumstances. The virus is most easily transmitted within families living at close quarters, so they may suggest your partner stays home too, but it\u2019s unlikely they would advise any more casual contacts to do so. But check with them. Q: What happens if I get Covid-19 symptoms while I\u2019m on holiday abroad? Lucy, 39, Project Manager, Wakefield Hi Lucy! This would depend on where you are and how serious your symptoms are. Broadly speaking, if you think there\u2019s a chance you\u2019ve been exposed or have symptoms that are not likely to be simply a cold or flu (such as a dry cough, tightness in the chest or trouble breathing) you should self-isolate, follow local public health advice and seek local medical help if necessary. You should avoid taking local public transport or flights if you are unwell. Q: Do we have any information on how at risk people with asthma are? Tony, engineer, Berkshire The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said at a briefing that people with mild asthma would probably not be at increased risk of problems - Covid-19 for them would be similar to catching a bad cold or flu, so not pleasant but not in the serious risk category. That may be different for those with severe asthma. Q: Why is the UK government not recommending working from home or taking any measures when other countries have already stepped up on their actions? Daniel, 35, works in the IT industry, Scotland Many people are asking the same question. Some epidemiologists believe that in the UK, people who can work from home should already be working from home. Plenty of organisations have enforced this and it should certainly slow the spread of the virus because you have fewer people commuting and mingling at work. The government has so far held off on this. They want to stagger the rollout of different measures, introducing each one when they think they\u2019ll get the greatest benefit. But that advice could change at a moment\u2019s notice and as early as today. Q: Could you clearly define the term \u2018underlying health conditions\u2019? Which conditions significantly affect susceptibility? Nick Young, Vega de Pas, Cantabria, Spain Based on data from China, doctors believe that some people are at higher risk of suffering very severe symptoms. These include older adults and people with serious chronic conditions that either affect the immune system or respiratory systems. So this would include heart disease, diabetes, any auto-immune disorders, serious asthma and other lung conditions. However, experts are still working to understand who is most at risk and how they can best protect themselves. Between 1pm and 2pm GMT our experts will be answering your questions on coronavirus: what the symptoms are, how to protect yourself and what it might mean for you. The Guardian\u2019s science correspondent, Hannah Devlin, the health editor, Sarah Boseley, and the science editor, Ian Sample, will be addressing your concerns. Following a callout we have received more than 800 questions so far. If there is something you would like to know about coronavirus, you can fill in our form or leave a comment below.",

      "bodyText": "A British-Iranian political prisoner being held in Tehran on spying charges has sent a recorded message saying that the jail he is in was in chaos because of coronavirus and appealing for the UK government to do more to help secure his temporary release. Anoosheh Ashoori was transferred three days ago within Evin prison to ward four, one of the wards he claims housed coronavirus victims previously. Ashoori was sentenced two years ago to 10 years in jail on charges of spying for Israel, a charge he vehemently denies. Iran is releasing a large number of prisoners, including some political prisoners, on bail, but has refused to release most of those with sentences longer than five years. Some older prisoners with longer sentences have been released. In the recording, from a phone call to his wife, Sherry, in London, he said people were arriving in the new ward from quarantine. In a call from the prison recorded by his family, Ashoori said \u201cAs we entered [the new prison ward] the soldiers were wearing worn-out masks, and no gloves. Nobody checked anybody for high temperature. All our stuff they touched when we entered\u201d. He added: \u201cLast night bedbugs were biting everyone. Nobody slept through the night.

The reasons for the transfer within the ward to what are regarded as far less sanitary conditions have not been explained to the political or security prisoners, but more than 50,000 prisoners are being released nationwide temporarily amid fears that the virus could rapidly spread within prisons. At least six prominent journalists and activists have been temporarily released in recent days. Iran\u2019s health ministry said in the past 24 hours 1,075 new cases of coronavirus infections, and 75 more deaths, had been recorded. Both numbers are records for a single day. The total number of cases has risen to 10,075 and the death toll to 429. A total of 3,276 people have also recovered from the disease, while the government estimates the peak may be about a week away. Iran insists conditions in jails are clean, necessary tests are being done and it has responded to the crisis through its release programme. A list of 10 political prisoners who were due to be released on furlough was read out to the male political prisoners last week including two dual nationals, one from the US and one from the UK. Their identities have not been divulged. Ashoori\u2019s son Aryan said he was prepared to camp outside No 10 and the Foreign Office to press ministers to do more to help his father. Sherry said: \u201cThis is playing with people\u2019s lives. This is abandoning people. My husband is 65 years old, and he has done absolutely nothing wrong. Iran seems to be mocking the Europeans.\u201d Iran does not recognise the status of dual nationals, and so will not receive UK representations. Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of another imprisoned British-Iranian, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, is still hoping his wife will be temporarily released. She had reportedly fallen ill, but the prison authorities have said she has recovered. Human Rights Watch, in a release on Wednesday, said it had received reports that prisoners had tested positive for coronavirus, including in Evin prison and others in the cities of Euromieh and Rasht. On 27 February, in an open letter, families of 25 prisoners detained for their activism pleaded with judicial officials to fully release or at least grant temporary release to their loved ones. On 2 March, Jared Genser, an American lawyer who represents the family of Siamak Namazi, an Iranian-American businessman sentenced to 10 years in prison, said in a statement: \u201cA prisoner in Siamak\u2019s ward, who slept just several cells down the same hallway, had acute respiratory symptoms, [and] tested positive for coronavirus.\u201d",

His decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/oct/20/spending-review-2010-osborne-cuts\" title=\"\">cut public spending</a> during the worst recession since the second world war <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/ng-interactive/2015/apr/29/the-austerity-delusion\" title=\"\">flouted basic macroeconomics</a>, the Keynesian principle that in a deep recession governments should spend more, and was opposed by a majority of economists. It delayed the UK\u2019s recovery from the global financial crisis <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=efd1DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA285&amp;lpg=PA285&amp;dq=austerity+delayed+UK+recovery+by+three+years&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hCmj0KjmZg&amp;sig=ACfU3U2ps8Pg1scNwQbOeRyrztUk04FV6A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwid25aD-ZToAhUsREEAHSuYA6wQ6AEwDnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=austerity%20delayed%20UK%20recovery%20by%20three%20years&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">by three years</a>, from 2010 until 2013. </p> <p>When the economy did finally recover, Osborne continued to cut areas of public spending. Rather than a response to the crash, austerity became just another byword for spending cuts. That policy of cutting areas of spending each year stopped under the previous chancellor, Sajid Javid. But just because the current chancellor has put an end to cutting spending, it does not mean that he has reversed any of Osborne\u2019s cuts.</p> <p>For example, the recent budget doesn\u2019t mean that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/29/council-spending-on-local-services-down\" title=\"\">local councils</a> will have as much money per person to spend tomorrow as they had 10 years ago. Nor does it mean that we will have as many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/mar/28/britains-police-chiefs-leader-sara-thornton-says-she-wants-end-to-blame-culture\" title=\"\">police officers</a> per person as we had 10 years ago. The government has stopped cutting large areas of public spending, but the amount spent on those areas as a share of GDP is still far lower than it was before Osborne embarked upon his policy of cuts in 2010.</p> <p>That is the first confusion caused by the phrase \u201cending austerity\u201d. The second comes when we look at aggregate numbers. Some will argue the state hasn\u2019t been shrunk at all; total expenditure is projected to be almost <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/the-changing-size-and-shape-of-the-uk-state/\" title=\"\">41% of GDP</a>, which is nearly 1% above where it was in the financial year 2007/08. Austerity, they argue, is a myth.</p> <p>This confusion arises for a number of reasons. The first is that the total expenditure figure includes public investment, which is now projected to be at <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/budget-2020-documents/budget-2020\" title=\"\">3% of GDP</a>, rather than below 2% as it was in the decade before the 2008 crisis. This change is welcome, although it\u2019s probably still well below the threshold that would be required to radically improve public infrastructure outside London and to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/13/avoid-uk-recession-by-kickstarting-green-economy-says-thinktank\" title=\"\">green the economy</a> by enough to meet emissions targets. I really hope that when the chancellor revises his fiscal rule he abandons the arbitrary 3% limit for the public investment share. When borrowing costs are so low, he should be doing much more to invest, using bodies such as the <a href=\"https://www.nic.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Infrastructure Commission</a> to judge whether state investments are value for money.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d0870a58052bd9f66f3e62036dd9b152d34b6cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d0870a58052bd9f66f3e62036dd9b152d34b6cd/0_68_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Osborne\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018George Osborne\u2019s decision to cut public spending during the worst recession since the second world war flouted basic macroeconomics.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If we exclude public investment, public spending is about half a percent of GDP below what it was in 2007. Yet even that figure is much higher than day-to-day spending on public services such as health, education, defence and local government. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), day-to-day spending on public services at the end of 2019 was just over 14% of national income, compared with just over 16% in 2007/08.<strong> </strong>One of the reasons current spending on public services has fallen by much more than total spending is pensions: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/27/pensions-triple-lock-questions-answered\" title=\"\">the triple lock</a>, which was introduced in 2011, substantially increased the share of these pensions in GDP.</p> <p>Even that 2% fall in the share of GDP spent on public services is misleading, because it includes health spending.

From 2010 the Conservatives tried to hold back this tide by slightly reducing health spending as a share of GDP, but they have now admitted this is unfeasible. Their previous attempts to reduce health spending has left the NHS <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jun/18/nhs-crisis-20bn-standstill-budget\" title=\"\">in a far worse state</a> than it was before 2010.</p> <p>The IFS estimates that by the end of last year, public service spending excluding health stood at just over 8% of GDP, compared to just over 11% in 2007/08. This is the scale of the austerity we have seen. Day-to-day spending on public services, excluding health, is now three quarters of what it was in 2007. Nothing in the budget will reverse that squeeze to any noticeable extent.</p> <p>This government has rightly decided that the Conservatives have shrunk the state by as much as is feasible. Austerity is no longer a vote winner, but the government still won\u2019t reverse its effects; measures such as raising corporation tax or increasing taxes on top incomes would be an ideological step too far.</p> <p>It is worth making one final point about deficits.

It simply doesn\u2019t matter that the deficit is likely to rise far above the OBR\u2019s projection for this year, which were made before the pandemic hit.

Princess Cruises, which has more than 50,000 passengers from 70 countries onboard its ships each day, has been especially hard hit by the spread of Covid-19. One vessel, the Diamond Princess, was quarantined for two weeks off the coast of Japan, with 3,000 passengers and crew onboard, as it became a floating breeding ground for the virus, resulting in at least seven deaths. Shortly afterwards, the Grand Princess ship was held off California after it was linked to the death of a US man who had previously travelled onboard. A couple from Florida who were on the cruise liner have filed a $1m lawsuit against Princess Cruises, accusing it of failing to protect passengers from the outbreak.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>InsureandGo, owned by Mapfre of Spain, said on Thursday morning that customers who bought a policy after 11.59pm on 11 March will not be able to make any claim relating to the virus.

LV shocked the travel industry on Wednesday night when it announced it would stop selling all travel insurance policies with immediate effect due to the coronavirus outbreak. The insurance giant Aviva said on Thursday it had halted all single-trip direct travel insurance for new customers travelling to Italy \u201cto reflect the current risks posed by coronavirus\u201d. Customers buying cover for trips to other destinations will no longer be able to select its \u201ctravel disruption\u201d or \u201cairspace closure\u201d add-ons, Aviva said. The move has been prompted by the World Health Organization declaration of a pandemic, and is likely to be followed by other insurers. It means that anyone who has not already bought cover for future holidays will be unlikely to be able to get coronavirus cover. The Post Office said it would continue to sell travel insurance policies but there is no longer cover provided for any claims related to Covid-19 for policies purchased after 11 March 2020 \u2013 the date of the WHO\u2019s pandemic announcement.

      "bodyText": "Poundland\u2019s owner, Steinhoff International, is postponing a potential sale or flotation of its European arm amid uncertainty relating to coronavirus and the unrelated illness of boss Andy Bond. Pepco Europe, which has about 2,800 stores including Poundland in the UK and the Pepco and Dealz chains in Europe, was expected to finalise a takeover deal or IPO later this year after Steinhoff confirmed it was evaluating options for the group in November. But the company has decided to delay the process partly because Bond, who previously ran Asda and is a shareholder in Pepco Europe, is taking a two-month leave of absence for treatment for a medical condition, which is not linked to coronavirus. The delay has also been prompted by volatility in both the retail market and stock markets, as countries around the world struggle to cope with the coronavirus pandemic. Steinhoff was seeking to value the business at more than \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.5bn), according to Bloomberg, which first reported the delay. The pause to Steinhoff\u2019s plans raises the prospect that other potential retail IPOs in the UK will be put on hold amid the fallout from Covid-19, including Travis Perkins\u2019s plan to demerge DIY chain Wickes. Retailers are taking a hit from slower spending on nonessential items such as clothing and homewares, partly as people avoid high streets and other busy areas in an attempt to avoid contracting the coronavirus. Interruption to the production of goods in China is also expected to affect supplies in Europe from Easter, usually one of the busiest trading periods of the year. The coronavirus outbreak has added to existing pressures, including the switch to online shopping, as well as rising costs from business rates, increases in the legal minimum wage and the fall in the value of the pound since the 2016 Brexit vote. Steinhoff had hoped to offload the Pepco group as part of a massive overhaul that was kicked off by an accounting scandal at the South African parent group in 2017. Steinhoff has already sold off assets including Bensons for Beds and Harveys in the UK. As part of its preparations for independence from Steinhoff, Pepco had refinanced with a \u20ac475m loan and further \u20ac130m credit facility.

Downton Abbey (2019)</h2> <p>Perhaps this is cheating (you could as well put on something from your Downton Abbey TV DVD boxset) but a visit to the Crawley family\u2019s leisured world will go down like a non-Christmas glass of sherry.</p> <h2>20. Back to the Future (1985)</h2> <p>The Freudian themes might make it less comforting than other films here, but Marty McFly\u2019s time-travel adventures in the small-town America of his parents\u2019 youth is always reassuring.</p> <h2>19. Quiz Show (1994)</h2> <p>Great performances from Ralph Fiennes, Paul Scofield and John Turturro in this true story of a rigged TV quiz show. A morality tale that is weirdly calming and pacifying.</p> <h2>18. Guys and Dolls (1955)</h2> <p>Cinematic greatness is always comforting: wonderful songs and comedy in this fantastic New York musical with Vivian Blaine, Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Jean Simmons.</p> <h2>17. When Harry Met Sally\u2026 (1989)</h2> <p>Director Rob Reiner makes the first of his two appearances on this list with this great romantic comedy starring Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yK4AEkzYDIE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yK4AEkzYDIE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>16. Dreamgirls (2006)</h2> <p>Jamie Foxx, Beyonc\u00e9, Jennifer Hudson and Danny Glover in this outrageously calorific double-helping of music and romance, all about the Detroit music scene from the 60s and 70s.</p> <h2>15. Love &amp; Basketball (2000)</h2> <p>Here to prove that sports movies can be as comforting as romances, and that they can moreover be romances, is Gina Prince-Bythewood\u2019s Love &amp; Basketball. Omar Epps and Sanaa Lathan star as the boy and girl next door who are both fiercely good at basketball, and pretty competitive, and perhaps not yet ready to confess how into each other they are. It\u2019s a very seductive love story with some sharp commentary on sexism on the basketball court.</p> <h2>14. Jupiter Ascending (2015)</h2> <p>This supremely wacky and world-historically daft sci-fi extravaganza is just what you need to cheer you up, featuring as it does an outrageous scene-stealing turn from Eddie Redmayne, playing the scheming space-lord Balem, an epicene pharaoh of intergalactic evilness. He completely upstages the film\u2019s notional leads Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis who encounter the vampirically arrogant alien clan \u2013 led by Redmayne. It really is wildly silly but very funny.</p> <h2>13. Mary Poppins (1964)</h2> <p>When you want cinema itself to be your nanny, dispensing wisdom and comfort, here is the Julie Andrews classic, cheering you up, spit-spot.</p> <h2>12. Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off (1986)</h2> <p>A wonderfully comforting movie that celebrates the world of idling, skiving, goofing off, and what the French flaneurs called \u201c<a href=\"https://hybridflaneur.wordpress.com/2015/03/05/the-metaphor-in-flaneur-botanizing/\" title=\"\">botanising on the asphalt</a>\u201d. Matthew Broderick plays a high-school kid from Chicago\u2019s North Shore called Ferris Bueller who fakes an illness so he can award himself a personal day in the city with his girlfriend and his best friend, who will be bringing his dad\u2019s treasured Ferrari. The movie bops around the city from joyous set-piece to joyous set-piece and some words from Ferris about how life goes by so fast that you have to make sure you appreciate it.</p> <h2>11. Clueless (1995)</h2> <p>The greatest Jane Austen adaptation in film history is also as richly comforting as drinking a mug of milky tea while curled up on the couch, eating a family-sized tub of Celebrations swathed in a cashmere slanket. Alicia Silverstone is glorious as Cher (the Emma of her day) who is happy, pretty and extremely well-meaning, with a great love of the mall, and an altruistic need to fix other people\u2019s love lives. She achieves a strange kind of intimacy with her stepbrother Josh, an earnest college kid home for the vacation, played by Paul Rudd, and they hang out in the kitchen or huddled up watching TV \u2013 and realise that have feelings for each other.</p> <h2>10. The Pursuit of Happyness (2006)</h2> <p>Unashamed and unabashed at all times, this is an industrial-strength Hollywood heartwarmer that lets you have the feelgood monosodium-glutamate right in your veins. Will Smith stars in this based-on-a-true-story of an ordinary guy who suffered heartbreak and homelessness as a single dad, and gets offered a once-in-a-lifetime shot out of poverty: an unpaid internship at a top financial firm. But he has to keep up appearances in front of all the other entitled Ivy Leaguers while covering up the fact that he is sleeping in a homeless shelter at night.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52x5HJ9H8DM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/52x5HJ9H8DM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>9. Paddington 2 (2017)</h2> <p>At a time when all of us feel like nothing more than self-isolating and eating marmalade direct from the jar, here is one of the most profoundly comforting comedies of recent times, which incidentally shows how a confident nation is happy about immigrants. Hugh Grant gives what many believe to be the finest performance of his career as the peevish, cravat-wearing actor Phoenix Buchanan who steals a precious pop-up book with clues to hidden treasure from Mr Gruber\u2019s shop \u2013 and frames Paddington for the crime. Despite doing jail time, the bear comes bouncing back.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzCx8bMMTOM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TzCx8bMMTOM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>8. Galaxy Quest (1999)</h2> <p>All together now: \u201cBy Grabthar\u2019s hammer, by the Sons of Warvan, you shall be avenged!\u201d Alan Rickman had a glorious role in this brilliant postmodern sci-fi comedy as Alexander Dane, the grumpy British thesp who had his moment of fame playing Dr Lazarus on a cancelled TV show called <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0177789/\" title=\"\">Galaxy Quest</a> and now, like the rest of the jaded cast (including Sigourney Weaver and Tim Allen), makes a living going round fan conventions, signing photos and reciting the catchphrases to the tragic nerdy fans. But then a deputation from outer space arrives believing the show to be a documentary history of what actually happened, and desperately needing our heroes\u2019 help. Galaxy Quest has one of the cleverest, funniest plot premises in film history, worked out to perfection.</p> <h2>7. The Princess Bride (1987)</h2> <p>William Goldman, who adapted this movie from his own novel, became famous for his screenwriting axiom: \u201cNobody knows anything.\u201d But we certainly know that this film is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/nov/09/favourite-film-princess-bride\" title=\"\">absolutely great</a>: sweet, charming, funny, with a dash of idealism and a genuine eccentricity that distinguishes it from regular Hollywood product. Cary Elwes plays the handsome farmhand who falls in love with a beautiful noblewoman played by Robin Wright. Their love is sabotaged by evil court plotters but the lovers find friendship with the passionate, hot-headed Spanish swordsman Montoya, played by Mandy Patinkin. Great to watch with all the family, or the grownups can savour it all on their own.</p> <h2>6. Notting Hill (1999)</h2> <p>This inspirationally glutinous fantasy from screenwriter Richard Curtis is about what would happen if an ordinary civilian bloke (and a Brit, to boot) fell for a super-glamorous Hollywood star, and she with him. The bloke is the tousle-haired stammerer Hugh Grant (making his second appearance on this list) and the star is Julia Roberts, who had what some of us believe to be her greatest career moment in Notting Hill, and the scene when she tearfully tells him that she\u2019s just a girl standing in front of a boy is a classic. Rhys Ifans found stardom as Hugh\u2019s appalling flatmate Spike who says: \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you a story that will make your balls shrink to the size of raisins\u201d, which incidentally is what happens to the male audience when the arrogant star, played by Alec Baldwin, dismisses poor Hugh from the hotel where he had been hoping to have sex with Julia. But it all ends happily.</p> <h2>5. Duck Soup (1933)</h2> <p>A brilliant and rather prescient satire on 1930s nationalism and indeed fascism, but also a hilarious comedy. The bizarre Ruritanian state of Freedonia, in deepest central Europe, is enduring a continuous and worsening economic crisis and forever on the verge of war with its equally belligerent neighbour Sylvania. But a rescue plan is at hand. A wealthy American widow (played in magnificent deadpan by Margaret Dumont) offers a multimillion dollar loan to Freedonia\u2019s coffers on condition that they install her close friend as president \u2013 and that is the free-thinking visionary and genius, Rufus T Firefly, played by Groucho Marx. Wisecracking Rufus soon causes mayhem in Freedonia\u2019s quasi-fascist staterooms. Is this the US\u2019s quasi-colonialism in action?</p> <h2>4. It\u2019s Complicated (2009)</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/11/nancy-meyers-focusing-on-my-movie-kitchens-is-sexist-director-its-complicated\" title=\"\">Nancy Meyers</a> is the Michelin-starred chef of cinematic comfort cuisine and here she serves up a richly flavoured dish of escapist storytelling, a veritable festival of gastro-lifestyle porn featuring very rich people who don\u2019t particularly regard themselves as rich. Meryl Streep is the divorced woman with grown-up kids who is now a \u201cchocolatier\u201d, of all the outrageously implausible things, running an upscale deli-cum-eaterie, although the actual work involved is minimal. Her roguish lawyer ex-husband, played by Alec Baldwin, broke her heart by running off with a hard-faced younger woman who is now failing to satisfy him on the life-affirming laughter front, so he starts having an affair with his ex-wife. You really do need to suspend your disbelief in this world of almost weightless freedom from work and ordinary money worries, but it is undeniably enjoyable and comforting in its weird way.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHfRyFyuDKM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sHfRyFyuDKM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <h2>3. Waiting to Exhale (1995)</h2> <p>Waiting to Exhale is basically the equivalent to eating an entire Haagen Dazs tub of ice-cream while watching the greatest daytime soap opera of all time \u2013 and it is tremendously addictive. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon play four smart, successful women who are discontented with the men in their lives \u2013 and the way society somehow finds that a woman\u2019s inability to be in a relationship with a man makes their other accomplishments somehow second-rate. But these discontents are showcased in a horribly watchable world of nice clothes and nice cars. It also has a great male cast, including Wendell Pierce, later to be Bunk in The Wire and Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman on the London stage.</p> <h2>2. The Devil Wears Prada (2006)</h2> <p>Meryl Streep makes her second appearance on this list in this fashion comedy movie based on the Lauren Weisberger novel, reportedly inspired by the terrifying fashion empress Anna Wintour. It is a comedy, but without the sharp, angular edges of satire or bleakness that might endanger the comfort factor. New York City is replete with glamour and gorgeousness as the location for this aspirational story: Anne Hathaway is the callow literature graduate from the sticks who somehow flukes a job at the colossally prestigious fashion magazine Runway edited by Streep\u2019s terrifying Miranda Priestly, the boss from hell who enforces a Stockholm-Syndrome love on all her employees and on us, the audience. Stanley Tucci is wonderful as her long-serving, long-suffering senior executive and this was the film that launched the elegant Emily Blunt on the world, as the super-snobbish fashionista who is to be Hathaway\u2019s unwilling guide.</p> <h2>1. Titanic (1997)</h2> <p>There can surely be no doubt as to the No 1 slot. As Liam Neeson says in Love Actually: \u201cWe need Kate and we need Leo and we need them now.\u201d Cheesy it may be, but this film delivers weapons-grade feelgood \u2013 and, at well over three hours, it delivers an awful lot of it. Because, paradoxically, nothing says filmic comfort eating like screaming in terror and being plunged into the icy Atlantic ocean, resurfacing, discovering that for some reason the woman you are in love with somehow can\u2019t scooch up on her bit of driftwood to let you on, and then going back down again, with C\u00e9line Dion in the background singing that her heart will go on. Kate Winslet found her moment of global greatness as Rose, the young well-born passenger in first class who is unhappily engaged to creepy Billy Zane (fated not to cover himself with glory once the trouble starts). Rose finds that she has a distinct spark with Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s Jack who has won his third-class ticket in a poker game and thinks himself the luckiest young fellow in the world to have got on board for this exciting maiden voyage \u2013 especially when he feels that Rose is in love with him, and secretly gets to paint her in the nude. (That\u2019s her in the nude, not him.) It is amazing to think that just before this film was released, all the talk was about how it could be a disaster \u2013 how it was going to be like Lew Grade\u2019s Raise the Titanic; what a tyrannical monster Cameron was to his cast etc \u2013 but the film\u2019s instant rip-roaring success simply blew all this away. A film to lull you into a bovine stupor of wellbeing.</p>",

Hugh Grant gives what many believe to be the finest performance of his career as the peevish, cravat-wearing actor Phoenix Buchanan who steals a precious pop-up book with clues to hidden treasure from Mr Gruber\u2019s shop \u2013 and frames Paddington for the crime. Despite doing jail time, the bear comes bouncing back. 8. Galaxy Quest (1999) All together now: \u201cBy Grabthar\u2019s hammer, by the Sons of Warvan, you shall be avenged!\u201d Alan Rickman had a glorious role in this brilliant postmodern sci-fi comedy as Alexander Dane, the grumpy British thesp who had his moment of fame playing Dr Lazarus on a cancelled TV show called Galaxy Quest and now, like the rest of the jaded cast (including Sigourney Weaver and Tim Allen), makes a living going round fan conventions, signing photos and reciting the catchphrases to the tragic nerdy fans.

The bizarre Ruritanian state of Freedonia, in deepest central Europe, is enduring a continuous and worsening economic crisis and forever on the verge of war with its equally belligerent neighbour Sylvania. But a rescue plan is at hand. A wealthy American widow (played in magnificent deadpan by Margaret Dumont) offers a multimillion dollar loan to Freedonia\u2019s coffers on condition that they install her close friend as president \u2013 and that is the free-thinking visionary and genius, Rufus T Firefly, played by Groucho Marx. Wisecracking Rufus soon causes mayhem in Freedonia\u2019s quasi-fascist staterooms. Is this the US\u2019s quasi-colonialism in action? 4. It\u2019s Complicated (2009) Nancy Meyers is the Michelin-starred chef of cinematic comfort cuisine and here she serves up a richly flavoured dish of escapist storytelling, a veritable festival of gastro-lifestyle porn featuring very rich people who don\u2019t particularly regard themselves as rich. Meryl Streep is the divorced woman with grown-up kids who is now a \u201cchocolatier\u201d, of all the outrageously implausible things, running an upscale deli-cum-eaterie, although the actual work involved is minimal. Her roguish lawyer ex-husband, played by Alec Baldwin, broke her heart by running off with a hard-faced younger woman who is now failing to satisfy him on the life-affirming laughter front, so he starts having an affair with his ex-wife. You really do need to suspend your disbelief in this world of almost weightless freedom from work and ordinary money worries, but it is undeniably enjoyable and comforting in its weird way. 3. Waiting to Exhale (1995) Waiting to Exhale is basically the equivalent to eating an entire Haagen Dazs tub of ice-cream while watching the greatest daytime soap opera of all time \u2013 and it is tremendously addictive. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon play four smart, successful women who are discontented with the men in their lives \u2013 and the way society somehow finds that a woman\u2019s inability to be in a relationship with a man makes their other accomplishments somehow second-rate. But these discontents are showcased in a horribly watchable world of nice clothes and nice cars. It also has a great male cast, including Wendell Pierce, later to be Bunk in The Wire and Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman on the London stage. 2. The Devil Wears Prada (2006) Meryl Streep makes her second appearance on this list in this fashion comedy movie based on the Lauren Weisberger novel, reportedly inspired by the terrifying fashion empress Anna Wintour. It is a comedy, but without the sharp, angular edges of satire or bleakness that might endanger the comfort factor. New York City is replete with glamour and gorgeousness as the location for this aspirational story: Anne Hathaway is the callow literature graduate from the sticks who somehow flukes a job at the colossally prestigious fashion magazine Runway edited by Streep\u2019s terrifying Miranda Priestly, the boss from hell who enforces a Stockholm-Syndrome love on all her employees and on us, the audience. Stanley Tucci is wonderful as her long-serving, long-suffering senior executive and this was the film that launched the elegant Emily Blunt on the world, as the super-snobbish fashionista who is to be Hathaway\u2019s unwilling guide. 1. Titanic (1997) There can surely be no doubt as to the No 1 slot. As Liam Neeson says in Love Actually: \u201cWe need Kate and we need Leo and we need them now.\u201d Cheesy it may be, but this film delivers weapons-grade feelgood \u2013 and, at well over three hours, it delivers an awful lot of it. Because, paradoxically, nothing says filmic comfort eating like screaming in terror and being plunged into the icy Atlantic ocean, resurfacing, discovering that for some reason the woman you are in love with somehow can\u2019t scooch up on her bit of driftwood to let you on, and then going back down again, with C\u00e9line Dion in the background singing that her heart will go on. Kate Winslet found her moment of global greatness as Rose, the young well-born passenger in first class who is unhappily engaged to creepy Billy Zane (fated not to cover himself with glory once the trouble starts). Rose finds that she has a distinct spark with Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s Jack who has won his third-class ticket in a poker game and thinks himself the luckiest young fellow in the world to have got on board for this exciting maiden voyage \u2013 especially when he feels that Rose is in love with him, and secretly gets to paint her in the nude. (That\u2019s her in the nude, not him.) It is amazing to think that just before this film was released, all the talk was about how it could be a disaster \u2013 how it was going to be like Lew Grade\u2019s Raise the Titanic; what a tyrannical monster Cameron was to his cast etc \u2013 but the film\u2019s instant rip-roaring success simply blew all this away. A film to lull you into a bovine stupor of wellbeing.",

      "bodyText": "Concerns are growing that the deportation of migrants from the US and Mexico could accelerate the spread of coronavirus in Central America, after authorities in Honduras suspended repatriation flights and confirmed the first two cases in the country. Honduras became the third country in Central America \u2013 and the first in the Northern Triangle region which is the largest source of migration to the US \u2013 to confirm cases of the virus late on Tuesday. The cases both involved people who had recently returned from Europe, but three men deported from the US also arrived presenting symptoms of the virus. The three deportees \u2013 aged between 18 and 26 \u2013 have been placed in isolation, and President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez called for calm, saying on Wednesday: \u201cWe cannot allow ourselves to be guided by panic or hysteria.\u201d But activists fear that the constant flow of deportees from the US and Mexico could complicate the region\u2019s ability to contain the virus. More than 1,000 cases and 38 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the US. \u201cThose countries need to be reviewing a moratorium on deportations right now in light of this illness,\u201d said Elizabeth Kennedy, a migration expert based in Central America. So far, Central America has just one death \u2013 in Panama \u2013 and a handful of confirmed cases in Panama, Costa Rica and now Honduras. But the pandemic reaches the region just as Honduras and El Salvador were due to follow Guatemala and implement \u201csafe third country\u201d agreements with Washington, under which migrants seeking asylum at the US border will instead be diverted to Central America. Health workers have warned that the virus will inevitably find a foothold in US immigration detention centers where overcrowding and limited healthcare are endemic. Meanwhile the grueling journey north leaves migrants particularly vulnerable. Lack of food, sleep and constant stress lead to fatigue and weakened immune defenses, said Karen Valladares, director of the migrant rights group Fonamih in Honduras. \u201cOn their journey migrants are more susceptible \u2013 not only to coronavirus \u2013 but also other illnesses,\u201d she said. The lack of access to medical care and close quarters at migrant shelters, camps and detention centers further exacerbates the risk.

These 14-day isolation periods involve individuals or families staying within their homes, and not having physical contact with those outside. With the prospect of school and daycare closures, as well as workplaces shutting down or moving to remote working, many more families around the world face the prospect of precisely the kind of long days the Diener family is experiencing.</p> <p>But what can families expect and how can they survive not only the virus, but each other?</p> <p>For parents trying to work from home, their ability to do so will rely on various factors from the age of their children and the layout of their home to the nature of their work. The temperament of parents and kids will also play a role.</p> <p>Claire Amos, the principal of Albany senior high school in Auckland, has been self-isolating within the family home, away from her teenage children and husband, for nearly two weeks after a work trip to Italy. Amos devotes mornings to emails and Google Hangout meetings with senior staff and students, and was surprised at how productive she has been. \u201cYou can get jobs done really effectively in this state. A lot of the time you\u2019re busy being busy, rather than doing anything productive.\u201d</p> <p>Diener\u2019s wife works part-time from home for a local wine company, so her work hasn\u2019t been too disrupted. For Diener, used to training and playing basketball all day, the shift has been hard. He has tried to keep up some training but it\u2019s not the same. \u201cFor me, sitting at home is driving me a little crazy too,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m used to doing my job.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/coronavirus-charities-rally-to-help-older-people-in-self-isolation\">Coronavirus: charities rally to help older people in self-isolation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With routines disrupted and families thrown into close quarters, cabin fever is a real danger. It is exacerbated by predispositions and thought processes and can manifest, says Dr Carly Johnco, a clinical psychologist at Sydney\u2019s Macquarie University, as anxiety, extreme frustration, depression or low mood. The University of Melbourne psychology professor and parenting expert Prof Lea Waters AM says self-isolation can hit three critical components of mental health: our sense of autonomy, relatedness (a sense of being connected to others) and competency (feeling effective).</p> <p>Now for the good news. They\u2019ve all got tips on how to get through it.</p> <h2><strong>Begin on the same page</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI\u2019d suggest at the very start the family sit down and devise a family contract,\u201d Waters says. \u201cHave a discussion: what do you think will be the biggest challenges? What are the strengths that we each have as an individual family member that can help out?\u201d Discussing concerns and expectations about the quarantine, and what role each person can play to make it better, can be helpful, she says. \u201cForewarned is forearmed.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Be truthful</strong></h2> <p>It is important for parents to listen to and empathise with their children\u2019s fears, speak truthfully about the situation in an age-appropriate manner and put it into context, the experts say.</p> <p>\u201cHave conversations for facts and feelings,\u201d Waters says. Critical to allaying fears will also be allowing children a sense of control, such as over their personal hygiene.</p> <p>For adults too, keeping a sense of perspective and sourcing information and advice from credible sources will help stave off anxiety. Amos says it\u2019s important for people to be open about what they are experiencing, to reduce any possible stigma or embarrassment attached to self-isolation.</p> <h2><strong>Set up structure</strong></h2> <p>Maintaining a routine will be important but it need not be strict. \u201cRoutines are always helpful for people to see an endpoint,\u201d Waters says.</p> <p>Amos says routine has been critical to not going \u201cbonkers\u201d.

The Diener family in Italy break up their day with some micro-exercises, such as jumping jacks, running up stairs or playing basketball and soccer.</p> <h2><strong>Get things done</strong></h2> <p>Feeling as though something has been accomplished during an isolation period will be important for both children and their parents. It could include working from home, school assignments or setting sights on long-avoided chores, repairs or tasks. Waters suggests encouraging kids to keep a \u201ccorona journal\u201d, in which they can document their experience. Amos has altered a jacket she had been meaning to work on for months, and laughs that her wardrobe has never been so organised.</p> <p>\u201cThe other thing I\u2019ve been doing is indulging,\u201d Amos says. She has a mandatory tea in the backyard sunshine. Johnco says it is important to make time for \u201cactivities that just make you feel good\u201d.</p> <p>Families should consider things they can do together \u2013 like planning for a movie night, taking on a large project such as building something together, or even rearranging the furniture.</p> <h2><strong>Give each other space</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1ce36c36f11035f5de41c21443e9575b9dd32fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1ce36c36f11035f5de41c21443e9575b9dd32fb/0_0_1753_1372/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A teenage girl reading an e-book in a corner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"783\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Respecting time alone is important in close quarters.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: praetorianphoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cTry to think of things you can do by yourself and as a family,\u201d Johnco says. \u201cIt can be hard for families who are used to all going off to their own activities being forced into this intense time. That\u2019s why when you\u2019re on family holiday you\u2019ll sometimes see kids squabbling \u2013 they\u2019re not used to being in the same space.\u201d</p> <p>Waters says: \u201cI would create spaces in the house, if possible, like little zones \u2013 \u2018This is our game zone. This bean bag with a headset is our chill-out corner.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>While respecting time alone is important, it could also be a time for creating or reconnecting with family rituals, she says. This might be as simple as a proper sit-down family meal, perhaps with a new recipe the kids have been involved in preparing.</p> <h2><strong>Stay in touch</strong></h2> <p>Another critical component of good mental state is feeling connected to others. This time, technology is our friend. Connecting and making time for friends on social media or over the phone will be critical for adults. Also important, says Johnco, is \u201creciprocal social support\u201d \u2013 reaching out to others to make sure they are OK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/disease-dodging-worried-wealthy-jet-off-to-disaster-bunkers\">Super-rich jet off to disaster bunkers amid coronavirus outbreak</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Children are used to highly social environments and will also need to connect with friends. Older children, Waters says, could create themes on Instagram or Snapchat where they can share their experiences and tips with friends. With younger children it might be scheduling in some video calls with friends and family.</p> <h2><strong>Learn from the experience</strong></h2> <p>Diener says his kids have been great during their isolation, and have accepted their new routine. It\u2019s given him a new perspective, too.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m gaining a lot more respect for teachers and their patience, because it\u2019s hard to teach kids,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been good for me as well.

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt gets a little crazy in our house,\u201d Travis Diener says. Diener, a professional basketball player, lives in Cremona in the Covid-19 red zone of Lombardy, Italy, with his wife and three young children. They are living in lockdown; the kids have been off school for two weeks, and the family is following government advice: staying in their home and only venturing outside when necessary. \u201c\u2018Time flies\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s the saying,\u201d he says. \u201cBut in this situation it can go slow. The days are long.\u201d As the coronavirus pandemic spreads, self-isolation or quarantine is one of the key strategies in \u201cflattening the curve\u201d of infection rates. These 14-day isolation periods involve individuals or families staying within their homes, and not having physical contact with those outside. With the prospect of school and daycare closures, as well as workplaces shutting down or moving to remote working, many more families around the world face the prospect of precisely the kind of long days the Diener family is experiencing. But what can families expect and how can they survive not only the virus, but each other? For parents trying to work from home, their ability to do so will rely on various factors from the age of their children and the layout of their home to the nature of their work. The temperament of parents and kids will also play a role. Claire Amos, the principal of Albany senior high school in Auckland, has been self-isolating within the family home, away from her teenage children and husband, for nearly two weeks after a work trip to Italy. Amos devotes mornings to emails and Google Hangout meetings with senior staff and students, and was surprised at how productive she has been. \u201cYou can get jobs done really effectively in this state. A lot of the time you\u2019re busy being busy, rather than doing anything productive.\u201d Diener\u2019s wife works part-time from home for a local wine company, so her work hasn\u2019t been too disrupted. For Diener, used to training and playing basketball all day, the shift has been hard. He has tried to keep up some training but it\u2019s not the same. \u201cFor me, sitting at home is driving me a little crazy too,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m used to doing my job.\u201d With routines disrupted and families thrown into close quarters, cabin fever is a real danger. It is exacerbated by predispositions and thought processes and can manifest, says Dr Carly Johnco, a clinical psychologist at Sydney\u2019s Macquarie University, as anxiety, extreme frustration, depression or low mood. The University of Melbourne psychology professor and parenting expert Prof Lea Waters AM says self-isolation can hit three critical components of mental health: our sense of autonomy, relatedness (a sense of being connected to others) and competency (feeling effective). Now for the good news. They\u2019ve all got tips on how to get through it. Begin on the same page \u201cI\u2019d suggest at the very start the family sit down and devise a family contract,\u201d Waters says. \u201cHave a discussion: what do you think will be the biggest challenges? What are the strengths that we each have as an individual family member that can help out?\u201d Discussing concerns and expectations about the quarantine, and what role each person can play to make it better, can be helpful, she says. \u201cForewarned is forearmed.\u201d Be truthful It is important for parents to listen to and empathise with their children\u2019s fears, speak truthfully about the situation in an age-appropriate manner and put it into context, the experts say. \u201cHave conversations for facts and feelings,\u201d Waters says. Critical to allaying fears will also be allowing children a sense of control, such as over their personal hygiene. For adults too, keeping a sense of perspective and sourcing information and advice from credible sources will help stave off anxiety. Amos says it\u2019s important for people to be open about what they are experiencing, to reduce any possible stigma or embarrassment attached to self-isolation. Set up structure Maintaining a routine will be important but it need not be strict. \u201cRoutines are always helpful for people to see an endpoint,\u201d Waters says. Amos says routine has been critical to not going \u201cbonkers\u201d. She wakes in the morning at nearly her usual time, showers, gets dressed and puts on her makeup, before waving off her family members not quarantined and then getting stuck into work for the morning. In the afternoon she plays with posting outfits of the day on Instagram and has \u201creconnected with Yoga with Adriene on YouTube\u201d. Diener and his family have tried to stay close to their normal routine. The school has emailed activities and lessons so the children don\u2019t fall behind. He and his wife break up the day into seven or eight \u201csubjects\u201d, for their children, who are aged three, five and seven. \u201cIt could be anything from helping my wife bake cookies, a dance class, math, spelling, some Italian, some English,\u201d he says. These lessons are broken up with something fun, like downtime or half an hour with the iPad or TV. Waters says families should try to enjoy having more spare time than usual, especially what can be very rare downtime for kids. Parents can be prepared with games, craft, schoolwork and books, but allowing more screen time than normal will not, says Johnco, be catastrophic. Just don\u2019t stay on screens all the time. \u201cIt could be tempting for people to just sit in front of the telly for two weeks,\u201d she says. \u201cThe novelty of that will wear off quite quickly. We know that when people withdraw, or stop doing their normal activities, it can have a pretty profound effect on their mood.\u201d Reliance on streaming services or the internet may not be practical. Telecommunications networks are preparing for a surge in people working from home. Australia\u2019s networks are resilient but will come under pressure, a Telstra spokesman said. \u201cWe are confident our networks can be optimised to manage a significant increase in network traffic as a result of people being at home, although depending on what eventuates there may be times when the service is slower than usual.\u201d So don\u2019t go crazy on the Netflix, and have a robust mobile data plan as a backup, if you\u2019re likely to need to complete urgent work. Keep moving Johnco says keeping physically active is critical to boosting mood: \u201cFrustration and boredom can come when kids are not getting the opportunities to be physically active.\u201d Creative exercise ideas, like setting up an obstacle course in the backyard, could occupy both parents and kids. The Diener family in Italy break up their day with some micro-exercises, such as jumping jacks, running up stairs or playing basketball and soccer. Get things done Feeling as though something has been accomplished during an isolation period will be important for both children and their parents. It could include working from home, school assignments or setting sights on long-avoided chores, repairs or tasks. Waters suggests encouraging kids to keep a \u201ccorona journal\u201d, in which they can document their experience. Amos has altered a jacket she had been meaning to work on for months, and laughs that her wardrobe has never been so organised. \u201cThe other thing I\u2019ve been doing is indulging,\u201d Amos says. She has a mandatory tea in the backyard sunshine. Johnco says it is important to make time for \u201cactivities that just make you feel good\u201d. Families should consider things they can do together \u2013 like planning for a movie night, taking on a large project such as building something together, or even rearranging the furniture. Give each other space \u201cTry to think of things you can do by yourself and as a family,\u201d Johnco says. \u201cIt can be hard for families who are used to all going off to their own activities being forced into this intense time. That\u2019s why when you\u2019re on family holiday you\u2019ll sometimes see kids squabbling \u2013 they\u2019re not used to being in the same space.\u201d Waters says: \u201cI would create spaces in the house, if possible, like little zones \u2013 \u2018This is our game zone. This bean bag with a headset is our chill-out corner.\u2019\u201d While respecting time alone is important, it could also be a time for creating or reconnecting with family rituals, she says. This might be as simple as a proper sit-down family meal, perhaps with a new recipe the kids have been involved in preparing. Stay in touch Another critical component of good mental state is feeling connected to others. This time, technology is our friend. Connecting and making time for friends on social media or over the phone will be critical for adults. Also important, says Johnco, is \u201creciprocal social support\u201d \u2013 reaching out to others to make sure they are OK. Children are used to highly social environments and will also need to connect with friends. Older children, Waters says, could create themes on Instagram or Snapchat where they can share their experiences and tips with friends. With younger children it might be scheduling in some video calls with friends and family. Learn from the experience Diener says his kids have been great during their isolation, and have accepted their new routine. It\u2019s given him a new perspective, too. \u201cI\u2019m gaining a lot more respect for teachers and their patience, because it\u2019s hard to teach kids,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been good for me as well. It\u2019s helped me, I think, become a better parent.\u201d Amos, too, has found silver linings in her forced removal from a busy life. \u201cIt\u2019s quite nice to slow down,\u201d she says. \u201cIn a weird way I hope I learn from that and change my behaviours a little bit. For probably the first time ever, I\u2019ve actually felt guilt-free about not being busy.\u201d",

That is not on the cards today as the front seats in his car are not 1.5 metres apart.</p> \n<p>Now I go on a run (the faster I move, the less time there is to expose myself to people) to meet Brad.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s almost two weeks ago and we\u2019re sitting on the terrace having breakfast in Siem Reap when one of us gets a text message from work. \u201cIt says if I have been travelling overseas, when I return I can\u2019t go into the office and have to work from home.\u201d We all fall about laughing. But you\u2019re not sick! We say. You don\u2019t have the virus. That\u2019s crazy! People be freaking out, I think. We scroll on our phones over breakfast watching people in Australia brawl over loo paper. \u201cSomeone got tasered! There are armed security guarding toilet paper!\u201d We laugh and shake our heads. Then my cleaner messages me. I have Airbnb guests at my place in the country this weekend but there\u2019s no toilet paper anywhere in town. She sends me a photo of empty shelves. Suddenly I\u2019m not laughing so much. The virus has barely touched the sides in Australia, and already people are panicking. I\u2019m panicking. Do I have serviettes they can use? Paper towels? Back issues of the New Yorker? After Cambodia I am due to fly to Sydney, to attend the Sydney writers\u2019 festival launch party and a 40th birthday. I arrange to work from both the Guardian\u2019s office and an office in Martin Place with a friend. Before I fly in from Cambodia, I get a message from another friend I\u2019m staying with in Sydney, saying that yeah sure it\u2019s still totally fine that I stay with her \u2026 she just needs to \u201cget advice\u201d. That\u2019s weird. Get advice? What sort of advice? The penny drops. I don\u2019t have it! I don\u2019t have the virus!! I would know! I can stay, I\u2019m not sick! My boss gets in touch. Can I please avoid the Guardian offices in Melbourne and Sydney for two weeks? I don\u2019t have it! I don\u2019t have it! I feel great! My immune system has been stressed and strengthened over the years by years of unsanitary behaviour. Like, if a chip falls on the floor, I will still eat it. Another friend in Sydney sends me an updated NSW Health advisory as I\u2019m about to get on the plane. \u201cYou need to go into quarantine!\u201d she says. I don\u2019t have it! I\u2019m not sick! I read the advisory more closely. It says travellers returning from Cambodia and Thailand are not required to socially isolate but to socially distance. Socially distance? What the hell is that? I cancel all my Sydney commitments and return to my house in the country (with toilet rolls purchased in Cambodia) and prepare for two weeks of social distancing \u2013 which means refraining from attending crowds and mass gatherings, keeping a distance of 1.5 metres between people, avoiding shaking hands, hugging and kissing and staying away from elderly and sick people. Sometimes I wonder why, as a very urban, extroverted person, I bought a house in the country on a dirt road, backing on to a forest with only three or four other houses in the street. But under social distancing guidelines my purchase is coming into its own. I must have been psychic! This house is the perfect quarantine station. Day one is a novelty. I sleep in and write from bed. I tweet. I read obsessively about the coronavirus. I set up a home gym and do laps at 2.30pm around a deserted oval while listening to podcasts about the virus (my usual yoga class and going to the gym is out). On the second day, the postman comes bearing an enormous box of wellness supplements to be trialled for a magazine story I\u2019m writing. I can just sit here, in the country, in my isolation with Cambodian toilet paper and survive off hundreds of dollars of expensive, celebrity endorsed supplements \u2013 and spend my days refreshing Twitter. Social distancing is fast beginning to lose its appeal. Later I try to cycle into town but my bike tyre is flat. It has a puncture. I can\u2019t even wheel it down the driveway. It\u2019s like \u201cthe universe\u201d is a co-conspirator in my social distancing. I walk into town and go to the supermarket after dark. It\u2019s pretty empty. I buy some food and manage to find it on a high shelf \u2013 an elusive four-pack of two-ply homebrand toilet paper. The following day, my elderly neighbour drops in. Bob is nearly 90 and it\u2019s not unusual for him to chill with me for two or three hours and complain about the state of my garden. Once when I was away, he chopped down two trees that were actually noxious weeds. \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d he asks. \u201cYou\u2019ve been away so long I thought you got married in Thailand.\u201d I tell him that I didn\u2019t get married in Thailand, that I am now back \u2013 but due to government health warnings I need to socially distance myself because I have travelled to Thailand and Cambodia. \u201cYou need to stay at least a metre away from me,\u201d I tell him hiding behind the door frame. Bob jumps back. He looks quite freaked out. \u201cI can tell just by looking at you that you\u2019re sick! You\u2019re all red in the face.\u201d Am I? I touch my face then remember I shouldn\u2019t touch my face. \u201cI\u2019m not sick. I\u2019m just being careful. It\u2019s called social distancing.\u201d Bob looks at the puncture in my tyre and says that he better not see me riding round town because, \u201cYou\u2019re under community surveillance now. I don\u2019t want you bringing the disease to these good people around here.\u201d Bob doesn\u2019t stick around. He tells me that I have his number: \u201cCall me if you\u2019re about to die.\u201d I go inside and look in the mirror. My face is not red. It\u2019s tanned. I\u2019ve got a tan! I Google \u201cred face\u201d and coronavirus. Is it a symptom? Dodging Bob, I leave the house to have coffee with a friend. For the last three years Brad has been teaching me how to drive. Every time we meet, we have a mini driving lesson. That is not on the cards today as the front seats in his car are not 1.5 metres apart. Now I go on a run (the faster I move, the less time there is to expose myself to people) to meet Brad. We sit 1.5 metres apart, on an outside table so any germs I may have can air dry. Brad tells me he thought twice about seeing me \u2013 and by meeting he was taking a risk. I tell him I\u2019m not sick and do not have the virus. \u201cI am taking these supplements and I ran here! I\u2019m OBSCENELY HEALTHY!\u201d Brad also tells me about the toilet paper situation in town. \u201cI bought some because I needed some. And I noticed everyone else in the line for the checkout also had toilet paper.\u201d Brad said the vibe was a bit shifty, because there had been so much media about toilet paper hoarding. \u201cThen I noticed there was a row of people standing outside the checkouts looking at all of us buying toilet paper!\u201d We murmur about how crazy the world is right now. Brad goes to pay for the coffees. I slide over $4. He looks at my money like it might be contaminated. \u201cFor godsakes, I don\u2019t have it!!!\u201d \u2022 Brigid Delaney is a Guardian Australia columnist",

An insistence that their style and philosophy \u2013 playing out from the back \u2013 is \u201cnon-negotiable\u201d is admirable, but the Lionesses defence seems to shudder whenever it is put under pressure, meaning that any team to press them high and hard as they attempt to move the ball out of their own half often forces mistakes. The determination of the manager to persist with Chelsea\u2019s Millie Bright and Manchester City\u2019s Steph Houghton as his No 1 centre-back pairing is a part of the problem. Both are hugely talented defenders, but together they lack pace and the latter has not looked at her best for her country this season. That told in the game against Spain, where Abbie McManus and Bright looked relatively solid, with arguably the Women\u2019s Super League\u2019s best ball-playing centre-back, or just best centre-back, Leah Williamson, shielding them. However, when Neville swapped Bright for Houghton things started to break down at the back. The full-backs are also a problem, with opposing teams able to swing in crosses way too easily.</p> <h2><strong>The kids are all right</strong></h2> <p>There was huge excitement when Neville announced his squad for the SheBelieves Cup with fresh young faces called into the fold, some for the first time. Manchester City\u2019s forward Lauren Hemp, despite her tender age of 19, was arguably the best player of England\u2019s tournament.

The Arsenal midfielder is crawling towards her pre-injury form and against Japan in particular, positioned behind England in a 4-4-1-1, Neville looked to have found a set-up that would get the best out of her. The youth may be the future of this England team but, at 27, Nobbs straddles the two generations and has the potential to be the figurehead of the team, the critical missing link between the middle of the park and their attack, going into Euro 2021 and the World Cup in 2023.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>The FA is not doing enough</strong></h2> <p>After defeat to Spain in Dallas, it is understood that Neville and the players were frustrated that the FA did not step in and charter a flight home due to the increasing threat posed by coronavirus \u2013 a move the governing body would likely have made for the men\u2019s team \u2013 instead sticking to existing travel plans that involved the players trekking through busy airports to fly back to the UK in business class.</p> <p>Although much of the blame for England\u2019s poor form, that has seen them fall to seven defeats in their past 11 games, lies at Neville\u2019s door, he is right to feel aggrieved at the gap in support between the men\u2019s senior side and the women\u2019s.

      "body": "<p>I was a remarkably strange, earnest, rule-abiding 10-year-old, so when we received a prank call to the house once, I didn\u2019t immediately realise it was happening. I don\u2019t think it hit me that it was a prank until I was deep into my 20s. I assumed that the voice on the other end of the phone asking, \u201cIs your washing machine running?\u201d was a representative of Hotpoint making a legitimate follow-up survey call after a vaguely recent purchase. I had to walk all the way downstairs to find my mum, who it turns out was in the bathroom, to ask her. I knocked on the door.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs the washing machine running?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat? I can\u2019t hear you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIS THE WASHING MACHINE \u2013\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2013 RUNNING?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWho wants to know?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMan on the phone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA man on the phone wants to know about our washing machine?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell tell him \u2018Yes\u2019 then!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOK.\u201d</p> <p>Then I trudged all the way upstairs again, to someone who had set out two minutes ago to make a harmless prank call and was now frantically coining 20p pieces into a public phone box to hear how this saga ended, and picked up the phone. \u201cShe says yes,\u201d I said, dutifully, and then, with the expectation of generations behind him, with a breath held for hours before him in anticipation, with the raw earthly power of the wind itself, he shouted: \u201cWELL BEST GET RUNNING AFTER IT THEN!\u201d and hung up. I was utterly, thoroughly owned.</p> <p>Solidarity, then, with the Artist Formerly Known As Prince Harry, who, it emerged this week, was allegedly the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/prince-harry-tricked-into-megxit-revelations-by-fake-greta-thunberg\" title=\"\">victim of a prank phone call</a> from Russia\u2019s Ant and Dec equivalent, <a href=\"https://monitoring.bbc.co.uk/product/c1dofhaw\" title=\"\">Vovan and Lexus</a> (Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexey Stolyarov). Actually, I suspect they are possibly more like Russia\u2019s <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2007/09/06/jk-and-joel-axed-in-radio-one-shake-up-114285/\" title=\"\">JK &amp; Joel</a>. Anyway, they somehow duped him into thinking he was on a conference call with Greta Thunberg and her father, Svante, twice over Christmas and New Year. The calls were released online this week and, honestly, they are \u2026 fine? They are less embarrassing than interrogating your mum about white goods, as a random example.</p> <p>Here a few selected excerpts. President Donald Trump has \u201cblood on his hands\u201d due to his continuing tubthumping of the US coal industry. Getting married into the royal family is \u201cnot all it\u2019s made out to be\u201d. Boris Johnson is a \u201cgood man, so you are one of few people who can reach into his soul and get him to feel and believe in you\u201d. On the Sussexes having a private jet habit: \u201cUnfortunately, there are very few alternatives\u201d. On Prince Andrew having a private jet habit: \u201cI have very little to say on that. But whatever he has done or hasn\u2019t done is completely separate from me and my wife.\u201d He rounded the phone call out by saying: \u201cI was in the military for 10 years, so I\u2019m more normal than my family would like to believe.\u201d Which I think is pushing it a bit. There are literally four career paths available to former members of the British army \u2013 bullish Apprentice contestant; murderer; hidden homeless ignored by the government; and Nervous Man At Public Fireworks Display. Harry has about a week and a half to decide which of them he is going to take up.</p> <p>Read the headlines on Harry taking a phone call in good faith from a prominent climate activist and proceeding to have a mild conversation that was so watertight it could\u2019ve run on The One Show as a \u201cbit\u201d and you would see it as an enormous \u201cGotcha!\u201d That Harry \u2013 who dared to leave a royal family he was never going to be the king of simply because existence within its ancient structures is deeply horrible \u2013 was a spoilt brat who, seconds after announcing his exit, let the artifice slip and started blabbing family secrets to anyone who could reach his incredibly secure line at his safe house in Canada. Or you might see it as an agenda pushed by a media that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/08/prince-harry-lambasts-press-over-meghan-markle-coverage\" title=\"\">got chided by the same man</a> for aggressively pushing a witch-hunt against his wife: I don\u2019t know. The cynic in me, though \u2013 the one born the second he put that phone down as a child, who in that moment learned never to believe anything again \u2013 thinks this is all an act.</p> <p>Think about it. Harry has left the royal family to a mixed response (you fall into one of two camps: you either think leaving an ancient institution on mental health and limelight-pressure grounds into a life of guaranteed wealth and family bliss is a good idea, or you Extremely Care About Whether The Taxpayer Still Funds His Security Detail). He needs a PR win. What better way to woo the young, hip, always-online crowd than by speaking their language, of YouTube pranks, diplomatic \u201csee all sides\u201d opinions about world leaders, sincere wife-guy expressions of love and all the right noises about the climate crisis? Being pranked by Russians was arguably the best thing he could have done for his career at this point.</p> <p>My only fear is that this will result in the remaining members of the royal family trying to get in on the \u201cspeaking the language of online\u201d trend, in a bid to out-Harry Harry. William tries to do the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6wkZincU14\" title=\"\">Say So TikTok dance</a> in front of an assembly full of year 6 children, or something. Kate Middleton does a lacklustre smoky-eye beauty tutorial. Prince Charles makes one of those vile Instagram cooking videos which consists of just his knobbly hands seen holding a tray of Duchy of Cornwall butter to melt it over an induction hob and then mixing it with ribboned hotdogs. Prince Andrew gets caught slowly licking his lips on Chaturbate. It\u2019s a perilous new era for Britain\u2019s favourite family. Let\u2019s see where they go with it.</p> <h2><strong>Tom\u2019s not tripping</strong><br></h2> <p>Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson, have become the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/tom-hanks-coronavirus-actor-and-wife-rita-wilson-test-positive-in-australia\" title=\"\">first A-list celebrities to test positive for coronavirus</a>. You have to assume there are various Hollywood-adjacent WhatsApp groups currently seething about this news: it\u2019s just so <em>Tom Hanks</em> of Tom Hanks to be the guy to get coronavirus, isn\u2019t it? First he has an entire career of impeccable award-winning acting. Then he is universally embraced as the ultimate nice guy, like one of those footballers who somehow goes their whole career without a single yellow card. And now he gets to be the first big coronavirus scalp while filming an Elvis biopic in Australia. That is just \u2026 so Hanksian, isn\u2019t it? He probably got it after too-close contact with an infected typewriter. Tom Hanks never stops being Tom Hanks, even for one second.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Chet Hanks\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

      "bodyText": "I was a remarkably strange, earnest, rule-abiding 10-year-old, so when we received a prank call to the house once, I didn\u2019t immediately realise it was happening. I don\u2019t think it hit me that it was a prank until I was deep into my 20s. I assumed that the voice on the other end of the phone asking, \u201cIs your washing machine running?\u201d was a representative of Hotpoint making a legitimate follow-up survey call after a vaguely recent purchase. I had to walk all the way downstairs to find my mum, who it turns out was in the bathroom, to ask her. I knocked on the door. \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cIs the washing machine running?\u201d \u201cWhat? I can\u2019t hear you.\u201d \u201cIS THE WASHING MACHINE \u2013\u201d \u201cYeah?\u201d \u201c\u2013 RUNNING?\u201d \u201cWho wants to know?\u201d \u201cMan on the phone.\u201d \u201cA man on the phone wants to know about our washing machine?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cWell tell him \u2018Yes\u2019 then!\u201d \u201cOK.\u201d Then I trudged all the way upstairs again, to someone who had set out two minutes ago to make a harmless prank call and was now frantically coining 20p pieces into a public phone box to hear how this saga ended, and picked up the phone. \u201cShe says yes,\u201d I said, dutifully, and then, with the expectation of generations behind him, with a breath held for hours before him in anticipation, with the raw earthly power of the wind itself, he shouted: \u201cWELL BEST GET RUNNING AFTER IT THEN!\u201d and hung up. I was utterly, thoroughly owned. Solidarity, then, with the Artist Formerly Known As Prince Harry, who, it emerged this week, was allegedly the victim of a prank phone call from Russia\u2019s Ant and Dec equivalent, Vovan and Lexus (Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexey Stolyarov). Actually, I suspect they are possibly more like Russia\u2019s JK &amp; Joel. Anyway, they somehow duped him into thinking he was on a conference call with Greta Thunberg and her father, Svante, twice over Christmas and New Year. The calls were released online this week and, honestly, they are \u2026 fine? They are less embarrassing than interrogating your mum about white goods, as a random example. Here a few selected excerpts. President Donald Trump has \u201cblood on his hands\u201d due to his continuing tubthumping of the US coal industry. Getting married into the royal family is \u201cnot all it\u2019s made out to be\u201d. Boris Johnson is a \u201cgood man, so you are one of few people who can reach into his soul and get him to feel and believe in you\u201d. On the Sussexes having a private jet habit: \u201cUnfortunately, there are very few alternatives\u201d. On Prince Andrew having a private jet habit: \u201cI have very little to say on that. But whatever he has done or hasn\u2019t done is completely separate from me and my wife.\u201d He rounded the phone call out by saying: \u201cI was in the military for 10 years, so I\u2019m more normal than my family would like to believe.\u201d Which I think is pushing it a bit. There are literally four career paths available to former members of the British army \u2013 bullish Apprentice contestant; murderer; hidden homeless ignored by the government; and Nervous Man At Public Fireworks Display. Harry has about a week and a half to decide which of them he is going to take up. Read the headlines on Harry taking a phone call in good faith from a prominent climate activist and proceeding to have a mild conversation that was so watertight it could\u2019ve run on The One Show as a \u201cbit\u201d and you would see it as an enormous \u201cGotcha!\u201d That Harry \u2013 who dared to leave a royal family he was never going to be the king of simply because existence within its ancient structures is deeply horrible \u2013 was a spoilt brat who, seconds after announcing his exit, let the artifice slip and started blabbing family secrets to anyone who could reach his incredibly secure line at his safe house in Canada. Or you might see it as an agenda pushed by a media that got chided by the same man for aggressively pushing a witch-hunt against his wife: I don\u2019t know. The cynic in me, though \u2013 the one born the second he put that phone down as a child, who in that moment learned never to believe anything again \u2013 thinks this is all an act. Think about it. Harry has left the royal family to a mixed response (you fall into one of two camps: you either think leaving an ancient institution on mental health and limelight-pressure grounds into a life of guaranteed wealth and family bliss is a good idea, or you Extremely Care About Whether The Taxpayer Still Funds His Security Detail). He needs a PR win. What better way to woo the young, hip, always-online crowd than by speaking their language, of YouTube pranks, diplomatic \u201csee all sides\u201d opinions about world leaders, sincere wife-guy expressions of love and all the right noises about the climate crisis? Being pranked by Russians was arguably the best thing he could have done for his career at this point. My only fear is that this will result in the remaining members of the royal family trying to get in on the \u201cspeaking the language of online\u201d trend, in a bid to out-Harry Harry. William tries to do the Say So TikTok dance in front of an assembly full of year 6 children, or something. Kate Middleton does a lacklustre smoky-eye beauty tutorial. Prince Charles makes one of those vile Instagram cooking videos which consists of just his knobbly hands seen holding a tray of Duchy of Cornwall butter to melt it over an induction hob and then mixing it with ribboned hotdogs. Prince Andrew gets caught slowly licking his lips on Chaturbate. It\u2019s a perilous new era for Britain\u2019s favourite family. Let\u2019s see where they go with it. Tom\u2019s not tripping Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson, have become the first A-list celebrities to test positive for coronavirus. You have to assume there are various Hollywood-adjacent WhatsApp groups currently seething about this news: it\u2019s just so Tom Hanks of Tom Hanks to be the guy to get coronavirus, isn\u2019t it? First he has an entire career of impeccable award-winning acting. Then he is universally embraced as the ultimate nice guy, like one of those footballers who somehow goes their whole career without a single yellow card. And now he gets to be the first big coronavirus scalp while filming an Elvis biopic in Australia. That is just \u2026 so Hanksian, isn\u2019t it? He probably got it after too-close contact with an infected typewriter. Tom Hanks never stops being Tom Hanks, even for one second. All the more odd, then, that his son Chet announced the news with a topless Instagram video in which Chet appears huge, hulking and tattooed like the back of a dollar bill, the leg day-skipping gym receptionist who ghosts you to end all other leg day-skipping gym receptionists who ghost you. He leads with: \u201cWhat\u2019s up everyone, uh, yeah, uh, it\u2019s true my parents got coronavirus. Crazy.\u201d If you are unfamiliar with Chet Hanks, I must urge you to swim deep down the rabbit hole of him over your next month of self-isolation: as a human being, he is fascinating; as the direct descendant of the world\u2019s nicest man, he is doubly so; as an example of how mind-bending it must be to grow up the son of one of the planet\u2019s most famous actors, he is a cautionary tale. He last made headlines for dropping a bizarrely competent patois accent at the Golden Globes (I won\u2019t transcribe the whole thing, but \u201cBig up, big up the whole island massive, it\u2019s your boy Chet coming straight from the Golden Globes\u201d features heavily). And now he is dropping Tom Hanks Health Updates in the form of Instagram thirst traps. I am obsessed. \u201cI just got off the phone with them,\u201d Chet concluded. \u201cThey both are fine, they\u2019re not even that sick. They\u2019re not worried about it, they\u2019re not tripping, but they\u2019re going through the necessary health precautions, obviously.\u201d Guys, please don\u2019t worry. Tom Hanks is not tripping. But if you are worried about him, please slide into Chet Hanks\u2019s DMs, where you will be welcomed warmly.",

      "body": "<p>Was the coronavirus engineered by Netflix? This was one of the wilder conspiracy theories doing the rounds earlier this month, as observers noted how the streaming giant\u2019s new docuseries <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81026143\" title=\"\">Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak</a> dropped into subscribers\u2019 menus just as the world was experiencing exactly the type of once-in-a-century outbreak it was warning against. Coincidence? Good timing? Massively implausible homicidal marketing strategy? \u201cWe hoped to inform before, not after, another dangerous pathogen emerged,\u201d explained Pandemic\u2019s producers.</p> <p>But now that the Covid-19 virus is disrupting global business and behaviour, streamers like Netflix seem to be in a fortunate position. Public gatherings are being discouraged or avoided, including cinema-going. High-profile releases are being postponed, such as the latest James Bond instalment, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/04/james-bond-no-time-to-die-november\" title=\"\">No Time to Die</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51822739\" title=\"\">Peter Rabbit 2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/12/quiet-place-part-ii-release-postponed-coronavirus-pandemic\">A Quiet Place Part II</a> and Fast &amp; Furious 9. People are being quarantined or self-isolating, which means they are trapped at home with hours to fill like never before. In other words, conditions are perfect for a marathon binge-watch.</p> <p>\u201cAmid fears over a global economic slowdown from the widening coronavirus outbreak, companies like Netflix that provide in-home services are best positioned to withstand the storm or even see upside from the crisis,\u201d reported Variety at the end of February, noting that while global stock markets plummeted, Netflix\u2019s share price had actually risen 0.8%. Similarly upbeat was Perry Sook, head of Nexstar, the largest owner of local TV stations in the US. \u201cIf it becomes more widespread in the US and there\u2019s more quarantining at home and all of that, it could potentially benefit our business because we\u2019d become the primary source of entertainment,\u201d he boasted on 4 March.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d25264994c61a404ac03079956a527eb534f811\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d25264994c61a404ac03079956a527eb534f811/0_0_4500_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Craig in No Time to Die\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No Time to Die ... the new Bond film\u2019s cinema release has been postponed in response to the coronavirus. Photograph: Nicole Dove/DANJAQ, LLC AND MGM.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nicole Dove/2019 DANJAQ, LLC AND MGM.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That was then. On 9 March the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 7.8% and media stocks were among the hardest hit. Nextstar lost nearly 14%. Other streaming giants that theoretically stood to gain from the pandemic also fell, due to liabilities elsewhere in their businesses.</p> <p>Disney, for example, is set to launch its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/01/disney-plus-coming-soon-to-uk-galaxy-netflix-challenge\" title=\"\">Disney+ streaming service</a> in the UK on 24 March \u2013 another case of suspiciously good timing. Disney+ offers a vast back catalogue of features from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, the Star Wars universe and National Geographic \u2013 just the thing to keep the young ones amused when the schools are shut, perhaps. The service went live in India this Wednesday, 18 days ahead of schedule. But any potential gains for Disney are offset by hits to its cinema business and especially its theme parks: both Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneylands have been closed since the end of January. There are fears its US parks could be next. On Monday, Disney shares fell 23% (they have recovered slightly since). Likewise Apple, whose iPhone manufacturing supply chains have been disrupted by the shutdown in China. As a \u201cpure play\u201d, solely concerned with the streaming business, Netflix has fared slightly better (its share price fell 6% on Monday), but the overall outlook is bleak: nobody is really \u201cbenefiting\u201d from a global economic downturn.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1296164639d3e4fa281e09c0f21fed2eb21d23d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1296164639d3e4fa281e09c0f21fed2eb21d23d1/0_0_2270_1362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cinema release postponed ...

Photograph: Columbia Pictures/Sony via AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Sony Pictures/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In addition, the \u201ccoronavirus is good for Netflix\u201d narrative doesn\u2019t bear close scrutiny, argues Laura Martin, senior entertainment analyst at New York-based Needham and Company: \u201cThe logic that just because somebody\u2019s staying in, that\u2019s good for everybody that does TV, that\u2019s simplistic.\u201d She points out that Netflix only makes money on its monthly subscription charges, so it makes no difference if a subscriber watches for one hour a day or 24. Nor does Martin see potential for attracting new subscribers: \u201cAwareness is already 100%.\u201d Added to which, people in the US and elsewhere might well have been suspended from work with no pay. \u201cIf you have to decide between food and your Netflix subscription, it seems to me like you disconnect your Netflix. You\u2019re probably not going to add another $13 a month if you don\u2019t know when your next pay check\u2019s going to come in.\u201d</p> <p>Whether or not the streaming giants profit in the short term, the coronavirus could still have long-term consequences for the industry. That has certainly been the case in China, where the pandemic first struck.

      "bodyText": "Was the coronavirus engineered by Netflix? This was one of the wilder conspiracy theories doing the rounds earlier this month, as observers noted how the streaming giant\u2019s new docuseries Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak dropped into subscribers\u2019 menus just as the world was experiencing exactly the type of once-in-a-century outbreak it was warning against. Coincidence? Good timing? Massively implausible homicidal marketing strategy? \u201cWe hoped to inform before, not after, another dangerous pathogen emerged,\u201d explained Pandemic\u2019s producers. But now that the Covid-19 virus is disrupting global business and behaviour, streamers like Netflix seem to be in a fortunate position. Public gatherings are being discouraged or avoided, including cinema-going. High-profile releases are being postponed, such as the latest James Bond instalment, No Time to Die, Peter Rabbit 2, A Quiet Place Part II and Fast &amp; Furious 9. People are being quarantined or self-isolating, which means they are trapped at home with hours to fill like never before. In other words, conditions are perfect for a marathon binge-watch. \u201cAmid fears over a global economic slowdown from the widening coronavirus outbreak, companies like Netflix that provide in-home services are best positioned to withstand the storm or even see upside from the crisis,\u201d reported Variety at the end of February, noting that while global stock markets plummeted, Netflix\u2019s share price had actually risen 0.8%. Similarly upbeat was Perry Sook, head of Nexstar, the largest owner of local TV stations in the US. \u201cIf it becomes more widespread in the US and there\u2019s more quarantining at home and all of that, it could potentially benefit our business because we\u2019d become the primary source of entertainment,\u201d he boasted on 4 March. That was then. On 9 March the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 7.8% and media stocks were among the hardest hit. Nextstar lost nearly 14%. Other streaming giants that theoretically stood to gain from the pandemic also fell, due to liabilities elsewhere in their businesses. Disney, for example, is set to launch its Disney+ streaming service in the UK on 24 March \u2013 another case of suspiciously good timing. Disney+ offers a vast back catalogue of features from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, the Star Wars universe and National Geographic \u2013 just the thing to keep the young ones amused when the schools are shut, perhaps. The service went live in India this Wednesday, 18 days ahead of schedule. But any potential gains for Disney are offset by hits to its cinema business and especially its theme parks: both Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneylands have been closed since the end of January. There are fears its US parks could be next. On Monday, Disney shares fell 23% (they have recovered slightly since). Likewise Apple, whose iPhone manufacturing supply chains have been disrupted by the shutdown in China. As a \u201cpure play\u201d, solely concerned with the streaming business, Netflix has fared slightly better (its share price fell 6% on Monday), but the overall outlook is bleak: nobody is really \u201cbenefiting\u201d from a global economic downturn. In addition, the \u201ccoronavirus is good for Netflix\u201d narrative doesn\u2019t bear close scrutiny, argues Laura Martin, senior entertainment analyst at New York-based Needham and Company: \u201cThe logic that just because somebody\u2019s staying in, that\u2019s good for everybody that does TV, that\u2019s simplistic.\u201d She points out that Netflix only makes money on its monthly subscription charges, so it makes no difference if a subscriber watches for one hour a day or 24. Nor does Martin see potential for attracting new subscribers: \u201cAwareness is already 100%.\u201d Added to which, people in the US and elsewhere might well have been suspended from work with no pay. \u201cIf you have to decide between food and your Netflix subscription, it seems to me like you disconnect your Netflix. You\u2019re probably not going to add another $13 a month if you don\u2019t know when your next pay check\u2019s going to come in.\u201d Whether or not the streaming giants profit in the short term, the coronavirus could still have long-term consequences for the industry. That has certainly been the case in China, where the pandemic first struck. Most of China\u2019s nearly 70,000 cinemas closed in late January \u2013 just before the Chinese new year holiday, traditionally the most lucrative box-office period. Major movie releases were cancelled. In response, one of them, local comedy Lost in Russia, sold its rights to local streaming platform Bytedance (which also owns the TikTok app), which streamed Lost in Russia for free. It was watched by 180 million viewers in its first three days. By comparison, China\u2019s all-time highest-grossing movie, Wolf Warrior 2, sold 159 million tickets. Western moviegoers are now accustomed to high-profile movies going straight to streaming, such as Netflix\u2019s releases of The Irishman and Marriage Story, but for China\u2019s booming industry, this was an unprecedented step. Another Chinese New Year movie, the Hong Kong-made Enter the Fat Dragon, made a similar streaming deal with iQiyi \u2013 China\u2019s answer to Netflix. (Netflix itself is unavailable in China except via illegal VPN). Now it\u2019s had a taste of streaming, China is unlikely to go back, says Elaine Yau, a Beijing-based journalist. Quarantined in their apartments, Chinese people have learned to love online viewing, whether that be new movies, cooking shows or livestreams of strangers doing banal indoor activities like sewing. \u201cPeople are getting bored,\u201d Yau says. \u201cMany people in China like going to the cinema, but they\u2019ve been getting into the habit of watching whatever they want, at their convenience, with no need to buy a ticket.

Last year the issue exploded when a Brazilian romance novelist was accused of plagiarising dozens of better-known writers. \u201cAmazon maintains content guidelines for the books we sell, and we continue to evaluate our catalogue, listening to customer feedback,\u201d the retailer said on Thursday. \u201cWe have always required sellers, authors, and publishers to provide accurate information on product detail pages, and we remove those that violate our policies. In addition, at the top of relevant search results pages we are linking to UK government advice where customers can learn more about the virus and protective measures.\u201d",

Every horse has two or three staff to accompany it, who will return to a country on lockdown on Friday evening.

The amateur has won this four times in the past 11 years and teams up again with Le Breuil, on whom he won the National Hunt Chase last year. He hasn\u2019t won this season but that was also true for nine of the last 12 Kim Muir winners.</p> <p>Deise Aba is probably ahead of the handicapper, following his Sandown win on just his fourth start over fences, though whether he is quite quick enough for this is open to question. Fingerontheswitch is having a grand season but is flying up the weights in consequence. Fitzhenry is a JP McManus horse who looks nicely treated on the best of his form, like his Troytown second.</p> <p>Champagne Platinum is a JP/Nicky Henderson horse who stayed on well at the end of the Scilly Isles to be third.

Always in the front rank, the Willie Mullins-trained nine-year-old held the late challenge of Saint Calvados to take Grade One honours under Paul Townend.</p> <p>Min, owned by Rich Ricci, was accompanied by Frodon up front in the early stages until last year\u2019s winner started to lose touch, although he kept going for fourth. Shattered Love and Aso were others unable to keep pace with Min, who turned up the tempo with Riders Onthe Storm falling three out when trying to get into contention. </p> <p>A Plus Tard laid it down to Min (2-1) from that point, but the 7-4 favourite could not find what was needed from the final fence. Saint Calvados was the last to challenge but the post came in time for Min, who crossed the line a neck to the good. A Plus Tard was a length and a half back in third.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd46b91a270160da831b250e1feffdaa733a6ae4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd46b91a270160da831b250e1feffdaa733a6ae4/0_0_4654_3103/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Townend and Min\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Townend celebrates winning the Ryanair Chase on board Min</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6a4e6f8f085f0b8d947410\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chriscook\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T15:00:57.481Z\">3.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Stayers' Hurdle (3.30) preview</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Paisley Park was a hugely popular winner last year and has not been beaten since, most recently pushing past Summerville Boy in the Cleeve here in January. Judging by last year, he\u2019ll be settled in midfield, which brings the risk of trouble in running, and his stable has been gradually dropping out of form since November. However, it\u2019s not always wise to pay attention to stable form when you\u2019re considering top-class horses, I\u2019ve found.</p> <p>Summerville Boy has not built on his Supreme win from two years ago but he ran well on his first try at this distance in the Cleeve and may have more to offer. City Island returns to hurdles for the first time since last season, when he beat Champ in the Ballymore. Emitom slogged through the Haydock mud to win the Rendlesham last month, but that hasn\u2019t been an influential trial.</p> <p>Penhill, the 2018 winner, seems to be working his way back to form. L\u2019Ami Serge has masses of talent but often would rather hide it under a bushel and would be the oldest winner since 1986. Apple\u2019s Jade also seems to have lost her enthusiasm for the game, though she ran to a high standard at Christmas and blinkers may help.

The 2018 Ballymore Novices\u2019 Hurdle winner has had a chequered career since that Festival highlight - but returned to his best in a finish that had just about everything.</p> <p>The pair battled it out up the famous hill and it could have gone either way, but in the end it was the Gordon Elliott-trained Samcro (4-1) who snatched the verdict on the line under Davy Russell.</p> <p>Faugheen - with the packed stands willing him on - was right behind the first two in third spot, with Mister Fisher fourth. Sent off the 3-1 favourite, Faugheen was away smartly, but Reserve Tank and Poker Play made the early running before Melon joined the leaders before the fifth fence.</p> <p>There was early drama when Itchy Feet blundered and unseated Gavin Sheehan at the sixth fence. Samcro travelled well and there was all to play for until Faugheen made a mistake three out that cost him ground at a crucial time.</p> <p>It left Samcro and Melon ahead of the pack with the former, wearing the Gigginstown House Stud colours, prevailing by a nose, as Faugheen rallied to be just another length behind.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89ee61cd4484996bf52597698ae12dd91ac6a272\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89ee61cd4484996bf52597698ae12dd91ac6a272/0_283_4108_2465/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cheltenham Festival 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samcro (left) and Melon leap the final fence side by side before fighting out a thrilling finish.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6a3d198f087df56e4c747f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T13:47:26.436Z\">1.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Grand National meeting under threat</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Racing is braced for an anticipated Government update as measures to tackle the coronavirus appear set to move to the \u201cdelay\u201d stage.</p> <p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson was expected to confirm the next policy move after a lunchtime Cobra meeting.

That required one of the great galvanising rides from Barry Geraghty, as well as first-time cheekpieces. Can Geraghty do it again, with the help of blinkers this time? Since the horse is 7lb higher, I doubt it.</p> <p>The Storyteller looks a stronger candidate from the same yard, that of Gordon Elliott. This one won a Festival handicap over fences two years ago and ran on well from the back to nick sixth in his qualifier. Relegate is also a Festival winner, in the Bumper of 2018, and should be sharper for her first run in a year, last month.</p> <p>Third Wind looks well treated on just 4lb higher for his Wincanton win on Boxing Day, when the free-running Jatiluwih was second. Kilbricken Storm, an Albert Bartlett winner, would be a welcome boost for the Colin Tizzard team. Everyone loves a Nicky Henderson runner just now and his unexposed improver Welsh Saint is proving popular.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6a3b588f085f0b8d94730b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T13:39:05.224Z\">1.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">JLT Novice Chase (1.30) result</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>1 Samcro (D N Russell) 4-1</strong><br>2 Melon (Mr P W Mullins) 14-1<br>3 Faugheen (P Townend) 3-1 Fav<br>12 ran<br><br></p> <p>Also: 7-1 Mister Fisher 4th<br>CSF: 55.73<br>Tricast: 195.46</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fddcc884318c995a37ccad5b3b0262238bb24c28\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fddcc884318c995a37ccad5b3b0262238bb24c28/0_0_3500_2382/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Davy Russell soaks up the applause as he and Samcro are lead into the Winners\u2019 Enclosure.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Davy Russell soaks up the applause as he and Samcro are lead into the Winners\u2019 Enclosure.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T13:50:51.086Z\">at 1.50pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e6a3ae78f08c2df6d2783ff\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T13:38:09.671Z\">1.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">JLT Novice Chase (1.30) 2m 4f</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Crikey, that is tight!

Admittedly, he was going well when he well at Fairyhouse in December but was he not beaten on merit when Faugheen left him 10 lengths behind at Christmas? I\u2019d say so and yet here we are. Good luck to the chestnut\u2019s many fans.</p> <p>The risk for Faugheen is that he had a hard race at Leopardstown last month and it\u2019s worth noting that the runner-up, Easy Game, ran no race in the RSA yesterday. Itchy Feet, third in last year\u2019s Supreme and the Scilly Isles winner, seems sure to go well.

The amateur has won this four times in the past 11 years and teams up again with Le Breuil, on whom he won the National Hunt Chase last year. He hasn\u2019t won this season but that was also true for nine of the last 12 Kim Muir winners.</p> <p>Deise Aba is probably ahead of the handicapper, following his Sandown win on just his fourth start over fences, though whether he is quite quick enough for this is open to question. Fingerontheswitch is having a grand season but is flying up the weights in consequence.</p> <p>Fitzhenry is a JP McManus horse who looks nicely treated on the best of his form, like his Troytown second. Champagne Platinum is a JP/Nicky Henderson horse who stayed on well at the end of the Scilly Isles to be third. He surely has more to offer and cheekpieces first time may get it out of him, along with the crack amateur Derek O\u2019Connor.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6a2a208f087df56e4c7389\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chriscook\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T12:27:05.067Z\">12.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Dawn Run Mares\u2019 Novice Hurdle (4.50) preview</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here\u2019s a funny thing, a race that has only ever been won by Willie Mullins (it\u2019s only been run four times) and yet some other trainer somehow has the favourite. Minella Melody occupies that position for Henry de Bromhead, having won a key trial in January, beating Colreevy. She is unbeaten over hurdles and looks classy.</p> <p>Concertista, whose odds halved to 5-1 during Wednesday, was beaten just a short-head in this race a year ago, her first start over hurdles. She was third in a big-field handicap last time, form which looks solid. Floressa represents the in-form Nicky Henderson and was a bit unlucky last time. Her November win at Newbury puts her in the argument.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8c1f89b1ba3e90b834cc64ad608269198a10e21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8c1f89b1ba3e90b834cc64ad608269198a10e21/0_249_2349_1610/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Willie Mullins\" width=\"1000\" height=\"685\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Willie Mullins has saddled all four winners of the Dawn Run Mares\u2019 Novice Hurdle</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Cooper/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6a29c78f08c2df6d27832d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chriscook\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T12:24:38.123Z\">12.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Brown Advisory Plate Handicap Chase (4.10) preview</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Simply The Betts is the obvious one, having improved so much as a chaser this term, and the form of his win here in January was boosted by the runner-up scoring here on Tuesday. Novices like him have a good record and have won this twice in the past three years.</p> <p>Happy Diva won the BetVictor here in November but has no secrets from the handicapper. Sirruh Du Lac made all to win this last year and may have had his excuses for a November flop, his only run since.</p> <p>La Bague Au Roi doesn\u2019t look badly treated for this switch to handicaps. Oldgrangewood is a strong finisher who seems likely to get the strong pace that he needs.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6a29358f08c2df6d27831b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chriscook\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T12:23:23.437Z\">12.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Stayers Hurdle (3.30pm) preview</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Paisley Park was a hugely popular winner last year and has not been beaten since, most recently pushing past Summerville Boy in the Cleeve here in January. Judging by last year, he\u2019ll be settled in midfield, which brings the risk of trouble in running, and his stable has been gradually dropping out of form since November. However, it\u2019s not always wise to pay attention to stable form when you\u2019re considering top-class horses, I\u2019ve found.</p> <p>Summerville Boy has not built on his Supreme win from two years ago but he ran well on his first try at this distance in the Cleeve and may have more to offer. City Island returns to hurdles for the first time since last season, when he beat Champ in the Ballymore. Emitom slogged through the Haydock mud to win the Rendlesham last month, but that hasn\u2019t been an influential trial.</p> <p>Penhill, the 2018 winner, seems to be working his way back to form. L\u2019Ami Serge has masses of talent but often would rather hide it under a bushel and would be the oldest winner since 1986. Apple\u2019s Jade also seems to have lost her enthusiasm for the game, though she ran to a high standard at Christmas and blinkers may help. Richard Johnson is a surprising booking, with Davy Russell unused.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"730c57bc9f2c5876977946b2b949150c8493f13f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/730c57bc9f2c5876977946b2b949150c8493f13f/0_0_3500_2313/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cheltenham Festival 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some racegoers takes a selfie during day three of the Festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Cooper/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6a28b18f08c2df6d278311\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chriscook\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T12:20:46.572Z\">12.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Ryanair Chase (2.50) preview</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A Plus Tard is back at the Festival, having hosed up in a handicap last year. He was last seen beating Chacun Pour Soi over Christmas, a fine effort even if the runner-up needed the outing. With the De Bromhead/Blackmore combination going well, he seems set to run another big race, but dangers abound.</p> <p>Frodon won this last year under a great front-running ride and returned to form last time. Min doesn\u2019t have to face Altior for the first time in four visits to the Festival. It seems timely to recall that he beat Politologue 20 lengths at Aintree last April.</p> <p>Duc Des Genievres has done little since winning a weak Arkle, while Riders Onthe Storm ought to be puggled after his Ascot race last month. Shattered Love is interesting at a big price, having won the Marsh two years ago. She lost her way after that but has had a couple of good moments this winter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d13e15500fd8fde6fb53b0de2afc7585963d5421\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d13e15500fd8fde6fb53b0de2afc7585963d5421/0_0_4500_3309/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cheltenham Festival 2020\" width=\"1000\" height=\"735\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lunch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Crowhurst/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6a28438f087df56e4c7362\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chriscook\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T12:18:30.419Z\">12.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Pertemps Final Handicap Hurdle (2.10) preview</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It\u2019s almost four years since Sire Du Berlais left France and the only race he has won in that time was this one, a year ago. That required one of the great galvanising rides from Barry Geraghty, as well as first-time cheekpieces. Can Geraghty do it again, with the help of blinkers this time. Since the horse is 7lb higher, I doubt it.</p> <p>The Storyteller looks a stronger candidate from the same yard, that of Gordon Elliott. This one won a Festival handicap over fences two years ago and ran on well from the back to nick sixth in his qualifier. Relegate is also a Festival winner, in the Bumper of 2018, and should be sharper for her first run in a year, last month.</p> <p>Third Wind looks well treated on just 4lb higher for his Wincanton win on Boxing Day, when the free-running Jatiluwih was second. Kilbricken Storm, an Albert Bartlett winner, would be a welcome boost for the Colin Tizzard team. Everyone loves a Nicky Henderson runner just now and his unexposed improver Welsh Saint is proving popular.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6a25b98f08c2df6d2782e6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/chriscook\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T12:16:52.867Z\">12.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preview: JLT Novice Chase (1.30) preview</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Oh my God, they\u2019re backing Samcro again. The horse who was once so hyped that Michael O\u2019Leary had to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/attheraces/status/937311929831383040?lang=en\">remind us he wasn\u2019t the second coming of Jesus Christ</a> looks like starting favourite for this, even though his only win in the past two years was a beginners chase in Down Royal.</p> <p>Admittedly, he was going well when he fell at Fairyhouse in December but was he not beaten on merit when Faugheen left him 10 lengths behind at Christmas? I\u2019d say so and yet here we are. Good luck to the chestnut\u2019s many fans. The risk for Faugheen is that he had a hard race at Leopardstown last month and it\u2019s worth noting that the runner-up, Easy Game, ran no race in the RSA yesterday. Itchy Feet, third in last year\u2019s Supreme and the Scilly Isles winner, seems sure to go well.</p> <p>Mister Fisher, only eighth in the Supreme, is steadily getting better over fences. In addition to Faugheen, Willie Mullins runs Melon, Tornado Flyer and Bapaume, so he has a fair chance of shaping the race.

But it jumped past the opening day in 2008, when the second day was lost to high winds, and has roared ahead in recent years, relegating Wednesday to a clear last place in attendance and, as often as not, pulling in the second-best crowd of the week behind Gold Cup day.</p> <p>It\u2019s only a hunch, but my guess would be that plenty of racegoers who can\u2019t handle (or afford) four days in Gloucestershire are coming for the last two days instead, and an afternoon like last year\u2019s Stayers\u2019 Hurdle day, when Bryony Frost and Frodon took the Ryanair and then Paisley Park landed the feature, can only persuade them that they\u2019ve got the balance right.</p> <p>Anyone who has been tempted to give Thursday a try by last year\u2019s excitement, meanwhile, will be delighted that today\u2019s card not only offers the chance of a repeat performance, but also has the added twist of the old favourite Faugheen, a former Champion Hurdle winner, attempting to win a Grade One novice chase at the age of 12.</p> <p>The Faugheen-Frodon-Paisley Park treble is currently on offer at around 55-1, so it\u2019s a big ask, but it might be worth a couple of pounds just in case.</p> <p>The action switches to the New course for the final two days, the sun is out at Cheltenham and the official going for this afternoon\u2019s card is soft, good-to-soft in places.

This year\u2019s Cheltenham Festival will continue as planned tomorrow despite the coronavirus pandemic, according to the organisers. Make of that what you will. Racing tends to live in its own little world at the best of times \u2013 for many of its fans, that is part of the attraction \u2013 but the sense of deliberate detachment can never have felt so strong as it will when a dozen horses head to post on Friday afternoon for the 92nd running of theCheltenham Gold Cup, writes Greg Wood from Cheltenham. In the space of a couple of hours on Thursday morning, in the wider world outside the Prestbury Park bubble, Spain suspended its football league for two weeks, McLaren pulled out of the Australian grand prix after a team member tested positive for Covid-19 and Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, announced the closure of all schools, colleges and childcare facilities in Ireland until 29 March and a ban on outdoor gatherings of more than 500 people. Ireland supplies seven of the runners of Friday\u2019s big-race field and 59 of the likely starters on the day as a whole. Every horse has two or three staff to accompany it, who will return to a country on lockdown on Friday evening. Yet as all this was happening elsewhere, the enclosures were filling with around 65,000 racegoers, many of whom will be back again on Friday on their annual pilgrimage to watch steeplechasing\u2019s championship event. Read on ... Horse racing in Ireland to take place behind closed doors It has been announced that horse racing in Ireland will take place behind closed doors until March 29th at the earliest. There will be no crowds or caterers at the courses and the number of grooms and trainers permitted at each meeting will be kept to the bare minimum.

The amateur has won this four times in the past 11 years and teams up again with Le Breuil, on whom he won the National Hunt Chase last year. He hasn\u2019t won this season but that was also true for nine of the last 12 Kim Muir winners. Deise Aba is probably ahead of the handicapper, following his Sandown win on just his fourth start over fences, though whether he is quite quick enough for this is open to question. Fingerontheswitch is having a grand season but is flying up the weights in consequence. Fitzhenry is a JP McManus horse who looks nicely treated on the best of his form, like his Troytown second. Champagne Platinum is a JP/Nicky Henderson horse who stayed on well at the end of the Scilly Isles to be third. He surely has more to offer and cheekpieces first time may get it out of him, along with the crack amateur Derek O\u2019Connor. 1 Concertista (D A Jacob) 9-2 2 Dolcita (R M Power) 9-1 3 Rayna\u2019s World (Thomas Dowson) 100-1 22 ran Also: 11-4 Fav Minella Melody, 20-1 Yukon Lil 4th CSF: 41.22 Tricast: 3651.61 Mares\u2019 Novices\u2019 Hurdle (4.50) 2m 1f Minella Melody continues to lead from Anna Bunina and Fort Worth Texas ... there\u2019s just one hurdle left to jump ...

Minella Melody occupies that position for Henry de Bromhead, having won a key trial in January, beating Colreevy. She is unbeaten over hurdles and looks classy. Concertista, whose odds halved to 5-1 during Wednesday, was beaten just a short-head in this race a year ago, her first start over hurdles. She was third in a big-field handicap last time, form which looks solid. Floressa represents the in-form Nicky Henderson and was a bit unlucky last time. Her November win at Newbury puts her in the argument. Richard Johnson is OK: According to ITV Racing, Richard Johnson got a lift back to the weigh room in a car and was able to walk from it to the sanctuary. \u201cI got a bit of a kicking but I\u2019m OK,\u201d he says. Both he, Lizzie Kelly and their respective mounts are fine, which is good news. A bad fall at the second last: Both Lizzie Kelly and Richard Johnson had very heavy falls at the penultimate hurdle, from Siruh Du Lac and La Bague Au Roi respectively. Lizzie, according to ITV, is back on her feet. Here\u2019s hoping Richard Johnson will be OK too. I think both their mounts are alright - more news as I get it. 1 Simply The Betts (G Sheehan) 10-3 Fav 2 Happy Diva (Richard Patrick) 20-1 3 Mister Whitaker (Adrian Heskin) 22-1 4 Oldgrangewood (Harry Skelton) 11-1 23 ran Non Runner: 10 Brown Advisory Plate (4.10) Siruh Du Lac and Lizzie Kelly continue to make the running with three to jump ...

They\u2019re off and racing in the fifth race of the day of the day and Siruh Du Lac is one of the early leaders with Simply The Betts. With 11 fences to go, the field is strung out. Old Grangewood and Robin De Foret are among the back-markers ... Oscar-winning performance in Stayers\u2019 Hurdle Lisnagar Oscar caused a 50-1 upset as reigning champion Paisley Park disappointed in the Paddy Power Stayers\u2019 Hurdle at Cheltenham. Making smooth progress on the near side, Lisnager Oscar hit the front before the final flight in the hands of Adam Wedge, to put trainer Rebecca Curtis back in the big time. Lisnagar Oscar galloped on strongly up the hill to hold the challenge of Ronald Pump (20-1) by two lengths, with Bacardys (33-1) a further three lengths away in third place. Apple\u2019s Jade had set a decent gallop and opened up a big led until she came back to the field after the third-last flight. The runners bunched up, with several horses in with a chance two out, but it was Lisnagar Oscar who proved strongest to claim the coveted prize. Last year\u2019s winner Paisley Park looked to be in trouble some way out and faded to finish seventh. \u201cUnbelievable, it\u2019s fantastic,\u201d said Wedge, the winning jockey. \u201cThe little horse has tried his heart out. I couldn\u2019t believe it when I hit the front, I was just praying he\u2019d keep galloping - he fought like a little lion up that hill.\u201d Brown Advisory Plate (4.10) betting Simply the Betts \u2013 10/3 Ben Dundee \u2013 11/1 Deyrann de Carjac \u2013 12/1 Oldgrangewood \u2013 12/1 Blazer \u2013 14/1 Robin Des Forest \u2013 16/1 Siruh Du Lac \u2013 16/1 La Bague Au Roi \u2013 16/1 Spiritofthegames \u2013 16/1 Not Another Muddle \u2013 20/1 Springtown Lake \u2013 20/1 Death Duty \u2013 20/1 Mister Whitaker \u2013 25/1 Happy Diva \u2013 28/1 Vision Des Flos \u2013 28/1 Livelovelaugh \u2013 40/1 Snow Falcon \u2013 40/1 Charmant \u2013 50/1 Highway One O One \u2013 66/1 Louis Van Pouch \u2013 66/1 Kauto Riko \u2013 70/1 Imperial Presence \u2013 90/1 Royal Village \u2013 100/1 View the market moves Simply The Betts is the obvious one, having improved so much as a chaser this term, and the form of his win here in January was boosted by the runner-up scoring here on Tuesday. Novices like him have a good record and have won this twice in the past three years. Happy Diva won the BetVictor here in November but has no secrets from the handicapper. Sirruh Du Lac made all to win this last year and may have had his excuses for a November flop, his only run since. La Bague Au Roi doesn\u2019t look badly treated for this switch to handicaps. Oldgrangewood is a strong finisher who seems likely to get the strong pace that he needs. 1 Lisnagar Oscar (Adam Wedge) 50-1 2 Ronald Pump (B J Cooper) 20-1 3 Bacardys (Mr P W Mullins) 33-1 15 ran Also: 4-6 Fav Paisley Park, 10-1 Emitom 4th CSF: 781.78 Tricast: 28381.06 Stayers\u2019 Hurdle (3.30) Lisnagar Oscar pulls off a huge shock in the Stayers\u2019 Hurdle.

Always in the front rank, the Willie Mullins-trained nine-year-old held the late challenge of Saint Calvados to take Grade One honours under Paul Townend. Min, owned by Rich Ricci, was accompanied by Frodon up front in the early stages until last year\u2019s winner started to lose touch, although he kept going for fourth. Shattered Love and Aso were others unable to keep pace with Min, who turned up the tempo with Riders Onthe Storm falling three out when trying to get into contention. A Plus Tard laid it down to Min (2-1) from that point, but the 7-4 favourite could not find what was needed from the final fence. Saint Calvados was the last to challenge but the post came in time for Min, who crossed the line a neck to the good. A Plus Tard was a length and a half back in third. Paisley Park was a hugely popular winner last year and has not been beaten since, most recently pushing past Summerville Boy in the Cleeve here in January. Judging by last year, he\u2019ll be settled in midfield, which brings the risk of trouble in running, and his stable has been gradually dropping out of form since November. However, it\u2019s not always wise to pay attention to stable form when you\u2019re considering top-class horses, I\u2019ve found. Summerville Boy has not built on his Supreme win from two years ago but he ran well on his first try at this distance in the Cleeve and may have more to offer. City Island returns to hurdles for the first time since last season, when he beat Champ in the Ballymore. Emitom slogged through the Haydock mud to win the Rendlesham last month, but that hasn\u2019t been an influential trial. Penhill, the 2018 winner, seems to be working his way back to form. L\u2019Ami Serge has masses of talent but often would rather hide it under a bushel and would be the oldest winner since 1986. Apple\u2019s Jade also seems to have lost her enthusiasm for the game, though she ran to a high standard at Christmas and blinkers may help. Richard Johnson is a surprising booking, with Davy Russell unused. 1 Min (P Townend) 2-1 2 Saint Calvados (G Sheehan) 16-1 3 A Plus Tard (Rachael Blackmore) 7-4 Fav 8 ran Also: 11-2 Frodon 4th CSF: 30.53 Tricast: 64.65 Ryanair Chase (2.50) 2m 5f If you backed Aso you can throw your ticket away.

Sire Du Berlais repeats Pertemps success Sire Du Berlais led home a Gordon Elliott one-two as he recorded back-to-back victories in the Pertemps Network Final Handicap Hurdle at Cheltenham. Continuing a fine Festival for Elliott as well as jockey Barry Geraghty and owner JP McManus, Sire Du Berlais (10-1) was revitalised by wearing blinkers for the first time. The Storyteller, Sire Du Berlais and Tout Les Permis jumped the last virtually together, and it was the first two from the Elliott stable who pulled away. Sire Du Berlais, carrying top-weight, got on top close home to land the spoils by half a length. Tout Les Permis was six and half lengths away in third place, with Third Wind fourth and Relegate a never-nearer fifth.

A Plus Tard is back at the Festival, having hosed up in a handicap last year. He was last seen beating Chacun Pour Soi over Christmas, a fine effort even if the runner-up needed the outing. With the De Bromhead/Blackmore combination going well, he seems set to run another big race, but dangers abound. Frodon won this last year under a great front-running ride and returned to form last time. Min doesn\u2019t have to face Altior for the first time in four visits to the Festival. It seems timely to recall that he beat Politologue 20 lengths at Aintree last April. Duc Des Genievres has done little since winning a weak Arkle, while Riders Onthe Storm ought to be puggled after his Ascot race last month. Shattered Love is interesting at a big price, having won the Marsh two years ago. She lost her way after that but has had a couple of good moments this winter. 1 Sire Du Berlais (B J Geraghty) 10-1 2 The Storyteller (D N Russell) 11-2 Jt Fav 3 Tout Est Permis (E Walsh) 12-1 4 Third Wind (T J O\u2019Brien) 12-1 24 ran Also: 11-2 Jt Fav Relegate CSF: 62.65 Tricast: 706.05 Pertemps Final Handicap Hurdle (2.10) 3m Kansas City Chief but Rapper takes over in front with The Storyteller making his move on the outside.

The 2018 Ballymore Novices\u2019 Hurdle winner has had a chequered career since that Festival highlight - but returned to his best in a finish that had just about everything. The pair battled it out up the famous hill and it could have gone either way, but in the end it was the Gordon Elliott-trained Samcro (4-1) who snatched the verdict on the line under Davy Russell. Faugheen - with the packed stands willing him on - was right behind the first two in third spot, with Mister Fisher fourth. Sent off the 3-1 favourite, Faugheen was away smartly, but Reserve Tank and Poker Play made the early running before Melon joined the leaders before the fifth fence. There was early drama when Itchy Feet blundered and unseated Gavin Sheehan at the sixth fence. Samcro travelled well and there was all to play for until Faugheen made a mistake three out that cost him ground at a crucial time. It left Samcro and Melon ahead of the pack with the former, wearing the Gigginstown House Stud colours, prevailing by a nose, as Faugheen rallied to be just another length behind. Racing is braced for an anticipated Government update as measures to tackle the coronavirus appear set to move to the \u201cdelay\u201d stage. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was expected to confirm the next policy move after a lunchtime Cobra meeting. The Cheltenham Festival continues into day three, with the showpiece Gold Cup scheduled on Friday, and has so far gone ahead - albeit with crowds slightly down on last year\u2019s record numbers, and hand-sanitiser stations in place on course to aid hygiene and mitigate spread of the virus. Racing in Ireland seems sure to be curtailed, however - perhaps with meetings taking place behind closed doors - after Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced the imminent closure of all schools and colleges and a ban on outdoor gatherings of 500 people or more, initially until March 29. Depending on the nature of new advice set to be issued by Government on Thursday, in British racing the focus is sure to switch next to the possiblilty of postponing next month\u2019s Grand National meeting at Aintree - or placing major crowd restrictions on it. It\u2019s almost four years since Sire Du Berlais left France and the only race he has won in that time was this one, a year ago. That required one of the great galvanising rides from Barry Geraghty, as well as first-time cheekpieces. Can Geraghty do it again, with the help of blinkers this time? Since the horse is 7lb higher, I doubt it. The Storyteller looks a stronger candidate from the same yard, that of Gordon Elliott. This one won a Festival handicap over fences two years ago and ran on well from the back to nick sixth in his qualifier. Relegate is also a Festival winner, in the Bumper of 2018, and should be sharper for her first run in a year, last month. Third Wind looks well treated on just 4lb higher for his Wincanton win on Boxing Day, when the free-running Jatiluwih was second. Kilbricken Storm, an Albert Bartlett winner, would be a welcome boost for the Colin Tizzard team. Everyone loves a Nicky Henderson runner just now and his unexposed improver Welsh Saint is proving popular. 1 Samcro (D N Russell) 4-1 2 Melon (Mr P W Mullins) 14-1 3 Faugheen (P Townend) 3-1 Fav 12 ran Also: 7-1 Mister Fisher 4th CSF: 55.73 Tricast: 195.46 Crikey, that is tight! Samcro wins in a photo by the shortest of short heads. Samcro wins the first under Davy Russell for trainer Gordon Elliott, who is in tears. JLT Novice Chase (1.30) 2m 4f Melon leads over the last from Samcro. Samcro pulls clear with Faugheen on the outside. Melon rallies close to the finish. It\u2019s a photo, but I think Melon has got up to win on the nod from Samcro. Faugheen was third. JLT Novice Chase (1.30) 2m 4f Two to jump and Melon continues to make the running from Faugheen. Samcro is making his move ... JLT Novice Chase (1.30) 2m 4f Melon leads the way from stable companion Faugheen, Reserve Tank is hogging the rail on the inside in a well grouped field. They\u2019re six from home ... Melon moves a couple of lengths clear ... JLT Novice Chase (1.30) 2m 4f Melon makes the running from Faugheen with a circuit to travel ... Itchy Feet is a faller and now running loose at the back of the field ... They\u2019re off and running in the Marsh Novices\u2019 Chase on Day Three of the Festival. Faugheen makes the running, followed by Reserve Thank, Mr Fisher and Melon ... The runners and riders are down at the start for the Marsh Novices\u2019 Chase, ahead of the day\u2019s first race. Good luck! JLT Novice Chase (1.30) betting Faugheen 7-2 Samcro 9-2 Itchy Feet 9-2 Mister Fisher 7-1 Tornado Flyer 12-1 Melon 14-1 Bapaume 20-1 22-1 bar Oh my God, they\u2019re backing Samcro again. The horse who was once so hyped that Michael O\u2019Leary had to remind us he wasn\u2019t the second coming of Jesus Christ looks like starting favourite for this, even though his only win in the past two years was a beginners chase in Down Royal. Admittedly, he was going well when he well at Fairyhouse in December but was he not beaten on merit when Faugheen left him 10 lengths behind at Christmas? I\u2019d say so and yet here we are. Good luck to the chestnut\u2019s many fans. The risk for Faugheen is that he had a hard race at Leopardstown last month and it\u2019s worth noting that the runner-up, Easy Game, ran no race in the RSA yesterday. Itchy Feet, third in last year\u2019s Supreme and the Scilly Isles winner, seems sure to go well. Mister Fisher, only eighth in the Supreme, is steadily getting better over fences. In addition to Faugheen, Willie Mullins runs Melon, Tornado Flyer and Bapaume, so he has a fair chance of shaping the race. The ex-French Saint Sonnet won easily at Catterick on his first start for Paul Nicholls but this is a huge step up. Already a winner at this Festival, Jamie Codd returns to the fray for what has been his most fruitful race. The amateur has won this four times in the past 11 years and teams up again with Le Breuil, on whom he won the National Hunt Chase last year. He hasn\u2019t won this season but that was also true for nine of the last 12 Kim Muir winners. Deise Aba is probably ahead of the handicapper, following his Sandown win on just his fourth start over fences, though whether he is quite quick enough for this is open to question. Fingerontheswitch is having a grand season but is flying up the weights in consequence. Fitzhenry is a JP McManus horse who looks nicely treated on the best of his form, like his Troytown second. Champagne Platinum is a JP/Nicky Henderson horse who stayed on well at the end of the Scilly Isles to be third. He surely has more to offer and cheekpieces first time may get it out of him, along with the crack amateur Derek O\u2019Connor. Here\u2019s a funny thing, a race that has only ever been won by Willie Mullins (it\u2019s only been run four times) and yet some other trainer somehow has the favourite. Minella Melody occupies that position for Henry de Bromhead, having won a key trial in January, beating Colreevy. She is unbeaten over hurdles and looks classy. Concertista, whose odds halved to 5-1 during Wednesday, was beaten just a short-head in this race a year ago, her first start over hurdles. She was third in a big-field handicap last time, form which looks solid. Floressa represents the in-form Nicky Henderson and was a bit unlucky last time. Her November win at Newbury puts her in the argument. Simply The Betts is the obvious one, having improved so much as a chaser this term, and the form of his win here in January was boosted by the runner-up scoring here on Tuesday. Novices like him have a good record and have won this twice in the past three years. Happy Diva won the BetVictor here in November but has no secrets from the handicapper. Sirruh Du Lac made all to win this last year and may have had his excuses for a November flop, his only run since. La Bague Au Roi doesn\u2019t look badly treated for this switch to handicaps. Oldgrangewood is a strong finisher who seems likely to get the strong pace that he needs. Paisley Park was a hugely popular winner last year and has not been beaten since, most recently pushing past Summerville Boy in the Cleeve here in January. Judging by last year, he\u2019ll be settled in midfield, which brings the risk of trouble in running, and his stable has been gradually dropping out of form since November. However, it\u2019s not always wise to pay attention to stable form when you\u2019re considering top-class horses, I\u2019ve found. Summerville Boy has not built on his Supreme win from two years ago but he ran well on his first try at this distance in the Cleeve and may have more to offer. City Island returns to hurdles for the first time since last season, when he beat Champ in the Ballymore. Emitom slogged through the Haydock mud to win the Rendlesham last month, but that hasn\u2019t been an influential trial. Penhill, the 2018 winner, seems to be working his way back to form. L\u2019Ami Serge has masses of talent but often would rather hide it under a bushel and would be the oldest winner since 1986. Apple\u2019s Jade also seems to have lost her enthusiasm for the game, though she ran to a high standard at Christmas and blinkers may help. Richard Johnson is a surprising booking, with Davy Russell unused. A Plus Tard is back at the Festival, having hosed up in a handicap last year. He was last seen beating Chacun Pour Soi over Christmas, a fine effort even if the runner-up needed the outing. With the De Bromhead/Blackmore combination going well, he seems set to run another big race, but dangers abound. Frodon won this last year under a great front-running ride and returned to form last time. Min doesn\u2019t have to face Altior for the first time in four visits to the Festival. It seems timely to recall that he beat Politologue 20 lengths at Aintree last April. Duc Des Genievres has done little since winning a weak Arkle, while Riders Onthe Storm ought to be puggled after his Ascot race last month. Shattered Love is interesting at a big price, having won the Marsh two years ago. She lost her way after that but has had a couple of good moments this winter. It\u2019s almost four years since Sire Du Berlais left France and the only race he has won in that time was this one, a year ago. That required one of the great galvanising rides from Barry Geraghty, as well as first-time cheekpieces. Can Geraghty do it again, with the help of blinkers this time. Since the horse is 7lb higher, I doubt it. The Storyteller looks a stronger candidate from the same yard, that of Gordon Elliott. This one won a Festival handicap over fences two years ago and ran on well from the back to nick sixth in his qualifier. Relegate is also a Festival winner, in the Bumper of 2018, and should be sharper for her first run in a year, last month. Third Wind looks well treated on just 4lb higher for his Wincanton win on Boxing Day, when the free-running Jatiluwih was second. Kilbricken Storm, an Albert Bartlett winner, would be a welcome boost for the Colin Tizzard team. Everyone loves a Nicky Henderson runner just now and his unexposed improver Welsh Saint is proving popular. Oh my God, they\u2019re backing Samcro again. The horse who was once so hyped that Michael O\u2019Leary had to remind us he wasn\u2019t the second coming of Jesus Christ looks like starting favourite for this, even though his only win in the past two years was a beginners chase in Down Royal. Admittedly, he was going well when he fell at Fairyhouse in December but was he not beaten on merit when Faugheen left him 10 lengths behind at Christmas? I\u2019d say so and yet here we are. Good luck to the chestnut\u2019s many fans. The risk for Faugheen is that he had a hard race at Leopardstown last month and it\u2019s worth noting that the runner-up, Easy Game, ran no race in the RSA yesterday. Itchy Feet, third in last year\u2019s Supreme and the Scilly Isles winner, seems sure to go well. Mister Fisher, only eighth in the Supreme, is steadily getting better over fences. In addition to Faugheen, Willie Mullins runs Melon, Tornado Flyer and Bapaume, so he has a fair chance of shaping the race. The ex-French Saint Sonnet won easily at Catterick on his first start for Paul Nicholls but this is a huge step up. Top jockeys after day two Barry Geraghty 3 Nico De Boinville 1 Mark Walsh 1 Jamie Codd 1 Paul Townend 1 Rachael Blackmore 1 Harry Skelton 1 David Bass 1 Aidan Coleman 1 Jonathan Plouganou 1 Brendan Powell 1 Davy Russell 1 Barry Geraghty hasn\u2019t been top jockey here since 2012 but he\u2019s well on his way, considering three winners was enough to win it last year. This is already his best Festival since 2014 (Jezki, O\u2019Faolains Boy, More Of That). Paul Townend finally got one on the board after knocking on the door with form figures of 4F4233P. Still, Davy Russell\u2019s form figures here this week are better: 20214245. Rachael Blackmore had three rides on Wednesday and was second twice. Top jockey betting: Barry Geraghty Evens Paul Townend 4-1 Rachael Blackmore 11-2 Davy Russell 13-2 Nico de Boinville 10-1 Mark Walsh 14-1 Aidan Coleman 25-1 Top trainers after day two Nicky Henderson 4 wins Gordon Elliott 3 Henry de Bromhead 2 Willie Mullins 1 Paul Nicholls 1 Kim Bailey 1 David Bridgwater 1 David Cottin 1 Britain 7 Ireland 6 France 1 Nicky Henderson has managed three Grade One wins already this week and that\u2019s even with Altior being lame. Santini in the Gold Cup is the shortest priced of his remaining runners. Gordon Elliott has got himself another Festival handicap and he\u2019s also had five placed runners in the handicaps so far. Willie Mullins has found it tougher going but, for him, there\u2019s always the Bumper. He\u2019s saddled five favourites in the 14 races so far and they were all turned over. Top trainer betting: Gordon Elliott Evens Nicky Henderson 11-8 Willie Mullins 5-1 Henry de Bromhead 16-1 Paul Nicholls 33-1 Furlongs, fancy hats \u2013 and a few face masks \u2013 for Ladies\u2019 Day at the Cheltenham Festival. This great gallery of shots including some from colleague Tom Jenkins at the races is well worth a look ... 1.30 Marsh Novice Chase Faugheen (nb) 9-2 2.10 Pertemps Handicap Hurdle Relegate 13-2 2.50 Ryanair Chase A Plus Tard 7-4 3.30 Stayers Hurdle City Island 12-1 4.10 Brown Advisory Plate Handicap Chase Simply The Betts (nap) 7-2 4.50 Mares Novice Hurdle Concertista 5-1 5.30 Kim Muir Handicap Chase Just A Sting 33-1 This could be the day when Ireland asserts, or at least I\u2019m hoping so, having put them down for wins in both the centrepieces races and three others as well. Simply The Betts is proving popular after we all saw the form boosted by Imperial Aura on Tuesday. Concertista halved in price during Wednesday, which was a bit disappointing but shows the market isn\u2019t completely sold on Minella Melody. I\u2019m surprised there\u2019s not more interest in Just A Sting, given that he was a popular choice the last day in what used to be the Racing Post Chase. Congratulations to FillyManilli, who won Wednesday\u2019s competition on a final score of +17, having picked Ferny Hollow (11-1), Champ (4-1) and Politologue (6-1). Robertkeen was second on +16, a valiant effort. Filly, we\u2019ll be in touch with you by email about your prize towards the end of the week. You could win a \u00a3100 account credit from Betfair by proving your tipping prowess on today\u2019s races. All you have to do is give us your selections for all of today\u2019s races at Cheltenham. As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional stakes of \u00a31 at starting price on each tip. Non-runners count as losers. Please post all your tips in a single posting, using the comment facility below, before the first race at 1.30pm. There are seven races at Cheltenham today and you must post a single selection for each race. Our usual terms and conditions, which you can read here, will apply, except that this will be a strictly one-day thing. If we get a tie after all the races have been run, the winner will be the one who posted their tips earliest out of those with the highest score. If an entrant has to repost their selections because of a non-runner, we will use the time of their later posting for tiebreak purposes. If you don\u2019t win today, don\u2019t despair. You\u2019ll have one more shot at our Cheltenham competition tomorrow (Friday). The third day of the Festival felt a little like the meeting\u2019s poor relation when it moved from three days to four in 2005, and for a few years, Thursday was the least popular of the week in terms of attendance. But it jumped past the opening day in 2008, when the second day was lost to high winds, and has roared ahead in recent years, relegating Wednesday to a clear last place in attendance and, as often as not, pulling in the second-best crowd of the week behind Gold Cup day. It\u2019s only a hunch, but my guess would be that plenty of racegoers who can\u2019t handle (or afford) four days in Gloucestershire are coming for the last two days instead, and an afternoon like last year\u2019s Stayers\u2019 Hurdle day, when Bryony Frost and Frodon took the Ryanair and then Paisley Park landed the feature, can only persuade them that they\u2019ve got the balance right. Anyone who has been tempted to give Thursday a try by last year\u2019s excitement, meanwhile, will be delighted that today\u2019s card not only offers the chance of a repeat performance, but also has the added twist of the old favourite Faugheen, a former Champion Hurdle winner, attempting to win a Grade One novice chase at the age of 12. The Faugheen-Frodon-Paisley Park treble is currently on offer at around 55-1, so it\u2019s a big ask, but it might be worth a couple of pounds just in case. The action switches to the New course for the final two days, the sun is out at Cheltenham and the official going for this afternoon\u2019s card is soft, good-to-soft in places. Chris Cook\u2019s tips for the seven races are here \u2013 including a 14-1 pick to beat Paisley Park \u2013 and the action is under way at 1.30pm GMT.",

Health workers would no longer test people for the virus in their homes, but would continue to test people already in hospitals, where the risk of contagion is higher and the impact more serious. He said the most dangerous period was \u201csome weeks away\u201d and the intention with delay was to increase the ability of the emergency services and society more widely to cope. When enthusiasm for measures started to flag, people were less vigilant, he told reporters. He said people with even mild symptoms should stay at home for a week and that the advice could soon become stricter. \u201cAt some point in the next few weeks we are likely to go further, and if someone in a household has those symptoms then we will be asking everyone in that household to stay at home. I want to signal now that this is coming down the track.\u201d He ended with an upbeat message, saying the country had faced challenges before and \u201cwill get through this\u201d. Announcing Scotland\u2019s decision to ban public gatherings of more than 500 people earlier on Thursday afternoon, Nicola Sturgeon said it was not based on scientific evidence, which suggests it will not have a significant impact on the spread of the virus, but would help for consistency of messaging and to alleviate pressure on the emergency services being stretched by the pandemic. Whitty said the UK would not be introducing social distancing measures yet as it was not the right moment within the pandemic. Ireland moved to close schools and colleges on Thursday morning to try to halt the spread of the virus. On Wednesday, Donald Trump decided to ban citizens from 26 European countries from entering the US for the next 30 days. Britain and Ireland are exempt from the ruling because they are not in the Schengen border-free travel agreement. No 10 said on Thursday the government had no plans for the UK to follow the US. \u201cIt\u2019s not the current position of the UK, based on medical and scientific advice, that we should halt flights,\u201d the spokesman said. Downing Street has so far judged that the disruption that would be caused by blanket school shutdowns, for example, would outweigh the benefits in terms of slowing the spread of the disease. However, some health experts have questioned whether the government has acted aggressively enough to contain the virus. Richard Horton, the editor of the Lancet, has argued that social distancing measures should have been taken earlier, claiming the government was \u201cplaying roulette with the public\u201d. Contingency planning is under way to enable Brexit talks with the EU to continue next week. This could involve phone or video calls. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said there was no change to the timetable and June was still the point at which the UK government would walk away from negotiations if it could not secure a Canada-style trade deal.",

      "bodyText": "Uefa is considering postponing the European Championship until 2021 as it attempts to deal with the escalating coronavirus pandemic. European football\u2019s governing body will meet stakeholders on Tuesday to discuss a series of proposals aimed at solving the growing disruption of the calendar due to Covid-19, with the prospect of Euro 2020 being delayed for a year among the options being considered. It is understood that all options are on the table at this stage, including the possibility that the format of the 24-team tournament could be altered or scrapping some of the 12 venues across the continent. Rome is due to host the opening match between Italy and Turkey on 12 June, with Wembley hosting seven matches including the final on 12 July. Both Bosnia-Herzegovina and Slovakia have requested that this month\u2019s play-off matches, against Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland respectively, be postponed. The two football associations face playing the games with decimated squads should they proceed as planned. Also under discussion at the video-conference of the 55 national associations will be how to resolve the fixture backlog in the Champions League and Europa League, with the second legs of Real Madrid\u2019s tie against Manchester City and Juventus against Lyon next week having already been postponed indefinitely. That followed the postponement of Sevilla v Roma and Internazionale v Getafe in Thursday night\u2019s Europa League schedule, with Uefa set to consider whether it will be possible to continue with the competitions in their current format or reduce the ties to a single leg on a neutral ground. La Liga\u2019s decision to suspend action in the Spanish top flight for \u201cat least the next two rounds of matches\u201d came after one of the players in Real\u2019s basketball team tested positive for the virus, leaving all activity at the club\u2019s Valdebebas training ground suspended with immediate effect. It was followed by the Dutch Eredivisie, Portugal\u2019s Primeira Liga and USA\u2019s Major League Soccer, while the Danish FA has decided to stop all football activities in the country until 29 March. \u201cThe men\u2019s friendly matches against the Faroe Islands in Herning on 27 March and against England at Wembley on 31 March are expected to be canceled,\u201d read a statement. \u201cClarified with Uefa.\u201d England are also due to face Italy in a friendly on 27 March at Wembley. Wales\u2019s friendly against the United States on 30 March has been postponed and the Football Association of Ireland has announced all football activity under its jurisdiction has been suspended until 29 March. That came after a directive from the Irish government that all outdoor gatherings of more than 500 people should be cancelled. Similarly, a number of Scottish sporting events are set to be postponed or played behind closed doors following an announcement by the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, that she would recommend the cancellation of gatherings of more than 500 people from Monday. That would mean Sunday\u2019s Old Firm clash between Rangers and Celtic in the Premiership could go ahead as planned. Meanwhile, the Premier League has insisted that matches will go ahead this weekend in line with new directives from the government despite three Leicester City players having been isolated from the rest of the squad after displaying flu-like symptoms. Uefa\u2019s position is complicated by the already congested calendar, with the women\u2019s European Championship due to take place next summer in England from 11 July to 1 August, as well as Fifa\u2019s newly expanded Club World Cup in China. There is a possibility that the women\u2019s tournament could also be postponed for a year in order to accommodate any changes. A statement read: \u201cIn the light of the ongoing developments in the spread of Covid-19 across Europe \u2026 Uefa has today invited representatives of its 55 member associations, together with the boards of the European Club Association and the European Leagues and a representative of FIFPro, to attend meetings by video-conference on Tuesday 17 March to discuss European football\u2019s response to the outbreak.\u201d It has also been confirmed that Andrea Agnelli, the Juventus chairman who chairs the powerful European Club Association, is in quarantine after one of the Serie A team\u2019s players \u2013 defender Daniele Rugani \u2013 tested positive for the virus this week.",

We are all entering a new world as the Covid-19 pandemic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\" title=\"\">takes hold</a>. Many more families in the UK will lose loved ones, the prime minister has warned: while 590 cases have been identified, officials say the true number is probably between 5 and 10,000. The government has now moved from trying to contain the outbreak, to seeking to delay it. It says it is doing so on the advice of experts. Yet there are questions about whether its policy is adequate. The editor of the medical journal the Lancet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/richardhorton1/status/1238145139840778241\" title=\"\">describes it as complacent</a>.

But it is governments who determine the context in which they operate, and who steer the public response. Around the world, authorities are being forced to make difficult and complex decisions in this crisis. Mass quarantines of the kinds seen in Wuhan, China and Italy, may not be the only or even the best approach; it appears aggressive testing and contact tracing with some social distancing measures have been effective in countries including Singapore and <a href=\"https://asiatimes.com/2020/03/why-are-koreas-covid-19-death-rates-so-low/\" title=\"\">South Korea</a> (which has been testing 20,000 people a day).</p> <p>Yet the UK appears to have disregarded lessons from elsewhere, and be set on another course. It will no longer test those not sick enough to be in hospital, simply relying on those who feel unwell to stay at home for a week (a much shorter period than other places have imposed). Its focus on urging those with flu-like symptoms to self-isolate comes as new research suggests that most Covid-19 infections may be spread by people who have caught it but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-most-infections-spread-by-people-yet-to-show-symptoms-scientists\" title=\"\">not yet developed symptoms</a>.</p> <p>It is essential that governments follow expert medical advice and give clear instructions. While some have done exemplary work, others are failing. The complacency and erratic nature of the American response has been shocking and frightening. A ban on almost all foreigners flying from most European countries does nothing to address its existing outbreak. On top of systemic problems such as healthcare coverage and the lack of statutory sick pay, there is a glaring shortage of testing, even for those at clear risk: the number of US cases is likely far higher than declared. Donald Trump maximised the damage by misrepresenting his own plan, leaving the public confused, and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-secrecy-exclusive-idUSKBN20Y2LM\" title=\"\">classifying coronavirus discussions</a>.

We are all learning more about the seriousness of this situation and hopefully people can continue to educate themselves and realize that they need to behave responsibly both for their own health and for the well being of those around them. I appreciate the authorities in Oklahoma who were helpful with the testing process and everyone from the @utahjazz who have been so supportive.

I have gone through so many emotions since learning of my diagnosis\u2026mostly fear, anxiety, and embarrassment.  The first and most important thing is I would like to publicly apologize to the people that I may have endangered.  At the time, I had no idea I was even infected.  I was careless and make no excuse.  I hope my story serves as a warning and causes everyone to take this seriously.  I will do whatever I can to support using my experience as way to educate others and prevent the spread of this virus .  I am under great care and will fully recover.  Thank you again for all your support.  I encourage everyone to take all of the steps to stay safe and healthy.

      "bodyText": "A second player for the NBA\u2019s Utah Jazz tested positive for Covid-19, the team confirmed on Thursday, a day after the league said it was suspending the season until further notice amid the global coronavirus outbreak. The team did not disclose the player\u2019s identity but Utah\u2019s All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell confirmed the report on Instagram and thanked everyone who had reached out to him since hearing about his positive test. The news came one day after Rudy Gobert reportedly became the first player in the league to test positive for the virus, prompting the cancellation of Wednesday\u2019s Jazz game in Oklahoma City moments before tip-off. Once the test result became known the game was called off. \u201cWe are working closely with the CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), Oklahoma and Utah state officials, and the NBA to monitor their health and determine the best path moving forward,\u201d the team said in a statement. An ESPN report on Wednesday had stated Jazz players said Gobert showed a \u201ccavalier attitude toward the virus\u201d with his teammates, touching them and their belongings. That report appeared to be corroborated by a video that went viral on Monday night where Gobert jokingly touched all of the reporters\u2019 microphones following a media availability. Jazz guard Evan Fournier on Wednesday said he had spoken to Gobert and that his fellow Frenchman was doing well. \u201cWas just on the phone with Rudy. He is doing good man. Let\u2019s not panic everyone. Love you all,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. Later Thursday, Gobert, an All-Star center and two-time Defensive Player of the Year, apologized for his \u201ccareless\u201d actions in exposing others to the virus, expressing his hope that his \u201cstory serves as a warning and causes everyone to take this seriously\u201d. The NBA said it will use the hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic. Players from teams that the Jazz have played in the past 10 days were told to self-quarantine, ESPN reported. Those teams are the Cleveland Cavaliers, New York Knicks, Boston Celtics, Detroit Pistons and Toronto Raptors, the ESPN report added. Mitchell thanked authorities in Oklahoma who administered tests to the Jazz organization for being supportive. \u201cWe are all learning more about the seriousness of this situation and hopefully people can continue to educate themselves and realize that they need to behave responsibly both for their own health and for the well being of those around them,\u201d he wrote on Instagram. \u201cI am going to keep following the advice of our medical staff and hope that we can all come together and be there for each other and our neighbors who need our help.\u201d The NBA playoffs were scheduled to start on 18 April with the finals set to begin on 4 June.",

      "bodyText": "Glastonbury is pressing ahead with preparations for its 50th anniversary year despite coronavirus fears, announcing a wave of more than 90 artists including Friday-night headliner Kendrick Lamar. The festival is still scheduled to take place 24-28 June in its usual home of Worthy Farm, Somerset. At 15 weeks away, it would happen just after when Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, placed the likely peak of the outbreak in the UK during a Downing Street press conference today, at 10 to 14 weeks. Emily Eavis, who heads Glastonbury festival along with her father Michael, said they were still \u201cworking hard\u201d to deliver it, and were announcing the lineup \u201cafter much consideration given the current circumstances, and with the best of intentions \u2026 No one has a crystal ball to see exactly where we will all be 15 weeks from now, but we are keeping our fingers firmly crossed that it will be here at Worthy Farm for the greatest show on Earth!\u201d Earlier this week, the festival put out a statement to say its team was \u201cclosely monitoring developments\u201d in the spread of the disease. The UK government is not currently planning to ban large-scale events, though Boris Johnson has warned of future events being cancelled because of the burden they would place on emergency services. In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon has brought in a ban on gatherings of over 500 people to come into force on Monday. If Glastonbury does go ahead, headlining the Other stage will be Pet Shop Boys, Dua Lipa and Fatboy Slim, though their respective days have not been announced. Other newly announced artists include major pop stars Camila Cabello, Mabel, Burna Boy and Robyn; soul legends the Isley Brothers and Candi Staton; and 90s indie-rockers Manic Street Preachers, Primal Scream, Supergrass, Lightning Seeds, and Noel Gallagher with his band High Flying Birds, who will play the Pyramid stage set before headliner Paul McCartney on the Saturday night. Thom Yorke brings his Tomorrow\u2019s Modern Boxes electronic solo work, while Radiohead bandmember Ed O\u2019Brien performs solo as EOB, billings that will spark hopes for a secret Radiohead set (Yorke and Radiohead guitarist Jonny Greenwood performed a secret set together in 2010). Another regular Glastonbury visitor, Jarvis Cocker, will appear with his band Jarv Is. AJ Tracey, whose verse on his track Thiago Silva went viral at Glastonbury 2019 when performed by bucket-hatted teenager Alex Mann, will appear along with other British rappers including Dizzee Rascal, Aitch and Kano. From further afield will be the Avalanches, Herbie Hancock, Seun Kuti, Tinariwen, Black Uhuru and the re-formed Crowded House, who will appear as part of their first tour since 2011. Brazilian singer-songwriter Gilberto Gil, 77, lived at Worthy Farm during his exile in the UK in 1970, and played the very first festival that year \u2013 he will return to perform with four generations of his family. They all join the previously announced headliners Paul McCartney and Taylor Swift, plus Diana Ross playing the Sunday teatime \u201clegend\u201d slot, and Lana Del Rey, who is scheduled to play the set before Lamar on the Pyramid stage. Lamar will be the fourth rapper to headline the Pyramid stage, following Jay-Z, Kanye West and Stormzy, whose 2019 set was widely hailed as one of the greatest ever. Lamar recently announced a new company, pgLang, described by his business partner Dave Free as \u201cfocused on cultivating raw expression from grassroots partnerships\u201d, and he is expected to release new music this year. Further names will be announced closer to the festival.

The official number of confirmed cases is 596.<br></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson confirmed that the UK was now moving out of the \u201ccontain\u201d phase and into the \u201cdelay\u201d phase for dealing with the epidemic.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is now not just to attempt to contain the disease as far as possible, but to delay its spread and thereby minimise the suffering. If we delay the peak even by a few weeks, then our NHS will be in a stronger state as the weather improves and fewer people suffer from normal respiratory diseases, more beds are available and we\u2019ll have more time for medical research. We can also act to stretch the peak of the disease over a longer period so that our society is better able to cope.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said that people with a fever or a new, persistent cough were now being asked to stay at home for seven days.</strong> He also said schools were being advised to cancel overseas trips, and the over-70s and the ill were being told to avoid cruises. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>From tomorrow, if you have coronavirus symptoms, however mild -- either a new continuous cough or a high temperature -- then you should stay at home for at least 7 days to protect others and help slow the spread of the disease. We advise all those over 70 and those with serious medical conditions against going on cruises and we advise against international school trips. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that at some point in the future the government would go further, and ask all family members to stay at home if someone was ill.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At some point in the next few weeks we are likely to go further and if someone in a household has those symptoms then we will be asking everyone in that household will stay at home.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also said that at some point in the future the elderly would be asked to stay away from places or people to avoid infection. He did not give details.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said at the moment he was not planning to ban sporting events, but he said this was being kept under review.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are considering the question of banning major public events such as sporting fixtures. And the scientific advice, as we\u2019ve said over the last couple of weeks, is that banning such events will have little effect on the spread but there\u2019s also the issue of the burden that such events can place on public services.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In a mild dig at Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister who is planning to cancel events with crowds of more than 500 people from next week and whose decision to announce the results of the Cobra meeting before Johnson angered some in No 10, Johnson said that Scotland might have a particular issue with the resilience of its emergency services. He implied that that was why the Scots needed a different policy. Vallance said cancelling sporting events could be counterproductive. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On average, one person infects two or three others.</p> \n   <p>You therefore have a very low probability of infecting a large number of people in a stadium and a rather higher probability of infecting people very close to you.</p> \n   <p>And that means that most of the transmission actually tends to take place with friends and colleagues and those in close environments - and not in the big environments.</p> \n   <p>Though it is true that any cancellation of things can have some effect, if you then get a displacement activity where you end up with everyone congregating somewhere else, you may actually perversely have an increased risk, particularly in an indoor environment.</p> \n   <p>So it doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t at some point make the decision from a resilience point but this is not a major way to tackle this epidemic.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson defended his decision not to introduce measures as draconian as those being introduced in some other other countries.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The measures that I have discussed today... staying at home if you think you have the symptoms, your whole household staying at home, looking after the elderly - making sure the elderly and vulnerable stay at home - these are the three most powerful defensive lines.</p> \n   <p>We think it\u2019s very important to maintain public trust and confidence in what we are doing, throughout this challenging time, always to be guided by the best possible scientific advice.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He and his advisers also argued that, if self-isolation measures were introduced too early, they would be ineffective - because people would ignore them at the point where they were most necessary.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Whitty said he thought the overall mortality rate from Covid-19 was around 1% or less.</strong> It was higher for older people, and people in the vulnerable group, and lower for others, he said. But he said he did not want to speculate on who many people might die from the illness because he said the scientists just did not know how many people are infected. He said, although an 80% infection rate was the government\u2019s top reasonable worst case scenario, nowhere in the world was currently coming close to an infection level like that.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Vallance said that the outbreak in the UK could be about four weeks behind the outbreak in Italy. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Vallance said the peak of the epidemic in the UK was \u201csomething like 10 to 14 weeks away\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s all from me for today.</p> \n  <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6a7aaf8f087df56e4c77e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T18:21:06.369Z\">6.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Nigel Farage critique of Boris Johnson (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/12/trumps-travel-ban-wont-have-much-impact-on-spread-of-coronavirus-says-rishi-sunak-live-news?page=with:block-5e6a79788f08c2df6d278784#block-5e6a79788f08c2df6d278784\">6.08pm)</a> is still very much a minority view at Westminster.

But there\u2019s a catch, or rather two. First, if you look at day-to-day spending on public services per head, it is no higher than it was in 2009-10 (because the population has got bigger). And, second, if you take out health, which received a sizeable, long-term spending increase under Theresa May, real-terms spending on everything else is lower than at the end of the Labour government, both overall (7% lower) and per person (14% lower).</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be3d989cc63d9d4035285161238d9319379939ce\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be3d989cc63d9d4035285161238d9319379939ce/0_0_938_692/500.jpg\" alt=\"Real-terms public spending figures.\" width=\"500\" height=\"369\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Real-terms public spending figures.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IFS</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>But the IFS also says these figures are potentially misleading, for two reasons. First, they include the \u00a311bn a year that the UK will save because it won\u2019t have to make annual payments to the EU - but they do not take into account the \u00a37-8bn a year that the EU used to spend in the UK. And, second, they include an extra \u00a35.5bn a year that the government is spending because of changes to the rules on employer pension contributions. The IFS argues that taking out these figures allows for a more reliable comparison with the past, and on that basis it has produced a chart with adjusted figures (see below).</p> \n  <p>On this measure, day-to-day public spending in real terms will still be higher in 2024-25 than in 2009-10, but only 5% higher, not 9% higher. But day-to-day spending per person ends up being 4% lower in 2024-25 in real terms than in 2009-10, overall spending excluding health is 12% lower, and spending per person excluding health is 19% lower.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b7e823ec34da069481ab0d7c1aeb734b08b2e24\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b7e823ec34da069481ab0d7c1aeb734b08b2e24/0_0_946_703/500.jpg\" alt=\"Real-terms public spending figures - adjusted\" width=\"500\" height=\"372\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Real-terms public spending figures - adjusted</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IFS</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6a58268f087df56e4c75e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T15:42:49.500Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Sturgeon is now taking questions.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What sort of gatherings do you want to cancel?</em></p> \n  <p>Ones that put pressure on emergency services, she says.

For example, the second decile will ultimately be \u00a32,900 a year worse off (on average) than if welfare policy had remained unchanged, with \u00a3900 of that still to come as a result of welfare policies still being rolled out. </p> \n   <p>Welfare cuts have been somewhat offset (in aggregate) by tax cuts. Successive cuts to income tax, through increases in the personal allowance and higher-rate threshold, have been followed in this budget by an increase in the starting point for national insurance, as well as repeated fuel duty freezes. But these changes have been of most benefit \u2013 in cash terms \u2013 to the top half of the income distribution, though this has been tempered at the very top by tax increases targeted at the richest tenth of the population.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dce2e891de391d34268cb33e03c1bb28ecdf1b08\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dce2e891de391d34268cb33e03c1bb28ecdf1b08/0_0_649_510/500.jpg\" alt=\"Distributional impact analysis of tax and benefit changes since 2015.\" width=\"500\" height=\"393\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Distributional impact analysis of tax and benefit changes since 2015.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Resolution Foundation</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T13:26:24.243Z\">at 1.26pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6a33228f08c2df6d2783a6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kate-proctor\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T13:05:35.612Z\">1.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>President Trump did not contact Boris Johnson directly before his decision to ban citizens from 26 EU countries from entering the US for the next 30 days, No 10 has said.

He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The US is still deciding the details of what exactly that means, but you are right. As I talked about yesterday, there will be an impact on the demand side of our economy as people are unable to spend in the way they normally would and travel, but it also affects the supply chains for businesses and that impacts the supply side of our economy.</p> \n   <p>As those supply chains are disrupted, the productive capacity of our economy will shrink for a period of time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He dismissed claims that his spending plans were irresponsible. </strong>He said: </li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I make absolutely no apology for responding in the short term in scale to the immediate threat that we face from coronavirus.</p> \n   <p>I think that\u2019s the right thing to do for the economy. We need to help businesses have a bridge to get to the other side.</p> \n   <p>In the medium term, as you will see from the figures, there is actually responsible economic management and it\u2019s because we\u2019ve had responsible economic management for several years that I\u2019m able to stand here in a strong position to say that we will do whatever it takes to get through this.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that his measures were compatible with the fiscal rules set out in the Conservative manifesto.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He laughed off suggestions that he had delivered a Gordon Brown budget, or a Labour budget</strong>. When LBC\u2019s Nick Ferrari put this to him, Sunak laughed, and said he would let others make that judgment.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He suggested that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s resignation as Labour leader was holding up the announcement of plans for reform of social care. </strong>When asked about the absence of social care from the budget, he said that Matt Hancock, the health secretary, wrote to MPs last week <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/health-and-care/news/110410/matt-hancock-kicks-cross-party-talks-social-care-crisis-letter\">proposing cross-party talks starting in May.</a> When it was put to him that the government was taking a long time, particularly since Boris Johnson claimed to have a plan for social care last summer, Sunak replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is no permanent leader of the opposition at the moment. They\u2019re having a leadership contest, so we can\u2019 formally start that process until they have one.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Sunak defended his decision not to extend sick pay to cover the low-paid and the self-employed.</strong> In the budget he said that people in these categories would instead find it easier to claim benefits as a result of rules being relaxed during the coronavirus outbreak. This morning he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>For those that don\u2019t [have access to statutory sick pay] we\u2019ve strengthened the working of our welfare system so that it works quicker, more responsibly and more generously for those people.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also claimed that around half of workers who needed to take time off would get more than statutory sick pay because their employers offered more generous arrangements.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He sidestepped a question about whether he and his family would be able to live on \u00a390 a week.</strong> Statutory sick pay is worth \u00a394.25 per week. Asked whether that was enough to live on, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have strengthened our safety net to make sure we have access to benefits easier, quicker, more generously, and also provided an extra \u00a3500m to local authorities to distribute to vulnerable people and their local communities if they need extra support. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When pressed on whether he could live on this himself, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is a safety net. That is what it\u2019s there for, to provide people to fall back on. It\u2019s obviously not the same as your day-to-day life</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He defended his decision not to include nurseries in the list of companies that will qualify for a one-year exemption from business rates.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51843971\">The nursery sector has been horrified by the decision</a>. Asked why they were not included, Sunak said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Because what we\u2019ve done on business rates is target the sectors of the economy which are in the consumption side of the economy, which will see a very significant hit because of people\u2019s inability to spend. And what we wanted to do is make sure that they don\u2019t go out of business during that period of time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He accepted that his plans involved making an assumption about the cost of borrowing remaining low, but it was a judgment he defended.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You have to make a judgment about the persistence of low interest rates, that\u2019s a judgment I have to make as chancellor.</p> \n   <p>The reality is these interest rates have stayed lower for longer than anyone expected and keep falling, and it\u2019s right that I as someone in charge of managing our public finances has a view on that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0562573b5aa4ed8b8417232293950b28bd3faf1\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0562573b5aa4ed8b8417232293950b28bd3faf1/0_147_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rishi Sunak visiting a building project at Leeds station this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rishi Sunak visiting a building project at Leeds station this morning.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T10:56:06.488Z\">at 10.56am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6a00d18f087df56e4c7207\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T09:29:35.590Z\">9.29am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Stock markets around the wall are down following President Trump\u2019s travel ban announcement.

      "bodyText": "Here are the main points from the news conference. Boris Johnson was joined by Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser. Johnson said that Britain was facing the \u201cworst public health crisis for a generation\u201d and that \u201cmany more\u201d people would die. (See 5.52pm.) In a marked change of tone from his previous press conferences and interviews on this subject, he explained that Britons were going to face considerable disruption to ordinary life over the next few months as the government introduced measures to delay and limit the spread of Covid-19. Johnson said the true number of coronavirus cases in the population was probably \u201cmuch higher\u201d than official figures suggest. He said: The number of cases will rise sharply, indeed the true number of cases is higher - perhaps much higher - than the number of cases we have so far confirmed with tests. Vallance said he thought the actual number of people infected in the UK at the moment could be between 5,000 and 10,000. The official number of confirmed cases is 596. Johnson confirmed that the UK was now moving out of the \u201ccontain\u201d phase and into the \u201cdelay\u201d phase for dealing with the epidemic. He said: This is now not just to attempt to contain the disease as far as possible, but to delay its spread and thereby minimise the suffering. If we delay the peak even by a few weeks, then our NHS will be in a stronger state as the weather improves and fewer people suffer from normal respiratory diseases, more beds are available and we\u2019ll have more time for medical research. We can also act to stretch the peak of the disease over a longer period so that our society is better able to cope. Johnson said that people with a fever or a new, persistent cough were now being asked to stay at home for seven days. He also said schools were being advised to cancel overseas trips, and the over-70s and the ill were being told to avoid cruises. He said: From tomorrow, if you have coronavirus symptoms, however mild -- either a new continuous cough or a high temperature -- then you should stay at home for at least 7 days to protect others and help slow the spread of the disease. We advise all those over 70 and those with serious medical conditions against going on cruises and we advise against international school trips. He said that at some point in the future the government would go further, and ask all family members to stay at home if someone was ill. He said: At some point in the next few weeks we are likely to go further and if someone in a household has those symptoms then we will be asking everyone in that household will stay at home. He also said that at some point in the future the elderly would be asked to stay away from places or people to avoid infection. He did not give details. He said at the moment he was not planning to ban sporting events, but he said this was being kept under review. He said: We are considering the question of banning major public events such as sporting fixtures. And the scientific advice, as we\u2019ve said over the last couple of weeks, is that banning such events will have little effect on the spread but there\u2019s also the issue of the burden that such events can place on public services. In a mild dig at Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister who is planning to cancel events with crowds of more than 500 people from next week and whose decision to announce the results of the Cobra meeting before Johnson angered some in No 10, Johnson said that Scotland might have a particular issue with the resilience of its emergency services. He implied that that was why the Scots needed a different policy. Vallance said cancelling sporting events could be counterproductive. He explained: On average, one person infects two or three others. You therefore have a very low probability of infecting a large number of people in a stadium and a rather higher probability of infecting people very close to you. And that means that most of the transmission actually tends to take place with friends and colleagues and those in close environments - and not in the big environments. Though it is true that any cancellation of things can have some effect, if you then get a displacement activity where you end up with everyone congregating somewhere else, you may actually perversely have an increased risk, particularly in an indoor environment. So it doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t at some point make the decision from a resilience point but this is not a major way to tackle this epidemic. Johnson defended his decision not to introduce measures as draconian as those being introduced in some other other countries. He said: The measures that I have discussed today... staying at home if you think you have the symptoms, your whole household staying at home, looking after the elderly - making sure the elderly and vulnerable stay at home - these are the three most powerful defensive lines. We think it\u2019s very important to maintain public trust and confidence in what we are doing, throughout this challenging time, always to be guided by the best possible scientific advice. He and his advisers also argued that, if self-isolation measures were introduced too early, they would be ineffective - because people would ignore them at the point where they were most necessary. Whitty said he thought the overall mortality rate from Covid-19 was around 1% or less. It was higher for older people, and people in the vulnerable group, and lower for others, he said. But he said he did not want to speculate on who many people might die from the illness because he said the scientists just did not know how many people are infected. He said, although an 80% infection rate was the government\u2019s top reasonable worst case scenario, nowhere in the world was currently coming close to an infection level like that. Vallance said that the outbreak in the UK could be about four weeks behind the outbreak in Italy. Vallance said the peak of the epidemic in the UK was \u201csomething like 10 to 14 weeks away\u201d. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. The Nigel Farage critique of Boris Johnson (see 6.08pm) is still very much a minority view at Westminster. That could change very quickly, of course, and it was noticeable that the questions posed by the media at the press conference this afternoon were a bit more hostile than at the press conference on Monday, or the one he did on Tuesday last week. But the opposition parties have been broadly supportive of the government\u2019s approach, and some YouGov polling last week (pdf) said more people thought Johnson was handling this well (49%) than badly (32%). Some of the journalists who watched the press conference were reasonable impressed. Here is some reaction. From Sky\u2019s Adam Boulton From the Financial Times\u2019 Jim Pickard From the Guardian\u2019s former political editor Michael White From the Sun\u2019s Tom Newton Dunn This is from Nigel Farage. This Brexit party that he leads is, for the moment, politically irrelevant, but he has made a successful career out of stirring up populist grievances against establishment wisdom, and now he seems to be putting himself at the front of the campaign to denounce Boris Johnson as complacent. Here is a tweet from the health department with a link to a web page giving the government\u2019s new \u2018stay at home\u2019 advice in full for anyone with coronavirus symptoms. This is what Boris Johnson said at the start of his press conference. In a marked change of tone from the previous press conferences and interviews he has given on this subject, he said that this was the worst public health crisis for a generation and that \u201cmany more\u201d people would die. He said: It\u2019s clear that coronavirus Covid-19 continues and will continue to spread across the world and our country over the next few months. We\u2019ve done what can be done to contain this disease, and this has bought us valuable time, but it\u2019s now a global pandemic. The number of cases will rise sharply, indeed the true number of cases is higher - perhaps much higher - than the number of cases we have so far confirmed with tests. We\u2019ve all got to be clear, this is the worst public health crisis for a generation. Some people compare it to seasonal flu, alas that is not right. Due to the lack of immunity this disease is more dangerous. It is going to spread further and I must level with you, I must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time. Full summary coming soon. Johnson is winding up now. He ends by repeating the point about how if anyone has a high temperature, or a new and continuous cough, they should stay at home. That is the way to \u201csquash the sombrero\u201d, he says, referring to the graph illustrating the peak (see below). And that\u2019s it. I will post a summary and reaction shortly. Q: How confident are we in the data? Johnson says some countries are having some success in greatly reducing the incidence of the disease. He says there are measures that could be taken of a draconian nature. But that might just lead to the disease surging back, he says. Whitty says there are some things we are very confident of, like the mortality rate. But we don\u2019t know how many people get the disease without symptoms. He says, depending on what the answer to that is, the disease has very different outcomes. Q: When do you think older people will be asked to stay at home? And how old is old? Vallance says the peak is probably 10 to 14 weeks away, maybe longer. Even to cover the peak, you would need to ensure that those sorts of measures would be in place for 12 or 13 weeks or so. Whitty say people may get individual advice from their GP. But national guidance will also be issued at the appropriate time, he says. Q: What do you mean by people volunteering? Johnson says he hopes people will think of their neighbours, and consider what they can do to help them. The advice is not to go within two metres of them. Vallance says the behavioural science says, at times like this, you see an outbreak of altruism. Q: You said we were four week behind Italy. Might we have to introduce Italian-style measures? Vallance says the UK may be four weeks behind in terms of the scale of the outbreak. You would expect it to follow a similar trajectory in terms of numbers.. What they are proposing today are measures to deflect that, he says. Q: Are you planning any register to help people volunteer? Johnson says Matt Hancock is setting up a system for people who want to come back to the NHS to offer their services. Q: Some workers will not be covered by our statutory sick pay issue. Could you extend SSP? Johnson says the government is changing benefits rules. It will do everything necessary to ensure people are not penalised for doing the right thing. Q: Are you worried about getting it yourself? You have to meet a lot of people in your job. And who would step in if you were incapacitated? Johnson just says he is washing his hands. Johnson asks Vallance to address the point about whether stopping flights is effective. Vallance says, when they looked at this in reduction to China, they thought at best stopping flights would delay the disease by a day or two. And he says screening at airports sound sensible. But in the US the first case went through screening. On sports events, he says a single individual on average infects two or three others. That means there is a very low probability of infecting a large number of people in a studium. Most infection takes places when people are with friends, not when they are in large groups. That means, perversely, banning large events could be counter-productive. He says the way to fight this is to reduce infection across households and across people who are affected. Q: Can you understand why people watching this will think you are doing little, when they look at the kind of things happening in Ireland? Johnson says he is guided by the best scientific advice. Q: The German chancellor said 70% of people could get this. Do you agree? And how many people might die? Vallance says getting people to stay at home will give you a 20 to 25% reduction in the peak. And he says isolating the elderly can reduce the death rate by about 30%, he says. He says it is important not to go to things that sound sensible, but have little effect. And you don\u2019t want to introduce measures that only apply for a week or two, he says. To be effective, these measure will have to last longer. Whitty says closing schools has big knock-on effects for the whole of society. On numbers, Whitty says he has been absolute level with the public on numbers on which he has confidence. He says his top planning assumption is 80% of people getting the illness. He says he and Vallance agree on a mortality rate of 1% - which would be higher for vulnerable groups, and lower for other groups. But he says what he does not want to do is give a figure for how many people have been affected. He says he does not want to do that because he does not know the numbers. Whitty says asking people to stay at home with minor symptoms sounds easy. But in practice it will be harder for people than they think. Johnson is now taking questions. Q: How sure are you that your approach is right? Johnson says he is guided by science in everything he does. He returns to the point about elderly people. He says you need to time the period of isolation for them at the point where they are most at risk. He says in Scotland there is a particular issue with the resilience of public services. In the UK this issue will have to be kept under review too, he says. He says the UK government is not saying no to the sort of measure announced by Nicola Sturgeon. (See 12.57pm.) Whitty says the government is also looking at mitigation measures. First, that involves reducing the peak. And, second, that involves increasing the capacity of the NHS. Whitty says, at the next stage, the government will want to introduce social distancing measures for people who are vulnerable or who have underlying conditions. But it is too early to recommend that, he says. He says this would lead to other problems, like loneliness. But at some point it will be necessary to do this, he says. And Whitty says there will now no longer by any geographical limits to testing. Whitty says there are other changes too. The government no longer needs to identify every case, he says. People staying at home will not need testing. Testing will focus on people in hospitals with symptoms. Whitty says it is important that people with mild symptoms do not call 111. But if their conditions deteriorate, they should seek medical help. Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, is speaking now. He says the contain phase is over, and the government is moving on to the delay phase. All four chief medical officers have agreed to raise the risk level to high. He says it is important not to ask people too early to respond. There is a danger of fatigue. Washing hands is very important, he says. He says, from today, the government is asking people who have a persistent cough which is new, or a temperature, to stay at home for seven days. It is important to explain why, he says. First, he says this reduces the risk to older people and people with underlying conditions. Second, he says this can reduce the peak. And, third, this can delay the peak, he says. He says they have chosen seven days because the illness is most infectious at the beginning. He says the evidence suggests that people with mild symptoms can spread the disease to a lot of people. Vallance says the timing is critical: if you tell people to stay at home too early, they get fed up with this at the point where you need them to stay at home. On closing schools, he says for this to be effective, closures would have to last from 13 to 16 weeks. He says children would, in practice, keep mixing with each other during that period. And they might get sent to stay with grandparents, which could increase the risk, he says. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, is speaking now. This is a new disease, he says. He says no one has immunity to it. He says it looks as if the UK is on a trajectory about four weeks behind Italy. He shows a slide showing a peak. This shows the pattern of an infection, he says. He says it starts with very low numbers. He says the number of infections at the moment is likely to be between 5,000 and 10,000. Then the number of infections rise steeply, he says. He says the government wants to do two things: to delay the peak, and to push the peak down. He says delaying the peak pushes it into the summer, when respiratory diseases are less common. He says it is not possible to stop everyone getting it. And it is not desirable either, he says. He says you want people to pick up immunity. He says the disease seems to come in two phases: an early, mildish phase, and then a second phase, where the elderly and people with underlying conditions are vulnerable. Johnson says he wants to address older people in particular. For most people this is a mild illness, but he knows they are vulnerable. He says he wants to tell them that the government will do all it can \u201cto help you and your family\u201d. The government is not just helping the economy, he says. He says he wants to stress that it is helping families. He says he wants to end with two familiar messages. First, it is vital to wash your hands. And, second, the country will get through this, just as it has got through other situations like this. Johnson says this will cause disruption across the country for many months. He says he wants to urge people not to call 111, but to use the internet to get information if they can. Johnson says he is not closing schools now. He says the advice is that his could do more harm than good. But the situation may change, he says. Johnson says the government is considering banning large events. He says that won\u2019t necessarily reduce the spread. But that would ease the pressure on the emergency services, he says. Johnson says tomorrow, if you have coronavirus symptoms, you should stay home for at least seven days. He says people over 70 with underlying medical conditions are being advised to avoid going on cruises. And he says schools are being advised to cancel overseas trips. Boris Johnson is starting his press conference. He says he has just chaired a Cobra meeting. They have done what they can to contain coronavirus, he says. The true number of cases is higher, \u201cperhaps much higher\u201d, than the figures suggest, he says. He says this is the worst public health crisis for a general. It is much more serious than flu, he says. He goes on: More families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time. The Telegraph\u2019s science editor Sarah Knapton has a read-out from the measures being announced by the government. Boris Johnson is about to hold a press conference to announce the decisions taken by the Corbra emergency committee this afternoon. He will appear alongside Prof Chris Whitty, the government\u2019s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser. The Electoral Commission is saying that this year\u2019s local elections should be postponed. The final decision is up to the government, but it would be embarrassing for ministers to ignore the commission\u2019s advice on this issue. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s successor as Labour leader will now be announced at a scaled-back event as the party postpones and alters meetings due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Press Association reports. The PA story goes on: Labour said that the final leadership hustings of the race was being cancelled, while the party\u2019s Welsh conference and Scottish women\u2019s conference were being postponed. The party said the \u201cwellbeing of our members and staff\u201d and contributing to the \u201ccollective effort to protect public health\u201d were behind the decision. The winner of the race between Sir Keir Starmer, Rebecca Long-Bailey and Lisa Nandy will still be announced on 4 April as planned, but it will no longer be at a \u201cspecial conference\u201d. Labour\u2019s decision was announced shortly after the UK moved on to the next stage of its response to Covid-19, with potential restrictions being imposed to delay the spread of the disease. A Labour spokeswoman said: \u201cIn light of the spread of coronavirus, Labour has cancelled the leadership elections special conference scheduled for 4 April. \u201cThe results of the leadership and deputy leadership elections will be announced at a scaled-back event on the same date and we are now considering options for what form that event will take. \u201cThis is not a decision we have taken lightly. Our priority is the wellbeing of our members and staff, and ensuring we fully contribute to the collective effort to protect public health.\u201d The final hustings was due to take place in Tottenham, north London, on Saturday and focus on black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) issues. Party officials were also considering whether constituency meetings should go ahead. Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s decision to announce the outcome of today\u2019s Cobra meeting before Boris Johnson (see 3.33pm) has gone down badly with London, BuzzFeed\u2019s Alex Wickham reports. Earlier I quoted the Institute for Fiscal Studies saying yesterday\u2019s budget was less generous on current spending than it appeared. (See 1.56pm.) These two charts from the detailed presentation on public services (pdf) explain why in more detail. This chart shows how, in real terms, day-to-day spending on public services will be higher in 2024-25 than it was in 2009-10, at the end of the last Labour government. But there\u2019s a catch, or rather two. First, if you look at day-to-day spending on public services per head, it is no higher than it was in 2009-10 (because the population has got bigger). And, second, if you take out health, which received a sizeable, long-term spending increase under Theresa May, real-terms spending on everything else is lower than at the end of the Labour government, both overall (7% lower) and per person (14% lower). But the IFS also says these figures are potentially misleading, for two reasons. First, they include the \u00a311bn a year that the UK will save because it won\u2019t have to make annual payments to the EU - but they do not take into account the \u00a37-8bn a year that the EU used to spend in the UK. And, second, they include an extra \u00a35.5bn a year that the government is spending because of changes to the rules on employer pension contributions. The IFS argues that taking out these figures allows for a more reliable comparison with the past, and on that basis it has produced a chart with adjusted figures (see below). On this measure, day-to-day public spending in real terms will still be higher in 2024-25 than in 2009-10, but only 5% higher, not 9% higher. But day-to-day spending per person ends up being 4% lower in 2024-25 in real terms than in 2009-10, overall spending excluding health is 12% lower, and spending per person excluding health is 19% lower. Sturgeon is now taking questions. Q: What sort of gatherings do you want to cancel? Ones that put pressure on emergency services, she says. So that would not mean church events. But it would mean sports events. She says, as the weeks go on, the emergency services are going to come under growing pressure. That is why she wants to ease the pressure on them. She says she will publish further details in due course. Sturgeon says the government\u2019s focus is on seeking to delay the spread of Covid-19. Sturgeon says moving from \u201ccontain\u201d to \u201cdelay\u201d means that anyone with coronavirus-type symptoms will be advised to stay at home for seven days. That means people who have a fever, or a persistent cough, she says. She says those people do not have to see a doctor, unless their condition gets worse. She says the UK government is not advising schools to close at the moment. But it is advising schools to cancel overseas trips. And she says it is important for people to understand that, if schools were to close, it would not just be for a week or two. It would be until the disease had passed its peak, which would mean until the summer, she says. She also restates her position on mass gatherings. She says this is just a Scottish government position, not a UK government position. She repeats the point she made to the Scottish parliament earlier (see 12.57pm), when she said she wanted to cancel mass gatherings primarily to ease the pressures on the emergency services. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, is holding a press briefing now. She says she will be talking about the outcome of the Cobra emergency committee, which has just concluded. She participated in the meeting, although only remotely; she has not been in London. She is jumping the gun on Boris Johnson, who is due to hold a press briefing later. These are from the Telegraph\u2019s Gordon Rayner. The Scottish Green party has cancelled its spring conference, which was due to take place on Saturday 28 March, because of the coronavirus outbreak after the number of cases declared in Scotland jumped to 60 on Thursday. Ross Greer MSP, a co-chair of the party\u2019s executive, said: Due to the ongoing coronavirus situation the Scottish Greens executive committee has today taken the decision to cancel our upcoming conference. The health and wellbeing of our members and the public is our primary concern and it is with that in mind that we have taken this decision. The conference was due to be held at the Adam Smith theatre in Kirkcaldy, the birth place of the legendary 18th century economist. Johnny Mercer, the veterans minister, promised to unveil a bill on Wednesday next week to introduce a statutory presumption against prosecution for veterans in the Commons, as he made a statement about mental health in the armed forces in the morning. The minister said he was meeting a pledges to legislate in this area, but would not say how or whether the measures would apply to Northern Ireland, where many violent incidents from the time of the Troubles are only now beginning to be investigated by legal authorities. \u201cThe days of lawyers running amok in our services and in our veterans community, trying to rewrite history, in order to make money, are over,\u201d Mercer added. The party\u2019s election manifesto promised to \u201cintroduce new legislation to tackle the vexatious legal claims that undermine our armed forces\u201d. In the last parliament Penny Mordaunt, the then defence secretary, proposed a statutory presumption against prosecutions against veterans for incidents taking place 10 or more years ago, covering Iraq, Afghanistan and any other armed conflict overseas - but left open the question of Northern Ireland, prompting pressure from Conservative backbenchers for it to be included. Mercer was challenged by newly elected Alliance party MP Stephen Farry, who voiced concern about the impending legislation. He said: I do challenge this narrative of excessive claims being made against veterans, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland. It undermines the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland, which has the ability to weed out such claims. Farry warned that some veterans could get \u201cunnecessary protection, warping the rule of law\u201d in relation to historic claims as a result. In reply Mercer said that when to comes to Northern Ireland \u201cI tread down this path with utmost care\u201d. The Scottish government is to get an \u00a3350m as its share of the extra money that Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, released in yesterday\u2019s budget to boost public spending to cope with the coronavirus crisis. A UK government source said Wales would receive \u00a3220m extra and Northern Ireland \u00a3120m. The money has not been ringfenced, allowing all three devolved administrations to spend it as they see fit, but they will face significant political and public pressure to focus on tackling the pandemic\u2019s impacts on the NHS, public services and businesses. The Scottish health secretary, Jeane Freeman, was challenged on BBC Radio Scotland about the availability of protective equipment such as face masks when doctors across Scotland texted the BBC to say they had not been issued with any or had run out. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, told Holyrood today that the NHS would be put under great strain. \u201cOur emergency services are likely to suffer from higher than normal sickness absence rates in the weeks and months ahead and our NHS in particular will be under significant pressure,\u201d she said. Kate Forbes, Scotland\u2019s finance secretary, said yesterday her government had not yet been told how much extra money it would get but was pleased the Treasury was increasing funding. The Institute for Fiscal Studies is holding its traditional day-after briefing on the budget. It started with an overview from Paul Johnson, its director, and the full text is now available on the IFS website. Johnson said the economy was not in a robust state for dealing with a shock like coronavirus. And failure to negotiate a trade deal with the EU this year could make that worse, he said. He explained: The OBR\u2019s economic forecasts are a little more positive than the Bank\u2019s, but they are still very weak even before factoring in possible longer term effects from the coronavirus. Projected growth rates averaging barely over one and a half per cent a year for the next five years are feeble and indicative of an economy that is not in a robust position for coping with shocks like the coronavirus. The OBR continues to assume an orderly move to a free trade agreement with the EU. Anything less orderly, or a failure to achieve such an agreement, would weaken an already weak economy even further. He said that if coronavirus had a long-term impact on the economy, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, would have to revise his strategy. Johnson said: Only time will tell whether any of the numbers in this budget will have meaning once the economic effects of coronavirus become fully evident ... If the long-term path of the economy is affected then [Sunak] will also need to reassess much more of his fiscal strategy when he returns to the despatch box in the autumn. He said the plans for current spending were \u201cnothing like as generous as they appear\u201d. He explained: Average annual increases of 2.8% sound substantial. Take account of the need to replace EU funding, and factor in planned increases for health, schools, defence and overseas aid, and there is relatively little here for other departments. If this spending envelope is stuck to there are plenty of public services which will not be enjoying much in the way of spending increases over the next few years. He said overall spending is due to rise by 9% in real terms between 2019-20 and 2023-24, \u201clargely paid for by extra borrowing\u201d. He said public spending would stabilise at around 41% of national income, \u201cabove its pre-crisis level and bigger than at any point between the mid 1980s and the start of the financial crisis\u201d. But he said current spending per head for most public services would remain well below 2010-11 levels in 2024-25. He went on: While austerity is clearly at an end in the sense that spending is rising, spending levels in many areas are set to remain well below 2010 levels for a long time to come. Expectations may be disappointed. He said although public spending was rising, it was not rising by as much as Labour proposed in its 2019 manifesto. He said he thought the \u00a312bn package of measures to help the country tackle coronavirus was \u201cfairly well designed\u201d. Here are two of the most striking charts from the Resolution Foundation\u2019s report (pdf) on yesterday\u2019s budget. The UK\u2019s medium-term outlook for growth is \u201cdismal\u201d, the foundation says. It explains: The [Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s] medium-term outlook is dismal. [The chart below] shows cumulative real GDP growth over the five-year forecast period for each fiscal event since the OBR\u2019s inception. As it makes plain, the OBR\u2019s outlook in March 2020 is the second-weakest in its history, pipped only by its March 2018 prognosis. If yesterday\u2019s forecast holds true, we estimate that the economy will have underperformed by almost one-quarter relative to the average five-year growth rate of the preceding decade. And the growth rates for the fourth and fifth years of the forecast are both the weakest on record. The overall impact of tax and benefit changes since 2015 has been highly regressive, the foundation says. It explains: [The chart below] shows the overall impact of benefit and tax policy choices on households across the income distribution since summer budget 2015. Given that welfare support is targeted at lower-income households, and that the 2015 package of welfare cuts was so substantial (including the benefits freeze and two-child limit), the average losses for poorer households are very large. For example, the second decile will ultimately be \u00a32,900 a year worse off (on average) than if welfare policy had remained unchanged, with \u00a3900 of that still to come as a result of welfare policies still being rolled out. Welfare cuts have been somewhat offset (in aggregate) by tax cuts. Successive cuts to income tax, through increases in the personal allowance and higher-rate threshold, have been followed in this budget by an increase in the starting point for national insurance, as well as repeated fuel duty freezes. But these changes have been of most benefit \u2013 in cash terms \u2013 to the top half of the income distribution, though this has been tempered at the very top by tax increases targeted at the richest tenth of the population. President Trump did not contact Boris Johnson directly before his decision to ban citizens from 26 EU countries from entering the US for the next 30 days, No 10 has said. Britain and Ireland are exempt from the ruling because they are not in the Schengen border-free travel agreement. No 10 said today the government had no plans for the UK to follow the US and ban travel from EU countries. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: We have been following the advice of the chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser in relation to all parts of our response to this virus and the advice we\u2019ve been given is that is not a step they recommend in the UK. Asked about concerns that other countries were taking a different approach to the virus, such as Ireland and Denmark, where they have already moved to school closures, the spokesman said: \u201cWe believe that we are taking our decisions based on the best scientific and medical advice that is available.\u201d This is what Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs in the Scottish parliament about her plan to cancel mass gatherings in Scotland. She said that she would be participating in the Cobra meeting chaired by the prime minister this afternoon to discuss coronavirus, and she said she expected the UK to move from the \u201ccontain\u201d phase of the strategy to the \u201cdelay\u201d phase. She went on: In addition, the health secretary [Jeane Freeman] and I have been considering what further actions we require to take, particularly to protect the resilience of our frontline emergency workers, and that does involve our position on mass gatherings ... The scientific advice is telling us that cancelling mass gatherings will not, in itself, have a significant impact on reducing the spread of the virus. Of course that does not mean it will have no impact on that. But the view that the health secretary and I have come to is that there are wider issues to take account of here. Mass gatherings require to be policed. They require to have emergency ambulance cover. They require the services of our voluntary health services. And at a time when we need to be reducing the pressures on these frontline workers in order to free them up to focus on the significant challenge that lies ahead, I do think it is inappropriate that we continue as normal. So the health secretary and I this morning have decided that we are minded \u2013 and this is something that we will seek views on from others at Cobra \u2013 now that we will advise the cancellation, from the start of next week, of mass gatherings of 500 people or more. And that is principally to protect the resilience of our frontline workers. The Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen is in self-isolation, having had lunch with the health minister Nadine Dorries who has tested positive for coronavirus, the Sun\u2019s Kate Ferguson reports. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has told the Scottish parliament that she is minded to recommend the cancellation of events involving crowds or more than 500 people from next week, the BBC\u2019s Glenn Campbell reports. Sturgeon set out part of her reasoning on this in an interview this morning. (See 11.01am.) Yesterday the Liberal Democrats announced that they were cancelling their spring conference in York this weekend because of coronavirus. Now Plaid Cymru has announced that it has cancelled its spring conference in Llangollen next weekend for the same reason. Plaid said it thought this was \u201cthe most responsible course of action for the party to take in the current circumstances\u201d. At the No 10 lobby briefing this morning Downing Street insisted that Ireland\u2019s decision to close schools, colleges and childcare facilities because of coronavirus would not lead to Northern Ireland being treated differently from the rest of the UK. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: We have been in regular dialogue with Irish counterparts. In terms of our own response, we have said that we want it to be a UK-wide response and we have been working with the four chief medical officers and devolved administrations. Asked about the difference in the approach in Dublin, the spokesman added: \u201cWe follow our own advice, they will do the same.\u201d Will Tanner, head of the centre-right thinktank Onward, has welcomed the planning measures announced by Robert Jenrick in the Commons. His tweet includes a link to the 11-page government document (pdf) summarising the measures. There is also a press release here. Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, has just delivered a statement to MPs about planning. It is normal for a budget to be followed by ministerial announcements in the following days fleshing out some of the proposals announced by the chancellor, and yesterday Rishi Sunak said that Jenrick would be setting out \u201ccomprehensive reforms to bring the planning system into the 21st century\u201d. Sunak may have jumped the gun, because although Jenrick said there would be a planning white paper, he told the Commons that it would not be published until the spring. Despite not being ready to publish a full package of measures, Jenrick was able to outline a series of proposals that are in the pipeline. He said that his priority was ensuring more homes get built, so that it was easier for young people to acquire a home. In particular, he announced: A drive to encourage building on brownfield sites. Some \u00a3400m is being spent regenerating brownfield sites, and a map of development opportunities on brownfield sites will be produced. A move to \u201cdramatically accelerate\u201d the planning system. This will involve making it more digital, with planning fees linked to performance. Developers will get new rights to demolish shops or industrial units to build homes. More information will be published about who owns options for land development. The formula used by councils to assess local housing need will be revised, with a view to ensuring that more homes are built, particularly in urban areas. Councils will be told that all local plans must be completed by December 2023 Two bills will be introduced: a building safety bill, and a renters reform bill. The national planning policy framework will be revised, to embed the principle of good design in it. Planning rules for areas at high risk of flooding will be reviewed. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has told MPs that they are not at high risk of catching coronavirus when they congregate in the division lobbies to vote. He was speaking during business questions, and responding to a question from the SNP MP Tommy Sheppard who said that it might be safer for MPs during the coronavirus outbreak to abandon their normal method of voting (queuing up in a smallish lobby while waiting to have their names ticketed off by a clerk) and to instead use the deferred division procedure (voting using a ballot paper). Rees-Mogg replied that he had taken a Public Health England official into a division lobby and been told that the lobbies were \u201cnot a high risk\u201d. But the expert did suggest opening windows, Rees-Mogg said. Rees-Mogg also indicated that emergency legislation to give the government new powers to deal with the outbreak would be introduced in the week beginning Monday 23 March. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has said that there is a \u201cbig question mark\u201d about whether large public events like football matches should continue to go ahead during the coronavirus outbreak. In an interview with ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain she said that, even if events like these did not significantly contribute to the spread, they distracted the emergency services. She explained: Mass gatherings, football matches for example, they need to be policed, they need to have emergency medical ambulance cover. We are going into a period where our emergency services, our NHS in particular, will be under significant challenge and significant pressure, we may see all of our workforces affected by high absentee rates because of sickness, so there\u2019s a wider issue here about whether cancelling those kind of events is the right thing to do to reduce pressure on our front-line emergency workers. From a wider resilience point of view, then I think there is a big question mark over whether large-scale events like that, whether it is sensible to allow them to proceed at the moment. We\u2019re looking very carefully right now at whether large-scale events, whether it would be right and sensible given the situation we are facing right now to allow them to go ahead. The UK government may announce a move towards new \u201csocial distancing measures\u201d after a Cobra emergency committee meeting on coronavirus being chaired by Boris Johnson this afternoon. Sturgeon said she thought it was time to move from the \u201ccontain\u201d phase of the strategy to the \u201cdelay\u201d phase. Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, told BBC Radio Scotland this morning that Boris Johnson would soon announce a feasibility study into plans for a bridge linking Scotland to Northern Ireland. In an interview this morning, asked why there was no money for the plan in the budget, he replied: \u201cWatch this space.\u201d He went on: The prime minister I expect will announce a feasibility study into the link to Northern Ireland. I hope the Scottish government will back it. Johnson has a fondness for extravagant infrastructure schemes and he has repeatedly expressed interest in a bridge linking Scotland and Northern Ireland, despite experts dismissing the idea as impractical. Jack has suggested that the scheme could involve a combination of tunnel and bridge. The Resolution Foundation thinktank has this morning published a 60-page analysis of the budget (pdf). And it has been posting some highlights on a Twitter thread starting here. I will post more from the report shortly. Here are the main points from Rishi Sunak\u2019s morning interview round. Sunak, the chancellor, criticised President Trump\u2019s flight ban announcement, saying that the UK government\u2019s view was that measures like this would not have much impact on the spread of coronavirus. (See 8.55am.) He accepted that the flight ban would have an impact on the UK economy. Asked on the Today programme whether it would have a negative impact on the economy, he accepted that it would, although in his answer he focused on making a general point about the negative economic impact of coronavirus. He said: The US is still deciding the details of what exactly that means, but you are right. As I talked about yesterday, there will be an impact on the demand side of our economy as people are unable to spend in the way they normally would and travel, but it also affects the supply chains for businesses and that impacts the supply side of our economy. As those supply chains are disrupted, the productive capacity of our economy will shrink for a period of time. He dismissed claims that his spending plans were irresponsible. He said: I make absolutely no apology for responding in the short term in scale to the immediate threat that we face from coronavirus. I think that\u2019s the right thing to do for the economy. We need to help businesses have a bridge to get to the other side. In the medium term, as you will see from the figures, there is actually responsible economic management and it\u2019s because we\u2019ve had responsible economic management for several years that I\u2019m able to stand here in a strong position to say that we will do whatever it takes to get through this. He said that his measures were compatible with the fiscal rules set out in the Conservative manifesto. He laughed off suggestions that he had delivered a Gordon Brown budget, or a Labour budget. When LBC\u2019s Nick Ferrari put this to him, Sunak laughed, and said he would let others make that judgment. He suggested that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s resignation as Labour leader was holding up the announcement of plans for reform of social care. When asked about the absence of social care from the budget, he said that Matt Hancock, the health secretary, wrote to MPs last week proposing cross-party talks starting in May. When it was put to him that the government was taking a long time, particularly since Boris Johnson claimed to have a plan for social care last summer, Sunak replied: There is no permanent leader of the opposition at the moment. They\u2019re having a leadership contest, so we can\u2019 formally start that process until they have one. Sunak defended his decision not to extend sick pay to cover the low-paid and the self-employed. In the budget he said that people in these categories would instead find it easier to claim benefits as a result of rules being relaxed during the coronavirus outbreak. This morning he said: For those that don\u2019t [have access to statutory sick pay] we\u2019ve strengthened the working of our welfare system so that it works quicker, more responsibly and more generously for those people. He also claimed that around half of workers who needed to take time off would get more than statutory sick pay because their employers offered more generous arrangements. He sidestepped a question about whether he and his family would be able to live on \u00a390 a week. Statutory sick pay is worth \u00a394.25 per week. Asked whether that was enough to live on, he replied: We have strengthened our safety net to make sure we have access to benefits easier, quicker, more generously, and also provided an extra \u00a3500m to local authorities to distribute to vulnerable people and their local communities if they need extra support. When pressed on whether he could live on this himself, he said: This is a safety net. That is what it\u2019s there for, to provide people to fall back on. It\u2019s obviously not the same as your day-to-day life He defended his decision not to include nurseries in the list of companies that will qualify for a one-year exemption from business rates. The nursery sector has been horrified by the decision. Asked why they were not included, Sunak said: Because what we\u2019ve done on business rates is target the sectors of the economy which are in the consumption side of the economy, which will see a very significant hit because of people\u2019s inability to spend. And what we wanted to do is make sure that they don\u2019t go out of business during that period of time. He accepted that his plans involved making an assumption about the cost of borrowing remaining low, but it was a judgment he defended. He said: You have to make a judgment about the persistence of low interest rates, that\u2019s a judgment I have to make as chancellor. The reality is these interest rates have stayed lower for longer than anyone expected and keep falling, and it\u2019s right that I as someone in charge of managing our public finances has a view on that. Stock markets around the wall are down following President Trump\u2019s travel ban announcement. My colleague Graeme Wearden has all the details on his business live blog. This is from the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming. He is quoting from the government\u2019s UK influenza pandemic preparedness strategy. It was drawn up in 2011, but officials have been using it as the starting point for their response to the coronavirus outbreak. There will be two statements in the Commons today. Good morning. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has been doing the tradition post-budget morning interview round and, in a sign perhaps of the seriousness of the crisis facing the economy, No 10 has lifted its usual ban and let him speak to the Today programme. The first topic to come up, of course, was President Trump\u2019s shock decision last night to announce a 30-day ban on people from most EU countries (but not the UK) from travelling to the US. Criticising American presidents in public does not come easily to UK government ministers, particularly Conservative ones working for Boris Johnson, but Sunak could not avoid saying he thought Trump\u2019s plan was a bad idea. He told the Today programme: With regard to flight bans, we are always guided by the science as we make our decisions here. The advice we are getting is that there isn\u2019t evidence that interventions like closing borders or travel bans are going to have a material effect on the spread of the infection. That is why we have taken the decisions we have. In another BBC interview he was more direct. \u201cWe haven\u2019t believed that that\u2019s the right thing to do, the evidence here doesn\u2019t support that,\u201d he said. I will post more from his interviews shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Lord Hall, the BBC director general, and Sir David Clementi, its chairman, give evidence to the Commons culture committee. 1pm: The Institute for Fiscal Studies holds a briefing on the budget. 1.15pm: Boris Johnson chairs a meeting of Cobra, the government\u2019s emergency committee, to discuss coronavirus. We\u2019re also due to get an announcement from Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, on plans to reform planning laws. I will be covering Westminster coronavirus developments, but our main coronavirus coverage is on a separate coronavirus outbreak live blog. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Woodford\u2019s string of bad bets sparked a surge in redemptions that eventually resulted in the fund\u2019s suspension last June. The fund\u2019s administrators, Link Fund Solutions, said on Thursday that most of the fund\u2019s easy-to-sell assets had been sold and further payouts were unlikely in the coming months. Link said in a letter on Thursday: \u201cAt this stage, we are unable to advise you of the exact timing and amount of these future capital distributions as this is dependent upon the sale of the fund\u2019s assets. Investors should be aware that the assets that remain to be sold are the less liquid assets of the fund and disposing of these assets may take longer than was the case for the sales to date.\u201d Investment banking firm PJT Park Hill, which is helping sell the remaining assets, last year estimated investors would lose nearly 33% of their remaining cash once the firm was wound up, and nearly 43% in a worst-case scenario. Ryan Hughes, head of active portfolios at AJ Bell, said Park Hill may struggle to sell the remaining assets at full price, given the state of financial markets, which have been roiled by the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen market conditions deteriorate considerably, meaning that selling any unlisted and illiquid assets is likely to become much harder. Sadly, this means that it looks like investors are in for a long wait before they see the remainder of their money paid out of the fund,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cWhile the asset manager will balance the competing needs to sell assets at a good price versus the saga dragging on for years, it seems inevitable that this will rumble on into 2021.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>You\u2019d expect Larry Summers, former US Treasury Secretary under President Bill Clinton and adviser to President Barack Obama, to twist the knife, and he did so stylishly. By destroying \u201cabout $500bn in equity market value in course of an 11-minute speech\u201d, President Donald Trump had set \u201cwhat I believe is a new world record for presidential market value destruction\u201d.</p> <p>Fair point. Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/eu-condemns-donald-trump-coronavirus-travel-ban\">ban on flights from 26 European countries</a> lacked rhyme or reason. It runs counter to the World Health Organization\u2019s advice and virtually guarantees the economic hit to the US will be intensified. More to the point, the president said virtually nothing about how the US will construct its healthcare response to the pandemic.</p> <p>Trump also managed to lower already-low hopes that the world\u2019s big economies would summon a spirit of collectivism. The US president seems mostly concerned with finding someone to blame while ensuring trade tensions with the EU are set to maximum, the natural reading for why flights from the UK to the US will be permitted (for now).</p> <p>Cue another huge fall for stock markets as investors, having been offered no reason for macro optimism, engaged in a micro hunt for corporate losers. Within the FTSE 100 index\u2019s 10.87% fall, more than a dozen constituents saw their share prices fall 15% or more \u2013 and they weren\u2019t all obvious candidates such as airlines, hoteliers, tour operators or the cruise company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/12/princess-cruises-owner-suspends-all-trips-for-two-months\">Carnival</a>.</p> <p>Anglo American, BHP and Glencore \u2013 three of the world\u2019s large miners, and thus sensitive to every twitch in commodity prices \u2013 were among the biggest fallers. The moral there is that markets now expect global recession and fear deflation.</p> <p>Then there was Centrica, the British Gas owner that, once upon a time, would have been considered a haven stock. Not now: its earnings will be hit by lower energy prices while its North Sea assets, which are up for sale, will be falling in value by the day. Centrica, unfortunately, is one of the most widely held stocks by retail investors.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email\">Business Today: sign up for a morning shot of financial news</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then came the financial crew of Prudential, Legal &amp; General, Standard Life Aberdeen and Barclays. The whacks to insurers and fund managers can be explained: the former\u2019s capital is depleted when markets fall and the latter\u2019s assets under management decline for the same reason.</p> <p>However, the presence of Barclays, down 17% at 97.5p, its lowest level since 2009, was most revealing. It played to the new fear of financial contagion, meaning previously liquid markets suddenly drying up. The danger is mayhem as financial institutions are forced to get out of positions at almost any price in a desperate search for cash. It happened in 2008 \u2013 indeed, it was a defining feature of the chaos in the weeks after the fall of Lehman Brothers.</p> <p>The worries were clearly justified. Soon after the close of trading in London, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/12/us-and-european-markets-plunge-further-after-trump-travel-ban\">the New York Fed injected $1.5tn into financial markets</a> to address what it called \u201chighly unusual disruptions\u201d in the US Treasury market, or the market for US government debt, which in normal times is the world\u2019s most liquid.</p> <p>Consider the intervention a case of the financial grownups trying to restore a sense of stability via a show of strength. It is frightening, however, that the US central bank was forced into action less than 24 hours after the US president tried to calm a crisis and failed at every turn. More wild days lie ahead, one suspects.</p> <h2>Cineworld\u2019s dividend decision could have unhappy ending</h2> <p>Its share price has fallen by 75% in a year, and has halved in the past 10 days, but Cineworld, the world\u2019s second-largest cinema chain, is trying to imagine a cheerful plot. The industry expects to provide \u201cfun, laughter, happiness and joy to millions of dedicated movie fans, just as it has for over a century\u201d, said its chairman, Anthony Bloom.</p> <p>In his shoes, you\u2019d probably say the same, especially as Cineworld says ticket sales have largely been immune to coronavirus so far. But the decision to lift the annual dividend by 3.3% looks very odd when you read the auditor\u2019s scary \u201cgoing concern\u201d statement.</p> <p>In short, Cineworld, which also runs the Picturehouse chain in the UK, could breach its banking covenants if it lost two or three months of revenue across its estate.</p> <p>Skipping the latest quarterly dividend would save $50m, which is popcorn in the context of group debt of $3.5bn, the legacy of acquisition-driven expansion. All the same, why pay any dividend when enforced closures of cinemas are a real possibility?</p>",

      "bodyText": "You\u2019d expect Larry Summers, former US Treasury Secretary under President Bill Clinton and adviser to President Barack Obama, to twist the knife, and he did so stylishly. By destroying \u201cabout $500bn in equity market value in course of an 11-minute speech\u201d, President Donald Trump had set \u201cwhat I believe is a new world record for presidential market value destruction\u201d. Fair point. Trump\u2019s ban on flights from 26 European countries lacked rhyme or reason. It runs counter to the World Health Organization\u2019s advice and virtually guarantees the economic hit to the US will be intensified. More to the point, the president said virtually nothing about how the US will construct its healthcare response to the pandemic. Trump also managed to lower already-low hopes that the world\u2019s big economies would summon a spirit of collectivism. The US president seems mostly concerned with finding someone to blame while ensuring trade tensions with the EU are set to maximum, the natural reading for why flights from the UK to the US will be permitted (for now). Cue another huge fall for stock markets as investors, having been offered no reason for macro optimism, engaged in a micro hunt for corporate losers. Within the FTSE 100 index\u2019s 10.87% fall, more than a dozen constituents saw their share prices fall 15% or more \u2013 and they weren\u2019t all obvious candidates such as airlines, hoteliers, tour operators or the cruise company Carnival. Anglo American, BHP and Glencore \u2013 three of the world\u2019s large miners, and thus sensitive to every twitch in commodity prices \u2013 were among the biggest fallers. The moral there is that markets now expect global recession and fear deflation. Then there was Centrica, the British Gas owner that, once upon a time, would have been considered a haven stock. Not now: its earnings will be hit by lower energy prices while its North Sea assets, which are up for sale, will be falling in value by the day. Centrica, unfortunately, is one of the most widely held stocks by retail investors. Then came the financial crew of Prudential, Legal &amp; General, Standard Life Aberdeen and Barclays. The whacks to insurers and fund managers can be explained: the former\u2019s capital is depleted when markets fall and the latter\u2019s assets under management decline for the same reason. However, the presence of Barclays, down 17% at 97.5p, its lowest level since 2009, was most revealing. It played to the new fear of financial contagion, meaning previously liquid markets suddenly drying up. The danger is mayhem as financial institutions are forced to get out of positions at almost any price in a desperate search for cash. It happened in 2008 \u2013 indeed, it was a defining feature of the chaos in the weeks after the fall of Lehman Brothers. The worries were clearly justified. Soon after the close of trading in London, the New York Fed injected $1.5tn into financial markets to address what it called \u201chighly unusual disruptions\u201d in the US Treasury market, or the market for US government debt, which in normal times is the world\u2019s most liquid. Consider the intervention a case of the financial grownups trying to restore a sense of stability via a show of strength. It is frightening, however, that the US central bank was forced into action less than 24 hours after the US president tried to calm a crisis and failed at every turn. More wild days lie ahead, one suspects. Cineworld\u2019s dividend decision could have unhappy ending Its share price has fallen by 75% in a year, and has halved in the past 10 days, but Cineworld, the world\u2019s second-largest cinema chain, is trying to imagine a cheerful plot. The industry expects to provide \u201cfun, laughter, happiness and joy to millions of dedicated movie fans, just as it has for over a century\u201d, said its chairman, Anthony Bloom. In his shoes, you\u2019d probably say the same, especially as Cineworld says ticket sales have largely been immune to coronavirus so far. But the decision to lift the annual dividend by 3.3% looks very odd when you read the auditor\u2019s scary \u201cgoing concern\u201d statement. In short, Cineworld, which also runs the Picturehouse chain in the UK, could breach its banking covenants if it lost two or three months of revenue across its estate. Skipping the latest quarterly dividend would save $50m, which is popcorn in the context of group debt of $3.5bn, the legacy of acquisition-driven expansion. All the same, why pay any dividend when enforced closures of cinemas are a real possibility?",

Universities don\u2019t need so much bricks and mortar because there\u2019s so much learning online. What we\u2019ve got is this cack-handed centralised country trying to run everything from London. In a period of three months we\u2019ve gone from \u201cwe don\u2019t need experts\u201d to \u201cwe are the experts, we will tell you what to do\u201d and neither position is right. You do need expertise but you also need to trust the population.",

      "body": "<p>Things fall apart. Just a little, at any rate. Moments after the latest Cobra meeting had broken up, Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, went rogue and gave her own press conference. </p> \n<p>The coronavirus pandemic had gone beyond the \u201ccontainment\u201d phase and into \u201cdelay\u201d. People with a dry cough and a fever should self-isolate. Large gatherings of more than 500 in Scotland would almost certainly be banned from Monday. Enough time to make sure the Old Firm derby between Rangers and Celtic could be played on Sunday.</p> \n<p>A little over an hour later, Boris Johnson emerged into the familiar setting of the Downing Street state room to give his third coronavirus presser inside two weeks. There will be plenty more to come. </p> \n<p>His message was pretty much identical to Sturgeon\u2019s, other than to declare that sports events and concerts would be going ahead in the rest of the UK for the foreseeable future. His irritation at being pre-empted by the first minister on further measures was mostly kept in check.

      "bodyText": "Things fall apart. Just a little, at any rate. Moments after the latest Cobra meeting had broken up, Scotland\u2019s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, went rogue and gave her own press conference. The coronavirus pandemic had gone beyond the \u201ccontainment\u201d phase and into \u201cdelay\u201d. People with a dry cough and a fever should self-isolate. Large gatherings of more than 500 in Scotland would almost certainly be banned from Monday. Enough time to make sure the Old Firm derby between Rangers and Celtic could be played on Sunday. A little over an hour later, Boris Johnson emerged into the familiar setting of the Downing Street state room to give his third coronavirus presser inside two weeks. There will be plenty more to come. His message was pretty much identical to Sturgeon\u2019s, other than to declare that sports events and concerts would be going ahead in the rest of the UK for the foreseeable future. His irritation at being pre-empted by the first minister on further measures was mostly kept in check. Only a barb at the lack of resilience in the Scottish health service betrayed his feelings. Boris was here to tell the country we were in for a long haul, but he already looked on his knees. He has aged appreciably over the last few weeks.

Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, described the current state of affairs as \u201ca failing\u201d at a hearing of the House oversight committee.</p> \n<p>From Congress to state capitals across the country, politicians of both main parties have shown rare bipartisan agreement that the pace of federal testing is woefully inadequate. Congress members who were given private briefings by Trump administration officials on Thursday expressed shock and outrage that so far only 11,000 tests have been conducted in a country of 327 million people.</p> \n<p>By contrast South Korea, which has been grappling with one of the most severe outbreaks of Covid-19 globally, tests roughly the same number, about 10,000 people, every day. In total, South Korea has tested <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-testing-intl-hnk/index.html\">230,000</a> of its 51 million people \u2013 130 times as many per capita as the US.</p> \n<p>The aggressive use of testing to identify carriers of the disease and quarantine them has been credited as a major factor in South Korea\u2019s relative success in dealing with the crisis.</p> \n<p>Answering press questions in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said: \u201cFrankly, the testing has been going very smooth.\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1238138713919705089\">He added</a>: \u201cWe have heavily tested.\u201d</p> \n<p>That is factually incorrect, and a growing number of public officials, including from his own party, are willing to say so.</p> \n<p>Members of Congress who attended a bipartisan House briefing expressed anger about testing failures.</p> \n<p>Mike Quigley, a Democratic congressman from Illinois, said: \u201cWe are not where we need to be and not sure when we are going to get there. We are flying blind.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mark Walker, a Republican congressman from North Carolina, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/politics/congress-outrage-testing-covid-19/index.html\">told CNN</a> that there was \u201ca growing frustration among members as a whole to get more definitive answers\u201d. The Republican senator and former presidential nominee Mitt Romney of Utah said: \u201cOur system has just not been up to snuff and I think a lot of people are frustrated by it. I\u2019m one of them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York, which is one of the states hardest hit by the disease so far, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/03/12/andrew-cuomo-coronavirus-testing-intv-sot-cpt-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/coronavirus/\">told CNN</a> the US was \u201cway behind on testing\u201d. What he called a \u201cfederal bottleneck\u201d was so bad that he had authorised New York authorities to contract out testing to private laboratories.</p> \n<p>Cuomo said the paucity of testing not only prevented containment of localised outbreaks, it also gave the public a false sense of security by obscuring how prevalent the disease has already become. \u201cIt\u2019s because we have no testing capacity, that\u2019s why the numbers are low. If you actually had testing capacity you would see how high the numbers are already. As we do ramp up testing you are going to see those numbers go sky-high.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 March 2020. An earlier version referred to the number of specimens tested for Covid-19 in the US on March 10 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public health labs. The figure at the time was just eight, but this was an incomplete figure. The CDC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing-in-us.html\">coronavirus database</a> indicates that the final figure for March 10 was 2,587. We have removed the section in question.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Anger is mounting in the US over the Trump administration\u2019s failure to test for coronavirus on a scale that could contain the outbreak and mitigate its most devastating impacts. On Thursday the lack of testing capacity for Covid-19 was recognised in blunt terms by one of the top US officials dealing with the crisis. Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, described the current state of affairs as \u201ca failing\u201d at a hearing of the House oversight committee. From Congress to state capitals across the country, politicians of both main parties have shown rare bipartisan agreement that the pace of federal testing is woefully inadequate. Congress members who were given private briefings by Trump administration officials on Thursday expressed shock and outrage that so far only 11,000 tests have been conducted in a country of 327 million people. By contrast South Korea, which has been grappling with one of the most severe outbreaks of Covid-19 globally, tests roughly the same number, about 10,000 people, every day. In total, South Korea has tested 230,000 of its 51 million people \u2013 130 times as many per capita as the US. The aggressive use of testing to identify carriers of the disease and quarantine them has been credited as a major factor in South Korea\u2019s relative success in dealing with the crisis. Answering press questions in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said: \u201cFrankly, the testing has been going very smooth.\u201d He added: \u201cWe have heavily tested.\u201d That is factually incorrect, and a growing number of public officials, including from his own party, are willing to say so. Members of Congress who attended a bipartisan House briefing expressed anger about testing failures. Mike Quigley, a Democratic congressman from Illinois, said: \u201cWe are not where we need to be and not sure when we are going to get there. We are flying blind.\u201d Mark Walker, a Republican congressman from North Carolina, told CNN that there was \u201ca growing frustration among members as a whole to get more definitive answers\u201d. The Republican senator and former presidential nominee Mitt Romney of Utah said: \u201cOur system has just not been up to snuff and I think a lot of people are frustrated by it. I\u2019m one of them.\u201d Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York, which is one of the states hardest hit by the disease so far, told CNN the US was \u201cway behind on testing\u201d. What he called a \u201cfederal bottleneck\u201d was so bad that he had authorised New York authorities to contract out testing to private laboratories. Cuomo said the paucity of testing not only prevented containment of localised outbreaks, it also gave the public a false sense of security by obscuring how prevalent the disease has already become. \u201cIt\u2019s because we have no testing capacity, that\u2019s why the numbers are low. If you actually had testing capacity you would see how high the numbers are already. As we do ramp up testing you are going to see those numbers go sky-high.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 16 March 2020. An earlier version referred to the number of specimens tested for Covid-19 in the US on March 10 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public health labs. The figure at the time was just eight, but this was an incomplete figure. The CDC\u2019s coronavirus database indicates that the final figure for March 10 was 2,587. We have removed the section in question.",

      "bodyText": "A Brazilian official who met Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago last weekend has tested positive for coronavirus. Fabio Wajngarten, communications secretary to Jair Bolsonaro, accompanied the Brazilian president on a visit to Florida, where the two leaders dined together. On Thursday the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, said both Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence had \u201calmost no interactions\u201d with Wajngarten and therefore did not need to be tested themselves. But during the visit Wajngarten shared on Instagram a picture of himself, Trump, Pence and Brazilian TV presenter Alvaro Garnero, while in one video, Wajngarten (wearing glasses) was seen just behind Bolsonaro and Trump. Guidelines from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) state that coronavirus can spread \u201cbetween people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6ft)\u201d. A Brazilian government statement said: \u201cThe medical service of the presidency of the Republic adopted and is adopting all the necessary preventative measures to preserve the health of the president of the republic and the entire presidential committee which accompanied him on the recent trip to the United States, as well as presidential palace staff.\u201d The US government had been informed \u201cso that they can adopt the necessary cautionary measures\u201d, the statement added. Grisham cited the CDC when she said \u201cthere is currently no indication to test patients without symptoms, and only people with prolonged close exposure to confirmed positive cases should self-quarantine\u201d. Speaking in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said he wasn\u2019t concerned. Asked about his dinner with the Brazilians, he said: \u201cWe did nothing very unusual.\u201d Two Republican senators, however, announced self-quarantine arising from their attendance at Mar-a-Lago. Rick Scott of Florida said that though the Senate\u2019s attending physician had advised him his risk was low, he was self-quarantining following \u201cpotential contact\u201d with Wajngarten. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close Trump ally, said that though he had \u201cno recollection of direct contact with the president of Brazil, who is awaiting the results of a coronavirus test, or his spokesman who tested positive\u201d, he would be working from home. It was also reported that Wajngarten met leaders of Southcom, the US military\u2019s southern command, who then travelled to meetings on Capitol Hill in Washington DC and at the Pentagon.

However, Wajngarten attacked Brazilian media and tweeted: \u201cI\u2019m well.\u201d Like Trump, Bolsonaro has downplayed the crisis. On Wednesday, he said \u201cOther flus kill more than this\u201d and has also called concern over coronavirus \u201coversized\u201d. On Thursday, Spanish-language reports said Bolsonaro himself had tested positive for coronavirus. The reports were discredited as fake news and none of Brazil\u2019s main media sites confirmed them. Bolsonaro has however taken a test, as Senator Graham said, and results will be ready on Friday. Covid-19 is a respiratory illness which can spread via sneezes or coughs or by physical contact. Most who contract the disease recover but it can be fatal, particularly among the elderly and those with underlying health concerns. According to the latest figures from the World Health Organization, which on Wednesday declared the outbreak a pandemic, nearly 120,000 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with 4,300 deaths. In the US, the CDC reports 938 confirmed cases and 29 deaths, in 38 states and Washington DC. Other estimates of the toll are higher. As the federal government has struggled to implement sufficient testing and preventative measures, Trump\u2019s own responses have been widely criticised. The president has downplayed the dangers posed by the virus, which he has repeatedly compared to the common flu; predicted it would be killed by warmer weather, which experts say is not certain; said a vaccine is imminent when experts say it is not; and continued to shake hands with supporters in public, against the advice of health experts. Republican members of Congress including Trump\u2019s new chief of staff self-quarantined after an individual who attended the recent Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) outside Washington tested positive for coronavirus. Trump and Pence also attended that gathering. In an Oval Office address on Wednesday night, Trump announced a suspension of travel to the US from Europe, excepting the UK. At the same time, to a sense of growing national dismay, the NBA suspended its season after a player tested positive and the Hollywood actor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson were revealed to have been hospitalised in Australia with the virus.

Here are the next steps in different areas, and the justifications they gave for them.</p> \n<h2>Schools<br></h2> \n<p>While school closures can be effective in the case of a flu pandemic, large-scale shutdowns are not thought to be an obvious next step in dealing with the virus in the UK, the government said. Closures would have to be at least 13 weeks long to reduce the peak of Covid-19 by 10-15%. Measures such as self-isolation for seven days for those with symptoms, as advised by the government, have been modelled and are shown to be much more effective. Experts also believe it would be difficult for school closures to work in practice, as children off school would end up socialising anyway or spending time with grandparents, who would be worse-affected by the virus. Schools will be asked to stop foreign trips.</p> \n<h2>Self-isolation<br></h2> \n<p>The updated guidance asks people to self-isolate at home for seven days if they have one or both of a new, persistent cough (one that continues over three or four hours), and a temperature of 37.8C and above. These are considered to be mild symptoms of coronavirus and people do not need to ring 111 for advice unless their condition dramatically worsens, the government said. Following this advice is thought to be an effective way of reducing the peak number of cases by up to 20%. The seven-day period is based on people being infectious just as their symptoms start to show and for a week afterwards. In the future, the government may ask a whole household to isolate for two weeks if one person is affected.</p> \n<h2>Mass gatherings <br></h2> \n<p>The government believes that banning large gatherings is one of the least effective measures a country can take, reducing the peak of the coronavirus by less than 5%. The virus is just as likely to spread within a smaller group such as those watching football in the pub as it would in a large crowd. Scotland has taken a different decision, banning events of more than 500 people from Monday to free up emergency services.</p> \n<h2>Older people<br></h2> \n<p>The illness especially affects elderly people. Most people experience five days of a viral illness but a small proportion of people, including older people and those with underlying health conditions, may have a far more serious immune response. At the moment, individual care homes will make their own decisions based on frequent government advice on how to best to protect residents. The government accepts that both care homes and nursing homes will be difficult to defend from the virus as people circulate in and out of hospital so frequently. The overall mortality rate is 1% but could be higher among elderly people.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/23/tell-us-have-you-been-affected-by-the-coronavirus\">Tell us: have you been affected by the coronavirus?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Public fatigue<br></h2> \n<p>Experts have warned consistently about the importance of not moving ahead too quickly with dramatic lifestyle changes to try to deal with the virus. Anything too onerous suggested by the government \u2013 such as a two-week isolation period for a whole household \u2013 might be adopted enthusiastically for a few weeks but then people get bored and leave their homes just as the peak of the illness hits, the government fears. A complete and immediate \u201clockdown\u201d on movement could suppress the virus for a short time but it would return once measures are lifted, the government believes. Instead, the aim is to push the peak back toward the summer months and bring in more stringent measures down the line.</p> \n<h2>Flights<br></h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-outbreak-us-trump-latest\">Donald Trump has banned citizens from 26 European Schengen area countries from travelling to the US for 30 days.</a> The decision will not be replicated in the UK following the advice of the chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser. The measure is not effective unless 95% of flights are stopped, the government said, when in reality only 50% stoppage is likely to be achievable. If you are to fly, the World Health Organization guidance suggests the highest-risk area is the two rows in front, behind or next to an infected person.</p> \n<h2>Testing<br></h2> \n<p>There will now be a shift in testing. The contain phase was about isolating individual cases, getting a diagnosis and then \u201ccontact-tracing\u201d the people they have spent time with and asking them to self-isolate. Many people will no longer be tested if they are showing mild symptoms. Instead, those with the most serious symptoms will be given a blood test in a hospital, and the NHS will move into a phase of prioritising the most seriously ill.</p> \n<h2>The peak<br></h2> \n<p>Scientists and medics are using this phrase a lot, and it means the highest potential rate of cases. For the UK, the peak is expected to fall in three months\u2019 time, likely in the summer months, and tail off throughout the autumn, the government said. Vallance said that the UK is around four weeks behind Italy, where there have been 1,000 deaths and more than 15,000 cases. The peak also brings the biggest period of challenge for the NHS. There are 5,000 ventilated beds but the service is looking to increase that number. Without a cure, the main treatment is oxygen therapy, which can be provided through a mask, and the NHS is looking to increase supplies.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 March 2020. Updated guidance asks people to self-isolate at home if they have either or both of the following symptoms, not only both as an earlier version said: a new and persistent cough, and a temperature of 37.8C and above. This has been corrected.</p>",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Fears that the US president had turned the possibility of a global recession into a certainty sent share prices into a tailspin and by the end of a day of turmoil, the FTSE 100 index was down 639 points \u2013 a drop of almost 11%.</p> \n<p>In other developments, the Electoral Commission urged the government to postpone local and mayoral elections in May, while next week\u2019s planned Brexit talks in London were called off.

Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, said between 5,000 and 10,000 people in the UK are thought to have the virus now, as it spreads undiagnosed.</p> \n<p>From now on, anyone with symptoms of the coronavirus must stay at home, schools should not undertake trips abroad and those aged over 70 with underlying health problems should not go on cruises, he said.</p> \n<p>However, the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt criticised the government for not doing more, saying that countries that had closed schools and \u201cacted earlier on social distancing\u201d had seen success in halting the spread of the virus. He said people would be concerned that the government had not adopted policies such as the banning of external visits to care homes. \u201cI think most people\u2019s priority is their elderly loved ones who are most vulnerable,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Experts also criticised the measures as too limited to have a major effect and inadequate, given the scale of the looming threat to health.</p> \n<p>\u201cI can\u2019t see that any of these measures are going to have a big impact \u2026 none of that is really going to affect transmission in the UK,\u201d said Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the university of East Anglia.</p> \n<p>Prof John Ashton, former regional director of public health for northwest England, said: \u201cThis is a kind of ragbag with no particular logic to it \u2026 they are issuing some semi-directive things but they are not really doing what we need to do, which is to mobilise and encourage communities, neighbourhoods, families to form their own plans for the next period in which the local situation will influence what happens \u2013 whether it\u2019s not going out to eat, or stopping sporting events.\u201d</p> \n<p>Coming on the day that Ireland decided to close all schools and colleges until 29 March, Johnson\u2019s decision not to dramatically upgrade the government\u2019s response highlighted again the stark difference between the UK\u2019s approach and that of other European countries, which have instigated tougher action.</p> \n<p>The UK is among a dwindling number of European countries \u2013 others include Belgium and the Netherlands \u2013 not to have introduced at least a partial closure of its schools. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, announced measures including a ban on gatherings of more than 100 people yesterday, but said closing schools would do more harm than good at this stage.</p> \n<p>Flanked by Vallance and Whitty, Johnson defended their tactics.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe measures that I have discussed today \u2026 staying at home if you think you have the symptoms, your whole household staying at home, looking after the elderly \u2013 making sure the elderly and vulnerable stay at home \u2013 these are the three most powerful defensive lines,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>But Hunter said older people had been \u201cleft out on a limb\u201d by ministers not setting our more detailed plans to protect their health.</p> \n<p>Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the UK\u2019s response \u201chas clearly not been sufficient\u201d. He and other experts called for much more extensive testing and tracing of the contacts of those diagnosed with Covid-19.</p> \n<p>However, there was broad support for schools staying open, given children\u2019s low risk from the virus and the economic and practical impact of parents left unable to work because they were looking after their offspring.</p> \n<p>Signs that financial markets were starting to freeze up in response to growing evidence of economic distress caused by the pandemic created echoes on Thursday of the near-collapse of the banking system in 2008 and prompted an emergency cash injection from America\u2019s central bank.</p> \n<p>But the action by the New York Fed was not enough to make good the damage caused by Donald Trump, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ecbs-plan-to-support-eurozone-banks-is-underwhelming\">botched attempts by the European Central Bank to reassure</a> investors proved counter-productive.</p> \n<p>The prospect of a sharp fall in business and tourist travel prompted concern over the financial health of airlines and saw an 80% drop in the share price of Finablr, owner of the airport money business Travelex.</p> \n<p>But the pain suffered by sectors seen as especially sensitive to travel restrictions and weaker consumer demand was only part of a wider selloff that saw a fall in the share price of every FTSE 100 company.</p> \n<p>Since the markets started to take fright at the economic implications of Covid-19 in late February, the FTSE 100 has fallen by more than 2,000 points to 5,237 and seen its value plummet by \u00a3543bn.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 March 2020. An earlier version implied in the standfirst that it was chief medical officer Chris Whitty who suggested that half a million people could die. In fact Prof Whitty made it clear that he did not want to put \u201cspeculative numbers\u201d into the public domain.</p>",

Medical, scientific and public health experts criticised the steps outlined to tackle what the prime minister described as the \u201cworst public health crisis for a generation\u201d, including ending school trips abroad, stopping older and vulnerable people taking cruises and the use of self-isolation for a temperature and cough lasting four hours. Schools are to remain open and large gatherings such as sports events and concerts will go ahead, amid concerns that moving too soon with stricter measures could bring public fatigue, though the prime minister said both measures remained under consideration. The moves put England and Wales at odds with neighbouring countries. Scotland moved to ban gatherings of more than 500 people from next week, while the Republic of Ireland and France became the latest countries to announce the closure of all schools. Johnson\u2019s moves came as the stock market in London suffered its blackest day since 1987, with panic selling \u2013 triggered by Donald Trump\u2019s surprise ban on travel between the US and the Schengen zone \u2013 surpassing the worst seen in the 2008-09 financial crisis. Fears that the US president had turned the possibility of a global recession into a certainty sent share prices into a tailspin and by the end of a day of turmoil, the FTSE 100 index was down 639 points \u2013 a drop of almost 11%. In other developments, the Electoral Commission urged the government to postpone local and mayoral elections in May, while next week\u2019s planned Brexit talks in London were called off.

Ministers and health chiefs are bracing themselves for an imminent sharp rise in infections and deaths. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, said between 5,000 and 10,000 people in the UK are thought to have the virus now, as it spreads undiagnosed. From now on, anyone with symptoms of the coronavirus must stay at home, schools should not undertake trips abroad and those aged over 70 with underlying health problems should not go on cruises, he said. However, the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt criticised the government for not doing more, saying that countries that had closed schools and \u201cacted earlier on social distancing\u201d had seen success in halting the spread of the virus. He said people would be concerned that the government had not adopted policies such as the banning of external visits to care homes. \u201cI think most people\u2019s priority is their elderly loved ones who are most vulnerable,\u201d he said. Experts also criticised the measures as too limited to have a major effect and inadequate, given the scale of the looming threat to health. \u201cI can\u2019t see that any of these measures are going to have a big impact \u2026 none of that is really going to affect transmission in the UK,\u201d said Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the university of East Anglia. Prof John Ashton, former regional director of public health for northwest England, said: \u201cThis is a kind of ragbag with no particular logic to it \u2026 they are issuing some semi-directive things but they are not really doing what we need to do, which is to mobilise and encourage communities, neighbourhoods, families to form their own plans for the next period in which the local situation will influence what happens \u2013 whether it\u2019s not going out to eat, or stopping sporting events.\u201d Coming on the day that Ireland decided to close all schools and colleges until 29 March, Johnson\u2019s decision not to dramatically upgrade the government\u2019s response highlighted again the stark difference between the UK\u2019s approach and that of other European countries, which have instigated tougher action. The UK is among a dwindling number of European countries \u2013 others include Belgium and the Netherlands \u2013 not to have introduced at least a partial closure of its schools. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, announced measures including a ban on gatherings of more than 100 people yesterday, but said closing schools would do more harm than good at this stage. Flanked by Vallance and Whitty, Johnson defended their tactics. \u201cThe measures that I have discussed today \u2026 staying at home if you think you have the symptoms, your whole household staying at home, looking after the elderly \u2013 making sure the elderly and vulnerable stay at home \u2013 these are the three most powerful defensive lines,\u201d he said. But Hunter said older people had been \u201cleft out on a limb\u201d by ministers not setting our more detailed plans to protect their health. Martin Hibberd, professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the UK\u2019s response \u201chas clearly not been sufficient\u201d. He and other experts called for much more extensive testing and tracing of the contacts of those diagnosed with Covid-19. However, there was broad support for schools staying open, given children\u2019s low risk from the virus and the economic and practical impact of parents left unable to work because they were looking after their offspring. Signs that financial markets were starting to freeze up in response to growing evidence of economic distress caused by the pandemic created echoes on Thursday of the near-collapse of the banking system in 2008 and prompted an emergency cash injection from America\u2019s central bank. But the action by the New York Fed was not enough to make good the damage caused by Donald Trump, and botched attempts by the European Central Bank to reassure investors proved counter-productive. The prospect of a sharp fall in business and tourist travel prompted concern over the financial health of airlines and saw an 80% drop in the share price of Finablr, owner of the airport money business Travelex. But the pain suffered by sectors seen as especially sensitive to travel restrictions and weaker consumer demand was only part of a wider selloff that saw a fall in the share price of every FTSE 100 company. Since the markets started to take fright at the economic implications of Covid-19 in late February, the FTSE 100 has fallen by more than 2,000 points to 5,237 and seen its value plummet by \u00a3543bn. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 March 2020. An earlier version implied in the standfirst that it was chief medical officer Chris Whitty who suggested that half a million people could die. In fact Prof Whitty made it clear that he did not want to put \u201cspeculative numbers\u201d into the public domain.",

The trigger for market turmoil came after Donald Trump unveiled a unilateral ban on travel from 26 EU countries, sparking renewed stock market panic after a week of heavy selling pressure, as tensions rise between nations over the best way to respond to the virus. The pound also suffered, falling by about 2 cents against the US dollar to $1.259 \u2013 its lowest since October \u2013 as investors sought safety in the American currency, which is typically regarded as a safe haven during times of heightened financial turmoil. The rush to buy dollars also pushed down the euro by 1.5%, back below $1.11. The widespread losses came despite the ECB becoming the latest global central bank to unleash emergency stimulus measures, following efforts by the Fed and the Bank of England, which announced an emergency cut in interest rates on Wednesday alongside Rishi Sunak\u2019s expansionary budget. The stimulus measures to try to prop up the fragile eurozone economy included loosening restrictions on lending by banks in the currency bloc, and buying more private sector bonds. However, the ECB president, Christine Lagarde, did not unveil the interest rate cut expected by investors and called instead for eurozone governments to step in with increased spending. The normally sure-footed Lagarde came under fire after she refused to echo her predecessor, Mario Draghi, and say the bank would do whatever it takes to protect the eurozone from a recession. Referring to calls for the ECB to help ease borrowing costs for highly indebted eurozone countries, Lagarde said: \u201cWe are not here to close [bond] spreads, there are other tools and other actors to deal with these issues.\u201d The cost of borrowing for the Italian government soared, sparking fears of a repeat of the 2012 eurozone debt crisis when the then ECB boss, Draghi, declared he would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to preserve the euro. Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the ECB chief\u2019s intervention was a \u201cdisaster\u201d given the scale of the challenge facing the global economy. \u201c[Her] performance will go down as a catastrophic failure by part of the ECB. It is one of the world\u2019s largest central banks, and today markets were crying out for a backstop; they got anything but,\u201d he said. Banking bosses from lenders including Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and Natwest were summoned by Rishi Sunak and Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, to discuss coordinated action to support small businesses. The group of lenders, which also included Santander, Virgin Money and Danske Bank, confirmed they were making more than \u00a320bn available for companies that needed emergency financing over the coming months.",

The panic selling prompted by the coronavirus has wiped \u00a32.7tn off the value of STOXX 600 shares since its all-time peak on 19 February. <br></p> <p> \u201cToday has been utterly brutal,\u201d said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst of the online trading platform Markets.com. \u201cMarkets are at breaking point, there is a real systemic risk now with financial markets in complete turmoil over the coronavirus.\u201d</p> <p>In the most significant intervention to date, the New York Fed said it would offer three blocks of $500bn into an arm of the financial markets which allows banks to exchange government bonds for cash. It came amid signals that the international financial system was coming under severe strain from some of the most extreme movements in stocks and bonds for a generation.</p> <p>Governments and companies use bond markets to borrow money from investors. In the 2008 credit crunch, banks stopped lending to one another as panic spread through the system. The Fed warned it had identified \u201chighly unusual disruptions\u201d amid widespread concern over the unfolding economic damage from Covid-19. <br> However, the move provided only a brief respite for share prices on Wall Street, before the Dow plunged again in what also turned out to be its worst day since 1987.  European markets suffered the steepest losses, with shares in France and Germany plummeting by 12%, in Spain by 14% and Italy \u2013 at the heart of the outbreak in Europe \u2013 falling by almost 17% in its worst day on record.  The trigger for market turmoil came after<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/12/stock-markets-tumble-trump-europe-travel-ban-ecb-christine-lagarde-business-live?page=with:block-5e6a60c08f085f0b8d9474fc#block-5e6a60c08f085f0b8d9474fc\"> Donald Trump unveiled a unilateral ban on travel from 26 EU countries</a>, sparking renewed stock market panic after a week of heavy selling pressure, as tensions rise between nations over the best way to respond to the virus. <br> The pound also suffered, falling by about 2 cents against the US dollar to $1.259 \u2013 its lowest since October \u2013 as investors sought safety in the American currency, which is typically regarded as a safe haven during times of heightened financial turmoil. The rush to buy dollars also pushed down the euro by 1.5%, back below $1.11.  The widespread losses came despite the ECB becoming the latest global central bank to unleash emergency stimulus measures, following efforts by the Fed and the Bank of England, which announced an emergency cut in interest rates on Wednesday alongside Rishi Sunak\u2019s expansionary budget.  The stimulus measures to try to prop up the fragile eurozone economy included loosening restrictions on lending by banks in the currency bloc, and buying more private sector bonds.  However, the ECB president, Christine Lagarde, did not unveil the interest rate cut expected by investors and called instead for eurozone governments to step in with increased spending.  The normally sure-footed Lagarde came under fire after she refused to echo her predecessor, Mario Draghi, and say the bank would do whatever it takes to protect the eurozone from a recession.  Referring to calls for the ECB to help ease borrowing costs for highly indebted eurozone countries, Lagarde said: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/12/stock-markets-tumble-trump-europe-travel-ban-ecb-christine-lagarde-business-live?page=with:block-5e6a5a028f087df56e4c7609#block-5e6a5a028f087df56e4c7609\">\u201cWe are not here to close [bond] spreads, there are other tools and other actors to deal with these issues</a>.\u201d <br> The cost of borrowing for the Italian government soared, sparking fears of a repeat of the 2012 eurozone debt crisis when the then ECB boss, Draghi, declared he would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to preserve the euro.  Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the ECB chief\u2019s intervention was a \u201cdisaster\u201d given the scale of the challenge facing the global economy.  \u201c[Her] performance will go down as a catastrophic failure by part of the ECB. It is one of the world\u2019s largest central banks, and today markets were crying out for a backstop; they got anything but,\u201d he said.  Banking bosses from lenders including Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and Natwest were summoned by Rishi Sunak and Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, to discuss coordinated action to support small businesses.  The group of lenders, which also included Santander, Virgin Money and Danske Bank, confirmed they were making more than \u00a320bn available for companies that needed emergency financing over the coming months.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/marketsneil/status/1238214730264829953\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">US Fed injects $1.5tn to markets as Dow and FTSE suffer worst day since 1987 <a href=\"https://t.co/4eycdRuq75\">https://t.co/4eycdRuq75</a></p>&mdash; Neil Wilson (@marketsneil) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marketsneil/status/1238214730264829953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 12, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Goodnight, and good luck. <strong>GW </strong>and <strong>JJ</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T22:02:30.276Z\">at 10.02pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e6aadc28f085f0b8d9478a0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T21:50:08.726Z\">9.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bitcoin is continuing to slump -- at a pace that dwarfs the stock market tumbles today:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/1238215558291771399\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wow! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#bitcoin</a> is down 30%... <a href=\"https://t.co/lqbcdNkGaz\">pic.twitter.com/lqbcdNkGaz</a></p>&mdash; jeroen blokland (@jsblokland) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/1238215558291771399?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 12, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Although other assets have suffered similarly steep declines in recent weeks:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Convertbond/status/1238211971717181441\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Drawdowns from Recent Highs: <br><br>Oil: -53%<br>Bitcoin: -46%<br>Delta Airlines: -46%<br>Tesla: -42%<br>Goldman: -40%<br>JP Morgan: -38%<br>Transports: -36%<br>Russell 2000: -35%<br>FANGs: -28%<br>S&amp;P 500: -27%<br>Nasdaq 100: -25%<br>Amazon: -23%<br>Consumer Staples: -19%<br>Gold: -7%<br>Cash: 0%<br><br>via: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BearTrapsReport?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@BearTrapsReport</a></p>&mdash; Lawrence McDonald (@Convertbond) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Convertbond/status/1238211971717181441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 12, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T21:50:22.951Z\">at 9.50pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e6aac1a8f08c2df6d2789d9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T21:42:11.908Z\">9.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Tho\u2019 markets in the US and Europe are closed, the futures markets are still open.</strong></p> <p>And they suggest markets are going to fall again tomorrow, with the German DAX currently 3% lower on IG\u2019s overnight futures trading. </p> <p>Not a good sign for Friday.

The Fed will widen the purchases to a broader range of debt.<br></p> <p>Shepherdson said:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is a full-blown crisis response operation, intended to make it abundantly clear that the Fed will not allow liquidity to dry up.

This is a world away from the bill purchases, which effectively just allowed banks to swap bills for reserves at the Fed. This action will offset the inevitable downward pressure on money supply growth as economic activity contracts. It should weaken the dollar and raise asset prices, other things equal. They won\u2019t be, but these actions should limit the damage. We expect the FOMC to announce indefinite purchases at next week\u2019s meeting, alongside a rate cut of at least 50bp.

The restrictions will apply to flights from the Schengen area, so flights from Ireland plus the UK are excluded. The ban applies to people but not cargo.

It is one of the world\u2019s largest central banks, and today markets were crying out for a backstop; they got anything but. Ms. Lagarde spent significant energy on the press conference calling on fiscal policy coordination as the key tool to deal with the fallout from Covid-19. This is self-evident, but it is also extremely tone-deaf at the current juncture. We are not in the business of expressing what we think policymakers should do, but we\u2019ll make an exception on this occasion.

She even delivered the astonishing signal that the ECB is \u201cnot here to close spreads\u201d with the result that BTP yields are up over 50bp as I type, and this is an economy that has just imposed a lockdown of its economy to combat Covid-19. We are very certain that Ms. Lagarde will have to eat those particular words in due course.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6a599e8f085f0b8d9474b0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T15:48:22.172Z\">3.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b24a3580767993de604c879d2813611e59013940\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b24a3580767993de604c879d2813611e59013940/0_0_821_448/500.jpg\" alt=\"The FTSE 100 over the last decade\" width=\"500\" height=\"273\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The FTSE 100 is plunging to its lowest point since May 2012 today</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Refinitiv</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T15:48:33.854Z\">at 3.48pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e6a58848f085f0b8d947495\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T15:44:34.730Z\">3.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>My god, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is now down 10% - or 590 points, at 5287, as the sell-off accelerates in late trading.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6a542b8f087df56e4c75a7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T15:36:01.982Z\">3.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>We\u2019re into the last hour of possibly the worst session on the London stock market in over 30 years.</strong></p> <p>The FTSE 100 is still showing huge losses, down 9.3% or 547 points at 5330.

      "bodyText": "Finally, here\u2019s a reminder of today\u2019s shock moves, from Jasper and our colleague Richard Partington: Panic over the coronavirus on global financial markets amid the biggest market crash in a generation has forced the US central bank to inject trillions of dollars into bond markets in a dramatic attempt to prevent a repeat of the 2008 credit crunch. As stock prices plunged around the world on Thursday, with both the London and New York markets suffering their worst day since the Black Monday crash of October 1987, the New York Federal Reserve said it would pump $1.5tn (\u00a31.2tn) into the American financial system to stop markets from freezing up. It came after the European Central Bank failed to reassure panicked investors with a botched rescue package, as the coronavirus death toll climbs and more countries impose emergency travel bans and outlaw large public gatherings. The FTSE 100 index of leading UK company shares lost 10.87% on Thursday in the second biggest rout on record, taking total losses on the London market since mid-February \u2013 before the severity of the coronavirus outbreak became evident \u2013 to more than \u00a3540bn. The index closed down more than 600 points at 5,237, the lowest level since 2012. The Dow Jones in New York closed down 10%, losing 2,352 points to 21,200. The Euro STOXX 600 index, which tracks all stock markets across Europe including the FTSE, fell by 11.48% \u2013 the worst day since it launched in 1998. The panic selling prompted by the coronavirus has wiped \u00a32.7tn off the value of STOXX 600 shares since its all-time peak on 19 February. \u201cToday has been utterly brutal,\u201d said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst of the online trading platform Markets.com. \u201cMarkets are at breaking point, there is a real systemic risk now with financial markets in complete turmoil over the coronavirus.\u201d In the most significant intervention to date, the New York Fed said it would offer three blocks of $500bn into an arm of the financial markets which allows banks to exchange government bonds for cash. It came amid signals that the international financial system was coming under severe strain from some of the most extreme movements in stocks and bonds for a generation. Governments and companies use bond markets to borrow money from investors. In the 2008 credit crunch, banks stopped lending to one another as panic spread through the system. The Fed warned it had identified \u201chighly unusual disruptions\u201d amid widespread concern over the unfolding economic damage from Covid-19. However, the move provided only a brief respite for share prices on Wall Street, before the Dow plunged again in what also turned out to be its worst day since 1987. European markets suffered the steepest losses, with shares in France and Germany plummeting by 12%, in Spain by 14% and Italy \u2013 at the heart of the outbreak in Europe \u2013 falling by almost 17% in its worst day on record. The trigger for market turmoil came after Donald Trump unveiled a unilateral ban on travel from 26 EU countries, sparking renewed stock market panic after a week of heavy selling pressure, as tensions rise between nations over the best way to respond to the virus. The pound also suffered, falling by about 2 cents against the US dollar to $1.259 \u2013 its lowest since October \u2013 as investors sought safety in the American currency, which is typically regarded as a safe haven during times of heightened financial turmoil. The rush to buy dollars also pushed down the euro by 1.5%, back below $1.11. The widespread losses came despite the ECB becoming the latest global central bank to unleash emergency stimulus measures, following efforts by the Fed and the Bank of England, which announced an emergency cut in interest rates on Wednesday alongside Rishi Sunak\u2019s expansionary budget. The stimulus measures to try to prop up the fragile eurozone economy included loosening restrictions on lending by banks in the currency bloc, and buying more private sector bonds. However, the ECB president, Christine Lagarde, did not unveil the interest rate cut expected by investors and called instead for eurozone governments to step in with increased spending. The normally sure-footed Lagarde came under fire after she refused to echo her predecessor, Mario Draghi, and say the bank would do whatever it takes to protect the eurozone from a recession. Referring to calls for the ECB to help ease borrowing costs for highly indebted eurozone countries, Lagarde said: \u201cWe are not here to close [bond] spreads, there are other tools and other actors to deal with these issues.\u201d The cost of borrowing for the Italian government soared, sparking fears of a repeat of the 2012 eurozone debt crisis when the then ECB boss, Draghi, declared he would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to preserve the euro. Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the ECB chief\u2019s intervention was a \u201cdisaster\u201d given the scale of the challenge facing the global economy. \u201c[Her] performance will go down as a catastrophic failure by part of the ECB. It is one of the world\u2019s largest central banks, and today markets were crying out for a backstop; they got anything but,\u201d he said. Banking bosses from lenders including Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and Natwest were summoned by Rishi Sunak and Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, to discuss coordinated action to support small businesses. The group of lenders, which also included Santander, Virgin Money and Danske Bank, confirmed they were making more than \u00a320bn available for companies that needed emergency financing over the coming months. Goodnight, and good luck. GW and JJ Bitcoin is continuing to slump -- at a pace that dwarfs the stock market tumbles today: Although other assets have suffered similarly steep declines in recent weeks: Tho\u2019 markets in the US and Europe are closed, the futures markets are still open. And they suggest markets are going to fall again tomorrow, with the German DAX currently 3% lower on IG\u2019s overnight futures trading. Not a good sign for Friday. But then, as nothing\u2019s improved, why should it be? Two weeks ago, the Dow suffered its biggest points fall ever -- 1,190 points, or 4.4%. That felt like a lot at the time. Today\u2019s slump is more than TWICE as bad, in both points and percentage terms. I quite forgot to give you the Dow\u2019s closing price! Sorry. Probably the shock. Here it is, and the tech-focused Nasdaq too. Dow: down 2,352 points or 9.99% at 21,200. Nasdaq: down 750 points or 9.43% at 7,201 The Dow Jones industrial average has also suffered its worst day since the 1987 crash. Despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s $1.5trn intervention, stocks have plunged very, very sharply again. That\u2019s worrying -- the news that the Fed was aggressively providing liquidity to address this week\u2019s market turmoil has been swept aside by investors. NEWSFLASH: America\u2019s S&amp;P 500 index has plunged into a bear market tonight, after another day of shocking losses. The S&amp;P 500 has just closed, down 260 points or 9.51% at 2,480. That\u2019s its worst one-day fall since 1987 -- matching the historic losses in Europe today. Baseball\u2019s only sport. Just like the markets are only money. But the postponement of America\u2019s Major League Baseball season tonight brings home to Wall Street just how much of an impact Covid-19 is going to have, With just 10 minutes to go, Wall Street is still showing heavy losses again. The S&amp;P 500 is down 8%, which means it will be in a bear market when the closing bell rings, while the Dow Jones industrial average is down 2,120 points or 9%. The International Air Transport Association, which represents most of the world\u2019s airlines, has warned that President Donald Trump\u2019s shock ban on visitors from most of Europe could drive some carriers out of business: IATA had already predicted that the crisis could wipe out over $100bn of revenue - but even that extreme scenario didn\u2019t include such severe measures. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale strategist Albert Edwards, who has long been predicting an economic downturn, has warned today that stock markets are still very vulnerable - and shouldn\u2019t be regarded as at bargain levels. Edwards (known as a perma-bear in City circles) wrote: \u201cThe toxic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic\u2019s bursting of the Fed\u2019s \u2018everything bubble\u2019 has collided with the grotesquely over-leveraged and vulnerable US corporate sector. This puts equity markets in an even more vulnerable position.\u201d Here\u2019s a number for you: Europe\u2019s blue-chip stocks have lost \u20ac3tn (\u00a32.7tn) in market value since hitting their highest level on record last month. The last three weeks have wiped out almost seven years of gains for Europe\u2019s largest companies (including many of those on the FTSE 100, Germany\u2019s Dax and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB, amongst others). The index has been running since 1998. This is the calculation from the kind people at Stoxx\u2019s owner, Deutsche Boerse: On February 19 the Stoxx Europe 600 reached its all time high with an index level of 433.90. The corresponding free-float market cap of all constituents on that day summed up to \u20ac9.372 trillion. As of close today (March 12) the free-float market cap is \u20ac6.372tn (sic), meaning \u20ac3tn of market cap was lost. And this is what that looks like (the vertical lines on the right-hand side): A worrying report from Reuters on the Treasury market, suggesting there are serious issues even after the Federal Reserve stepped in. The promise of $1.5tn of liquidity is a sign that the Fed is taking the problems about as seriously as they come. The Treasury market (for US government bonds) is the benchmark for prices all over the economy, meaning any disruptions could be very serious across the financial system. Here\u2019s part of the Reuters report: Liquidity in the $17tn Treasuries market has deteriorated to its worse levels since the financial crisis, traders said, and some market participants are concerned that conditions could lead to investors being forced to sell assets across markets. Fears about the spreading coronavirus and how badly it will impact the global economy have sent investors running from stocks and into lower-risk assets, including Treasuries, which hit record low yields on Monday. \u201cLiquidity has definitely dried up, it\u2019s the poorest I\u2019ve seen since the financial crisis,\u201d said Justin Lederer, an interest rate strategist and trader at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. Conditions in Treasuries have not been orderly. Investors this week said they struggled to get satisfactory market prices for some bonds while the spread between the cost of buying and selling bonds widened dramatically, making it more expensive to trade. A recap: here\u2019s the damage from across Europe on a day that will be remembered long into the future (for all the wrong reasons). The FTSE 100 fell by 10.87%, its most since 1987 (the day after Black Monday). That was the second worst daily fall since the index started on 3 January 1984. The Euro Stoxx 600, which tracks shares across Europe and the UK, fell by 11.48% \u2013 the worst day since that record began in 1998. Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB lost 16.92%, its worst loss ever. Germany\u2019s Dax index fell by 12.24%; France\u2019s Cac 40 lost 12.28%. The car industry and the insurance sector were the worst performing sectors. Market participants are shellshocked. Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: Markets are at breaking point, there is a real systemic risk now with financial markets in complete turmoil over the coronavirus, Treasury markets showing immense signs of stress and a scramble for dollars whacking FX markets all over the place. Today has been utterly brutal. European shares had their worst day ever and it is not unduly pessimistic to suggest that panic has taken hold. US stocks are almost back where they were before the NY Fed intervened. The S&amp;P 500 is down by 7.9%. The Dow Jones industrial average has lost 8.3%, the Nasdaq has lost 7.7%. Oil prices were briefly boosted by the Fed\u2019s intervention in the markets, but the good cheer did not last. A barrel of Brent crude, the North Sea benchmark, will set you back $32.71, according to futures prices. That represents a fall of 8.6% today. Prices were briefly almost at $36 per barrel only this morning. Here\u2019s the long haul: a chart showing oil prices since 2015. On a normal day that would be the headline gracing newspaper front pages. Today it feels almost like a footnote. It\u2019s worth taking a look back at some of the moves among UK shares on the FTSE 100 and the FTSE 250 today. Here\u2019s the picture of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 (there aren\u2019t any gainers): The FTSE 250 fell by 9.35% \u2013 its third worst day. Among the mid-caps: Finablr, the owner of Travelex, lost 79.9% of its value today. It said it has launched an internal investigation into its financial situation and that it will take steps to address a liquidity squeeze. Premier Oil lost 45% after a lender send it should abandon proposed acquistions to save cash. Go Ahead, the operator of buses and rail services such as Southeastern, dropped 31.5% after it said it would be hit in the second half of the year. In fact, the Fed\u2019s actions in total represent more than $1.5tn in liquidity: $500bn for the three-month repo market today, followed tomorrow by $500bn in that market and $500bn in the one-month repo market. Seema Shah, chief strategist, Principal Global Investors, said: The Fed finally stepped up to the plate today, recognising the desperate need for aid from several parts of capital markets. By expanding its balance sheet significantly, injecting over $1.5tn into short-term funding markets, the Fed is acting aggressively to prevent a liquidity crisis from taking hold of the global financial system \u2013 a fear that had been driving equity markets lower and credit spreads wider. The relief has been immediate, with stocks paring their losses as investors stop their indiscriminate selling. It remains to be seen how long risk assets will continue to be supported against a backdrop of global quarantines, travel bans, and spreading infection. But the Fed has certainly fulfilled its role of lender of last resort for markets today, injecting not just funds, but reassurance that someone is watching over them. The actions of the NY Fed (which is responsible for market operations on behalf of its parent, the US Federal Reserve) have sparked talk of a return of quantitative easing. It\u2019s \u201cQE4\u201d, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He pointed to a modification of the Fed\u2019s $60bn purchases of bonds, which it carries out to manage the stock of assets built up under quantitative easing. The Fed will widen the purchases to a broader range of debt. Shepherdson said: This is a full-blown crisis response operation, intended to make it abundantly clear that the Fed will not allow liquidity to dry up. [...] It\u2019s inconceivable to us that the Fed will not extend these operations; they can\u2019t do anything which reduces policy accommodation, even at the margin. In other words, we expect the Fed to purchase $60bn of securities across the spectrum for the foreseeable future: QE4 is here. This is a world away from the bill purchases, which effectively just allowed banks to swap bills for reserves at the Fed. This action will offset the inevitable downward pressure on money supply growth as economic activity contracts. It should weaken the dollar and raise asset prices, other things equal. They won\u2019t be, but these actions should limit the damage. We expect the FOMC to announce indefinite purchases at next week\u2019s meeting, alongside a rate cut of at least 50bp. Now it\u2019s up to Congress to fire the fiscal bazooka, the bigger and quicker the better. Prime minister Boris Johnson has described the coronavirus outbreak as the \u201cworst public health crisis for a generation\u201d. The true number of cases is higher, \u201cperhaps much higher\u201d, than the latest figures suggest, he said. More families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time. You can follow those developments here: The $500bn operation came too late for European markets, but it appears to have given limited succour to US investors. The US repo markets are a crucial part of the financial system, allowing banks and other financial institutions to borrow money against US government Treasury bonds. The NY Fed\u2019s statement said that there had been problems in transactions in this market. However, the liquidity actions will not address the underlying economic weaknesses that are scaring investors. Here\u2019s the full statement from the New York Fed. Fireman Fed? Hello, Jasper Jolly here, taking over from Graeme Wearden. And the news isn\u2019t stopping: The Federal Reserve Bank of New York has stepped in with three $500bn injections of liquidity into markets \u2013 helping US stocks to recover some losses. The NY Fed\u2019s actions came after \u201chighly unusual disruptions in Treasury financing markets associated with the coronavirus outbreak\u201d. This is from their statement: Today, March 12, 2020, the Desk will offer $500 billion in a three-month repo operation at 1:30 pm ET that will settle on March 13, 2020. Tomorrow, the Desk will further offer $500 billion in a three-month repo operation and $500 billion in a one-month repo operation for same day settlement. Three-month and one-month repo operations for $500 billion will be offered on a weekly basis for the remainder of the monthly schedule. The Desk will continue to offer at least $175 billion in daily overnight repo operations and at least $45 billion in two-week term repo operations twice per week over this period. The S&amp;P 500\u2019s losses recovered to about 3.5% in the immediate aftermath of the move, but then sold off again. It\u2019s now down by about 5.7%. More details to come... *This post has been corrected. An earlier version said there had been one injection of $500bn; in fact, there were three planned. Today\u2019s slump has wiped another \u00a3160bn off the value of Britain\u2019s biggest blue-chip companies, I calculate. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares listed in London has now plunged by almost 30% in the last three weeks - a shockingly sharp move, with a severe impact on savers, pensions funds and ISA holders. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has suffered its biggest one-day loss since October 1987, and its second worst day ever. The escalating coronavirus crisis has triggered an absolute rout in the City again, and around Europe, as Donald Trump\u2019s EU flight ban sparks alarm -- and fuels fears of a global recession. Investors appear to be pricing in a serious pandemic, with quarantine measures and lockdowns in major cities leading to huge economic cost, and losing faith that policymakers can prevent it. The FTSE 100 has just closed down 10.87% today at 5237, a loss of 639 points. Its only worse day was 20th October 1987 (as this chart shows). There are some deep, deep losses - mining giants Anglo American and Glencore shed 18% and 17% respectively. Cruise operator Carnival plunged 17% too, after suspending its Princess cruises line for two months. Holiday firm TUI also lost 17%. Insurance giant Prudential and asset manager Standard Life Aberdeen both lost at least 16%, with Barclays down 17%. Every single share fell, in a bigger wipeout than Monday\u2019s slump. David Madden of CMC Markets sums up the day: It has been yet another horrendous day in the markets as fears surrounding the health crisis continue to rise. Trump\u2019s travel ban set the scene, and even though the European Central Bank (ECB) announced measures to assist the eurozone, dealers remained in selling mode. The ECB kept the refinancing rate on hold at 0.0%, but the deposit rate was also left unchanged at -0.5%, while traders we expecting it to be cut to -0.6%. The central bank will assist SMEs in the currency area through a new targeted lending operation, and the terms will be more favourable. In addition to that, $120 billion of quantitative easing was revealed too. Christine Lagarde, the ECB chief, called for a co-ordinated and ambitious response to the crisis, and traders will be looking ahead to Monday\u2019s euro group meeting to see if there is a show of strengthen and unity. The ECB can only do so much on its own. Robust fiscal action is needed too. In relation to the government bond market, Lagarde, said they we not there to \u2018close spreads\u2019, but the stimulus addicted markets didn\u2019t like that one bit, hence why European equites are massively lower. The airline sector has had a terrible few weeks but things have gotten even worse for the industry on account of President Trump\u2019s decision to introduce a travel ban from Europe. The restrictions will apply to flights from the Schengen area, so flights from Ireland plus the UK are excluded. The ban applies to people but not cargo. The drastic move is aimed at stemming the health emergency in the US. Newsflash: Italy\u2019s stock market has closed down 17%, Reuters is reporting - its worst day ever. The EU-wide Stoxx 600 also had a terrible day, down 11% at the close of trading. We\u2019re just waiting for London to close now, but it\u2019s going to be awful. Donald Trump continues to insist that the coronavirus will \u201cgo away\u201d, speaking at the White House earlier. That will further alarm investors who fear the President isn\u2019t taking the crisis seriously enough. Donald Trump\u2019s decision to ban EU flights from America was \u201cthe most expensive speech in history\u201d, says Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. \u201cInvestors are voting with their feet, and I can\u2019t blame them. Markets wanted reassuring, and this was not reassuring.\u201d And with European markets down 10% today, and Wall Street down over 8%, it\u2019s hard to argue. Global stock markets have plunged into a bear market today, Reuters reports. Today\u2019s plunges in London, Paris, Frankfurt, New York, Tokyo, Seoul, Shanghai, Sydney and beyond have dragged the MSCI All-Country World index off over 20% from recent peak, less than a month ago. As Dennis Dick, proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas, puts it: \u201cIt\u2019s not just the fear of the economy going weak, but basically being on the brink of shutting down. \u201cIt\u2019s mass selling across the board (and) we are pricing in a potential to go into another financial crisis.\u201d Christine Lagarde is trying to repair the damage from her comment about \u201cnot being here to close [bond] spreads\u201d. She\u2019s told CNBC that the European Central Bank\u2019s new package to protect the economy from the coronavirus will help close \u201cdislocations\u201d in the bond market: ECB chief Christine Lagarde appears to have caused serious panic in the market today. During her press conference, she was asked about the jump in bond spreads (the gap between yields on risky and less risky assets) -- and appeared to reply that it wasn\u2019t her problem. That has driven Italian bond yields soaring today. As I flagged earlier, Lagarde\u2019s message was that government\u2019s need to step up -- but investors are now panicking that the ECB is abandoning Mario Draghi\u2019s pledge to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d. Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says it is a \u201cdisaster\u201d - far worse than the ECB\u2019s notorious interest rates hikes in 2011 as the eurozone crisis was kicking off. It is a major factor behind today\u2019s rout (along with the shock of Donald Trump\u2019s flight ban). Vistesen writes: Sometimes you\u2019re just dealt a bad hand. The ECB came into this meeting with volatility and fear dialled to a max; that isn\u2019t easy. That being said, today\u2019s performance will go down as a catastrophic failure by part of the ECB. It is one of the world\u2019s largest central banks, and today markets were crying out for a backstop; they got anything but. Ms. Lagarde spent significant energy on the press conference calling on fiscal policy coordination as the key tool to deal with the fallout from Covid-19. This is self-evident, but it is also extremely tone-deaf at the current juncture. We are not in the business of expressing what we think policymakers should do, but we\u2019ll make an exception on this occasion. Here is the message, the ECB should have sent today. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what fiscal policy will do. We hope they act. In the meantime, we will backstop the financial system and real economy using our position as a central bank with unlimited firepower. \u201c Instead, Ms. Lagarde repeatedly referred to the need for fiscal policy to step up, even \u201ccome first\u201d, eroding with a few sentences the power that her predecessor spent two terms nurturing. She even delivered the astonishing signal that the ECB is \u201cnot here to close spreads\u201d with the result that BTP yields are up over 50bp as I type, and this is an economy that has just imposed a lockdown of its economy to combat Covid-19. We are very certain that Ms. Lagarde will have to eat those particular words in due course. My god, Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 is now down 10% - or 590 points, at 5287, as the sell-off accelerates in late trading. We\u2019re into the last hour of possibly the worst session on the London stock market in over 30 years. The FTSE 100 is still showing huge losses, down 9.3% or 547 points at 5330. That would be the third-worse session in the index\u2019s history (going back to to 1984), exceeded only by the crash of 1987 [which took place over 2 days]. Every stock is down, still, with travel firms and financial stocks bottom of the pile. Back on Wall Street, traders are preparing for the official end of the Bull Market. The S&amp;P 500 index is down over 7.2%, or 196 points, at 2,544 -- or over 20% off its all-time high earlier this year. Unless there\u2019s a miracle rebound, it will end in bear market territory (as the Dow did yesterday), ending a stretch dating back to March 2009. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (-28%) and Royal Caribbean Cruises (-25%) are the biggest faller. The Dow is down another 8%, or over 1,900 points right now -- chemicals firm Dow Inc (-16%), American Express (-12%) and Boeing (-11%) are leading the rout. The chairman of Tesco has told UK shoppers not to panic about food shortages. Chairman John Allan told BBC radio that the supermarket\u2019s supply chains were coping, despite signs that shoppers are hoarding toilet roll, pasta, tinned goods and cleaning products. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of product in the supply chain, there\u2019s plenty of food at Tesco and other supermarkets, and I don\u2019t think anybody needs to panic buy. \u201cWe, and I\u2019m sure our competitors, are re-filling our supply chains as rapidly as ever we can.\u201d The ECB\u2019s new stimulus measures are broadly positive for banks, so it\u2019s concerning that financial stocks are plunging. So what\u2019s going on? Investors are realising that central banks have pretty much extended themselves, using all the tools at their disposal. The problem is that their efforts aren\u2019t being matched by fiscal stimulus by governments across the EU. (A point that ECB\u2019s Christine Lagarde has made ad nauseam, not just today.) If governments fail to take action - primarily by spending money to support small businesses and individuals as they weather the effects of the coronavirus outbreak - it could result in a wave of defaults, which could wipe out investments and pile banks with bad debts. Benjie Creelan-Sandford, an equity analyst at Jeffries said: We read the ECB measures on balance as positive for banks - it provides strong liquidity backstop while reduction in capital requirements offers flexibility. However, without follow-through from governments on fiscal measures to assist the most challenged parts of the economy, the market is likely to remain fearful about spillover impacts and eventual real losses for banks. ECB president Christine Lagarde has called for European leaders to help the eurozone\u2019s ailing economy, as the bond markets flash alarmingly. With markets plunging on both sides of the Atlantic, Lagarde told reporters in Frankfurt that Covid-19 was \u201ca major shock\u201d to the growth prospects of the global economy and the euro area economy. But she also argued the effect would be temporary, if the right measures are taken. Lagarde told today\u2019s (unusually sparsely attended) press conference that: \u201cWhat happens after a severe and temporary fall, provided the right measures have been taken by all the players, is that the economy will then bounce back. \u201cThe exact timing of that is uncertain. There will be a rebound but the timing is uncertain.\u201d And those measures must include government spending -- in an \u201cambitious, co-ordinated\u201d response which must also tackle the public health challenge before us. Lagarde demanded: I really would like all of us to join forces, I very much hope that the fiscal authorities appreciate that we will only deal with this shock if we come together.\u201d Lagarde also revealed that the ECB is splitting itself into teams, so it can keep working through the crisis. That includes its own executive board, and the next press conference in April will be online-only. Lagarde also defended the stimulus measures announced today, saying that the new liquidity, cheap bank loans and extra asset-purchases would target the risks in the euro area. But there\u2019s clearly disappointment -- the yields on Italian, Spanish and Portuguese bonds are surging, in their biggest one-day moves since 2016. That shows investors are ditching peripheral-area bonds, and fearing a new debt crisis could be brewing. European bank shares are being routed, with ING down 16%, ABN Amro down 15%, Deutsche Bank down 14% and Credit Agricole down 12.7%. Financial stocks in London are also plunging; life insurance and financial services group Prudential are down 18%, while Legal &amp; General are down 14%. The market crash is sending investors racing to buy dollars. This has sent sterling reeling, down 2 cents today to $1.26 - the lowest since October. Trading has been briefly halted in Brazil too, where stocks plunged another 10%. It\u2019s another horrific day in the markets, turning into the bleakest sell-off we\u2019ve seen since this crisis began. The FTSE 100 index is on track for its worst one-day fall since 1987. Worse than Monday\u2019s plunge. Worse than any single day in 2008 after Lehman Brothers failed. Right now, here\u2019s the situation: Dow: down 2,015 points or 8.5% at 21,537 FTSE 100: down 540 points or 9.1% at 5322 Trading has resumed on Wall Street, and the Dow has promptly plunged by 2,000 points! That takes the index down to a new one-year low, and shows just how serious this market crash is turning into. Investors are becoming petrified of a worldwide recession, a coronavirus pandemic, widespread losses that leave companies unable to repay debts. And Donald Trump\u2019s statement last night is clearly failing to provide reassurance or support. News that trading has been suspended on Wall Street has triggered a monster selloff in Europe. The FTSE 100 has plunged 9%, shedding 546 points to just 5,330.37 -- levels not seen since 2012. European stock markets have crated by 10% -- which would be the worse day ever for the Stoxx 600 index of EU companies. NEWSFLASH: Trading has been briefly suspended on the US stock exchange, for the second time this week. Automatic circuit breakers kicked in shortly after the open, at 9.30am New York (1.30pm UK), when the S&amp;P 500 index plunged 7%. The Dow has also plunged 7%, losing 1,696 points to 21,856 in opening trades. Investors are clearly more worried than ever about a global recession and a Covid-19 pandemic, following president Trump\u2019s shock EU travel ban announced late last night. That activates a 15-minute suspension (as happened on Monday). The coronavirus crisis has forced the Princess Cruises line to suspend global operations for the next two months. Princess\u2019s 18 cruise ships will be off duty for the next 60 days, a big blow to owner Carnival (whose shares were down 20% earlier) Two Princess ships have been at the heart of the crisis. The Diamond Princess was quarantined off the coast of Japan -- 700 passengers became infected, and 6 died. The Grand Princess was denied entry to San Francisco Bay last Wednesday en route back from Hawaii as authorities learned some passengers and crew had developed flu-like symptoms. It was finally allowed to dock on Monday: The top faller on the FTSE 250 is Finablr, which runs Travelex. Shares are down 66% (!) after it warned it might struggle to access cash needed to manage its business as well as negotiate longer term financing. Restaurant Group, which runs Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s, Garfunkel\u2019s and Wagamama, are down 23%. Clearly it would suffer from mass self-isolation in the coming weeks... ...as would airport food operator SSP, who are down 19%. Shares in UK train and bus operators are slumping today, after Go-Ahead warned the coronavirus would hurt profits. National Express are down 18%, First Group has lost 17%, Stagecoach are off 12%, and Trainline are down 11%. Their revenues would all suffer if fewer people travel into work (as seems imminent). Go-Ahead itself is down 30%, making it one of the big fallers on the FTSE 250. Back in the UK, Travel insurers Aviva, InsureandGo, and the Post Office have followed LV= and have withdrawn cover for future coronavirus claims, or stopped selling policies. On Wednesday night LV= shocked the travel industry when it announced that it would stop selling all travel insurance policies with immediate effect, due to the coronavirus outbreak. The move appears to have been prompted by the World Health Organisation declaration of a pandemic, on Wednesday afternoon. Industry regulator the European Banking Authority is delaying its EU-wide stress test by a year so that banks can focus on the challenges posed by the coronavirus outbreak. Instead, the EBA said it would launch a transparency exercise to determine how much risk they hold on their balance sheets. The EBA said. \u201cAddressing any operational challenges banks may face should be the priority. The EBA has decided to postpone the EU-wide stress test exercise to 2021. This will allow banks to focus on and ensure continuity of their core operations, including support for their customers,\u201d It also urged national regulators to take advantage of existing rules that allow for some flexibility around the kind of capital that banks have to hold to cushion against potential downturns and risks. The announcement comes just a week after EBA banned all external meetings at its Paris headquarters until 20 April to try tackle the spread of Covid-19. By resisting a rate cut today, the ECB has left its benchmark rate at 0%. It will continue to impose a negative rate of 0.5% on commercial bank deposits left at the ECB (to encourage lending). And that means that today\u2019s new cheap loans to banks will be priced at -0.75%. In other worse, the ECB will be paying commercial banks to borrow - as long as they actually pass this money onto the real econmy. European stock markets are plunging deeper into the red following the ECB\u2019s announcement. The FTSE 100 is now down 420 points, or 7.1%, at 5456 -- which would be its lowest close since 2012. The German DAX is also sliding: And....the eurozone bank index has hit a record low. And also.... the gap between German and Italian government bonds has widened. That suggests there\u2019s disappointment that the ECB hasn\u2019t gone further today, either with a rate cut or some targeted help for Italy. The European Central Bank is also relaxing the capital rules on banks, to help them through the crisis. It says: The European Central Bank (ECB) today announced a number of measures to ensure that its directly supervised banks can continue to fulfil their role in funding the real economy as the economic effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) become apparent. \u201cThe coronavirus is proving to be a significant shock to our economies. Banks need to be in a position to continue financing households and corporates experiencing temporary difficulties. The supervisory measures agreed today aim to support banks in serving the economy and addressing operational challenges, including the pressure on their staff,\u201d said Andrea Enria, Chair of the ECB Supervisory Board. NEWSFLASH: The European Central Bank has announced new stimulus measure to support the eurozone economy through the coronavirus shock. It is launching new longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs), which will offer liquidity to the financial system, saying: Although the Governing Council does not see material signs of strains in money markets or liquidity shortages in the banking system, these operations will provide an effective backstop in case of need. It is also offering new, very cheap loans for banks, to encourage lending: These operations will support bank lending to those affected most by the spread of the coronavirus, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises. Thirdly, it is boosting its quantitative easing (asset-purchase) scheme by \u20ac120bn A temporary envelope of additional net asset purchases of \u20ac120 billion will be added until the end of the year, ensuring a strong contribution from the private sector purchase programmes. In combination with the existing asset purchase programme (APP), this will support favourable financing conditions for the real economy in times of heightened uncertainty. BUT it has also left interest rates on hold at today\u2019s meeting, resisting pressure to cut to new record lows. It\u2019s just passed noon, and there\u2019s no recovery in the City. The FTSE 100 is still being hammered, down 5.7% or 341 points at 5534. Every share is still down. Holiday firms Carnival and TUI are among the worst of a very bad lot, down 14% each. Thameslink and Southeastern rail operator Go-Ahead is in discussions with the Government on relaxing the rules around timetable changes to cope with the conoravirus pandemic, reports the Press Association Chief executive David Brown explained he is hoping to be allowed to make changes faster than the current 70-day notice period. \u201cWe want to be able to respond far quicker. Let\u2019s say everyone wants to travel off-peak, we want to be able to make more services available.\u201d Food delivery group Deliveroo has introduced a \u201cno contact drop-off service\u201d as concern grows about the coronavirus pandemic in the UK. The app-based food delivery company told customers they will be able to request in the app that their food is left on the doorstep, thus \u201cremoving the need for direct contact for both parties.\u201d A spokesperson says this will keep customers, riders and restaurants safer. The coronavirus crisis has forced housebuilder Berkeley Group to suspend a \u00a3455m payout to shareholders, a mixture of dividends and share buybacks, until there is greater clarity on the economic impact of the pandemic. It added that there had been \u201cno noticeable impact\u201d on its business so far. The US travel ban could pile further pressure on oil markets by cutting demand for jet fuel, according to Rystad Energy. Oil prices fell to just above $33 a barrel this morning after President Trump\u2019s ban on European flights for the next 30 days. The Norwegian energy analysts said traders received the news \u201cvery negatively\u201d for three reasons: first, the cancelled flights could dent demand for oil by around 600,000 barrels; but importantly the move also stokes fear of further economic slowdown, and undermines confidence in the governments\u2019 handling of the fall-out. The oil market was already reeling from a double-blow due to the impact of the coronavirus and plans for an oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. Rystad has warned that oil prices in the $20s are not far off if the pair battle for dominance by pouring more oil into the market while demand remains weakened by Covid-19. (Contango is when the price of a commodity today is lower than the forward price) Ireland has just announced that schools, universities and childcare facilities will close until 29 March, due to Covid-19. Acting PM Leo Varadkar also said people should limit mass gatherings, work from home where possible, and stagger their break times. Lloyd\u2019s of London\u2019s temporary, one-day closure will affect thousands of brokers and underwriters. Just under 50,000 people hold a pass to the building, but don\u2019t all turn up every day, and Friday is a quieter day, John Neal explains. Newsflash: Lloyd\u2019s of London will close its underwriting room for 24 hours from midnight, until midnight on Friday, says its chief executive John Neal. This closure of the four-floor \u2018room\u2019 will allow Lloyd\u2019s to test its emergency protocols, and to deep clean the market. From next week, a third of workers on its risk team (around 100 people, out of 800 workers) will be working in the office, a third from home and a third from third party site, Neal explains. Neal says the underwriting room has never been closed before. He says there are no confirmed coronavirus cases at the corporation, but added that there are \u201canecdotal stories of one to two cases\u201d. Bitcoin is tumbling too. The crypto-currency has slumped from $7,859 last night to around $6,600 as I type, a drop of 15%. Trading is extremely volatile. It appears to be suffering from the coronavirus pandemic, as people try to get hold of cash (perhaps to cover losses on other investments) Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at interactive investor, warns that Wall Street is on track for another plunge in three hours time: The latest pronouncement from the US has exacerbated the sour mood, with a travel ban from Europe dealing another blow to the beleaguered tourism and travel sector. At the same time, the lack of any specific positive measures in the update has given markets an additional and unwelcome hit to factor in to share prices. Notable by its absence at the moment is any good news. The coronavirus has yet to peak, the oil price is under renewed pressure (although this may prove positive for consumers in the medium term) and only a fraction of the eventual economic cost has been confirmed, even though a growing number of companies are valiantly trying to put a figure on the hit to their earnings. Meanwhile, there is nowhere to hide, with even the traditional haven of gold in negative territory today. Sellers are pushing against an open door, and the situation could unfortunately get worse before it gets better. Hours ahead of the open, Dow futures have already hit the \u201climit down\u201d circuit breakers, which suggests that another traumatic day is in the offing. The number of brave souls trying to snap up shares, hoping we\u2019re near the bottom of the slump, is falling too: Even interactive investor customers are buying with less conviction. Of those choosing to trade today, 75% are buyers, which compares to the initial falls on Monday this week where the figure was 90%. Warnings about corporate debt levels are coming home to roost en masse thanks to the coronavirus, flags up economics professor Nouriel Roubini: After over two hours of frenzied trading, European markets are still a mess - trading at their lowest levels since 2016. In London, the FTSE 100 is still down over 5%, having briefly hit its lowest level since 2012 this morning. That wipes another \u00a380-odd billion off the index, pushing its coronavirus crisis losses over \u00a3450bn. The top faller on the Footsie is now betting firm Flutter, after rival Betway was hit with an \u00a311.6m penalty for taking stolen money from its VIP customers. But otherwise, the top fallers are companies particularly exposed to president Trump\u2019s travel ban - or the prospect of tighter movement controls in the UK. Rolls-Royce, which makes engines for the world\u2019s aeroplane manufacturers, are down 12.5%. Holiday firm TUI are down 12%, with the summer booking season looking a complete washout. Cruise operator Carnival are down 9.9%. Whitbread, which runs the UK Premier Inn hotel chain, has lost 10.7% - as companies ban staff from attending conferences. In Frankfurt, car maker Daimler, airline Lufthansa and Deutsche Bank have all lost 8% this morning. On the Paris market, steelmaker ArcelorMittal are down 9%, with carmaker Renault and airline manufacturer Airbus losing 8%. Stoxx 600: down 18 points or 5.5% at 315 FTSE 100: down 320 points or 5.4% at 5558. German DAX: down 553 points or 5.3% at 9,885 French CAC: down 251 points or 5.5% at 4,358 Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB: down 983 points or 5.5% at 16,943 Spanish IBEX: down 440 points or 5.9% at 6,995 The US travel ban, and Italy\u2019s increasingly severe lockdown, are triggering the rout, as analyst Marios Hadjikyriacos of City trading firm XM explains: Financial markets remain in absolute chaos as virus concerns run rampant. US stocks lost 5% on Wednesday and futures point to another 5% plunge when Wall Street opens today, after President Trump announced overnight that he will ban all travel from Europe for the next month to slow the spread of the virus. European stocks didn\u2019t escape the carnage, with most indices down ~6% today not just on concerns of business disruptions due to the travel ban, but also due to an increasingly worrisome flow of European news. Italy closed down most of its stores yesterday, while one country after another is closing down schools and banning public events. British train and bus operator Go-Ahead Group was warned its profits could be hurt by coronavirus (although there\u2019s no real damage yet). Reuters has the details: \u201cAt this moment in time it is not affecting us, not in any dramatic way because people haven\u2019t changed their travel patterns yet,\u201d CEO David Brown said in an interview on Thursday. But over the coming months, that could change. \u201cIf people are told not to travel, that would not be good,\u201d he said. Go-Ahead operates the GTR rail network in London and south east England, as well as London buses and buses in other parts of the UK. The market slump shows some investors are pricing in a major downturn, a lockdown of US cities, and a \u201csevere credit crunch\u201d, say analysts at Nomura: The market has been jolted to the point of breaking, and textbook common sense seems to no longer apply. To all appearances, investors are bracing themselves for a worst-case scenario in which the coronavirus spreads in explosive fashion and leads to a global recession, the lockdown of major urban centres across the US, and a severe credit crunch. It is difficult to know what investors are actually thinking, but given the extreme uncertainty over what will happen, investors\u2019 own insecurities could cause a worst-case black swan scenario to actually unfold in self-fulfilling fashion. They also believe further losses could follow, as investors continue to ditch riskier assets: Although we are simply hypothesizing here based on our estimates, we are of the impression that to the extent that relatively inexperienced market players have taken this episode as a shock, they are also likely to be quicker to conclude that the flow of bad news has been depleted. Conversely, investors who have already lived through such episodes as Black Monday and the collapse of Lehman Brothers may be less shocked by the present episode, but by the same token, they may be more inclined towards caution over what comes next. There is no data available on the age distribution of market participants. However, we suspect that the market\u2019s departure from what has passed for common sense may be encouraging more experienced investors to brace for more risk-off movements, thereby exacerbating the market plunge. Stock markets are capitulating in the face of the coronavirus\u2019s threat to the global economy (and Trump\u2019s response), says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. \u201cToday\u2019s early morning session saw a 6.3% decline in the FTSE 100 to 5,502 which put the index back to levels not seen since July 2012. Donald Trump\u2019s restrictions on travel from many parts of Europe to the US have spooked the market, particularly because his initial comments implied they would also block cargo, which he has since retracted. The travel ban will raise expectations that the US will enter recession. After all, Europe is a key source of tourists and business travel to North America and so there will be a large drop in spending which the region would normally enjoy. Today\u2019s warnings from WH Smith and Cineworld show that the real economy is now suffering, he adds: \u201cFor anyone in London, it does feel like some of the commuter trains are less busy, so too gyms and swimming pools. Daily activity is being affected by more people working or staying at home. One can only assume this trend is emerging across the rest of the country.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of grim charts out there today, but this one might be the worst. It shows how the Stoxx 50 index of Europe\u2019s largest companies is half its level before the dot-com crash: The speed and scale of the destruction of shareholder value in the last few weeks is shocking. The 25% wiped off the FTSE 100 since 21 February is equal to roughly \u00a3470bn - a huge debt in pension pots, ISAs and tracker funds. Hopes that the sell-off might abate have consistently been crushed as Covid-19 has continued to spread -- making a global recession more and more likely. Worryingly, the cost of insuring airline\u2019s debt against default is rising this morning too. The CBOE VIX index, which tracks volatility in the markets, have surged to its highest level since 2008, Reuters reports. That shows just how scared investors are about situation today. The EU-wide Stoxx 600 has plunged by 6.7% this morning, with markets an absolute sea of red. The technology sector is down 8%, consumer cyclicals have lost 7%, industrial groups are down 6.9% and banks have lost another 6.6%. This takes the Stoxx 600\u2019s losses for 2020 to 25%. Wild trading in London has driven the FTSE 100 as low as 5,482 points, down over 6% today. Every single company on the blue-chip index, and on the smaller FTSE 250 index, is down. Cineworld has slumped 30% after it warned it could breach its banking covenants if cinemas are forced to close (see earlier post). Wall Street is heading for another slump too -- trading in futures contracts have been suspended \u2018limit down\u2019, after falling 5%. Markets face a \u2018perfect storm\u2019 today, warns Ayush Ansal, chief investment officer at Crimson Black Capital: \u201cCovid-19 has triggered a chain reaction across markets that could prove unprecedented. \u201cThe travel ban is a major over-reaction from President Trump and economies and markets globally will pay the price. \u201cUnsurprisingly, the FTSE 100 fell sharply on Thursday\u2019s open and further falls are inevitable if any significant steps are announced following the[UK government\u2019s] emergency Cobra meeting. \u201cCoupled with the World Health Organisation\u2019s declaration that the Covid-19 outbreak is a pandemic, the European travel ban has created a perfect storm for markets. WH Smith shares have tumbled 17% this morning after the retailer issued a profit warning because of the coronavirus pandemic. The company flagged a \u201csignificant impact\u201d on its shops at airports in Asia Pacific, which accounts for 5% of its travel division\u2019s revenues. And in the last fortnight, passenger numbers at airports in the UK (60% of revenue), the US (25% of revenue) and Europe have also dropped. The outbreak could also affect high street spending in the UK, and will drag down WH Smith\u2019s revenues and profits this year. The company warned that revenues would be \u00a3100m to \u00a3130m lower in the year to 31 August while profits before tax are likely to be \u00a330m to \u00a340m lower. Trump\u2019s 30-day European travel ban is clearly not helping... UK chancellor Rishi Sunak has said Britain has no plans to shut its borders. Speaking on Radio 4\u2019s Today Progamme, Sunak said the evidence doesn\u2019t support such a move. He says the UK government is determined to take the right steps at the right time, an doesn\u2019t feel a travel ban is the right thing to do. Sunak also denied that the huge borrowing plans announced in yesterday\u2019s budget are a gamble, pointing out that government bond yield (interest rates) are at record lows [partly because panicky investors are piling into bonds and ditching shares] Cineworld isn\u2019t the only company warning about the impact of coronavirus this morning. The upmarket estate agents Savills has flagged that the coronavirus pandemic has caused a big drop in deals in China and elsewhere in Asia \u2013 and this could also happen in other countries as the virus spreads. Its chairman, Nicholas Ferguson, said: \u201cIn Asia, particularly China, it is clear that COVID-19 is having a significant impact on transactional activity and may have a similar effect elsewhere, depending to an extent on the length and severity of each outbreak. Our focus is on the welfare of our staff and clients and we have instituted protective measures in locations potentially affected by this virus.\u201d Cineworld, the world\u2019s second-largest movie chain, has warned if the spread of the coronavirus forced the closure of all its cinemas for two to three months it would face breaching its financial covenants with lenders. The company, which said cinema admissions in January and February were up year-on-year and are currently at a \u201cgood level\u201d, is planning cost cuts and delaying capital expenditure as virus measures. The company has no cinemas in China, where movie theatres have been closed since the beginning of February, with 75% of its business in North America. About 10% is derived from the U.K. &amp; Ireland and the remainder is from operations in the rest of the world, mostly Eastern Europe. The company said that aside from the new James Bond film, No Time To Die, which has been postponed from April to November, Hollywood studios \u201cremain committed\u201d to their movie release schedules this year. If this rout continues, the FTSE 100 index will soon hits its lowest level since 2012, when the eurozone debt crisis was raging. European stock markets are also taking a bath: The FTSE 100 has slumped to its lowest level since February 2016. Airline stocks are, predictably, being hit particularly hard. British Airways parent company, IAG, has lost 10.5%. EasyJet has slumped by 11.3%, while holiday maker TUI is off 8.7% Mining giant Anglo American has fallen 10.5%, reflecting the growing fears of a painful global recession. A fresh wave of selling in early trading has sent Britain\u2019s stock market slumping again. The FTSE 100 index has plunged by 311 points, or 5.3%, down to 5565. Every single share is falling. Jet engine maker Rolls-Royce is the top faller, slumping by 13%. Donald Trump\u2019s EU travel ban has clearly shocked City investors, and dashed hopes that the worst of the market meltdown could be behind us. Last month, before the crisis began, the FTSE 100 was trading around 7,404 points -- the stock index has fallen by around 25% since. Neil Wilson of Markets.com also believes Donald Trump has made a bad situation much worse: The World Health Organisation has finally declared the outbreak a pandemic \u2013 this is only going to force governments to feel they need to take more draconian measures, ramping up the uncertainty and the near-term economic shock. Volatility is not going anywhere, and we again see global stock markets tumbling on Thursday. So much for Trump\u2019s stimulus. Instead of his late-night presidential address calming things, it only fanned the flames raging in markets. The president has gone from calling it a Democrat hoax to banning all travel from Europe in just 12 days. A 30-day European travel ban didn\u2019t allay market fears that this virus is spreading very fast and will wreak economic havoc. Indeed, it actually makes the economic harm greater, at least in the short term Donald Trump\u2019s measures are likely to help push the world into recession, fears Mohamed El-Erian, chief economist of insurer Allianz. El-Erian warned: \u201cThe advanced economies are now likely to feel the full force of economic sudden stops that destroy both supply and demand at the same time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe collapse in economic activity risks being amplified by the economics of fear, uncertainty and adverse economic-financial feedback loops. \u201cI believe there is a high probability of global recession.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The global stock market slump is intensifying today after US president Donald Trump banned travel to America from the European Union for a month, to combat the spread of Covid-19. During a rare address to the nation, Trump blamed on the European Union for not acting quickly enough to address the \u201cforeign virus\u201d, saying US clusters had been \u201cseeded\u201d by European travellers. \u201cWe made a lifesaving move with early action on China. Now we must take the same action with Europe.\u201d The shock restrictions will affect all foreign nationals (but not US or UK citizens) coming from the Schengen area, were announced as Trump continued to downplay the severity of Covid-19 - insisting the risk was \u201cvery, very low\u201d for most Americans. Hopes of a massive stimulus package were dashed. Trump did again called for immediate payroll tax cuts, and said he\u2019d instruct the Treasury Department to allow individuals and businesses negatively affected by the coronavirus to defer their tax payments. He also promised emergency action to provide financial relief for working Americans who are ill or quarantined, and said he\u2019d push Congress for $50bn for small business loans. Trump\u2019s appearance came just hours after the Dow Jones industrial average plunged into bear market, having dropped more than 20% from its recent high. Asia-Pacific markets have been rocked already, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei falling over 4% and Australia slumping over 7%. European markets are heading for fresh heavy falls today, with the FTSE 100 being called down another 5% - or at least 300 points, down to 5576. Airlines will surely be severely hit, as they already grapple with the threat of a global downturn. Investors are losing faith in policymakers abilities to address the coronavirus crisis, with Italy now under a full-blown lockdown. Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA, says Trump has \u2018toppled the markets\u2019: Reality has swamped even the most ardent optimist in equity markets now. There is no doubt that the world is grappling with a coronavirus aggregate demand/supply shock, plus a deflationary wave on oil prices launched by Saudi Arabia and Russia. The bottom will be in sight when markets stop reacting to negative news. That is likely to be some way off yet. Given Europe\u2019s incredibly poor response so far to the developing situation, with a flock of headless chickens running around appearing more focused, and with a US travel ban in place, European stock markets could be in for an outsized drop when they open this afternoon. Later today the European Central Bank may announce stimulus measures of its own, at its regular monetary policy meeting. The agenda 12.45pm GMT: European Central Bank interest rate decision 1.30pm GMT: Press conference with ECB chief Christine Lagarde",

Why are we here? What is the point? Questions that trouble the most profound of perpetual teenagers on a daily basis, but which have far greater resonance today. It\u2019s impossible to know where this is all going: will the second leg happen? Will the competition be completed? Will anyone care by the time that happens? But here we are, so here we are.</p> <p>Rangers have struggled in the league recently, chucking away points faster than Steven Gerrard can dispense blame, but their performance against Braga in the last round of this competition was magnificent. They were thoroughly outclassed in the first leg, somehow coming back from 0-2 down to win 3-2 on a memorable Ibrox night, before a confident, disciplined performance saw them not only qualify but record a seriously impressive away win in the process. </p> <p>Tonight, though, they face an entirely different proposition. Leverkusen are a serious outfit and have beaten Dortmund, Bayern and Atl\u00e9tico this season, as well as beating Porto in both legs of the last 32. They\u2019re also in form, having won four of their last five league games \u2013 the draw in that run came away to Leipzig \u2013 beat Eintracht Frankfurt 4-0 at the weekend \u2013 and in Kai Havertz have one of the best young players in the world. Roughly, it\u2019s impossible to see a way for Rangers in this tie, except as the most profound of perpetual teenagers will tell you, the world often fails to do what it\u2019s meant to. </p> <p><strong>Kick-off: 8pm GM</strong><strong>T</strong></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T16:06:57.110Z\">at 4.06pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "That then, is us. Thanks for your company and comments \u2013 stay safe out there. Gosh, I\u2019d not fancy the away leg if i was Steven Gerrard. It\u2019s close enough so that Leverkusen can\u2019t slack, but not close enough so that his team have any kind of chance. Eeesh. Here\u2019s our report from Ibrox Stadium. In Athens, Pedro Neto grabbed Wolves an equaliser, so they\u2019ll take a 1-1 draw back to Molineux (in theory). What\u2019s especially impressive about Leverkusen is that they can play in a variety of ways and with a variety of players. They need to move the ball quicker \u2013 United and Inter won\u2019t let them pick their passes, and will defend better \u2013 but they\u2019re a lot of fun to watch. Rangers gave it a good go in the second half, and will probably rue how long it took them to get going. But the reality is that they were outclassed, and Leverkusen looked to have another gear that they didn\u2019t need. That, then, is Rangers\u2019 season. 90+2 min There\u2019s a fair chance that Leverkusen are the best side in this competition. I\u2019d expect one of them, Man United and whoever wins the Getafe-Inter tie to win this thing, if we ever get to that point. 90+1 min Morelos moves the ball across the face of the box to Hagi, who turns dextrously and shoots low ... but too close to Hradecky. 90 min There\u2019ll be three additional minutes. Diaby plays a deft one-two off Havertz and moves the ball left to Bailey, who looks to go on the outside of Polster, then chops behind his standing leg and absolutely rips a screecher that curls high into the far side-netting. That\u2019s the tie. 88 min Hagi receives the ball in centrefield on the half-turn and immediately sweeps a clever ball in behind for Morelos; Hradecky, though, is alive to it and charges out to slide clear. 87 min Leverkusen win a corner which Bailey swings out, Edmundson heading away but straight back to him; he crosses again, and this time Golsdon heads away. 85 min Kamberi breaks into space so Diaby pulls him back and is booked. That\u2019s the seventh yellow card of what hasn\u2019t been a dirty game, but it\u2019s hard to argue that any of them weren\u2019t merited. 85 min Final change for Rangers, Polster for Tavernier. Tavernier\u2019s done well, considering. 83 min \u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one to whom it has occurred that it\u2019s a high-risk approach to a tie to go two down at home then go for three late goals,\u201d says Paul Connelly. \u201cBut it worked last time for the Rangers, and they seem to be trying it again. Hard to believe they\u2019ll pull it off twice in a row.\u201d In fairness, tonight they started playing at 0-1, not 0-2. What they need is the opposite of the bloke in every Sunday league team who shouts \u201cIt\u2019s 0-0!\u201d when it\u2019s actually 32-6. 82 min Baumgartlinger replaces Aranguiz, who\u2019s been excellent. 81 min Hagi slides away from Weiser, who bites back and looks to take the ball cleanly, but he\u2019s booked and, like Kamara and Aranguiz, will miss the second leg. 80 min Aranguiz curls over the wall ... and McGregor looks like he\u2019s just watching it, before imparting the touch which takes it onto the face of the bar! The ball bounces kindly for Rangers, and they get it away. 79 min Good from Bailey, rinsing Tavernier on the outside on halfway and nashing away towards the box. Kent is in pursuit, and can\u2019t help but fall into him on the left corner of the box; he\u2019s booked. 78 min Barisic picks the near post, arcing up and over the wall ... but ruffling the wrong side of the side-netting. At the other end, some think it\u2019s in, which is always a joy. 77 min Bailey gives it away and Hagi finds Kent, who teases Wendell with a stepover then sways inside him, buying the free-kick, 22 yards out, right of centre. Wendell is booked, and Barisic right fancies this... Well! Tavernier smacks a flat, hard one towards the penalty spot and Edmundson rises unchallenged to guide a header in off the far post! We go again! 75 min Rangers win a corner down the right.... 73 min Hagi is caught in possession and Havertz powers away, so Hagi hacks him hand his hbooked. 71 min \u201cDaniel, no reflection on you OBVIOUSLY\u201d, doth protest too muches Charles Antaki, \u201cbut I\u2019m not enjoying this much; and if this is the kind of football that we shall have to forgo if all competitions are called off, then fine.\u201d I\u2019ve not minded this so much, but LASK-United was not easy to watch. Ultimately, we\u2019ve no context because we don\u2019t even know if the second leg\u2019s going to be, never mind the staggering denouement. 69 min I imagine Leverkusen will move to four at the back now. 68 min A change apiece: Hagi replaces Kamara, and Paulinho replaces Tapsoba. What a finish this is! Diaby swerves in an excellent cross that Tavernier bins, leaping and flicking. But the clearance drops perfectly for Aranguiz who, on the move, tucks home a half-volley inside the near post like it\u2019s an absolute slice of urine, which it was not, the footballing equivalent of the walk-off knockout. That\u2019ll be hard to take for Rangers, who were \u201cin a good moment\u201d, but that\u2019s also European fitba. 65 min Leverkusen already look better with Baily on the pitch and win a corner down the right which bobbles about in the air before Aranguiz tries an overhead ... which Davis, stood on the far post, bundles behind. 63 min Rangers are absolutely coming! They get it wide again, to Tavernier down the right, and he cracks a low cross towards Morelos ... but Tah reads it brilliantly to nip in front and clear. 62 min Leverkusen bring on Bailey for Bellarabi, which looks like a good change to me; yerman has been ineffective, and the roaming power of yer other man seems a better option. 61 min Rangers are stepping it up here! They\u2019ve got Leverkusen pinned back by getting their wide players higher, and are finding good angles to move the ball infield. 60 min It\u2019s funny when you get a team like Leverkusen did, full of players you\u2019ve never heard of, who turn out to be Lucio, Ballack, Basturk, Berbatov and Ze Roberto. 58 min \u201cI can\u2019t see the words \u2018Steven Gerrard\u2019 and \u2018Leverkusen\u2019 without seeing Michael Ballack dummying to shoot, Gerrard sliding to block the shot, and the two of them ending up about 8 yards apart as Ballack carefully chose his spot,\u201d says Matt Dony. \u201cOne of the most effective feints in history. It set Leverkusen up to win the game. It was heartbreaking to see Liverpool exit the Champions League that year (which feels familiar), but at least it led indirectly to THAT Zidane volley. Which made the world a better place.\u201d I saw Leverkusen that season too, when they knocked Manchester United out in the semis. Roy Keane\u2019s team-mates conceded twice after going ahead, in his absence, and then when he scored in the return allowed an equaliser. But, as you say, it earned us something special. 58 min In Athens, 10-man Olymipacos lead Wolves 1-0. Follow along here: 56 min Tavernier\u2019s corner is a good one too, aimed at Morelos; he can\u2019t quite get to it, and the ball plays Tah\u2019s arm on its way behind. The next corner comes to nothing, but this is much better from Rangers. 55 min This is more like it from Rangers, Tavernier driving at the heart of the Leverkusen defence and flicking a reverse-all in behind for Morelos! he\u2019s onto it and rams hard at the near post area, but Hradecky stick out a hand and palms behind. 54 min A mini-flurry from Rangers, mmmm McFlurry, and Kent sins Diaby down the right before heaving over a cross that Morelos stretches to reach. He gets a foot on it, but can\u2019t impart enough purchase to stop the ball sliding off it and away. 54 min Kamberi replaces Aribo, who\u2019s not been able to get into the game. 53 min Demirbay swerves this one way beyond the far post, but Leverkusen quickly win the ball back when Rangers go short from the goalkick. This time, Demirbay swipes a shot away tae Forfar. 52 min Weiser ploughs forward again and keeps going when he moves it on, reappearing on the flank to run onto Aranguiz\u2019s ball into space. He cuts back and earns a corner, which begets another. 50 min Hradecky misjudges a backpass which excites the crowd and tells you plenty about how seldom Rangers have threatened. He slides down by his post to clear. 49 min Nice from Leverkusen, Weiser progressing down the right and standing up a cross seeking Bellarabi, but Edmundson manages to insert a head between man and ball. 48 min Goldson jumps with Diaby and leaves a souvenir on his bonce, but he\u2019ll be fine. 47 min Davis looks to drive forward and the crowd roar him on, but without options he has to check. 46 min We go again.... \u201cThe quality of that pitch\u201d says Oliver Driesen. \u201cJesus! There seem to be European cities where it rains even more than here in Hamburg.\u201d Yes and apologies \u2013 I meant to note this when I noticed at kick-off. Also, it\u2019s funny you should say this \u2013 a mate of mine was lamenting his Glaswegian childhood just the other day, saying he had a permanent cold for the first 18 years of his life. On the plus side, his accent and vernacular are blinders. Half-time reading (2): Half-time reading (1): Leverkusen are much better than Rangers, obviously, but haven\u2019t threatened much. Rangers haven\u2019t created anything themselves, but if they gamble and press high up the pitch, it\u2019s far from inconceivable that they might score. 45+1 min Leverkusen pass to pass the time. 45 min There\u2019ll be two added minutes. 45 min Leverkusen knock it about the back line, playing for half-time, and nearly get caught when Rangers decide to press. They should do that more often, because it\u2019s difficult to create with so little of the ball, especially when it\u2019s won close to their own penalty box. 43 min If Leverkusen can add snap to their passing, they can finish this tie tonight, but if Rangers up the aggression \u2013 not in terms of kicking, but in terms of getting men forward and forcing the issue - they might just find something. 41 min \u201cI\u2019m just glad the football-loving public, me included, get to settle down to a game,\u201d darshans Ezra Finkelstein, \u201ca breath of fresh air to all the doom and gloom the coronavirus has sucked us all into.\u201d I\u2019m afraid that sometimes things are all doom and gloom, and we need to address them, not misdirect ourselves. I cannot believe that we\u2019re still playing, much as I wish it was the sensible thing to do. 40 min Fired with righteous indignation, Rangers bang the ball into the box and Golson is up, heading into Tah\u2019s back. Shouts for a penalty duly follow, but nothing doing. 38 min That\u2019ll be so frustrating to Rangers, because other than the fact that it came, that goal wasn\u2019t coming, and arose out of nothing. If the ball misses Edmundson\u2019s hand, it doesn\u2019t find an attacker. Ultimately, the law needs a rethink: not just what constitutes handball, but what constitutes a penalty. The way I\u2019d do it: if someone has a chance to shoot at goal, it\u2019s a penalty wherever on the pitch the infraction happened, and if not, it\u2019s a free-kick. This is done with real swagger. McGregor dives to his left, so Havertz rolls, left-footed, down the middle. Yup. It was, and Havertz places the ball on the spot... 36 min Edmundson was close to Aranguiz, but his arm was bent at the elbow and his hand was shoulder-height; he made himself bigger. The laws say that\u2019s a penalty, though perhaps they shouldn\u2019t. 34 min Edmundson loses a high ball on the right of the box and Aranguiz hoys it into the air; Goldson clears behind, but what\u2019s this? The ball clipped Edmundson\u2019s hand first, and this does not look good; the hand was up, close to the body but not where it should\u2019ve been and the ref comes over to watch some telly! 32 min There\u2019s not a lot coming to pass here. Rangers should take that as their cue to get themselves and the ball forward. 31 min Olympiacos and Wolves is still goalless, but the home side have just had Semedo sent off. Nick Ames has the latest here: 30 min A bit of scrapping by Tavernier gets the crowd excited, and then Davis spreads play to Kent, but Tapsova is there to sweep clear. 29 min Leverkusen move the ball nicely, but a bit too slowly. They\u2019re not making it difficult for Rangers, for whom Kamara drives forward ... until Demirbay runs into his trailing leg. He\u2019s booked, and will also miss the second leg; why bother? 26 min A quiet period, before lovely feet from Havertz makes space in midfield, weaving him around two challenges. Leverkusen need to get him on the ball, and he\u2019s coming deeper to find it now. 24 min Leverkusen haven\u2019t created much, for all their possession; 0-0 would be a barry result for Rangers. 22 min Barisic drives at Weiser, skipping inside him, and gratefully accepting the hack. Barisic duly humps the free-kick over the far goalline. 21 min Tah drives a ball into Diaby, who movesferim well, but Edmundson is in quickly to tackle. 20 min Weiser slides in to take the ball away from Kamara, who proceeds with his challenge as though nothing happened, sagely applying studs to ankle. He\u2019s booked, and will miss the second leg. 19 min Talking of Wendells, a word to the wise: Wendell Pierce\u2019s Desert Island Discs is absolutely sensational. 18 min Can someone please confirm that Wendell\u2019s dressing-room nickname is \u201cMr\u201d. Thanks. 17 min Wendell crosses low and well from the left but no one gambles and Rangers break, Morelos chasing after a ball and looking likely before Tah eases him out of it. 16 min ...is how long it took for Alex Rae to suggest someone rattle someone. The tackles have been \u201ca bit tepid\u201d, he reckons, which is to say no one has been bousted in the heed. 15 min Bellarabi has picked up a knock, but signals to the bench that he\u2019s alright. Meanwhile, his team have had 75 percent possession. 13 min It\u2019s pretty easy for the visitors at the moment but, thick as this sounds, that might not be awful for Rangers; Leverkusen forgetting they\u2019re in a game is one of their most likely routes to a result. 12 min More possession for Leverkusen, moving Rangers side to side. There\u2019s not a lot of pressing action, so Morelos gets involved, which sounds like the start of a very scary story. 10 min Demirbay\u2019s corner is rubbish but so is the eventuating clearance, and he collects between touchline and box, sending Arfield out for a deep-fried Mars bar with one simple sway. That opens the angle for a curling howitzer which nestles gloriously inside the top-corner stanchion, but his imagination is bigger than his precision and the shot flies wide. 9 min Nice from Leverkusen, Tapsoba sliding a ball inside Tavernier for Wendell, who clips back looking for Havertz. He can\u2019t quite find him but Bellarabi collects and his shot is deflected behind for a corner. 8 min The pitch is covered in red, white and blue confetti. I\u2019m choking up here, and will conduct the remainder of this MBM from a standing position. 7 min And I once had the privilege of seeing him involved in this. 5 min Alex Rae is in co-commentary. He once did this. 4 min But this is good from Rangers, Davis collecting the ball in centrefield and bursting past Dragovic, who clatters him and Morelos in one. Rangers take the opportunity to get Kent into the game down the left, before Tapsoba classily robs Aribo. 3 min This has settled into a pattern quicksmart, Leverkusen with the ball and Rangers sitting off. 2 min Have a look! Demirbay is given all manner of time to drill a luscious, er, diag towards the far post, where Bellarabi waits. But he can\u2019t control his volley, sending it over the top. 1 min There are two big exclusion zones either side of the away fans, which seems a bit much. And certainly different from the first time I went to Ibrox, where the fans were separated by a low fence and a row of stewards, leading to the exchange of various projectiles. 1 min Ok, off we go! \u201cRangers are gonna have to weather a storm at times,\u201d says Chris Sutton. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s how storms work, but here come the players. The commentator starts by bragging about how corona has stopped teams playing, but \u201chere, the show goes on\u201d. I think I might cry. Ok, they\u2019ve got plastic flags, proper bin-bag jobs. But there\u2019s still some good noise going. I\u2019d expect a good old row inside Ibrox tonight. There\u2019ll need to be. Rangers. United ended up edging LASK 5-0. In other English team news, you can follow Olympiakos-Wolves here: Steven Gerrard, dressed in classic Rangers school uniform of v-neck and tie, tells BT that his players need to find a level that allows them to compete. Braga played a back five, so his team know what to do against that, and his team need to do what they did in the second half of that first leg from the start tonight. He says that playing Tavernier is a bit of a risk as he\u2019s not trained, and that the team need to inspire the fans. Mason Greenwood has just put Manchester United 4-0 up in Linz, with another mortifyingly accomplished finish. You can follow the end of that here. This was a great moment. I\u2019m still trying to construct a narrative that ends with Rangers not getting done here. I\u2019m struggling. Perhaps they start fast, get the ball wide and into the box, and Leverkusen panic. I know I sound like yerda, but that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got I\u2019m afraid - there\u2019s just a huge disparity in quality between the sides. We\u2019re now rhapsodising Havertz, and the more I think about this, the more evens on Leverkusen to win looks hilarious. On BT, we\u2019re watching VT of Morelos, one of my favourites of football\u2019s current crop of nutters. He\u2019s not quite got the ability to justify it, which is great \u2013 he does it entirely lishma, for it\u2019s own sake. Ibrox Stadium is one of my favourites, and the Main Stand is one of the reasons why \u2013 it\u2019s an absolute work of art. Elsewhere: Eintracht Frankfurt 0-2 FC Basel Istanbul Basaksehir 0-0 FC Copenhagen LASK 0-2 Manchester United You can follow the third of those right here: For those of you wondering. There\u2019s a load of ability in this Leverkusen side. Tah has a high reputation, Demirbay\u2019s top level is a good level, and Havertz is an absolute brute, with a lovely touch. Their 3-5-2 looks a decent ruse as well, because it means they won\u2019t lose the numbers game in midfield and two strikers plus Havertz sounds like a difficult night for Goldson and Edmundson. Leverkusen, meanwhile, are without the injured Bender \u2013 Dragovic comes in \u2013 while Baumgartlinger and Paulinho drop to the bench, Tah and Demirbay replacing them. Steven \u201cSteven\u201d Gerrard makes two changes from the weekend win at Ross County: at right-back, Tavernier replaces Polster \u2013 I imagine Gerrard appreciates his ability to delivery quality balls into the box \u2013 and Aribo replaces Hagi, presumably because this Gerrard hopes to outrun Leverkusen, rather than out-art them. Glasgow Rangers (an implacably confident 4-3-3): McGregor; Tavernier, Goldson, Edmundson, Barisic; kamara, Davis, Arfield; Aribo, Kent, Morelos. Subs: Foderingham, Polster, Halliday, Katic, Ojo, Hagi, Kamberi. Bayer Leverkusen (a bespoke 3-5-2): Hradecky; Tah, Dragovic, Tapsoba; Weiser, Havertz, Aranguiz, Demirbay, Wendell; Bellarabi, Diaby. Subs: Ozcan, Paulinho, Bailey, Baumgartlinger, Palacios, Stanilewicz, Azhil. What\u2019s going on? Why are we here? What is the point? Questions that trouble the most profound of perpetual teenagers on a daily basis, but which have far greater resonance today. It\u2019s impossible to know where this is all going: will the second leg happen? Will the competition be completed? Will anyone care by the time that happens? But here we are, so here we are. Rangers have struggled in the league recently, chucking away points faster than Steven Gerrard can dispense blame, but their performance against Braga in the last round of this competition was magnificent. They were thoroughly outclassed in the first leg, somehow coming back from 0-2 down to win 3-2 on a memorable Ibrox night, before a confident, disciplined performance saw them not only qualify but record a seriously impressive away win in the process. Tonight, though, they face an entirely different proposition. Leverkusen are a serious outfit and have beaten Dortmund, Bayern and Atl\u00e9tico this season, as well as beating Porto in both legs of the last 32. They\u2019re also in form, having won four of their last five league games \u2013 the draw in that run came away to Leipzig \u2013 beat Eintracht Frankfurt 4-0 at the weekend \u2013 and in Kai Havertz have one of the best young players in the world. Roughly, it\u2019s impossible to see a way for Rangers in this tie, except as the most profound of perpetual teenagers will tell you, the world often fails to do what it\u2019s meant to.

In a joint statement, the presidents of the European commission and European council defended Europe\u2019s record in managing the pandemic and sharply criticised the White House for its failure to consult its allies. Travellers scrambled to rebook flights and global markets slumped after Trump imposed sweeping restrictions on travel from the passport-free Schengen zone on Wednesday night, battering airlines and further straining ties with Europe. The US president restricted travel from the zone, which does not include Britain or Ireland, for 30 days from midnight on Friday.

The European centre for disease prevention and control said in an updated risk assessment that it was \u201clikely that similar situations to those seen in China and Italy may be seen in other EU countries or the UK\u201d. In the US, which has confirmed more than 1,000 cases of coronavirus, a top health official said the country\u2019s testing system was currently failing. \u201cThe system is not really geared to what we need right now ... let\u2019s admit it,\u201d said Anthony Fauci from the National institute of allergy and infectious diseases. In other developments: In Spain, every cabinet member is being tested after equality minister Irene Montero tested positive; her partner, deputy prime minister, Pablo Iglesias, is in quarantine. The number of confirmed cases in Germany rose to 2,527, with four deaths. Slovenia, Norway and Austria suspended teaching at schools and colleges, although the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said working parents will still be able to drop off children for supervision. The Netherlands banned gatherings of more than 100, asked people to work at home and closed Amsterdam\u2019s celebrated Rijks- and Van Gogh museums. Iran\u2019s health ministry said the the virus had killed 75 more people, raising the death toll to 429 with more than 10,000 confirmed cases. Iran has asked the International Monetary Fund for an emergency $5bn (\u00a34bn) loan. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, is self-isolating while his wife Sophie Gregoire Trudeau awaits results from a coronavirus test. She began to show mild symptoms of illness late on Wednesday after a speaking engagement in the UK. Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s communications director tested positive days after travelling with the Brazilian president to a meeting with Trump in Florida. India, which has reported 73 cases, has barred all foreign tourists for one month starting on Friday, including foreign nationals of Indian origin. The Philippines halted domestic travel to and from the capital, Manila, banned mass gatherings and closed schools for a month. Stock markets in the US and Europe again posted near-record falls after Trump\u2019s travel ban sparked panic from investors. China, where the outbreak originated, said the peak had passed as it reported just eight new cases in Hubei province on Thursday. More businesses reopened as authorities cautiously eased draconian containment measures. Beijing\u2019s senior medical officer, Zhong Nanshan, an epidemiologist renowned for helping to combat the Sars outbreak in 2003, said the global epidemic could be over by June if countries were prepared to take firm measures. \u201cBut if some countries do not treat the infectiousness and harmfulness seriously, and [do not] intervene strongly, it would last longer,\u201d he said.",

The FIA and Formula 1, with the full support of the Australian Grand Prix Corporation, have therefore taken the decision that all Formula 1 activity for the Australian Grand Prix is cancelled.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe appreciate this is very disappointing news for the thousands of fans due to attend the race and all ticket holders will receive a full refund.\u201d</p> <p>The decision, which many had felt was long overdue, was pre-empted by an announcement from world champions Mercedes that they would be withdrawing from the event.</p> <p>\u201cThe Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team has today sent a letter to the FIA and F1 requesting the cancellation of the 2020 Australian Grand Prix,\u201d it read. \u201cWe share the disappointment of the sport\u2019s fans that this race cannot go ahead as planned.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, the physical and mental health and wellbeing of our team members and of the wider F1 community are our absolute priority.

      "bodyText": "The Australian Grand Prix has been called off because of coronavirus. In what had increasingly looked to be an inevitable decision, the demise of the race was drawn out, painful and undignified. From the moment the first McLaren team member was identified as having the coronavirus on Thursday evening, rumour and counter-rumour flew around Melbourne but from F1 management and Formula One\u2019s governing body, the FIA, the silence was as baffling as it was deafening. The governing bodies finally broke cover almost 12 hours after McLaren announced they were withdrawing from the grand prix on Thursday, after one of their team members was diagnosed with the coronavirus. The FIA and F1 issued a joint statement with the race organisers the Australian Grand Prix corporation. It read: \u201cFollowing the confirmation that a member of the McLaren Racing Team has tested positive for Covid-19 and the team\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Australian Grand Prix, the FIA and Formula 1 convened a meeting of the other nine team principals on Thursday evening. \u201cThose discussions concluded with a majority view of the teams that the race should not go ahead. The FIA and Formula 1, with the full support of the Australian Grand Prix Corporation, have therefore taken the decision that all Formula 1 activity for the Australian Grand Prix is cancelled.\u201d \u201cWe appreciate this is very disappointing news for the thousands of fans due to attend the race and all ticket holders will receive a full refund.\u201d The decision, which many had felt was long overdue, was pre-empted by an announcement from world champions Mercedes that they would be withdrawing from the event. \u201cThe Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team has today sent a letter to the FIA and F1 requesting the cancellation of the 2020 Australian Grand Prix,\u201d it read. \u201cWe share the disappointment of the sport\u2019s fans that this race cannot go ahead as planned. \u201cHowever, the physical and mental health and wellbeing of our team members and of the wider F1 community are our absolute priority. In light of the force majeure events we are experiencing with regards to the Coronavirus pandemic, we no longer feel the safety of our employees can be guaranteed if we continue to take part in the event.\u201d Shortly after the announcement, Ferrari issued a statement supporting the decision to cancel the race. Suggestions that the race was off had been circulating throughout the night. However initially the organisers issued a statement claiming the event would go on as planned and hospitality staff were told to attend.

The NRL said Friday night\u2019s games in Canberra and North Queensland could go ahead but a decision on the rest of the weekend\u2019s game will be taken on Saturday morning. Earlier on Friday, the government issued advice to shut down any gatherings over 500 people as of Monday. The NRL has <a href=\"https://www.nrl.com/news/2020/03/12/nrl-issues-stringent-player-guidelines-to-help-prevent-spread-of-coronavirus/\">sent an advisory document to all clubs</a> outlining measures to prevent the spread of the virus. The league has previously stated it may lock down games if advised to do so. The <strong>Women\u2019s Premiership</strong> does not start for six months, but major state competitions across Queensland and New South Wales begin this weekend.

The decision comes in the wake of the latest government advice on large gatherings. Earlier this week, the league\u2019s chief executive, Gillon McLachlan, said it remains the intention to play every men\u2019s game this season, but the AFL is prepared to heed advice from health experts and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/10/unnamed-fremantle-player-in-afl-coronavirus-scare\">exclude the public from matches</a> should the outbreak worsen.

The A-League is mid-season while the W-League\u2019s semi-finals are scheduled for this weekend and the grand final the week after. Football Federation Australia indicated on Friday all games will proceed without any restrictions, but small crowds are expected. FFA has previously stated it has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/04/watching-brief-adopted-as-australian-sport-braces-for-true-impact-of-coronavirus\">proactively monitoring the situation for months</a> and will take advice from relevant government departments before moving to cancel any matches.
