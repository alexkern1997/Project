The accord has been touted as the \"Paris agreement\" for nature, aiming to stop and reverse rampant biodiversity loss around the world.<br></p>\n    <p><b>Why is it a big&nbsp;deal?<br></b>In 2017, scientists warned that humans are causing the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/10/earths-sixth-mass-extinction-event-already-underway-scientists-warn\">sixth mass extinction in the Earth's history</a>. Overpopulation and overconsumption are driving a crisis that threatens the future of our species and life-sustaining ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>Are only governments worried?&nbsp;<br></b>No. At the 2020 World Economic Forum, business leaders warned biodiversity loss was the third biggest risk to the world in terms of likelihood and severity, ahead of infectious diseases, terror attacks and interstate conflict.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>What might the Kunming agreement look like?&nbsp;<br></b>In January, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/13/un-draft-plan-sets-2030-target-to-avert-earths-sixth-mass-extinction-aoe\">published a 20-point draft of the agreement</a>. It commits signatories to protect at least 30% of the planet, introduce controls on invasive species and reduce pollution from plastic waste and excess nutrients by 50%.

The planet\u2019s rapidly warming oceans must be the focus of increased conservation efforts due to their importance in producing oxygen and food for billions of people, the former ministers added, as governments prepare to begin negotiations for a Paris-style UN agreement on nature next week. In a statement signed by 23 diplomats \u2013 including former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright and former British foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind \u2013 world leaders are urged to back the draft UN agreement to protect almost a third of the world\u2019s oceans and land. Next week\u2019s meeting in Rome \u2013 originally scheduled to take place in Kunming, China but moved to the Italian capital in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 will be the first time governments formally react to the 20-point proposals to halt and reverse biodiversity loss. The current draft commits countries to protect 30% of the planet, introduce controls on invasive species, and reduce pollution from plastic waste and excess nutrients by 50%. \u201cThe loss and degradation of nature jeopardises human health, livelihoods, safety and prosperity.

      "bodyText": "One of Wuhan\u2019s most senior doctors has died after contracting the coronavirus as authorities began a sweeping campaign inside the city to seek out patients infected with the virus. Liu Zhiming had taken part in the battle against the virus from the start and had made important contributions in fighting and controlling Covid-19, the Wuhan municipal health commission said. During that process, \u201cunfortunately he became infected and passed away at 10.54 Tuesday morning at the age of 51 after all-out efforts to save him failed\u201d, the commission said. Confirmation also emerged of the death last Thursday of Xu Depu, the former director of the Ezhou city Chinese medicine hospital in Hubei province. A nurse at the hospital confirmed his death on Tuesday, according to reports in state media. Chinese state media reported new house-to-house checks in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people at the centre of the outbreak, that aimed to seek out and \u201cround up\u201d all infected patients. State media said anyone suspected of having the virus would face mandatory testing and anyone who had close contact with virus patients would be put under quarantine. According to Chutian Daily, a Wuhan newspaper, 10 quarantine centres similar to the makeshift Fangcang hospital will be set up across eight districts in the city, providing an additional 11,400 beds for people showing mild symptoms of infection. Buildings in factories, industrial estates and transport centres were being converted into makeshift centres for housing patients. The reports said all communities and villages would be placed under around-the-clock \u201cclosed-off\u201d management, in effect putting them under lockdowns. From Tuesday, anyone who buys cough medicine or treatments to bring down a fever in chemists or online will need to use their ID card, the state-funded site the Paper reported. The citywide inspection campaign indicates an escalation of the situation in Wuhan, where former officials have been blamed for a cover-up that led to the rapid spread of the virus. Health officials have reported nearly 50,000 confirmed cases in Hubei alone. The draconian measures come after two of the city\u2019s top leaders were sacked last week. Wuhan\u2019s new Communist party chief, Wang Zhonglin, issued the new decree, according to the Global Times, an English-language state newspaper. Officials would carry out the inspection with the help of big data and artificial intelligence, it said, without providing further details. An order on Monday from the Wuhan city legislature on \u201cwinning the coronavirus war\u201d warned that people who refused mandatory measures such as reporting cases of fever and cough to their local residential committees or going into quarantine if they were sick would be subject to \u201ccoercive measures\u201d. The order also said those who delayed reporting cases or \u201cfabricate and spread false information on the epidemic\u201d would be punished. Footage circulated on the website of the Changjiang Daily, a paper run by Wuhan\u2019s Communist party, showing officers in protective clothing knocking on people\u2019s doors and checking their temperatures. \u201cWe\u2019re racing with time. This is a heated war of annihilation, not a relaxed protracted war,\u201d a narrator says. \u201cIt\u2019s a painful process but the fight must be fought imminently. The temporary lockdown is for the sake of our reunion in the near future. Wuhan will be bustling again soon.\u201d Wuhan residents complained about the draconian lockdown on social media. \u201cWe\u2019re not allowed to go out at all, we\u2019ve lost our most basic human rights. The guards are like prison guards, abusing the little bit of power they have. We\u2019re guaranteed personal freedoms under the constitution!\u201d said a user of the the Chinese microblogging site Weibo. Another social media user also said it felt like being \u201cin prison\u201d as she was barred from leaving her house, even to go out for a stroll in the neighbourhood. The death of the whistleblowing doctor Li Wenliang, who alerted colleagues over a mysterious disease that turned out to be the coronavirus, this month unleashed an outpouring of anger and grief across the nation. Wuhan police detained and censured him last month for \u201cspreading false rumours\u201d. As in the case of Li\u2019s death, there was initial confusion in China about Liu\u2019s condition. On Monday night, the Communist party propaganda department of the Hubei health commission wrote in a social media post that Liu had died. It then said in a subsequent post that Liu was alive. Although the number of people contracting coronavirus outside Hubei province has dropped for 13 consecutive days, the situation inside Hubei continues to be serious, reported Global Times. Restrictions were tightened further in Hubei on Sunday with vehicles banned from the roads \u2013 excluding those delivering essential services \u2013 and companies told to stay shut until further notice. The notice also included locking down all residential communities in urban and rural areas, and closing non-essential public places. Meanwhile Russia announced it would temporarily suspend entry of Chinese citizens to its territory starting from Thursday, authorities there said. Additional reporting by Lillian Yang",

It was first suggested by Guy Verhofstadt, the ex-Belgian PM and then Brexit coordinator for the European parliament, who continues to back the idea. \u201cThe Maastricht treaty created the concept of \u2018European citizenship\u2019,\u201d Verhofstadt said, \u201cand I am in favour of using this now as a basis for people who want to keep their link with Europe.\u201d The chances of it making headway in \u201cfuture relationship\u201d talks are limited, though, as it would require changes to EU law. Meanwhile, Portugal is considering offering subsidised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/18/portugal-uk-tourists-post-brexit-healthcare-ehic\">post-Brexit healthcare to British tourists</a>. Rita Marques, the tourism minister, said Portugal wanted to ensure cover offered by the European health insurance card (Ehic) could continue: \u201cWe are trying to minimise the disruption to British tourism.\u201d About 2 million Britons visit Portugal every year.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>No plan for green schools \u2013 </strong>The new building for Hackbridge primary, in Sutton, opens next week as England\u2019s first zero-carbon school, able to produce and conserve as much energy as it uses, and even put power back into the grid. It is the first school in England to meet the Passivhaus Plus low-energy design standard. But only a handful of the 500-plus schools being rebuilt or refurbished are installing renewable energy technology \u2013 and the Department for Education\u2019s (DfE\u2019s) recommended designs do not include renewables, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/feb/18/renewables-barely-feature-building-programme-schools-solar-panels\">writes Liz Lightfoot</a>. In the West Midlands, warmth from canals could soon be used to heat hospitals and tower blocks. A consortium, led by London South Bank University and known as GreenSCIES, plans to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/17/west-midlands-canals-help-heat-hospitals-homes-plans\">install water source heat pumps</a> in the canal through Sandwell near Birmingham. The group already extracts \u201cwaste heat\u201d from the Northern line to warm homes in Islington, north London, accessing funds from a government renewables scheme.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Bercow \u2018no bully\u2019 \u2013 </strong>John Bercow, the former Commons Speaker, has hit out at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/17/john-bercow-says-bullying-accusers-are-snobs-and-bigots\">\u201csnobs and bigots\u201d</a> he says are behind bullying complaints against him. Speaking at a Guardian Live event, Bercow said: \u201cI was astonished when those allegations first surfaced on Newsnight nearly two years ago and for the best part of two years I\u2019ve had to put up with this issue being weaponised against me.\u201d Bercow said those concerned were \u201cpeople who are very long accustomed not just to having their say but to having their way \u2026 I make no apology for the fact that I fought my corner. But the idea I was some sort of raging bull ... has no credibility at all.\u201d Bercow has not been nominated for a peerage by the Tories despite his decade in the Speaker\u2019s chair. He said he \u201cdid care\u201d because the decision had been made against precedent: without the convention of former Speakers being sent to the Lords, future occupants of the role would be looking over their shoulders wondering if they had \u201chacked off the government\u201d.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>The offending brain \u2013 </strong>Newly published research suggests people who offend throughout their life may have shown antisocial behaviour from a young age and have an abnormal brain structure. Adults with a long history of offending showed a smaller surface area in many regions of the brain, and thinner grey matter in regions linked to regulation of emotions and behaviour, according to the UCL study. However, experts warn the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/17/long-term-offenders-have-different-brain-structure-study-says\">picture of cause and effect is far from clear</a>: genetic and environmental factors, such as childhood deprivation, may have shaped their brains early in life, and smoking, alcohol or drug abuse could come into play later. Prof Kevin McConway, of the Open University, said that even if the brain differences were down to genetics or other early-life factors, it may be those factors themselves that were involved, not the resulting brain differences.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>News of the north \u2013 </strong>The Yorkshire poet Ian McMillan has questioned why there are no newsreaders with northern English accents. The north has been prominent in news bulletins all year, from the Tory demolition of Labour\u2019s \u201cred wall\u201d to HS2 and flooding in the Calder valley. \u201cThe <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/18/why-no-northern-accents-reading-t-news-asks-yorkshire-poet\">north is a ventriloquist\u2019s dummy</a> and the south is in control of the speaking mouth,\u201d McMillan writes in the Radio Times. \u201cNewsreaders from the north aren\u2019t reading the news about themselves because, well, there aren\u2019t any.\u201d McMillan said that although the north was central to the news agenda, people from the area \u201ccan\u2019t be trusted with t\u2019autocue, tha knows\u201d.

Rita Marques, the tourism minister, said Portugal wanted to ensure cover offered by the European health insurance card (Ehic) could continue: \u201cWe are trying to minimise the disruption to British tourism.\u201d About 2 million Britons visit Portugal every year. * * * No plan for green schools \u2013 The new building for Hackbridge primary, in Sutton, opens next week as England\u2019s first zero-carbon school, able to produce and conserve as much energy as it uses, and even put power back into the grid. It is the first school in England to meet the Passivhaus Plus low-energy design standard. But only a handful of the 500-plus schools being rebuilt or refurbished are installing renewable energy technology \u2013 and the Department for Education\u2019s (DfE\u2019s) recommended designs do not include renewables, writes Liz Lightfoot. In the West Midlands, warmth from canals could soon be used to heat hospitals and tower blocks. A consortium, led by London South Bank University and known as GreenSCIES, plans to install water source heat pumps in the canal through Sandwell near Birmingham. The group already extracts \u201cwaste heat\u201d from the Northern line to warm homes in Islington, north London, accessing funds from a government renewables scheme. * * * Bercow \u2018no bully\u2019 \u2013 John Bercow, the former Commons Speaker, has hit out at the \u201csnobs and bigots\u201d he says are behind bullying complaints against him. Speaking at a Guardian Live event, Bercow said: \u201cI was astonished when those allegations first surfaced on Newsnight nearly two years ago and for the best part of two years I\u2019ve had to put up with this issue being weaponised against me.\u201d Bercow said those concerned were \u201cpeople who are very long accustomed not just to having their say but to having their way \u2026 I make no apology for the fact that I fought my corner. But the idea I was some sort of raging bull ... has no credibility at all.\u201d Bercow has not been nominated for a peerage by the Tories despite his decade in the Speaker\u2019s chair. He said he \u201cdid care\u201d because the decision had been made against precedent: without the convention of former Speakers being sent to the Lords, future occupants of the role would be looking over their shoulders wondering if they had \u201chacked off the government\u201d. * * * The offending brain \u2013 Newly published research suggests people who offend throughout their life may have shown antisocial behaviour from a young age and have an abnormal brain structure. Adults with a long history of offending showed a smaller surface area in many regions of the brain, and thinner grey matter in regions linked to regulation of emotions and behaviour, according to the UCL study. However, experts warn the picture of cause and effect is far from clear: genetic and environmental factors, such as childhood deprivation, may have shaped their brains early in life, and smoking, alcohol or drug abuse could come into play later. Prof Kevin McConway, of the Open University, said that even if the brain differences were down to genetics or other early-life factors, it may be those factors themselves that were involved, not the resulting brain differences. * * * News of the north \u2013 The Yorkshire poet Ian McMillan has questioned why there are no newsreaders with northern English accents. The north has been prominent in news bulletins all year, from the Tory demolition of Labour\u2019s \u201cred wall\u201d to HS2 and flooding in the Calder valley. \u201cThe north is a ventriloquist\u2019s dummy and the south is in control of the speaking mouth,\u201d McMillan writes in the Radio Times. \u201cNewsreaders from the north aren\u2019t reading the news about themselves because, well, there aren\u2019t any.\u201d McMillan said that although the north was central to the news agenda, people from the area \u201ccan\u2019t be trusted with t\u2019autocue, tha knows\u201d. He urged: \u201cSo, come on, people in charge: let a northern voice read the news, and not just the news about the north.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: Can fashion become sustainable? Environmental journalist Lucy Siegle has been writing about the fashion industry for 15 years. As London fashion week draws to a close, she discusses ways the industry could become more environmentally friendly. And: Laura Snapes on the Brit awards and its lack of female nominees. Lunchtime read: The great vape debate The US is cracking down on vaping while the UK is promoting e-cigarettes as an aid to giving up smoking. Where does the truth lie? Sport Frank Lampard said after Chelsea\u2019s 2-0 defeat against Manchester United \u2013 during which United\u2019s new signing Bruno Fernandes showed some much needed creative spark \u2013 that he believed Harry Maguire should have been sent off. Manchester City are unlikely to take their Uefa punishment for breaches of financial fair play legislation lying down, and word is that Abu Dhabi will be fighting back. England supporters have been urged to take a stand against the Rugby Football Union\u2019s swingeing 50% cuts to the Championship\u2019s funding during Sunday\u2019s Six Nations match against Ireland. Gymnastics star Simone Biles was named the Laureus Sportswoman of the Year for the third time on Monday, while Lionel Messi and Lewis Hamilton shared the men\u2019s award. Moeen Ali will captain Birmingham Phoenix in the inaugural Hundred competition and says he wants to promote cricket as a unifying game. Kim Clijsters\u2019 first WTA Tour match in eight years ended in defeat to Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza at the Dubai Duty Free Championships. J\u00fcrgen Klopp has said Liverpool return to the scene of their sixth European triumph not with the confidence of Champions League holders but to prove they are contenders to defend their crown in Istanbul. And the mass participation race at the Tokyo marathon, which was expected to have 38,000 people taking part, has become the latest sporting casualty of the coronavirus. Business Asian shares have fallen after Apple said it would not meet its revenue guidance for the March quarter because of the coronavirus outbreak. S&amp;P 500 e-mini futures have dipped as much as 0.3% in Asian trade. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.65% while Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei slid 1.0%. Shanghai shares dipped 0.2%, having gained in nine of the past 10 sessions largely on hopes for policy support by Beijing. The FTSE is in the order of 40 points down at time of writing while sterling is trading at $1.299 and \u20ac1.199. The papers \u201cRacist \u2018weirdo\u2019 quits No 10 job\u201d \u2013 how the Metro sums up the perhaps unsurprising departure in short order of Andrew Sabisky, taking his eugenic ideas with him. The Guardian version: \u201cNew advisers to No 10 resigns over race and intelligence controversy\u201d. Some look at the stance of Boris Johnson\u2019s chief post-Brexit negotiator with the EU. \u201cBritain will never allow EU oversight of laws, Brexit chief tells Brussels\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s the FT. A slightly less pugilistic-sounding version of David Frost\u2019s remarks in the Telegraph: \u201cBrexit can benefit all of Europe, says trade chief\u201d. The Times has \u201cBoris Johnson add odds with Cummings over BBC\u201d, reporting the PM does not agree that the licence fee should be made voluntary. The Mail is exasperated about rates being cut by National Savings and Investments (NS&amp;I), asking: \u201cWhat is the point of saving?\u201d. The Mirror splashes with \u201cFlooding hell\u201d, calling the impact of Storm Dennis a \u201cnational emergency\u201d.

Overall aid spending on the Pacific region has increased, with the region getting an extra $214m in foreign aid in the 2019-20 aid budget compared with 2014-15. But new figures, released in response to Labor questions in Senate estimates, show the Australian government has slashed budgets of some programs, including health, in favour of more spending on infrastructure. Health funding was cut in the Cook Islands by 75%, Fiji by 22%, in the Solomon Islands by 13% and in Samoa, which has been devastated by a measles outbreak that claimed the lives of more than 80 people, by 36%. The government has made much of its redirection of aid spending towards the Pacific region, at the expense of other regions, as part of its \u201cPacific step-up\u201d, which includes $3bn in infrastructure funding. Labor\u2019s spokesman on international development and the Pacific, Pat Conroy, said health had been neglected despite that emphasis. \u201cThe cuts to Australian assistance on health have also hit our Pacific neighbours particularly hard, despite the government\u2019s claims of a Pacific step-up. \u201cCutting health assistance to Samoa by 36% in the aftermath of its tragic measles epidemic raises questions about whether the Morrison government is genuinely responding to the needs of Australia\u2019s Pacific friends.\u201d The chief executive of the Australian Council for International Development, Marc Purcell, said Australia had traditionally been a leader on preventive health, but \u201cthis leadership has been lost\u201d as Australia has reduced its aid health spending by a third since 2014-15. \u201cGiven the low resilience of the region against infectious diseases, the recent spread of measles in Samoa and the threat of coronavirus, there are widely held concerns across the Pacific.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The British government, which has come under mounting pressure to fly citizens home, said on Tuesday morning it was \u201cworking to organise a flight\u201d to evacuate citizens stranded on the Diamond Princess.</p> \n<p>David Abel is among those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/15/coronavirus-pressure-grows-to-rescue-britons-stricken-liner-diamond-princess\">who have criticised the UK government\u2019s</a> response, and had appealed to Richard Branson to help evacuate British citizens.

      "body": "<p>HSBC has said it will slash 35,000 jobs over three years as part of a major shake-up as it issued a warning over the impact of the coronavirus outbreak in Asia.</p> <p>The interim chief executive, Noel Quinn, confirmed on Tuesday that plans to cut $4.5bn (\u00a33.5bn) worth of costs would involve slashing about 15% of the group\u2019s global workforce. \u201cWe would expect our headcount to decrease from the current level of 235,000 to be closer to 200,000 in 2022,\u201d Quinn said.</p> <p>\u201cThis represents one of the deepest restructuring and simplification programmes in our history.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/feb/18/apples-coronavirus-warning-markets-ftse-uk-unemployment-business-live\">Apple's coronavirus warning spooks markets \u2013 business live</a> </p> </aside>  <p>HSBC, which operates in 64 countries, said there would be \u201cmeaningful job cuts here in the UK\u201d, mainly affecting its head office operations as well as its global banks and markets business, which are largely London-based. The lender would not comment on potential branch closures in the UK but said it was keeping the network \u201cunder review\u201d. The group employs about 40,000 staff in the UK.</p> <p>Despite the planned job cuts, HSBC said it had set aside \u00a33.3bn in bonuses, down nearly 4% compared with last year. Quinn, who took over as interim chief executive after the ousting of John Flint in August last year, was paid nearly \u00a32m including a \u00a3665,000 bonus. The bank\u2019s group chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, who joined in January 2019, was handed a \u00a31m bonus as part of his \u00a34.9m pay package.</p> <p>Union officials called for urgent talks with HSBC on the planned cutbacks. </p> <p>Unite\u2019s national officer for finance, Dominic Hook, said: \u201cDespite HSBC still making billions of dollars of profit, once again hardworking and dedicated staff have woken up to the news that their job could be at risk.</p> <p>\u201cUnite is seeking urgent discussions with senior management to understand the serious impact of this announcement and what it will mean for our members in the UK.\u201d</p> <p>The UK cutbacks are part of a wider restructuring across the bank\u2019s European operations, where it aims to cut costs by 25%. HSBC is also targeting its US division, which will involve closing a third of its 224 branches, and said technology and automation would mean job losses across the bank as a whole. Apart from the cost-cutting, it also plans to shed $100bn worth of assets by the end of 2022.</p> <p>The bank also issued a warning over the coronavirus outbreak in Asia, which makes up the bulk of its profits, saying it could have an impact on its performance in 2020.</p> <p>HSBC said there had already been significant disruption for staff, suppliers and customers, particularly in mainland China and Hong Kong, and it was monitoring the situation closely.</p> <p>But if the outbreak continues to spread throughout the second half of the year, HSBC could be forced to set aside as much as $600m to deal with the business fallout. Stevenson said: \u201cWe don\u2019t expect anything like that but we do expect some increase in provisioning this year.\u201d</p> <p>Provisions for coronavirus would help cover bad debts if customers start to default on their loans.

      "bodyText": "HSBC has said it will slash 35,000 jobs over three years as part of a major shake-up as it issued a warning over the impact of the coronavirus outbreak in Asia. The interim chief executive, Noel Quinn, confirmed on Tuesday that plans to cut $4.5bn (\u00a33.5bn) worth of costs would involve slashing about 15% of the group\u2019s global workforce. \u201cWe would expect our headcount to decrease from the current level of 235,000 to be closer to 200,000 in 2022,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cThis represents one of the deepest restructuring and simplification programmes in our history.\u201d HSBC, which operates in 64 countries, said there would be \u201cmeaningful job cuts here in the UK\u201d, mainly affecting its head office operations as well as its global banks and markets business, which are largely London-based. The lender would not comment on potential branch closures in the UK but said it was keeping the network \u201cunder review\u201d. The group employs about 40,000 staff in the UK. Despite the planned job cuts, HSBC said it had set aside \u00a33.3bn in bonuses, down nearly 4% compared with last year. Quinn, who took over as interim chief executive after the ousting of John Flint in August last year, was paid nearly \u00a32m including a \u00a3665,000 bonus. The bank\u2019s group chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, who joined in January 2019, was handed a \u00a31m bonus as part of his \u00a34.9m pay package. Union officials called for urgent talks with HSBC on the planned cutbacks. Unite\u2019s national officer for finance, Dominic Hook, said: \u201cDespite HSBC still making billions of dollars of profit, once again hardworking and dedicated staff have woken up to the news that their job could be at risk. \u201cUnite is seeking urgent discussions with senior management to understand the serious impact of this announcement and what it will mean for our members in the UK.\u201d The UK cutbacks are part of a wider restructuring across the bank\u2019s European operations, where it aims to cut costs by 25%. HSBC is also targeting its US division, which will involve closing a third of its 224 branches, and said technology and automation would mean job losses across the bank as a whole. Apart from the cost-cutting, it also plans to shed $100bn worth of assets by the end of 2022. The bank also issued a warning over the coronavirus outbreak in Asia, which makes up the bulk of its profits, saying it could have an impact on its performance in 2020. HSBC said there had already been significant disruption for staff, suppliers and customers, particularly in mainland China and Hong Kong, and it was monitoring the situation closely. But if the outbreak continues to spread throughout the second half of the year, HSBC could be forced to set aside as much as $600m to deal with the business fallout. Stevenson said: \u201cWe don\u2019t expect anything like that but we do expect some increase in provisioning this year.\u201d Provisions for coronavirus would help cover bad debts if customers start to default on their loans. Individual borrowers could fall ill, while corporate customers could face financial difficulty if supply chains are disrupted due to trade restrictions or factory closures, particularly in China. Stevenson said: \u201cWe expect to take additional loan loss provisions as a result of the coronavirus and the weakened outlook for the Hong Kong economy. I think it\u2019s really a call on how long does it take to contain the virus, and certainly some of the latest data has given us more optimism on that over the last week or so.\u201d He said the bank would have further details on the impact of the virus on its full-year results when it releases first-quarter earnings on 28 April. HSBC\u2019s profits before tax for 2019 dropped 33% to $13.3bn, substantially below analysts\u2019 forecasts. The coronavirus outbreak is the latest challenge HSBC has had to face in Asia. It was also affected by anti-government protests in Hong Kong and tensions over the US-China trade war last year. However, Quinn said the lender remains committed to China, which represents a significant opportunity for growth despite recent disruptions. \u201cAbsolutely, we need to deal with the coronavirus situation in the short term but we do not see that changing the long-term strategic attractiveness of China,\u201d he said. HSBC\u2019s shares fell 6.2% in afternoon trading to 553p.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIf you think back to the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, there were critical parts coming from Japan, so Japanese producers shut down in the UK,\u201d said Prof David Bailey, of Birmingham Business School. \u201cIt depends whether they have second sourcing agreements to get parts elsewhere and whether they can flex those.\u201d</p> \n<p>Apple has been among the hardest hit of the world\u2019s major companies.

      "bodyText": "Jaguar Land Rover has warned it could run out of car parts at its British factories at the end of next week, as the coronavirus halts supplies from China. Britain\u2019s biggest carmaker added its voice to a chorus of companies counting the cost of the outbreak, as the epidemic weighs heavily on international business and trade. \u201cWe are safe for this week and we are safe for next week and in the third week we have \u2026 parts missing,\u201d said the JLR chief executive, Ralf Speth. He added: \u201cWe have flown parts in suitcases from China to the UK.\u201d Speth added that the company was currently making no sales in China, one of its most important markets. Apple cut its sales forecasts on Monday and could be set for further pain after its major iPhone supplier said quarantine protocols meant it was struggling to squeeze as many workers into its factory dormitories as usual. Elsewhere, the Parisian fashion house Chanel said it had shelved a forthcoming Beijing fashion show over coronavirus fears. As the ecomonic fallout spread, a series of companies and politicians conceded that disruption to day-to-day operations was inescapable: HSBC said it expected its sizeable Asian operations to take a financial hit in 2020 The world\u2019s largest miner, BHP, said global demand could slow South Korea proposed emergency steps to protect its economy Wall\u2019s and Richmond sausages company Kerry Group warned on revenues The UK accounting watchdog told UK firms to assess the impact of the virus on their business Energy services group Tekmar slashed its profit forecasts. Speth said JLR had enough parts from China to maintain its British production for the next two weeks but not beyond. The firm has three UK plants \u2013 Halewood on Merseyside, and Castle Bromwich and Solihull in the Midlands \u2013 but did not say if they might have to close or reduce production. \u201cIf you think back to the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, there were critical parts coming from Japan, so Japanese producers shut down in the UK,\u201d said Prof David Bailey, of Birmingham Business School. \u201cIt depends whether they have second sourcing agreements to get parts elsewhere and whether they can flex those.\u201d Apple has been among the hardest hit of the world\u2019s major companies. The smartphone maker said on Monday that the coronavirus may have shaved billions of dollars off global sales. Apple said it may not hit its sales forecast of between $63bn (\u00a348bn) and $67bn for the quarter ending this June, citing uncertainty caused by the epidemic. Its key iPhone supplier, Foxconn, has switched some of its production to making surgical masks instead of smartphones, but is reportedly struggling to get its production lines back up to speed. It usually fits eight workers into each dormitory at its factory in Zhengzhou but quarantine measures mean each now has to have their own room, the Financial Times reported. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at OANDA Europe said Apple\u2019s forecast was \u201clikely the first of many profit warnings as the coronavirus continues to wreak havoc in the world\u2019s second largest economy\u201d. Analysts have suggested that Apple\u2019s South Korean rival Samsung could benefit from the US firm\u2019s supply chain issues. But the South Korean domestic economy is far from isolated from the outbreak\u2019s effects. A day after economic forecasters warned Japan was facing a recession due to regional disruption to trade, South Korea\u2019s president, President Moon Jae-in, told members of his administration that the country needed to take \u201cemergency\u201d steps. George Magnus, associate at Oxford University\u2019s China Centre, said: \u201cThe knock-on effects from Chinese demand grinding to a halt are most acute for Hong Kong, but also for Australia, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore \u2013 and Brazil as a commodity producer.\u201d He said affected economies would recover from the impact quickly if restrictions imposed by Beijing were lifted within a few months. \u201cBut if it turns out that China sustained the clampdown regime into the early summer or beyond, then the cumulative effects would increase significantly,\u201d he said. \u201cA Chinese recession \u2013 unheard of \u2013 would send shockwaves through the world economy. Hopefully though that\u2019s a low-probability scenario.\u201d The coronavirus has already had a complex effect on global trade, hitting tourism and retail sales in the huge Chinese market. It has also caused the cancellation of industry events such as the tech sector\u2019s annual Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain. The latest global name to cancel its plans was Chanel, whose models were due to show off its latest designs at a show in Beijing in May. Chanel said the 31 rue Cambon 2019/20 M\u00e9tiers d\u2019art collection, which has already been shown in Paris, would be displayed at a \u201clater and more appropriate moment\u201d, but did not give a new date. \u201cAt the foremost are the health and well-being of its teams and clients,\u201d the company said. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the UK\u2019s accounting watchdog, has told the UK\u2019s \u201cBig Four\u201d auditors to ensure they have plans in place to analyst the effect of the outbreak on firms with operations in China. A string of companies offered updates alongside their financial results. Uncertainty about the length of the crisis is one of the largest hurdles, according to HSBC, which said on Tuesday that disruption for staff, suppliers and customers could hurt profits in 2020. Group chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, said: \u201cWe expect to take additional loan loss provisions as a result of the coronavirus and the weakened outlook for the Hong Kong economy. \u201cI think it\u2019s really a call on how long does it take to contain the virus, and certainly some of the latest data has given us more optimism on that over the last week or so.\u201d The chief executive of BHP, the world\u2019s largest mining group, said the company could be affected by falling demand if the virus is not contained by the end of March. As a major supplier of raw materials, BHP\u2019s fortunes are affected by economic growth patterns, particularly in large economies such as China. Irish food ingredients company Kerry Group, which makes Richmond sausages, said its Chinese revenues were likely to slump by 30% in the first quarter of the year. It has five factories in China and has been operating with a skeleton staff, it said. Holiday Inn owner InterContinental Hotels Group has closed or partially closed 160 out of its 470 hotels in mainland China and said it expects a short-term hit from the outbreak. The company said in January that it would allow customers to change or cancel stays in China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan up to 3 February, at no additional cost. Shares in Tekmar, a tech firm that serves offshore energy projects in China, fell by more than 20% after it cut profit forecasts, citing disruption to its shipments and supply chain. China accounts for 10% of its expected revenues. Chairman Alasdair MacDonald said the effect on the business had been \u201cunpredictable and rapid\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 February 2020 because an earlier version said that Kerry Group made Wall\u2019s Ice Cream, whereas it is a Unilever product.",

      "bodyText": "Russia will suspend entry of Chinese citizens to its territory starting from 20 February, Russian authorities in charge of coronavirus prevention have said. The suspension will be for Chinese citizens entering Russia for employment, private, educational and tourist purposes. The suspension will be temporary, the statement said. If you\u2019re just catching up, here is a quick rundown of the latest global coronavirus developments over the past few hours: There have been nearly 100 cases of human-to-human spread outside China, but WHO said there is little \u201csustained local transmission\u201d. A Wuhan hospital director has died from the virus, as authorities launched more forceful measures to round up patients. A British couple on the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship said they had tested positive for the virus, but questioned the results. Meanwhile, another Briton who had been on the ship announced he is being discharged from hospital tomorrow after testing negative for the coronavirus. A British family in a French ski resort have also left hospital after beating the disease. Boris Johnson has spoken to China\u2019s president about the outbreak, offering his sympathies to those affected. Prada has postponed a fashion show due to take place in Tokyo in May, while Chanel has delayed a Beijing show. Officials in Hubei province, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak, will adopt more thorough and forceful measures to find patients with fever, state media reported today. Records of all fever patients who have visited a doctor since 20 January will be checked, as well as the records of those who have bought over-the-counter cough and fever medications in shops and online, Xinhua reported. People will get health check-ups and, if necessary, be placed in quarantine or taken to hospital, the report added, citing a notice from the province\u2019s epidemic control headquarters. China reported on Tuesday the smallest number of new coronavirus infections since January and its lowest daily death toll for a week, but the World Health Organization said the data should still be viewed with caution. Dozens more countries across Africa and the Americas will be able to test citizens for coronavirus by the end of the week, the World Health Organization said today. Over the coming days, 40 countries in Africa and 29 in the Americas are expected to have the ability to detect the Covid-19 virus. Previously, many countries sent samples to other nations for testing in a process which can take days. Now they will be able to generate results in 24-48 hours. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO chief, said personal protective equipment has been sent to 21 countries and more will be sent to another 106 in the coming weeks. Chinese medical workers who die fighting the coronavirus outbreak will be designated as martyrs, CNN reports. Over 1,700 healthcare workers have become infected during the battle to contain the virus and several have died, with Chinese authorities coming under criticism for the pressure it is putting on staff. The deaths have included Li Wenliang, the whistleblower doctor who tried to warn of the virus in December, and Liu Zhiming, director of Wuchang hospital in Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak. Kristie Lu Stout, a CNN correspondent in Hong Kong, reported: China says it will designate all of them \u2014 the frontline doctors, nurses and medics who died while fighting the virus \u2014 as martyrs of the epicenter of the outbreak. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has flown Chinese parts in suitcases to Britain to maintain production and could run out after two weeks, as the impact of the coronavirus outbreak hits firms across countries and industries. Britain\u2019s biggest carmaker joined major global companies such as Apple in warning of the impact of the virus on supply chains, Reuters reports. Fiat Chrysler said last week it had temporarily halted output at its Serbian plant, the first such suspension by an automaker in Europe in response to the coronavirus crisis. Components made in China are used in millions of vehicles assembled around the world and Hubei province \u2013 the centre of the virus outbreak \u2013 is a major hub for vehicle parts production and shipments. The JLR chief executive, Ralf Speth, said: We are safe for this week and we are safe for next week and in the third week we have ... parts missing. We have flown parts in suitcases from China to the UK. Production at the firm\u2019s Chinese factory would recommence on 24 February and was \u201csafe for the very first week\u201d, he added. The new coronavirus has killed over 1,900 people in China and infected around 72,000, confining millions to their homes, disrupting businesses and delaying reopening of factories after the extended Lunar New Year holiday break. Speth said sales in China, the world\u2019s biggest auto market, had been hit. The knockback comes after JLR had enjoyed a recovery in sales there, helping it to return to profitability in recent quarters. \u201cThat\u2019s completely stopped. It\u2019s zero,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know whether the economy will catch up or whether this kind of loss is just a loss.\u201d A British man who was diagnosed with coronavirus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan will be discharged from hospital tomorrow. Alan Steele, who announced the news on Facebook, said he will wait in the country until he can be reunited with his wife, Wendy, and they can travel home together. The couple, who were celebrating their honeymoon on the ship, were separated on 7 February when Alan was diagnosed with the virus and taken to a nearby hospital. Although the ship\u2019s quarantine officially ends on Wednesday, new guidelines mean anyone who shared a cabin with a person who has tested negative for the virus will face another two weeks on board. Alan has now tested negative for the virus, and says he is looking forward to eating at the McDonald\u2019s near the cruise terminal. The are 92 cases in 12 countries outside China of human-to-human spread of the coronavirus, the World Health Organization chief has said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have data to make a meaningful comparison to China cases,\u201d Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus clarified. Speaking at a press conference, he added: We have not seen sustained local transmission of coronavirus except in specific circumstances like the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Dr Mike Ryan, director of the WHO health emergencies programme, said \u201cclearly there has been more transmission than expected\u201d on the cruise ship. He said Japanese authorities are adjusting to reality and taking necessary public health measures to evacuate people and deal with their follow-up care. Two Irish citizens have tested positive for coronavirus onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, Independent.ie has reported. More than 100 people have been tested in Ireland for the disease, but none have tested positive. There are six Irish nationals on the coronavirus-hit cruise ship. The two who have tested positive share dual citizenship with another EU member state and are not normally resident in Ireland. They are being treated at a hospital in Japan. The Irish deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, said: We are also in close contact with those who remain in quarantine on the ship. We are working with our EU partners and other like-minded countries regarding options for their return. A British family who contracted coronavirus at a French ski resort have been discharged from hospital, the French health minister, Olivier V\u00e9ran, has said. The British nationals, including a nine-year-old child, caught the virus from Steve Walsh, a British man who traveled to the Contamines-Montjoie resort from a conference in Singapore, where he got the coronavirus. The family were hospitalised in Grenoble, and CNN reports V\u00e9ran as saying: All of the patients that were hospitalised in Grenoble were able to leave the hospital. Thus the family that were infected, an English family, the father and his son were able to leave the hospital in Grenoble. They are no longer considered to be sick or carriers of the virus. The health minister also said a third French national had tested positive for coronavirus onboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan. French fashion company Chanel has postponed a show in Beijing, following on from Prada\u2019s decision to delay a show due to be held in Japan in May. Chanel said in a statement that following the guidance of Chinese authorities it had decided to postpone its Beijing replica of a catwalk display held in Paris last December \u201cto a later and more appropriate moment\u201d. The company is monitoring the situation closely, the statement said, adding: \u201cAt the foremost are the health and wellbeing of its teams and clients.\u201d No new date was given for the event. As the UK government makes plans to bring home the British nationals trapped on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, here\u2019s a quick summary of some the other countries which have taken similar measure, compiled by Reuters. Australia will evacuate more than 200 of its citizens and an unspecified number of New Zealand citizens onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. The passengers will depart on Wednesday and will be required to be quarantined for another 14 days. Taiwan said today it would charter a plane to evacuate its citizens from the Diamond Princess. It evacuated 247 of the estimated 500 Taiwanese stranded in Wuhan on 3 February. A plane chartered by Canada has left for Japan to evacuate its nationals aboard the virus-hit cruise ship off Yokohama. After arriving in Canada, the passengers will undergo a 14-day period of quarantine. After evacuating 215 people earlier, the country flew back 185 Canadians from Wuhan on 11 February. All evacuees are quarantined on the Trenton, Ontario, base for two weeks. The United States flew back over 300 Americans who had been stuck on the Diamond Princess. They will face two more weeks of quarantine, after spending the previous 14 days docked in Japan. The US also authorised the voluntary departure of its government employees and their family members from Hong Kong on 11 February. On 6 February, two planes with about 300 passengers, mostly US citizens, took off from Wuhan for the United States. Hong Kong said it would send an aircraft to Japan to bring back passengers from the Diamond Princess, which has seen the most coronavirus infections outside of China. The Italian luxury fashion house Prada has postponed a fashion show due to take place in Japan in May. In a statement, the company said: Due to the current uncertainty related to the spread of the novel coronavirus, the Prada Resort fashion show originally scheduled for 21 May in Japan will be postponed. Prada added the decision was a precautionary measure as well as \u201can act of responsibility and respect\u201d for all those working on and planning to attend the show. The statement continued: \u201cJapan remains one of Prada\u2019s strategic markets and relevant events will be scheduled in the country at a more appropriate moment.\u201d Both Japan and South Korea have reported entering a \u201cnew phase\u201d of the coronavirus outbreak, with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, saying the situation is changing \u201cminute-by-minute\u201d in the country. The number of cases in Japan now stands at 607, with 542 on the stranded Princess Diamond cruise ship and 65 elsewhere in the country. There has been one reported death. Most worryingly, there has been an increase in the number of cases where the Japanese health ministry has been unable to figure out the origin of the transmission. The Mainichi newspaper reports that a spate of new cases is being linked to a New Year\u2019s party for taxi drivers held on a river tour boat in the capital. It reports that as of 16 February, 11 attendees and boat employees were infected with coronavirus. Repatriating passengers from the coronavirus-stricken cruise ship in Japan is not without risks, a medical expert has said. Paul Hunter, professor in Medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: Considerable care needs to be made to ensure that the passengers do not transmit infection between themselves or to cabin crew during the flight home and once back on home soil they do not act as a focus for the spread of the disease into their home countries \u2013 any returning passengers may be put in quarantine on their return. He noted that while the quarantine seems to have been effective at stopping the spread of infection around the world as passengers return home or continue their travels, it hasn\u2019t stopped the coronavirus passing between passengers and crew. It is well known that certain infections such as influenza and norovirus can spread rapidly on board cruise ships. Cruise ships take passengers and crew from all over the world, often passengers are relatively elderly, they spend most of their time on board indoors mixing with others. The most likely [infection] route is direct person-to-person transmission when people are close to an infected person, but with currently publicly available information it is not possible to rule out other issues at this stage. Many countries, including the US, Canada and Australia have either evacuated their citizens or are in the process of doing so. The UK government has said it is in the process of organising a flight to bring back British nationals as soon as possible. Boris Johnson has spoken with the president of China about the coronavirus outbreak. A Downing Street spokesman said: The prime minister spoke to President Xi of China this morning. He offered his sympathies for those affected by the outbreak of coronavirus in China. President Xi thanked the UK for its support and in particular welcomed the donation of vital medical equipment to China. The prime minister and president agreed on the importance of the UK-China relationship and resolved to work together across a range of issues including strengthening the economic partnership, to benefit the people of both China and the UK. The spokesman added that ahead of COP26 in Glasgow and the Convention on Biological Diversity Summit in China, the two leaders pledged to would work closely together on the issue of climate change. They agreed that biodiversity and climate change are two sides of the same coin and must be addressed in tandem if we\u2019re to protect the planet for future generations. A social media campaign in Australia is urging people eat at Chinese restaurants, to combat disinformation and racialised stigma surrounding the coronavirus outbreak. The #IWillEatWithYou campaign hopes to boost struggling Chinese businesses in the country, with many owners reporting a drop in sales caused by coronavirus fears. On the campaign page, set up by Australian political activist group GetUp!, a call to action reads: As misinformation about coronavirus spreads across social media, local Chinese restaurants and stores are paying the price - with some losing up to 50% of their revenue. While other restaurants and public spaces are still buzzing, it is the Chinatown restaurants and Asian grocers that stand empty. Panic around the virus is unfairly impacting Chinese and Asian communities. If we don\u2019t take action \u2013 people will lose their jobs, and their livelihoods. Can you take the pledge to defeat baseless fears and support these businesses in their time of need? The Foreign Office has the \u201cutmost concern\u201d for the British people on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, two of whom may have tested positive for the virus. In an updated statement, a spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: We have the utmost concern for the British people currently on the cruise ship. We are ensuring those who have been diagnosed with coronavirus receive the best possible care in Japan and are organising a flight back to the UK for other British nationals on the Diamond Princess as soon as possible. The UK accounting watchdog has called on all British businesses to flag up the full extent of the risks posed by the coronavirus outbreak to their companies, PA Media reports. The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said companies had a duty to make \u201cup-to-date and meaningful\u201d disclosures to investors on the potential impact of the disease. PA Media also reported that the FRC is in talks with accountancy firms over the potential effect that coronavirus could have on their ability to sign off accounts, given travel restrictions in China. UK firms with Chinese subsidiaries can only review audit files within the country, as Chinese data protection laws prevent this being done remotely. An FRC spokesman said: Given the potential for rapid spreading of the virus, required disclosures will likely change over time as more information about the epidemic emerges. Companies will need to monitor developments and ensure they are providing up-to-date and meaningful disclosures to their shareholders when preparing their year-end reports. Thirty doctors in Brighton are currently in isolation after coming into contact with a GP who tested positive for coronavirus, the Argus reported. A frontline clinician told the local paper: \u201cThere are 30 doctors in isolation after coming into contact with a GP who tested positive for coronavirus at the CCG meeting. Public Health England told them to self-isolate. This is a risk. \u201cThere would have been a day or two in between them coming into contact with the GP with coronavirus and being traced and told to self-isolate.\u201d A spokesman for Brighton and Hove CCG said there have been no new cases in the city for more than a week. He added: \u201cAll doctors and other primary care health workers in Brighton and Hove who were advised to \u2018self-isolate\u2019 as a precaution are expected to be returning to work this week.\u201d The two-week quarantine of the Diamond Princess cruise ship ends on Wednesday, with thousands of passengers and crew set to disembark over the next several days in the port of Yokohama, near Tokyo. But a number of scientists told the Associated Press that the ship could have served as an incubator for Covid-19 instead of a quarantine facility that was meant to prevent the worsening of the outbreak. \u201cI suspect people were not as isolated from other people as we would have thought,\u201d said Dr Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, in England. \u201cObviously the quarantine hasn\u2019t worked, and this ship has now become a source of infection,\u201d said Dr Nathalie MacDermott, an outbreak expert at King\u2019s College London. She said the exact mechanism of the virus\u2019s spread was unknown. \u201cWe need to understand how the quarantine measures onboard were implemented, what the air filtration onboard is like, how the cabins are connected and how waste products are disposed of,\u201d MacDermott added. A small number of Irish people are onboard two cruise ships where coronavirus has been detected, the Irish government has said, according to a report by PA Media. Simon Coveney said his foreign affairs department was in contact with citizens on the Diamond Princess in Japan and the Westerdam off Cambodia. He told RT\u00c9\u2019s Morning Ireland: It\u2019s a small number though, and we\u2019re dealing with each individual case. There is a second cruise ship off Cambodia, we\u2019re working with Irish nationals on both of those ships to make sure they\u2019re safe. And if they\u2019re in quarantine, to make sure those conditions are safe. The department said in a statement: We are closely following the events concerning the Diamond Princess and we are in contact with the Irish citizens concerned. We are continuing to liaise closely with like-minded countries, EU partners, and the health authorities in Japan and here in Ireland concerning the best course of action. Hundreds of people have tested positive for the virus onboard the quarantined Diamond Princess. The Associated Press has reported the latest breakdown of the number of cases and deaths from the coronavirus outbreak. The viral outbreak that began in China has infected more than 73,000 people worldwide. Here are the latest figures reported by each government\u2019s health authority as of Tuesday morning (UK time): Mainland China: 1,868 deaths among 72,436 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei Hong Kong: 58 cases, 1 death Macao: 10 Japan: 607 cases, including 542 from a cruise ship docked in Yokohama, 1 death Singapore: 77 cases Thailand: 35 South Korea: 31 Malaysia: 22 Taiwan: 22 cases, 1 death Vietnam: 16 cases Germany: 16 United States: 15 cases; separately, 1 US citizen died in China Australia: 14 cases France: 12 cases, 1 death United Kingdom: 9 cases United Arab Emirates: 9 Canada: 8 Philippines: 3 cases, 1 death India: 3 cases Italy: 3 Russia: 2 Spain: 2 Belgium: 1 Nepal: 1 Sri Lanka: 1 Sweden: 1 Cambodia: 1 Finland: 1 Egypt: 1 Another 88 passengers onboard the Diamond Princess have tested positive for the new coronavirus, ABC News reports. The son of the British couple who tested positive for the coronavirus while on board the Diamond Princess described the government\u2019s response as \u201cappalling\u201d. David and Sally Abel, who published video diaries from a cruise ship quarantined off the coast of Japan, said they have tested positive for the new coronavirus. Their son, Steve, told BBC Breakfast: \u201cMy assessment of the government treatment to them \u2026 appalling. \u201cThey haven\u2019t done anything. They probably are behind the scenes, which is great if they are, but no one is communicating with us. The FCO have got my number, my wife\u2019s number, my brother\u2019s number, my sister\u2019s number and they haven\u2019t got back to us on anything. We\u2019ve been calling them every day for about four or five days.\u201d David Abel, from Oxfordshire, announced on Facebook that he and Sally had tested positive for the new virus. In a later post, however, he said he doubted his diagnosis. \u201cFrankly I think this is a setup! We are NOT being taken to a hospital but a hostel. That\u2019s where partners are sent waiting out their quarantine,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNo phone, no wifi and no medical facilities. I really am smelling a very big rat here! Waiting for the transfer now.\u201d Asked in the comments below one of his posts whether he was sure the test was positive, he replied: \u201cI doubt it was positive. If it was, we would be in hospital.\u201d Philippines\u2019 tourism and travel industry is projected to lose billions of peso with the temporary travel ban imposed on travellers from China, in the aftermath of the novel coronavirus outbreak. Apple has announced it could miss its revenues target in the first quarter of 2020 because of the coronavirus outbreak. European shares dropped as a revenue warning from the iPhone maker sent \u201cshockwaves through the tech sector\u201d. Reuters reports: The pan-European STOXX 600 index fell 0.8% by 0803 GMT, having ended at a record high on Monday after China outlined fresh stimulus measures to mitigate the virus\u2019 economic impact. However, Apple\u2019s warning that it would miss its March quarter sales outlook due to the outbreak, along with news of a slower-than-expected recovery in the firm\u2019s Chinese factories swiftly culled any optimism. Apple\u2019s Frankfurt-listed shares dropped more than 6%, while those of STMicroelectronics NV and Dialog Semiconductor PLC, which supply components to Apple, fell 4% and 4.9%, respectively. The technology-heavy German stock index plunged 0.9%, while the European tech subindex fell 1.5%. David and Sally Abel, a British couple onboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan, have tested positive for coronavirus, a day before passengers who tested negative were due to start leaving the ship after spending two weeks in quarantine. Abel, who has uploaded daily videos from the couple\u2019s cabin on social media, said in a Facebook post on Tuesday afternoon (local time): \u201cThere is going to be a time of quiet. We have been proved positive and leaving for hospital soon. Blessings all xxx.\u201d The Abels\u2019 diagnosis came as the British government said it was preparing to send a plane to Japan to repatriate about 70 British nationals from the ship, which has been moored off Yokohama, near Tokyo, since 3 February. The vessel, originally carrying 3,700 passengers and crew, was quarantined after a previous passenger tested positive for Covid-19 at the end of last month. Abel has used his video posts to apply pressure on Britain to evacuate its citizens. The US has evacuated more than 300 citizens, while Australia, Hong Kong, South Korea and Canada have said they will follow suit. The Foreign Office said: \u201cGiven the conditions onboard, we are working to organise a flight back to the UK for British nationals on the Diamond Princess as soon as possible. Our staff are contacting British nationals on board to make the necessary arrangements. We urge all those who have not yet responded to get in touch immediately.\u201d Japanese health authorities said on Tuesday they had collected samples from everyone on the ship and that the planned evacuation of passengers who tested negative would begin as scheduled on Wednesday and be completed by the end of the week. By Monday, 454 people on the ship had tested positive, but the final number of infections onboard has not been announced. Four Britons with confirmed coronavirus are currently in hospital in Japan, according to the latest official figures. Among the remaining passengers and crew, those whose tests come back negative will be allowed to leave, while those found to be infected will be treated at hospitals in Japan. However, people who had close contact with those who have tested positive will have their quarantine reset to the date of their last contact with an infected person. The large number of cases onboard the Diamond Princess has prompted criticism of Japan\u2019s decision to keep everyone on the ship throughout the two-week quarantine. But the government\u2019s top spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, told reporters on Tuesday the measure had been \u201cappropriate\u201d. The French health minister, Olivier Veran, said on Tuesday there was a \u201ccredible risk\u201d the coronavirus outbreak could turn into a pandemic, Reuters reports. \u201cThis is both a working assumption and a credible risk,\u201d Veran told France Info radio, when asked about the possibility of the coronavirus spreading globally. He said France was ready to deal with all the possibilities and its health system was sufficiently robust and well-equipped. I want to hear your news, experiences and questions about the coronavirus outbreak. You can email me at aamna.mohdin@theguardian.com or tweet me at @aamnamohdin I\u2019m particularly interested in hearing from travellers who have booked flights to China and are currently in limbo. Taiwan has urged the World Health Organization not to be \u201ckidnapped\u201d by China, as the self-ruled island fights its label as an infected area. Taiwan has reported 22 cases, compared with China\u2019s figure of more than 72,400, but the island shares the agency\u2019s classification of China as \u201cvery high risk\u201d since the WHO considers Taiwan as part of China. \u201cTaiwan is not ruled by China and certainly should not be labelled as an infected area,\u201d the foreign ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou told a news conference, according to a report by Reuters. \u201cWe urge the WHO to be professional and neutral: break away from China\u2019s unreasonable claim. Don\u2019t be kidnapped by China.\u201d Taipei is already in dispute with Beijing over its exclusion from the WHO because of objections by China, which considers Taiwan its own territory and has blocked the island\u2019s membership of many international bodies. Countries including El Salvador, Mongolia, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu have adopted travel curbs for people who have visited Taiwan, while the island\u2019s largest airline is included in an Italian ban on flights from China. Ou said the WHO should immediately correct its \u201cinappropriate label\u201d for the island, which was continuing to press Italy to resume flights. Morning, I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin taking over the live blog from Martin Farrer. Britons David and Sally Abel, who are on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, have tested positive for Covid-19. Abel, who has been posting regular video updates from the quarantined ship, said on Facebook: \u201cThere is going to be a time of quiet. We have been proved positive and leaving for hospital soon. Blessings all.\u201d The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has said it is \u201cworking to organise\u201d a flight back to the UK for British nationals on the ship who have tested negative. The department has come under increasing pressure to fly home the 74 Britons on the Diamond Princess after the US repatriated 340 of its citizens. The department said in a statement: Given the conditions onboard, we are working to organise a flight back to the UK for British nationals on the Diamond Princess as soon as possible. Our staff are contacting British nationals on board to make the necessary arrangements. We urge all those who have not yet responded to get in touch immediately. On Monday, a No 10 spokesman said those onboard the ship docked near Yokohama, Japan, were being contacted about the possibility of a repatriation flight. Shanghai\u2019s government says the city\u2019s schools, which have been closed for three weeks, will remain closed and will begin teaching primary and secondary school students online from 2 March. Lu Jing, head of the Shanghai education committee, revealed the decision at a briefing on Tuesday, according to reports. No date has been given for the proper reopening of schools. I\u2019m about to hand over to my colleagues in London so here are the main developments of the last eight hours or so: China has recorded 98 more deaths from the Covid-19 outbreak, taking the number of victims to 1,868. Health officials confirmed another 1,886 new confirmed infections , bringing the total on the mainland to 72,436. More than 12,000 have recovered. A senior hospital doctor in Wuhan has died from the virus. A \u201cdragnet-style\u201d operation has been launched in Wuhan to roundup all people infected with the virus. The UK government is evacuating its citizens from the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. South Korea, Canada and Australia gave more details of similar operations. Japan, which has 454 cases of the virus, is to trial HIV retroviral drugs on infected people. Hong Kong is to boost its Covid-19 emergency fund from HK$28bn (US$3.60bn) from HK$25bn. Singapore Airlines is cutting flights to major cities such as London, Frankfurt and Los Angeles as the virus continues to impact international travel. Asian stock markets have suffered losses after Apple said the factory shutdowns in China was causing a shortage of iPhones. Apple\u2019s announcement on Monday night that the Covid-19 outbreak was causing a shortage of iPhones has hit tech stocks in Asia. The Nikkei in Tokyo closed 1.4% for the day on Tuesday and Seoul finished down by a chunky 1.5%. The South Korean president Moon Jae-in said earlier that the economy faced an \u201cemergency\u201d situation because of the virus and the government would be making an all-out effort to boost growth. They\u2019re still trading in China where the Shanghai Composite is off 0.14% while the Hang Seng has fallen 1.35%. The FTSE100 is expected to shed 0.6% at the opening this morning and on Wall Street the Dow Jones is looking at a similar fall after having Monday off for President\u2019s Day. \u201cApple is saying its recovery could be delayed, which could mean the impact of the virus may go beyond the current quarter,\u201d Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities in Tokyo, told Reuters. \u201cIf Apple shares were traded cheaply, that might not matter much. But when they are trading at a record high, investors will be surely tempted to sell.\u201d HSBC, the international bank based in Hong Kong and London, has reported a fall 30% fall in profits for the last financial year. HSBC said its 2019 pre-tax profits fell by a third on year to $13.3 billion as interim chief Noel Quinn warned that the global banking giant was \u201cnot delivering acceptable returns\u201d. Most of the loss was a \u201cgoodwill impairment\u201d on its business in Europe. In his comments, chairman Mark Tucker said the \u201cmacroeconomic environment\u201d was uncertain and that the bank had lowered its growth forecast for Asia because of the Covid-19 outbreak. As a result of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, we have lowered our expectations for growth in the Asian economy in 2020. The main impact will be in the first quarter, but we expect some improvement as the virus becomes contained From Justin McCurry in Tokyo: Japan is to trial HIV antiretroviral drugs to treat people with coronavirus, the government said on Tuesday, as the number of infections in the country reached 520, including 454 cases onboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner. Yoshihide Suga, the chief cabinet secretary, said the government was \u201ccurrently conducting preparations so that clinical trials using HIV medication on the novel coronavirus can start as soon as possible\u201d. Suga said he couldn\u2019t comment on how long it would take for the new drug to be approved. Doctors in Thailand said they appeared to have had some success in treating severe cases of the coronavirus with a combination of influenza medication and HIV antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir. Thai doctors used an lopinavir-ritonavir combination along with the flu drug oseltamivir - also known as Tamiflu - to treat a Chinese coronavirus patient in her 70s, the Thai ministry of public health said in a report this month, according to Japan\u2019s Nikkei Asian Review. The woman\u2019s condition had not improved 10 days after she was diagnosed, but she recovered within 48 hours of being treated with the combination of HIV and flu drugs, the report said. A senior doctor treating patients in Wuhan has died from the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cLiu Zhiming, the director of Wuhan Wuchang hospital, died at 10.30am this morning after resuscitation efforts failed,\u201d reported the China Central Television\u2019s microblog. A hospital director in Hubei province has also died of the virus, it was confirmed, as the authorities in the city step up their attempts to roundup everyone infected. My colleague Verna Yu has the full story here: Singapore Airlines is following Cathay Pacific and other airlines by temporarily cutting flights across its global network in the three months until May, it said on Tuesday, blaming the Covid-19 outbreak. The main affected destinations include Frankfurt, Jakarta, London, Los Angeles, Mumbai, Paris, Seoul, Sydney and Tokyo. \u201cSingapore Airlines and SilkAir will temporarily reduce services across our network due to weak demand as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak,\u201d it said. \u201cWe will continue to monitor the situation and make further adjustments as necessary.\u201d Earlier I posted on the development of what appears to be an app-based health checking system in China. A reader has been in touch to tell me that such a system has been in place in the southern city of Shenzhen for a couple of weeks. It has worked like this. QR codes were put up on the bulletin boards of residential communities with people advised to scan the codes and then visit a website and enter their phone numbers, after which they would receive a text message confirming their movements. Once they\u2019d done this, residents could then register with the local administration and be allowed a transit pass to get back into their own communities. Since 1 February, movement has been greatly restricted in Guangdong. On Saturday the province introduced \u201creal name\u201d verification just to ride the metro. More from the Australian minister\u2019s press call. He was asked if those passengers on the ship were angry at having to be placed in quarantine despite already having been isolated on the ship for two weeks. Health minister Greg Hunt says he understands their frustration and a mental health hotline and counselling service has been set up for them. But because of ongoing infections on the ship where 454 people have been infected, \u201cthere was no choice\u201d. Hunt says: The medical advice from theAustralian Health Protection Principals Committee was clear and categorical, that an additional period of 14 days would be required. They have our deep sympathy. It must have been a very, very difficult time. And for many it would be frustrating. But we need to protect and support those Australians who have been on the ship, whilst protecting and supporting the entire containment arrangement in Australia. Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Brendan Murphy, is also at the briefing and he\u2019s asked if it\u2019s possible that the passengers \u2013 because of the growing number of cases on the ship \u2013 are more contagious than the Wuhan evacuees. Prof Murphy says it\u2019s \u201cpossible\u201d but adds that all the evacuees have tested negative and have also had a \u201cproper throat swab sent to the lab and they\u2019ll all have a health screen. We suspect that the risk for most of them is very low. But because some of them may have been exposed, we\u2019re doing this quarantine. So, potentially there might be a slightly higher risk, but if that\u2019s the case, we\u2019re absolutely well-prepared for it. Australia health minister, Greg Hunt, is giving details about how its citizens are going to be evacuated from the Diamond Princess. Speaking in Darwin in the Northern territory, Hunt says the government is \u201ctalking to all of the Australian passengers on the Diamond Princess today\u201d and it expects to have about 200 people on board an evacuation flight. \u201cIt could be less. It could be a few more. But at this stage foreign affairs is going through the process of contacting everybody. And once we have final numbers, we\u2019ll provide them immediately.\u201d Once they arrive back in Australia, Hunt says, they will be quarantined at Howard Springs for 14 days. The last 36 people quarantined on Christmas Island \u2013 people who were evacuated from Wuhan two weeks ago \u2013 will be moved tomorrow, Hunt says, after 242 were repatriated on Monday. \u201cIt was a really great example of the Australian spirit. Those who were quarantined, those who were taking care of them. And I understand it was a very emotional time at the departure, and they bonded and went very well. The remaining 36 are due to leave tomorrow. Then it takes some time to prepare the facility in case more - there are more people required to fill the spaces.\u201d The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office said on Tuesday morning that it would evacuate citizens from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, and urged travellers who wish to be flown home to contact officials, writes Rebecca Ratcliffe, our south-east Asia correspondent. More than 450 passengers onboard the ship have now been infected with the virus - the biggest cluster of cases outside of mainland China. In a statement, the FCO said: Given the conditions on board, we are working to organise a flight back to the UK for British nationals on the Diamond Princess as soon as possible. Our staff are contacting British nationals on board to make the necessary arrangements. We urge all those who have not yet responded to get in touch immediately. The British government has come under mounting pressure to fly citizens back from the UK, with several other countries already announcing plans to do so. The US flew more than 300 American citizens out on Sunday, 14 of whom tested positive for the virus before getting on the plane. Passengers onboard the ship have been mostly confined to their cabins since 3 February. Affected British nationals should call the British Embassy in Tokyo on +81 3 5211 1100, the FCO said. Alibaba, the huge Chinese technology company, appears to be rolling out a health check app which will help authorities keep track of the virus as people return to work. Beginning in Alibaba\u2019s base city of Hangzhou near Shanghai, its subsidiary Alipay \u2013 China\u2019s Paypal \u2013 will \u201cprovide development support for a national health code system\u201d which will track people\u2019s self-quarantine based on basic health information and travel history, according to the website Technode. People will be required to self-report their health and travel history over the past few weeks into the app. So as people return to work, companies will be asked to keep track of their employees\u2019 health and allow the government to monitor people who they think could be at risk of being infected, perhaps from knowledge of proximity with an infected person. Once registered \u2013 it\u2019s not clear if the system is mandatory or not \u2013 a resident would receive a coloured code. Residents with a green code means they are allowed to move around the city freely. Yellow means a seven-day quarantine, and red requires a 14-day quarantine. This tweet suggests what it looks like: I\u2019m indebted to a reader, Drew Gough, for spotting this. Drew lived in Hangzhou for two years while working for Alibaba. He says that a friend in Shanghai has received a text message \u2013 along with all other residents of the city \u2013 saying that it is mandatory to wear a face mask at all times while outside, and failure to do so was breaking the law and punishable by up to 10 days being detained. The Alipay health code is also being rolled out in Shanghai, according to Technode. South Korea is sending the presidential jet to evacuate its citizens from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan, according to the Yonhap news agency. Speaking in Seoul on Tuesday, president Moon Jae-in said the economy faced an \u201cemergency\u201d situation because of the virus and the government would be making an all-out effort to boost growth. \u201c(The government) shouldn\u2019t quibble over whether anything is unprecedented or not, rather, we should take every possible measure we can think of on the table to deploy them,\u201d Moon said in a cabinet meeting, Reuters reports. Last week, the governor of the Bank of Korea said the central bank was working on financial aid packages for those sectors directly affected by the spreading coronavirus. The carmakers Hyundai and Kia were forced to suspend production at their plants because of a lack of components from China although output has been resumed after parts were sourced from elsewhere in Asia and some Chinese factories reopened. The local Kospi stock market index has taken a decent hit today. It is down 1.35%. In Japan, our correspondent Justin McCurry reports on how the outbreak has disrupted the planned celebrations of the emperor\u2019s 60th birthday. Justin writes: Birthday celebrations for Japan\u2019s new emperor have become the latest victim of the coronavirus outbreak. The imperial household agency said Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako would not appear in public to mark his 60th birthday on Sunday due to concerns over the possible spread of the virus among large groups of people. The event regularly attracts tens of thousands of people to the inner grounds of the imperial palace in Tokyo. Naruhito\u2019s birthday address would have been his first since he ascended the Chrysanthemum throne on 1 May after his father, Akihito, became the first Japanese emperor to abdicate in more than 200 years. The emperor\u2019s birthday is a rare opportunity for the public to see senior members of the imperial family at the palace. Naruhito and Masako were due to greet well-wishers from a palace balcony three times on Sunday, along with the crown prince and his family. \u201cWe made the decision to cancel the public event at the palace, which is attended every year by many people in close proximity, after considering the risk of the virus spreading,\u201d Kenji Ikeda, the vice grand steward of the agency, said at a press conference, according to the Kyodo news agency. The last time the emperor\u2019s birthday celebration was cancelled was 1996, amid a hostage crisis at the Japanese embassy in Peru. The agency\u2019s decision to scrap the celebrations comes after Japan\u2019s health minister, Katsunobu Kato, said people should avoid crowds and non-essential gatherings. \u201cWe want to ask the public to avoid non-urgent, non-essential gatherings,\u201d Kato said. \u201cWe want elderly and those with pre-existing conditions to avoid crowded places.\u201d Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, has boosted the funds available to tackle the coronavirus outbreak to HK$28bn (US$3.60bn) from HK$25bn pledged previously to ease the impact on the city\u2019s battered economy. Lam last week had said the government would give one-off payments to businesses across the city and the hospital authority. One person has died from the virus in Hong Kong and 60 people have been infected. The numbers are very small compared with China but the city is facing an economic crisis with the double hit of the virus and last year\u2019s street protests. Visitor numbers have fallen off a cliff. After a very strong day yesterday when they were buoyed by more central bank stimulus, China\u2019s stock markets have dipped a bit today. The Shanghai Composite is off 0.2% although the Shenzhen Composite, which is more tech heavy, has just gone back into positive territory. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng is down 1%. Elsewhere in Asia Pacific, losses have widened from the last time I updated the scoreboard. The Nikkei is down 1% now and the Kospi in Seoul is off 1.3%. Sydney is still down 0.2%, but no doubt saved from further falls by publication of minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia today which painted a gloomy picture of the economy, especially on consumer demand. Policymakers are ready with more stimulus, which investors just love. Bad news is good news, folks. The bank also warned about downside cornavirus risks. In China, the fight to contain the virus is continuing despite encouragement that the number of new cases has fallen below 2,000 for the first time since January. The Global Times newspaper reports that a \u201cdragnet style\u201d operation is under way in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, to make sure all those infected are \u201crounded up\u201d. The operation was ordered by the city\u2019s new party chief, Wang Zhonglin, on Sunday and aims to be completed in three days. Big data and AI would be used to assist the operation. Here is what the news outlet reported yestedray: The three-day campaign aims to fulfill five objectives: have all suspected victims receive nucleic acid tests; round up all infected patients; check all patients with fever; put under quarantine anyone who has had close contact with patients; and ensure all communities and villages implement 24-hour closed-off management measures. It is not all gloom and doom in the economics department. It seems that in Hong Kong, where toilet paper is running short, some manufacturers are doing quite well. The Hong Kong-listed paper maker Vinda has seen its shares rise 41% this year. This follows an armed raid on a truck load of toilet rolls in Hong Kong amid panic-buying of necessities. A flight has left Canada to evacuate its citizens aboard the Diamond Princess in Yokohama, Canada\u2019s chief public health officer has said in the last hour. Dr Theresa Tam said Canada would evacuate asymptomatic Canadians and they would undergo a 14-day quarantine at Cornwall airbase in Ontario. It follows similar moves by the US and Australia to evacuate people from the ship on which 454 people have been infected with the virus. Asian stock markets have seen a dip this morning after Apple\u2019s announcement that the outbreak was causing shortages of the iPhone and that it would fail to meet its revenue target for this quarter. The Nikkei in Tokyo fell 0.6% this morning and the ASX200 was down 0.2% in Sydney. Seoul was down 0.56%. Chinese and Hong Kong markets open shortly. Apple\u2019s announcement follows a profit waring from Cathay Pacific on Monday. The Hong Kong-based airline, already hit hard by the city\u2019s protest movement, has cancelled 40% of its flights this month and next because of the virus. BHP, the world\u2019s biggest mining company, said that it might have to cut its growth forecasts for the year if the outbreak is not contained in the March quarter. But ... stock markets have weathered the coronavirus outbreak without too much alarm because investors have bet that central banks, led by China, will pump enough stimulus back into their economies to make sure things stay on an even keel. The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates last year and that has helped fuel a boom in the US economy which is also helping to shrug off fears about a China slowdown. There are rumbling concerns that passengers who were allowed to leave the cruise ship MV Westerdam in Cambodia may yet be infected with the virus. UK officials are trying to contact Britons who disembarked after experts said the checking process may not have been handled properly. One person tested positive after leaving the vessel, which was refused by five countries due to concerns that passengers were infected. Mark Harris, a professor of virology at the University of Leeds, said: \u201cIf you have got people who are infected at an early stage they might not test positive, they might not show any symptoms but they could go on to develop full-blown disease.\u201d Check out our full story here: The latest figures show that more than 12,000 people have recovered from the infection out of a total of more than 73,000 who have contracted it. We have to assume that many more will recover if we factor in the latest comments by the head of the World Health Organization. Speaking in Geneva, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said data from China had helped form a \u201ca clearer picture of the outbreak\u201d and that it appeared that four out of five people infected would recover. It was not as deadly as Sars or Mers, he said, adding: More than 80% of patients have mild disease and will recover, 14% have severe disease including pneumonia and shortness of breath, 5% have critical disease including respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organ failure, and 2% of cases are fatal,. The risk of death increases the older you are. Our health editor, Sarah Boseley, has the full story here: Those national health commission figures have been released in the last few minutes. 98 new fatalities were recorded on Monday, the commission said on Tuesday morning, taking the death toll in mainland China rose to 1,868. There were 93 deaths in Hubei, 72 of them in the capital Wuhan where the outbreak started. Across mainland China, there were 1,886 new confirmed infections on Monday, bringing the total so far to 72,436, the commission said. Welcome to our rolling coverage of the Covid-19 outbreak, which we can start by relaying the latest figures from the health commission in Hubei. It said on Tuesday morning that 93 more deaths were recorded on Monday, taking the total in the stricken province to 1,789. Another 1,807 cases were added as well for a total in the province of 59,989. Those numbers are lower than the figures from Sunday (100 deaths and 1,933 new cases) so will give some encouragement to China\u2019s efforts to lockdown its citizens and contain the spread. But these are, of course, only the figures from the health commission and must be treated with some caution. We haven\u2019t got the national figures from China yet but we expect them to be out soon. The other key developements are The WHO says the virus causes only mild disease in 80% of people and has a markedly greater imnpact on older people. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said data from China had helped form a \u201ca clearer picture of the outbreak\u201d. UK officials are trying to track Britons who left the MV Westerdam cruise ship in Cambodia amid fears the virus could have spread more widely than thought. Another 99 people have tested positive on board the cruise ship Diamond Princess Apple has warned of a shortage of iPhones due to factory closures in China. Germany\u2019s central bank has warned about the risk to the country\u2019s economy amid already slowing orders from China. China is considering delaying its annual people\u2019s congress, set for 5 March in Beijing. The Tokyo Marathon has been scaled down to just elite runners.",

In warning in this way Apple has neatly summed up the knock to global growth stemming from both reduced output and consumption. </p> <p>Firstly, how anyone is surprised by this is beyond me. Clearly there is going to be a hit to both output and consumption in the world\u2019s second largest economy and the world\u2019s growth driver. This is bound to hit earnings of companies exposed \u2013 Apple being the bellwether. </p> <p>Most of Apple\u2019s products are made in China, while the country accounts for about 16% of global revenues. </p> <p>The $4bn spread in the original guidance was already as wide as a barn door, reflecting uncertainty at the time of the Q1 results at the back end of January. </p> <p>The warning points to the two key ways the outbreak will impact growth. First output: Apple says iPhone supply will be constrained due to a slower ramp in production following the late return following the new year holiday. Two, consumption: demand for all products in China has been sharply hit. </p> <p>Apple warned about China a little over a year ago and after the stock initially sold off, investors soon shrugged it off.

      "bodyText": "Finally, here\u2019s our latest story on the coronavirus\u2019s growing impact on the global economy: In New York, shares are drifting lower too following Apple\u2019s warning that it won\u2019t meet its quarterly revenue target on account of the coronavirus crisis in China. The Dow Jones industrial average is down 0.86% or 252 points at 29,145. David Madden of CMC Markets says: The warning from the tech giant spooked traders as it is probably a sign of what is to come from other companies that have exposure to China \u2013 which is a very long list. The health crisis is causing major disruption to businesses in the second-largest economy in the world, so traders are ducking out of equities. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index of top shares has closed 51 points lower at 7,382, a drop of 0.7%. HSBC led the fallers, down 6.5% after posting lower profits and announcing sweeping job cuts. Miners also had a bad day. Brazil\u2019s economy is also going to hit by the coronavirus crisis, economists fear, due to its export links to China: The boss of Tata Motors, JLR\u2019s parent company, also warned that parts from China are in short supply. Guenter Butschek told reporters: \u201cWe are safe for the month of February and for a good part of March. Are we fully covered at this point of time for the full month of March? Unfortunately...not.\u201d Don\u2019t panic.... but carmaker Jaguar Land Rover\u2019s UK factories could run out of parts from China in a couple of weeks. According to Reuters, JLR chief executive Ralf Speth has said that Jaguar Land Rover has enough parts from China to maintain its British production for the next two weeks but not beyond that at the moment. Speth also told reporters that sales were not currently happening in China. The Financial Times have a great story about Apple\u2019s problems in China, which explains why production levels are much lower than expected. They\u2019ve learned that Foxconn is struggling to get enough workers onto the iPhone assembly line at its huge factory complex at Zhengzhou, in China\u2019s Henan province. It\u2019s because workers from outside the city are being forced into a quarantine period, for up to 14 days, to prevent them spreading Covid-19. That self-quarantine period is taking place in a Foxconn dormitory room, which normally houses eight people! So there aren\u2019t enough to go round. The FT explains: The rooms, which usually pack in eight workers, had quickly filled, causing Foxconn to halt the return of additional staff, explained a Zhengzhou-based factory recruiter, who asked not to be named. \u201cThey don\u2019t have enough room,\u201d the recruiter said, adding that workers could now sign up and wait for quarantine availability. \u201cThere\u2019s no one snoring. There\u2019s no one bothering you. The internet is finally fast,\u201d said one worker of the comfortable conditions in quarantine. The seven other bunks in his dorm room \u2014 consisting of only wood planks without mattresses \u2014 were empty. More here. This 2.8% decline knocks around $40bn off Apple\u2019s valuation. That sounds like a lot, but it means the tech giant is still worth $1.38 trillion, down from $1.42trn. Newsflash: Shares in Apple have fallen by 2.8% at the start of trading on Wall Street. New York traders are showing concern about last night\u2019s revenue warning. But this fall isn\u2019t as sharp as feared this morning, when Apple was down 5% in Frankfurt. This suggests there\u2019s some optimism that the coronavirus problems will be short-lived. The coronavirus crisis could drag Italy\u2019s economy into a recession this year, fears Capital Economics. Jack Allen-Reynolds, Senior Europe Economist, told clients that: After Italy\u2019s economy shrank at the end of last year, it looks set to continue to struggle in 2020. In fact, there is a clear risk that it falls back into recession for the fourth time since 2008. Allen-Reynolds has spotted that while Italy is only half as dependent on sales to China as Germany, it is MORE reliant on imports from China. So the closure of Chinese factories could hurt Italian manufacturers, if they can\u2019t get the parts they need to complete their own products. Last night\u2019s warning from Apple is a wake-up call for investors, writes our economics editor Larry Elliott: China is a big market for Apple \u2013 accounting for around one-sixth of its global revenues \u2013 and is the source of most of its products. The coronavirus represents both a demand and a supply shock to the company. Apple\u2019s statement to investors represented something of a reality check to the financial markets, which have been blithely assuming that the coronavirus would represent only a short-lived hit to China and to the wider global economy. To be sure, Apple says that production will return to normal but stresses that the process is taking longer than expected. This is far more serious than the outbreak of Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), and its timing could hardly have been worse.... More here: Just in. Factories in the New York state have reported their biggest increase in new orders in a year. The New York Fed\u2019s Empire State business conditions index, just released, rose 8.1 points to 12.9 in February. That\u2019s the best reading since last May - defying forecasts of a drop to 4.0. The index of new orders rose 15.5 points to 22.1 in February, the highest level in over a year, while the shipments index jumped 10.3 points to 18.9. This is an encouraging signal for the health of the US economy, at an important moment given the problems in China. Rupert Harrison of Blackrock tweets: US tech stocks could be in for a rough day, thanks to Apple. Chipmakers Qualcomm and Broadcom, who supply technology for the iPhone, are both down around 2% in pre-market trading. Apple\u2019s now off 2.5%. The wider market is also likely to dip. Swiss bank UBS have created some neat charts showing how economic activity in China has (understandably) flatlined in recent weeks. As you can see, coal consumption, property sales and traffic congestion are all much weaker than usual: HSBC has revealed it could be forced to take $600m in additional provisions against loan losses if the Coronavirus outbreak isn\u2019t tackled before the middle of 2020. Reuters has the details: Chief financial officer Ewan Stevenson said on Tuesday HSBC has modelled several scenarios for the impact of the virus on its business, and in the more extreme of those in which it carries on, the lender would have to assume bad loans rising to that amount. \u201cThere will be revenue impacts which will become progressively more acute if the coronavirus was to continue beyond the next month to six weeks,\u201d Stevenson told analysts on a conference call. Stevenson had earlier indicated that HSBC would update the markets on the coronavirus impact at the end of April (when Beijing would hope to have the situation firmly under control). Back in London, the FTSE 100 has touched a fresh two-week low. The blue-chip index is down 1.05%, or 78 points, at 7,354. There\u2019s a clear coronavirus impact, with mining companies among the top fallers. Fashion chain Burberry is down 3.3% too. It\u2019s suffering from Apple\u2019s warning of weak iPhone sales in China, and the cancellation of Chanel\u2019s Beijing show. Callum D\u2019Ath, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, suggests Apple\u2019s management may be criticised for putting so much reliance on Chinese manufacturing. He writes: This is Apple\u2019s second sales warning in 12 months where the company has blamed China-related issues. Previously it was the US/China \u2018trade war\u2019 and now it is the Coronavirus. As Apple supposedly has one of the best supply-chain systems in the world coupled with a very big physical presence in China, investors may question the quality of management going forward. \u201cLooking ahead for Apple, this is probably a transitory impact to numbers as global supply-chain issues will dissipate. In addition, while this is clearly a hardware issue, the jury is still out on whether Apple is a hardware company or successful in transitioning to becoming a high-quality consumer staple company with a growing software business.\u201d China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has insisted that the country\u2019s economy won\u2019t be derailed by the coronavirus crisis, and can still hits its growth targets. Reuters has the details: China can meet its economic growth target in 2020 despite the impact of the coronavirus outbreak, state television quoted President Xi Jinping as saying on Tuesday. Xi said the economy remained resilient as efforts to control the outbreak reached a critical stage. Beijing had been aiming for 6% growth in 2020, before the outbreak began in Wuhan. Many economists have trimmed their forecasts since, but there\u2019s a theory that the economy could bounce back later this year... if the Covid-19 restrictions are relaxed fairly soon. The coronavirus is the third-biggest \u2018tail risk\u2019 keeping fund managers awake at night, according to Bank of America\u2019s monthly survey. The top worry -- the US presidential election. Many in the markets expect Donald Trump to be re-elected for a second term. So a progressive Democrat could surprise Wall Street -- with Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren both pledging tighter bank regulation and higher taxes on the wealthiest. Just in: US supermarket titan Walmart has missed sales and profit expectations, and issued weaker-than-expected earnings forecasts. Walmart made $1.38 per share in adjusted earnings in the last quarter, shy of forecasts of $1.44. Sales rose by 1.9%, missing forecasts of 2.4%. It also expects to make between $5 and $5.15 per share in the coming financial year -- Wall Street had expected $5.22 per share. Walmart says it has NOT included any potential financial hit from the coronavirus -- suggesting it is reacting to a slowdown in its domestic market. Neil Wilson of Markets.com reckons investors will soon shake off their worries about Apple, even though its shares are having a bad day. He writes: Apple says it won\u2019t hit its Q2 revenue guidance of $63-67bn due to the Covid-19 outbreak in China. In warning in this way Apple has neatly summed up the knock to global growth stemming from both reduced output and consumption. Firstly, how anyone is surprised by this is beyond me. Clearly there is going to be a hit to both output and consumption in the world\u2019s second largest economy and the world\u2019s growth driver. This is bound to hit earnings of companies exposed \u2013 Apple being the bellwether. Most of Apple\u2019s products are made in China, while the country accounts for about 16% of global revenues. The $4bn spread in the original guidance was already as wide as a barn door, reflecting uncertainty at the time of the Q1 results at the back end of January. The warning points to the two key ways the outbreak will impact growth. First output: Apple says iPhone supply will be constrained due to a slower ramp in production following the late return following the new year holiday. Two, consumption: demand for all products in China has been sharply hit. Apple warned about China a little over a year ago and after the stock initially sold off, investors soon shrugged it off. I\u2019d anticipate a similar reaction to this Apple\u2019s share are down over 3% in pre-market trading in New York, as early-bird traders prepare to head to Wall Street. This chart from Bloomberg TV shows why the turmoil in China is bad for Apple\u2019s revenues - meaning it will miss sales targets this quarter. But Apple\u2019s stock is still nearly double its level last year: Chanel has cancelled a fashion show scheduled for May in Beijing, due to coronavirus angst - another sign of the economic cost of the crisis. The French fashion house said last night: \u201cConsidering the current situation and following the guidance of Chinese authorities, Chanel has decided to postpone its project of a replica of the Paris \u2013 31 Rue Cambon 2019/20 M\u00e9tiers d\u2019art collection in May in Beijing to a later and more appropriate moment.\u201d Chanel added that the \u201chealth and well-being of its teams and clients\u201d are its primary concern at this time. The AFP newswire has more details: The \u201c31 Rue Cambon\u201d show was first held in Paris in December, inspired by the studio and workshop of founder Coco Chanel. The decor was created by the film director Sofia Coppola. Scores of similar events have already been cancelled in China, and beyond - with Barcelona\u2019s Mobile World Congress being cancelled last week. CNBC\u2019s Julianna Tatelbaum says the slump in German investor confidence is much worse than expected -- as sign that the coronavirus is causing real alarm: Hopes of green shoots in Germany are turning into brown weeds, warns Katharina Uterm\u00f6hl of Allianz: But Aila Mihr of Danske Bank argues that the impact is \u2018muted\u2019 so far: ZEW president Achim Wambach says: \u201cThe feared negative effects of the coronavirus epidemic in China on world trade have been causing a considerable decline of the indicator of economic sentiment for Germany. Expectations regarding the development of the export-intensive sectors of the economy have dropped particularly sharply.\u201d NEWSFLASH: German investor confidence has taken a nosedive, hit by coronavirus turmoil and recession fears. The ZEW Institute\u2019s measure of German economic sentiment has tumbled to just 8.7, down from January\u2019s 26.7 (which was a four-year high). It blamed the \u201cnegative effects\u201d of the coronavirus outbreak in China - with export-intensive sectors of the German economy particularly affected. Recent weak economic data has also hurt -- with German GDP stagnating in the final three months of last year. ZEW\u2019s current conditions measures slumped to -15.7, from -9.5, in a clear indication that the economy is under pressure.... Back in the markets, Apple\u2019s shares are still under pressure in Frankfurt. The tech giant is down around 3.66%, so it\u2019s clawed back a BIT of its early selloff. But that still suggests Wall Street is going to see some heavy selling later today. On the upside, Apple\u2019s shares have been on a huge tear recently - soaring by 86% in 2019. So one day\u2019s losses shouldn\u2019t hurt..... Newsflash: Britain\u2019s new chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has squashed fears that the budget could be delayed following the shock departure of his predecessor, Sajid Javid. It\u2019s still on for 11 March, he just tweeted: Here\u2019s some reaction to today\u2019s jobs report from the Resolution Foundation think tank: And from Pawel Adrjan of jobs site Indeed.com: Good news! Pay in Britain has finally hit its pre-crisis levels, once you adjust for inflation and strip out bonuses. That\u2019s according to today\u2019s unemployment report, which says: Real regular pay increased by 1.8% to \u00a3474 between December 2018 and December 2019. This was the first time that real regular pay exceeded the pre-downturn peak of \u00a3473 recorded in March 2008. However, the annual rate of growth of both total and regular pay slowed down in recent months. NEWSFLASH: Britain\u2019s employment rate has hit a new record high, but wage growth has slowed. The Office for National Statistics has reported that the UK employment rate rose to 76.5% in the October-December quarter-- up from 76.1% in the previous quarter. The jobless rate remained at 3.8%, its lowest since Harold Wilson\u2019s Labour government of 1974. There are more vacancies too --some 810,000 in the last three months, up from 807,000 in the previous quarter. But there\u2019s bad news too -- average basic earnings growth fell to 3.2% per year, from 3.4%. Total pay (including bonuses) only rose by 2.9%, down from 3.2% a month ago. That\u2019s a blow, but it\u2019s compensated by the fact that inflation dropped to a three-year low in January. Most major European stock markets are in the red today, as investors digest the implications of Apple\u2019s revenue warning last night. Russ Mould of stockbroker AJ Bell says the markets have been \u201cfar too complacent\u201d about the impact of the coronavirus on China\u2019s manufacturing industry, and global supply chains. If factories are closed, are running at partial capacity, or are struggling to get raw materials to make goods, then it is no wonder that supplies will be disrupted. \u201cApple\u2019s retail stores will have also been affected by the health incident in China and surrounding areas in Asia as there will have been fewer people shopping. \u201cCompanies try to avoid tying up cash by having large stockpiles, even though that would help them to continue operating as normal at such times of supply chain disruption. Instead, they prefer to have the smallest amount of inventory possible in the hope that the supply chain always runs smoothly. That leaves little room for error, as Apple has now discovered. Germany\u2019s DAX index has dropped 0.75% in early trading, losing 105 points to 13,678. Industrial groups are leading the fallers, hit by fresh concerns about China\u2019s economy and the impact of Covid-19. Semiconductor-maker Infineon Technologies, another iPhone supplier, are down 2%. Carmaker Daimler has lost 1.9%, with tire manufacturer Continental off 1.4% and cement producer Heidelberg down 1.3%. Oil, a handy barometer of economic optimism, is falling too. Brent crude has shed 1.6% to $56.73 per barrel, down $1 overnight. Tech companies aren\u2019t the only ones suffering. Shares in small UK manufacturer Tekmar have plunged by almost 40%, after it warned that the coronavirus is hurting business. Tekmar makes protective coverings for subsea cables, such as power links to wind farms and oil rigs. It told the City this morning: \u201cChina\u2019s necessary and prudent response to the outbreak of the coronavirus, including the restriction of travel in the country, is affecting the Group\u2019s performance materially in a number of ways. Cardiff-based iPhone supplier IQE have slumped 6% in early trading -- another casualty of last night\u2019s warning. Over in Frankfurt, shares in Apple are taking a thumping in early trading. Apple\u2019s stock is down 5% at \u20ac285, as European traders react to last night\u2019s warning that revenue targets will be missed. Apple is worth around $1.4 trillion dollars. So this fall would wipe around $70bn off its market capitalisation! We\u2019ll see if Apple\u2019s New York-listed shares take a similar plunge when Wall Street opens in six hours time. Shares in STMicroelectronics, who also supply chips to Apple for the iPhone, are down 2.5%. Overall, tech stocks are the worst-performing sector across Europe this morning - down some 1.3%. European tech companies are being buffeted at the start of trading, thanks to Apple\u2019s warning last night. Anglo-German chip designer Dialog Semiconductor has plunged 6%, It supplies various technology for the iPhone, including power management systems. Another iPhone supplier, AMS, are down 4.5%. It provides optical sensor systems used in the 3D facial recognition features on iPhones. Oof! Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index has fallen 1%, or 72 points, at the start of trading to 7362. That\u2019s a two-week low, as Apple\u2019s virus warning sends a shiver through the City of London. HSBC is the biggest faller, after reporting a 33% drop in profits earlier today and outlining plans to shrink its investment bank. Mining stocks are among the fallers, reflecting worries that the global economy will suffer from the outbreak. Anglo American, BHP Billiton and Glencore have all lost at least 1.5% -- with BHP\u2019s warning about exports to China not helping the mood either... Banking giant HSBC has added its voice to the growing chorus of concerns over the coronavirus. HSBC\u2019s interim chief executive, Noel Quinn said there had been significant disruption for staff, suppliers and customers, particularly in mainland China and Hong Kong. Speaking after announcing a tumble in profits, Quinn said: \u201cDepending on how the situation develops, there is the potential for any associated economic slowdown to impact our expected credit losses in Hong Kong and mainland China.. \u201cLonger term, it is also possible that we may see revenue reductions from lower lending and transaction volumes, and further credit losses stemming from disruption to customer supply chains. We continue to monitor the situation closely.\u201d Mining giant BHP Billiton has also warned that the coronavirus is threatening its operations. BHP told shareholders that it will revise down its expectations for economic and commodity demand unless the outbreak is \u201cdemonstrably well contained within the March quarter\u201d. The company added that it expects a net loss in demand for oil in the near term, due to the coronavirus disease. Overnight data has confirmed that Chinese imports of iron ore have fallen in the last week: Britain\u2019s accountancy watchdog has warned UK companies not to be shy about spelling out the impact of coronavirus on their businesses. The Financial Reporting Council said in a statement. \u201cWe encourage companies to consider carefully what disclosures they might need to include in their year-end accounts relating to these events.\u201d So if you\u2019ve been expanding in China, or rely on a Wuhan factory for parts, you\u2019d better mention it now..... Here\u2019s the damage in the Asia-Pacific markets today, after Apple became the highest profile market victim of the virus impact so far. Japan\u2019s Nikkei: down 329 points, or 1.4%, at 23,193 China\u2019s CSI 300: down 19 points or 0.5% at 4,057 Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng: 394 points or 1.4% at 27,568 South Korea\u2019s KOSPI: down 5 points or 1.6% at 297 South Korea has warned it faces an economic \u2018emergency\u2019 from the coronavirus, in another sign that the outbreak is causing deeper damage to the global economy. President Moon Jae-in told a cabinet meeting in Seoul that the economy is in an emergency situation, and needs stimulus to lift domestic demand. Moon also called for \u201call possible measures\u201d to support South Korea\u2019s economy, fuelling speculation that his government could launch a stimulus package soon. He told cabinet ministers: \u201cWe should take every possible measure we can think of... The current situation is more serious than we thought . . . we need to take emergency steps in this time of emergency.\u201d South Korea\u2019s tourism sector is suffering from the travel restrictions in China, while its high-tech industry will suffer supply chain problems from the closure of Chinese factories. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Alarm bells are ringing in the markets this morning after Apple warned it won\u2019t hit key financial targets, due to the escalating coronavirus crisis. Late last night, the tech giant admitted that it will fail to reach sales targets set just last month -- the clearest sign yet that Covid-19 is having a serious impact on the global economy. Apple warned that coronavirus is hurting both supplies, and demand. Chinese factories are taking longer than expected to ramp up their iPhone production levels, having been closed for an extended period after the Lunar New Year due to the virus. This means it will have fewer iPhones available for sale around the world. It warned: \u201cWork is starting to resume around the country, but we are experiencing a slower return to normal conditions than we had anticipated. As a result, we do not expect to meet the revenue guidance we provided for the March quarter.\u201d That\u2019s being compounded by retail closures across China. Given the health emergency, fewer Chinese consumers are venturing out to buy phones even if their local store is open. That\u2019s a blow to Apple, as China provides a sixth of Apple\u2019s revenue. It warned: All of our stores in China and many of our partner stores have been closed. Additionally, stores that are open have been operating at reduced hours and with very low customer traffic. We are gradually reopening our retail stores and will continue to do so as steadily and safely as we can.\u201d Apple insists that the disruption is only temporary. But clearly the situation has deteriorated sharply in the last few weeks. And if Apple are suffering, surely other companies -- including its own suppliers -- will be struggling too? On Monday, airline group Cathay Pacific issued its own warning, and we could easily see more today. Asian investors have reacted swiftly, by hammering the sell button . The Chinese, Japanese and Hong Kong stock indices have all fallen, and European markets are likely to follow. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, says Apple have put the markets on edge: Even though Apple\u2019s manufacturing partner facilities resumed activity last week, China hasn\u2019t managed to get back to a normal rhythm just yet, and the latter could take a couple of more weeks, if not months. The risk appetite remains fragile and gains in equity markets remain vulnerable to coronavirus related news. Also coming up today Banking giant HSBC has reported a 33% plunge in profits this morning, and shocked staff by suggesting it will cut 35,000 jobs as part of a radical overhaul (more on that shortly). Speaking of jobs.... the latest UK unemployment report is due this morning. It\u2019s likely to show that wage growth slowed in the final quarter of 2019, as nervous companies held back from pay rises. But the jobless rate could remain at its lowest level since the mid 1970s. The agenda 9.30am: UK unemployment figures; jobless rate expected to stick at 3.8% 10am: ZEW survey of eurozone economic confidence",

New figures obtained by the Australian National University researcher Elise Klein add more weight to critics\u2019 claims that the card has not reduced reports of family violence about three years after welfare recipients were placed on to the card.</p> <p><strong>An officer on Australia\u2019s flagship Antarctic icebreaker was asked by bosses to remove a social media post</strong> showing her on deck with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/19/aurora-australis-remove-social-media-post-criticising-scott-morrisons-climate-policy-antarctica\">banner critical of Scott Morrison\u2019s climate policies</a> after Australia\u2019s Antarctic Division contacted her employer. Madeleine Habib, currently in Antarctica, unfurled the banner on the deck of the Aurora Australis with the words \u201cScomo \u2013 Coal or Ice?\u201d and posted the picture on her Facebook page. Habib was asked to remove the post on Monday after her employer, P&amp;O Maritime, was contacted by the government\u2019s Australian Antarctic Division, which contracts the ship.</p> <p><strong>Quarantine conditions imposed on the cruise ship docked in Japan are both morally dubious and appear counterproductive,</strong> according to health experts who fear the vessel has become an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/18/global-health-experts-question-cruise-ship-coronavirus-quarantine-measures\">incubator for the coronavirus Covid-19</a>.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 19 February. Top stories The cashless debit card has failed to reduce family violence in one of the first trial sites and may have actually coincided with an increase in abuse, police data released under freedom of information laws suggests. New figures obtained by the Australian National University researcher Elise Klein add more weight to critics\u2019 claims that the card has not reduced reports of family violence about three years after welfare recipients were placed on to the card. An officer on Australia\u2019s flagship Antarctic icebreaker was asked by bosses to remove a social media post showing her on deck with a banner critical of Scott Morrison\u2019s climate policies after Australia\u2019s Antarctic Division contacted her employer. Madeleine Habib, currently in Antarctica, unfurled the banner on the deck of the Aurora Australis with the words \u201cScomo \u2013 Coal or Ice?\u201d and posted the picture on her Facebook page. Habib was asked to remove the post on Monday after her employer, P&amp;O Maritime, was contacted by the government\u2019s Australian Antarctic Division, which contracts the ship. Quarantine conditions imposed on the cruise ship docked in Japan are both morally dubious and appear counterproductive, according to health experts who fear the vessel has become an incubator for the coronavirus Covid-19. The Diamond Princess cruise ship now accounts for the biggest cluster of cases outside mainland China. More than 540 passengers in the Japanese port Yokohama are confirmed to have the virus, after 88 additional cases were confirmed on Tuesday. Experts are still trying to understand how easily the virus transmits, but there are fears that the conditions on the ship \u2013 quarantined after a passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong tested positive \u2013 have allowed the disease to spread more rapidly. Australia Thunderstorms have felled trees and caused power outages across Sydney as damaging winds and large hailstones battered the central and southern parts of coastal NSW. A 37-year-old man died after he was struck by a gas bottle in the CBD just before midnight in an incident police said appeared to be related to the storm. Boris Johnson should block attempts to extradite Julian Assange to the US, say Australian MPs George Christensen and Andrew Wilkie, who visited the Wikileaks founder in prison and described him afterwards as \u201ca man under enormous pressure\u201d whose health and mental health had deteriorated. A three-year-old boy has been found dead on a bus in Queensland. The boy was found in a minibus parked out the front of a school in Edmonton, south of Cairns. Police said it was believed the boy was being taken to a daycare centre and was discovered by the driver of the minibus. Anthony Albanese has invoked his mother as the inspiration for Labor\u2019s latest policy reset, declaring older Australians need to be seen as a boon to the budget, rather than a burden. The world The Harvey Weinstein jury carries the weight of #MeToo into its deliberations. Seven men and five women have been sent out of courtroom 99 at the New York supreme court on Tuesday faced with a monumental collective decision. If they find the defendant guilty Weinstein could face a maximum sentence of life in prison. If they acquit it will send waves of shock and dismay throughout the fledgling #MeToo cause. Britain\u2019s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has rejected British demands for a Canada-style trade deal that would free the UK from EU rules as he made a thinly veiled warning to Boris Johnson not to break his word. A national association of 1,000 US federal judges has called an emergency meeting to address growing concerns about the intervention of Donald Trump and justice department officials in politically sensitive cases, as former Trump advisor Roger Stone\u2019s sentencing takes place on Thursday. The Boy Scouts of America has filed for bankruptcy protection amid an avalanche of sex abuse lawsuits that are set to result in huge victim compensation payments. Many plastic items that Americans put in their recycling bins aren\u2019t being recycled at all, according to a major new survey of hundreds of recycling facilities across the US. The findings confirm the results of a Guardian investigation last year. Recommended reads General Motors announced on Monday that it would axe the Holden brand, saying it would exit the \u201chighly fragmented right-hand-drive market\u201d and \u201cretire\u201d the Australian marque by 2021.

Pressure is hard to quantify and unknown pressure is difficult to prepare for.

      "bodyText": "A Chinese film director, his sister, mother and father have all died from the coronavirus, the latest high-profile victims of the disease in Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak. Chang Kai, 55, died on 14 February. His parents died over the previous two weeks, after the family spent days together in self-quarantine, the Chinese magazine Caixin reported. Chang\u2019s sister died hours after he did, and his wife is in a serious condition. Death rates in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei provinces have been higher than in the rest of China and beyond. Many patients reported struggling to find a bed in hospitals filled far beyond capacity, even as the government built new hospitals and converted spaces like an exhibition centre into makeshift medical centres. Others have died despite intensive medical care including a whistleblower doctor and the head of a hospital. An environmental activist and his wife are also thought to have been killed by coronavirus, although they were not tested for the disease. The World Health Organization has said that although the disease would be mild in four of five patients, about 20% will have more severe symptoms. There are concerns that initial government advice for those with symptoms to stay at home may have exacerbated the toll from the disease, with close confinement leading to whole families being infected. Chang had nursed his father at home after he fell sick in late January. He took the older man to several hospitals, but could not find a bed, Caixin reported. On 28 January he was the family\u2019s first victim but others had already become infected. Chang\u2019s mother died a few days later, then he became seriously ill. The director sent a deathbed message to friends, describing his grief and sending love to his son in London. \u201cFarewell to those I love and to those who loved me!\u201d Authorities are taking suspected coronavirus patients to quarantine centres, sometimes forcibly. The home quarantine policy could have caused clusters of cross-household and cross-community infections by allowing serious infections to progress without treatment, Caixin reported, quoting Chen Bo, a professor at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan. The virus has infected more than 73,000 people and killed 1,875, according to latest data. The vast majority of those cases have been in China, within Hubei province.",
