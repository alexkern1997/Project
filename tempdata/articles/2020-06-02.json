Nature has clearly benefited from several months of dramatically reduced economic activity. From a climate crisis perspective, this drop in emissions is astonishingly close to the 7.6% yearly reduction in emissions that scientists have advised will be necessary during the next decade. And yet none of this is cause for celebration.</p> <p>The resilience of nature is temporary, and will last only as long as the lockdown is enforced. More importantly, the reduction in greenhouse gases is not the result of decarbonising the economy, but the unintended consequence of economic paralysis that has come with painful human consequences and huge costs to lives and livelihoods. This is not what addressing the climate crisis looks like. The thoughtful reduction of greenhouse gases has to be intentional not circumstantial, sustained not temporary. Above all, it must lead to improved human wellbeing, not to human or economic suffering. </p> </blockquote> <p>More here:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/covid-low-carbon-future-lockdown-pandemic-green-economy\">Covid-19 has given us the chance to build a low-carbon future | Christiana Figueres</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed4be468f084df971c8d581\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T08:45:59.424Z\">9.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Other things reopening today include: cinemas in Thailand:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e80698f6ef448de86c3e44a47a701819819eebb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e80698f6ef448de86c3e44a47a701819819eebb/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Customers at a cinema in Bangkok, Thailand\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wear face mask to help curb the spread of the coronavirus during a movie at the Paragon Cineplex cinema in Bangkok, Thailand.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sakchai Lalit/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ikea stores in Britain:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de2811bd75e3f3b290db39236d1a8a853f306d30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de2811bd75e3f3b290db39236d1a8a853f306d30/0_250_4929_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Customers queue outside an Ikea store in Nottingham\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Customers queue outside an Ikea store in Nottingham before it reopens, after the British government relaxed lockdown measures.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73254ec01e55b0086c1700fef496e9d91e5f6b79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73254ec01e55b0086c1700fef496e9d91e5f6b79/0_233_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Customers queue at Ikea in Warrington\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Customers queue at Ikea in Warrington as it re-opens following the lifting of lockdown restrictions in the United Kingdom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And amusement parks in Japan:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a27cb0486663e99e289ebb74ad3ad12f791fa177\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a27cb0486663e99e289ebb74ad3ad12f791fa177/0_0_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A dolphin performs at Hakkeijima Sea Paradise near Tokyo, Japan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wearing face masks enjoy a dolphin performance as the Hakkeijima Sea Paradise amusement park opens after a two-month closure due to the preventative measures to help curb the spread of the coronavirus in Yokohama near Tokyo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Koji Sasahara/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed4bced8f08f5e3730122e2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T08:34:57.780Z\">9.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Trains are running today in Manila for the first time in two months, as the lockdown is eased in the <strong>Philippines</strong>.

Thank you for following along. My colleague Simon Burnton will be taking on the blog now to continue our round-the-clock coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. </p> <p>A reminder that we have a blog dedicated to the George Floyd protests <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/31/george-floyd-protests-latest-news-riots-us-cities-donald-trump-police-brutality-live\">here</a>. </p> <p>Below are the latest developments from the last few hours: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Manila eases lockdown. </strong>Traffic jams and crowds of commuters returned to the Philippine capital on Monday, as Manilla relaxed antivirus measures in a high-stakes gamble to slowly reopen the economy while fighting the coronavirus outbreak. Public transport was still limited and many commuters waited for hours to get a ride despite the government deploying special buses. School classes remain suspended for the next two weeks. Barber shops and beauty salons can open next week at a third of their capacity. The Philippines remains a south-east Asian hotspot for Covid-19, with more than 18,000 infections and 957 deaths.</li> <li><strong>Japan may open doors to travellers from selected countries. </strong>Japan is considering reopening its borders to travellers from selected countries that have low levels of coronavirus infections, as it begins to ease restrictions put in place earlier this year to control the outbreak. As schools, cinemas, sports clubs and department stores reopened in Tokyo on Monday, media have reported that the government is also planning to allow travellers in from Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand in the coming months. There was no immediate comment from the foreign ministry.</li> <li><strong>Hong Kong reports first locally transmitted case in two weeks. </strong>Hong Kong has confirmed its first locally transmitted coronavirus cases in more than two weeks, fuelling concerns over its spread as restrictions on movement are relaxed, Reuters reports. The Centre for Health Protection said on Sunday it was investigating two confirmed cases of coronavirus, taking the number of cases so far to 1,085. Four people have died of the disease in Hong Kong.</li> <li><strong>Wuhan reports zero new asymptomatic cases. </strong>Wuhan, the Chinese city of around 11 million people where the Covid-19 pandemic began, reported no new asymptomatic cases on Sunday, according to Chinese health officials. State media, Xinhua, said on Monday more than 60,000 nucleic acid tests were conducted on Sunday, finding no asymptomatic cases. Mainland China reported 16 new cases overall on Sunday, the highest daily number in three weeks. All were reported as imported cases \u2013 11 in Sichuan province, three in Inner Mongolia, and two in Guangdong. </li> <li><strong>Brazil passes 500,000 Covid-19 cases. </strong>Brazil has reported 16,409 new cases, taking the total of infected cases to 514,849. It keeps the country in second place in terms of infections, behind the US on 1.78 million cases. Brazil has moved into fourth in terms of deaths, with 29,314 fatalities, according to the health ministry. President Jair Bolsonaro has repeatedly dismissed the severity of the virus and continued to flout social distancing measures. On Sunday, he rode a horse to a rally calling for the supreme court to be shut down for investigating him. </li> <li><strong>Moscow eases lockdown despite high virus caseload. </strong>Shopping malls and parks are set to reopen in Moscow on Monday as the Russian capital eases coronavirus restrictions despite having the world\u2019s third-largest caseload, with 405,843 infections. The relaxation of the confinement orders in Moscow, the centre of Russia\u2019s outbreak with a population of more than 12 million, comes after President Vladimir Putin announced the epidemic had passed its peak in the country. </li> <li><strong>North Korea to reopen schools. </strong>North Korea will reopen schools this month after shuttering them over the coronavirus pandemic, reports said on Monday. Pyongyang has not confirmed a single infection but has imposed strict rules, including closing its borders and putting thousands of its people into isolation.

Head here for the latest: UK ministers have been accused of not taking seriously the threat posed to black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) Britons by Covid-19, after it was reported that the release of an official review of the issue had been delayed over fears of potential civil unrest. According to Sky News, officials are concerned about the effect the publication could have amid global anger over the death of George Floyd, an African American man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck. Citing an unnamed government source, Sky said the release of the Public Health England (PHE) review, due by the end of May, had been pushed back yet further because of \u201cworries\u201d around \u201ccurrent global events\u201d. The source was quoted as saying there were concerns in Whitehall about the \u201cclose proximity to the current situation in America\u201d, where protesters are demanding an end to police violence against black people. The source reportedly said it would be a \u201cbad combination\u201d if the review was released amid such tensions. De Cordova added: \u201cThere is a gross irony in delaying the release of a report into the unequal suffering of the BAME community, on the basis of global events that relate to the suffering of black communities around the world. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Trump\u2019s remarks come as the US faces not only national protests, but the number of highest coronavirus infections and deaths worldwide, as well as the Depression-level unemployment the pandemic has caused. The US has 1,804,206 confirmed cases, according to Johns Hopkins University data. There have been 105,003 fatalities. Both figures are far higher than any other country. Brazil has the next highest cases, with roughly half a million. The UK has the next highest deaths, with more than 39,000 lives lost. The US accounts for more than a quarter of cases and deaths worldwide. Meanwhile, new analysis from the US has found that masks and social distancing can help control the coronavirus but hand washing and other measures are still needed, AP reports. Researchers concluded single-layer cloth masks are less effective than surgical masks, while tight-fitting N95 masks provide the best protection. A distance of 1 meter (more than 3 feet) between people lowers the danger of catching the virus, while 2 meters (about 6 1/2 feet) is even better. Eye protection such as eyeglasses or goggles can help too. None of the strategies work perfectly and more rigorous studies are needed, according to the analysis published Monday. With the coronavirus still new, health officials have relied on studies involving its cousins, severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome. The findings come from a systematic review of 44 studies, including seven involving the virus causing Covid-19. The remaining focused on SARS or MERS. Public health officials have given conflicting advice about masks. The World Health Organization, which funded the new analysis, has said healthy people need to wear a mask only if they are caring for a person with Covid-19. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wants everyone to wear at least a cloth mask when grocery shopping or in similar situations where keeping distance is difficult. Fact check: Trump said he \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d states to activate the National Guard. He did not note that many states have already done this. According to one estimate, there are now more than 17,000 National Guard troops activated in 23 states and the District of Columbia. Some have argued that the presence of the National Guard has only further escalated tensions and resulted in increased clashes and violence by police. Trump said he would deploy the military if governors failed to sufficiently deploy national guard members, but that he was immediately deploying the military in Washington DC. Our country always wins. That is why I am taking immediate presidential action to stop the violence and restore security and safety in America. First we are ending the riots and lawlessness that has spread throughout our country. We will end it now. Today I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets. Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled. If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. I am also taking swift and decisive action to protect our great capital - Washington DC. What happened in this city last night was a total disgrace. As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily-armed soldiers, military personnel, and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults, and the wanton destruction of property. We are putting everybody on warning - a 7:00 curfew will be strictly enforced. Those who threaten innocent lives and property, will be arrested, detained and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. I want the organisers of this terror to be on notice that you will face severe criminal penalties and lengthy sentences in jail. This includes Antifa and others who are leading instigators of this violence. Here are those comments in more detail. Trump mentioned the virus once, saying the protests mean, \u201cBrave nurses who have battled the virus are afraid to leave their homes.\u201d My fellow Americans, my first and highest duty as president is to defend our great country and the American people. I swore an oath to uphold the laws of our nation and that is exactly what I will do. All Americans were rightly sickened and revolted by the brutal death of George Floyd. My administration is fully committed that for George and his family, justice will be served. He will not have died in vain. But we cannot allow the righteous cries of peaceful protesters to be drowned out by an angry mob, the biggest victims of the rioting are peace-loving citizens in our poorest communities and as their president I will fight to keep them safe. I will fight to protect you. ... Innocent people have been savagely beaten like the young man in Dallas, Texas, who was left dying on the street or the woman in Upstate New York viciously attacked by dangerous thugs. Small business owners have seen their dreams utterly destroyed. New York\u2019s finest have been hit in the face with bricks. Brave nurses who have battled the virus are afraid to leave their homes. A police precinct has been overrun here in the nation\u2019s capital, the Lincoln Memorial and the World War II Memorial have been vandalised. One of our most historic churches was set ablaze. A federal officer in California, an African-American enforcement hero, was shot and killed. These are not acts of peaceful protests. These are acts of domestic terror, the destruction of innocent life and the spilling of innocent blood is an offence to humanity and a crime against God. Trump has ended his speech without taking questions from the press. \u201cWhat happened in [Washington DC] last night was a total disgrace,\u201d he says. Those who ignore the curfew in Washington will be arrested and prosecuted to \u201cthe fullest extent of the law.\u201d He is deploying \u201cthousands\u201d of soldiers into the city. \u201cWe are ending the riots and lawlessness that has spread throughout our country. We will end it now,\u201d says Trump. Trump has recommended to every governor to deploy the national guard in \u201csufficient numbers until we dominate the streets.\u201d Those cities who do not deploy sufficient national guard members will see the military deployed there by the president. US President Donald Trump has started his address. \u201cAll Americans were rightly sickened and revolted by the brutal death of George Floyd,\u201d he says. He will not let it go unpunished. \u201cWe cannot allow the righteous cries of peaceful protestors to be drowned out by an angry mob,\u201d he says. \u201cI am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protestors.\u201d He says in recent days the country has been gripped by rioters, looters, and antifa, among others. He calls some of the acts of destruction in the protest acts of \u201cdomestic terror.\u201d This report from earlier explains the worries over how the George Floyd protests sweeping the US may lead to a surge in coronavirus cases: According to figures from Johns Hopkins University in Maryland, the US has seen nearly 1.8m infections and nearly 104,000 deaths in the Covid-19 pandemic. In a country that does not have universal healthcare, the crisis has disproportionately affected minorities, particularly those who live in crowded urban areas. Images of demonstrators in close proximity, many without masks, have therefore alarmed leaders \u2013 to the point where some are pleading with those on the streets to protest \u201cthe right way\u201d, in order to better protect themselves. Read more here: My colleagues on our US live blog also report that Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top public health expert and Covid-19 task force member, said he was no longer in frequent contact with the president. Asked whether the president talks to him often about Covid vaccine work, he told a reporter with Stat News, \u201cNo ... As you probably noticed, that the task force meetings have not occurred as often lately. And certainly my meetings with the president have been dramatically decreased.\u201d Fauci noted that they used to have task force meetings daily, including on the weekend, and said that frequently, the two would talk after the meeting, estimating that a month ago, they met four times a week. Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also told a CNN reporter that he has not spoken or met with Trump in two weeks and that their last interaction was 18 May, during a teleconference with the nation\u2019s governors. Trump\u2019s address comes as the Hennepin County Medical Examiner declares the death of George Floyd a homicide, saying he died of \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual restraint, and neck compression\u201d, according to Reuters, who cited a local a Minneapolis station. Hi, Helen Sullivan joining you now. US president Donald Trump is due to begin speaking shortly, in his first address since the protests in the US began. We\u2019ll be bringing you his comments as they relate to the pandemic live. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Citing an unnamed government source, Sky News is reporting that the release of the Public Health England (PHE) review is being pushed back because of \u201cworries\u201d around \u201ccurrent global events\u201d. The source is quoted as saying there are concerns in Whitehall about the \u201cclose proximity to the current situation in America\u201d, where protesters are demanding an end to police violence against black people. The source reportedly said it would be a \u201cbad combination\u201d if the report was released amid such tensions. In the UK, the opposition Labour party is condemning the government as it is reported that the publication of an official review of how people of black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds are affected by the virus is being delayed due to concerns about potential public unrest. Marsha de Cordova, the shadow women\u2019s and equalities secretary, has said: It is unacceptable that this review should be delayed without a given date for its publication. BAME communities need answers. There is a gross irony in delaying the release of a report into the unequal suffering of the BAME community, on the basis of global events that relate to the suffering of black communities around the world. If anything, recent events make the release of this report all the more urgent. If the government is serious about tackling racial injustice, they should not be shying away from understanding into why these injustices exist. Tens of thousands of new arrivals to the UK will be able to go food shopping, change accommodation and use public transport from airports during a 14-day quarantine imposed to prevent a second wave of coronavirus, under draft plans to be laid before parliament, Vikram Dodd and Peter Walker write. The Guardian understands that about a fifth of people are expected to receive a spot-check to ensure that they are staying at the address or addresses they have provided to the authorities, but enforcement of the quarantine will be limited. The rules, still being finalised and due to be published on Tuesday before coming into effect next week, have prompted cross-party concerns about the potentially limited impact on public health amid warnings of the severe damage that could be caused to the travel and aviation industry. More than 400 British travellers will be able to return home from central and South America on special charter flights this month, the UK government has said. Two transatlantic flights from Costa Rica and Ecuador will leave for London Stansted on 11 June. British travellers from Panama, Nicaragua, Guatemala and Chile will be able to board \u201csweeper flights\u201d which will take them to Costa Rica and Ecuador for the final transatlantic passage back to the UK. The government has brought back more than 2,100 British travellers from the region during the pandemic. Foreign and Commonwealth Office minister for the Americas Wendy Morton said: Our teams across the region are doing everything they can to get as many people as possible home to their families and will continue to provide support to British nationals who remain. The two flights will leave from San Jose in Costa Rica and Quito in Ecuador. Priority will be given to short-term British travellers aged over 70, those who have medical requirements, people travelling with young children and others located in remote or \u201cat-risk\u201d areas, the government said. In the UK, ministers in the devolved administrations have criticised limits imposed by Westminster on the number of students from England they can recruit to their universities. The new temporary cap is designed to prevent over-recruitment by higher education institutions to make up for lost revenue caused by a drop in international students because of the pandemic. The Welsh minister for education Kirsty Williams tweeted: Scotland\u2019s higher education minister Richard Lochhead said: In the face of huge uncertainty, Scottish universities and colleges are working to continue to deliver world class, and safe, learning and teaching. So the UK government\u2019s plan to restrict the number of English students that can come to Scotland \u2013 a plan which neither the Scottish government nor Universities Scotland have agreed to \u2013 is deeply disappointing. It is completely unnecessary and could add further damage to the sector, given that around 10% of current enrolments are from England. The UK government should be working with the devolved administrations to support higher education at a time of crisis not imposing, without agreement, targets and sanctions which are aimed at stabilising the English market and are not relevant to Scotland. Egypt has confirmed 1,399 new cases, the country\u2019s health ministry says; the first time it has decelerated for a week. That is down from 1,536 reported the day before, but still almost double the number on the same day a week ago. Egypt has reported a total of 26,384 cases, of which 6,297 have recovered and 1,005 died, the ministry said. Pakistanis are being urged to \u201clive with the virus\u201d as the country\u2019s prime minister Imran Khan pushes ahead with a plan to lift lockdown restrictions despite rising infections and deaths, citing the economic losses being suffered. Pakistan has rolled back almost all measures, primarily to avert an economic meltdown. The country will open to tourism but cinemas, theatres and schools remain closed. The nation of 220 million has reported 72,160 cases and 1,543 deaths, which jumped lately to as high as 80 a day. The country cannot afford to match the losses incurred as many other countries have done, Khan said. He cited 50 million people who live below the poverty line and 25 million daily wagers. He said his government has given cash handouts to the poor, which wasn\u2019t possible to continue on such a large scale, adding around 130 million to 150 million people were adversely affected by the shutdowns. Our conditions don\u2019t allow that we keep feeding money to them, how long we can give them money. He urged people to act responsibly but more infections and deaths were inevitable. This virus will spread more. I have to say it with regret that there will be more deaths. If people do take care they can live with the virus. Slovakia is undoing more restrictions this week, including opening indoor sports centres and pools, as the country with one of the world\u2019s lowest death rates from the outbreak moves ahead with reopening. The government has agreed to relax rules in restaurants by cutting the distance between customers, to open up sports events to limited crowds and to make it easier to visit people in hospital, the prime minister, Igor Matovi\u010d, said. From 10 June, up to 500 people will be allowed at public events and the limit will rise to 1,000 from July. The Israeli prime minister\u2019s office says an employee has tested positive for Covid-19. Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said an \u201cepidemiological investigation is being conducted, which will provide appropriate guidelines for those who came into contact\u201d with the staff member. It did not say whether the 70-year-old leader has been exposed. Netanyahu has already gone into isolation twice. The first time was in March, after he came into contact with an infected aide. The second was in April, after his then-health minister was diagnosed with the virus. The premier tested negative on both those occasions. Israel\u2019s health ministry generally requires 14-days of self-isolation for anyone deemed to have been in proximity with an infected person. The Czech Republic will welcome foreign travellers from 15 June as it introduces a system to classify other countries according to the level of risk Prague believes they pose. Czech officials will place 19 European states, mostly central, eastern and south-eastern nations, in the least-risky category under their new colour-coded system, while putting travel to and from the UK and Sweden in the riskiest category. The Czech Republic has undone most restrictions, with restaurants and hotels fully reopened on 25 May. But tourism suffered as lockdown measures hit the economy, and only short-term business travellers from the European Union, people in transit or students were allowed into the country. Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Known global cases of coronavirus have exceeded 6.2m, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. They say at least 6,206,773 people are known to have been infected and at least 372,752 are known to have died since the outbreak began. Spain has reported no coronavirus deaths in a 24-hour period for the first time since March. The emergency health response chief, Fernando Sim\u00f3n, called the development very encouraging. There were only 71 new infections over the past 24 hours, he said. Public trust in the UK government as a source of accurate information about the epidemic has collapsed, suggesting ministers may struggle to maintain lockdown restrictions in the aftermath of the Dominic Cummings affair. There were fears of resurgence in Germany, after the country\u2019s disease control body confirmed 333 new infections and 11 new deaths. The reproduction rate rose to 1.04 on Sunday, staying above the critical threshold of 1 for a second day. Malaysia\u2019s health ministry has said it is now 10 days since Malaysia suffered a coronavirus-related death. On Monday, the country reported 38 new cases, bringing the cumulative total to 7,857 cases. The death toll stands at 115. Bars and restaurants reopened in the Netherlands for the first time in three months. Along with museums, cinemas and theatres, they were allowed to open their doors as long as they followed strict social distancing rules. Long queues stretched outside railway stations in major Indian cities as authorities eased a nationwide lockdown despite a record daily rise in cases. Rail services, apart from the movement of some essential cargo, were halted in late March ahead of efforts to contain the virus that froze almost all economic activity. The family of a Covid-19 victim have called for an inquiry into the Champions League match between Liverpool v Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in March. Richard Mawson, 70, was \u201cfit and healthy\u201d before the match on 11 March, his wife Mary said. The coronavirus outbreak has led to a childcare crisis that threatens to undermine the reopening of the US economy, the Associated Press reports. More than one-third of families report that someone has stayed home from work to mind their children because of the outbreak, according to a nationwide survey by the Urban Institute, an economic policy research group. In most states, schools are due to remain closed until September, while most summer camps are not scheduled to take place this year. Thousands of daycares are closed, many of them following the lead of school districts, while some remain open only for the children of essential workers. The informal network of relatives and friends that many parents rely on has disintegrated in a world of social distancing. \u201cPeople are going to find that if there is no childcare system to return to, they aren\u2019t going to be able to go back to work,\u201d said Catherine White, director of childcare and early learning at the National Women\u2019s Law Center, which supported a coalition of more than 500 childcare providers and advocates in calling for the $50bn relief bill. \u201cWomen especially are going to pay the price,\u201d White added, noting that even before the pandemic, mothers were more likely than fathers to leave the workforce over childcare difficulties. \u201cWomen are over half the workforce. What does that mean for our economy if women can\u2019t go back to work?\u201d Churches and mosques will reopen in Nigeria from Tuesday, the chairman of the presidential taskforce for Covid-19 has said. Boss Mustapha, the country\u2019s most senior civil servant, also said a lockdown in the northern city of Kano would be eased, one of a number of changes over four weeks from Tuesday. Another official said the aviation industry had been asked to prepare for the possible resumption of domestic flights from 21 June. He added that a national curfew would be shortened to 10pm-4am from Tuesday, from the current 8pm-6am order. Nigeria\u2019s financial sector will also be able to resume normal working hours, said Sani Aliyu, the national coordinator of the taskforce. Other curbs remain in place, such as a ban on interstate travel, with a few exceptions, such as for essential workers. And face masks must still be worn in public. Nigeria has recorded 10,162 confirmed cases and 287 deaths. \u201cNigeria has not reached the peak of confirmed cases,\u201d Mustapha told reporters. The World Health Organization\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said he wants his organisation to continue working with the US, despite Donald Trump\u2019s decision to cut ties with it. At the UN health agency\u2019s regular coronavirus briefing, Tedros said US involvement with the organisation had made a \u201cgreat difference\u201d over the decades and \u201cit is WHO\u2019s wish for this collaboration to continue\u201d. Trump, the US president, said on Friday he was severing US ties with the WHO, which he says failed to do enough to combat the initial spread of the novel coronavirus. He has accused the Geneva-based organisation of being a \u201cpuppet\u201d of China. Responding to Trump\u2019s announcement, Tedros said on Monday: \u201cWe have received questions about Friday\u2019s announcement by the president of the United States of America. The world has long benefited from the strong, collaborative engagement with the government and the people of the United States. \u201cThe US government and people\u2019s contribution and generosity towards global health over many decades has been immense, and it has made a great difference in public health all around the world. It is WHO\u2019s wish for this collaboration to continue.\u201d Tedros said the \u201conly communication\u201d the WHO had had with US authorities was Friday\u2019s statement from Trump. The prime minister of Armenia, Nikol Pashinyan, has said he has tested positive for the novel coronavirus and that members of his family were also infected, Reuters reports. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any symptoms, I decided to take a test as I was planning to visit the frontline,\u201d Pashinyan said during a Facebook live video. Armenia, which has a population of 3 million, had registered 9,492 confirmed coronavirus cases and 139 deaths as of Monday. The deputy prime minister, Tigran Avinyan, said later on Monday that the country would resume international flights in mid-July to support the domestic tourism industry. There has been one death from Covid-19 in Ireland, the department of health has reported. Meanwhile, the total death toll from the disease has been revised down by three. A scientific row has erupted after a leading doctor in Italy claimed that the coronavirus \u201cno longer exists\u201d in the country. \u201cIn reality, the virus clinically no longer exists in Italy,\u201d said Alberto Zangrillo, head of the San Raffaele hospital in Milan, capital of the northern Lombardy region, which has been the worst hit by the pandemic. \u201cThe swabs performed over the past 10 days have showed a viral load that is absolutely infinitesimal in quantitative terms compared to those carried out a month or two months ago,\u201d he said in an interview on RAI television on Sunday. \u201cSomeone has to take responsibility for terrorising the country.\u201d Other experts countered that Zangrillo may have mistaken a higher detection rate of asymptomatic cases for diminished potency of the virus. \u201cIn a situation where the numbers of severe cases are falling, there may be time to start observing people with less severe symptoms \u2013 giving the impression that the virus is changing,\u201d said Martin Hibberd, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Dr Oscar MacLean, of the MRC-University of Glasgow centre for virus research, said Zangrillo\u2019s claims were \u201cnot supported by anything in the scientific literature, and also seem fairly implausible on genetic grounds\u201d. The dispute came as Italy prepares its next big step in easing its three-month-old national lockdown with the readmittance of foreign tourists from Wednesday and an end to the ban on travel between regions. The government has insisted that this is one of the most dangerous phases of the pandemic and has urged people to abide by social distancing rules and wear masks to prevent the virus from spreading once again. Italy reported 355 new cases of the virus on Sunday, mostly in the Lombardy region. Spain is reporting no deaths in a 24-hour period from the new coronavirus for the first time since March, according to the Associated Press. The emergency health response chief, Fernando Sim\u00f3n, said the development was very, very encouraging. He told a news conference on Monday that there had been only 71 new infections over the past 24 hours. The official death toll now stands at 27,127, with 240,000 confirmed cases. People in South Africa rushed to off-licences on Monday as a nine-week ban on alcohol sales, brought in when the country went into coronavirus lockdown, was finally lifted. The mood was festive in Soweto, on the outskirts of Johannesburg, where customers carrying crates of empty beer bottles waited out the meandering lines, some stationed in their cars, blasting loud music from their stereos, AFP reports. \u201cWe are overwhelmed, over the moon, so excited,\u201d said queueing customer Bongani Khumalo. \u201cThis place is jamming,\u201d he exclaimed, adding that celebrations were expected throughout the township. \u201cI\u2019m here to buy my beloved beer,\u201d said 31-year-old nurse Anele Mapoma. \u201cIt has been a while since I had a taste of that foam and burping (so) I am here so early to satisfy my habit,\u201d he said. Another Soweto resident, who asked not be named, said she had been looking forward to \u201cthis day for an entire month\u201d. \u201cI had to wake up super early to be here so I\u2019m all good now,\u201d the 24-year-old said as she stood outside a liquor store in the suburb of Pimville, wearing a face mask and dark hoodie. On Monday, South Africa moved to level three of its five-tier shutdown. The easing of measures comes despite a recent surge in coronavirus cases, with 1,674 more announced on Monday bringing the cumulative total in the country to 34,357. Of those, 705 people have died and 16,808 have recovered. The Colosseum, completed under Emperor Titus in AD80, was among many of famous cultural sites in Italy, including the Vatican Museums, to come back to life on Monday after being closed for more than three months as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, writes Angela Giuffrida, the Guardian\u2019s Rome correspondent. And many Romans are making the most of having the city\u2019s landmarks all to themselves: gone are the snake-like queues, street pedlars and ticket touts. \u201cThis is the only silver lining during these dark times,\u201d said Francesco Cipolla, 25, who lives near Rome and was also touring the Colosseum for the first time. \u201cIt just feels incredible to be inside this gigantic Roman structure. It\u2019s a time to appreciate all we have. The lack of crowds helps you live the experience more. We are going to the Vatican Museums after this.\u201d Just a single lab confirmed case of coronavirus was reported by Thailand on Monday, as authorities allowed the reopening of some beaches as part of an easing of public health measures. In Pattaya, visitors marvelled at the clarity of the turquoise-blue waters of the Gulf of Thailand, as pensioners eager for exercise walked along the beach, AFP reported. Social distancing rules still applied, with local authorities ordering beachgoers to stay at least a metre apart. Thailand has been under various lockdown restrictions since mid-March, when authorities declared a state of emergency against the coronavirus - shuttering malls, leisure centres and public spaces, including its famed beaches. Not all beaches were closed during the lockdown, and not all re-opened Monday. Phuket, in the south, is still off-limits, while sleepy Hua Hin remained open throughout. Thailand has recorded 3,082 cases of coronavirus. Of those 2,965 have recovered and 57 have died. Sixty are still receiving treatment. Long queues stretched outside railway stations in major cities in India on Monday as authorities eased a nationwide lockdown despite a record daily spike in coronavirus cases, AFP reports. Rail services, apart from the movement of some essential cargo, were abruptly halted in late March ahead of efforts to contain the virus that froze almost all economic activity, putting millions out of work overnight. But as New Delhi tried to get the economy moving again, officials reported 8,392 fresh coronavirus infections - the steepest daily increase yet - taking the toll to more than 190,000 cases with over 5,000 dead. At least 149,000 passengers were expected to board trains on Monday as Indian Railways ramped up the number of journeys from 30 to 200. Almost 2.6 million people are booked to travel in June on interstate trains - a network which normally carries over 20 million passengers a day, the railway ministry said. The World Health Organization\u2019s regular coronavirus briefing is just beginning. You can watch it in the player embedded at the top of the blog. Lebanon\u2019s health minister has said it is too early to declare victory over the coronavirus, even as the country opens back up from restrictions to curb its spread. \u201cI think the worst-case scenario has passed and is behind us, but at the same time we need to stay alert and we are taking measures in all regions,\u201d Hamad Hassan told AFP. \u201cIt\u2019s still early to announce a victory but we have scored points against the virus and we won\u2019t relinquish our lead,\u201d Hassan said speaking from his home in the city of Baalbek. After weeks of lockdown, the government announced on Sunday that restrictions would be eased this week, including a curfew which is pushed back from 7.00pm to midnight. The country of six million has recorded a remarkably low number of cases and the official death toll is around 10 times lower than some countries with roughly the same population such as Israel, Norway or the United Arab Emirates. The Democratic Republic of Congo reported 125 new cases of coronavirus on Monday, plus a fresh case of another, far more worrying outbreak. Doctors in the central African country confirmed a case of Ebola in the western province of Equateur, more than 1,000 km (620 miles) away from the ongoing outbreak in the country\u2019s east, the health minister, Eteni Longondo, said. In April, DRC was days from declaring the end of the second-largest Ebola epidemic on record when a new chain of infection was confirmed in the east. Terraces throughout the Netherlands filled quickly on Monday, Reuters reports as bars and restaurants were allowed to open for the first time in almost three months. Along with museums, cinemas and theatres, they were allowed to open their doors from Monday morning as long as they follow strict social distancing rules. They are now allowed to receive a maximum of 30 customers at a time, who have to make reservations in advance and need to be seated at tables spaced at least 1.5 metres apart. Public transport, which had been limited during the lockdown, also returned to regular service on Monday with all travellers and staff required to wear face masks. On Monday, the Dutch institute for public health reported that a further 103 people had tested positive for coronavirus, the lowest number reported since 10 March, raising the total number of cases in the country to 46,545. Six more have died, taking the country\u2019s death toll to 5,962. Secondary schools will reopen on Tuesday, following a partial opening of primary schools last month. Sweden reported 232 new cases of coronavirus on Monday. Eight more people have been recorded as dying of the virus, according to the latest update, which puts the total death toll at 4,403 and the cumulative case load at 37,814. Sweden generally reports comparatively few deaths and new infections on a Monday, given delays in reporting over the weekend. But even taking that into account it is clear there has been a fall in the spread and mortality of its Covid-19 outbreak. Observers have kept a keen eye on developments in the country, which chose not to impose the kinds of strict, mandatory lockdown measures used in attempts to contain the spread of the virus elsewhere in Europe. Its approach, mostly based on voluntary social distancing and basic hygiene, has been criticised by some as a dangerous experiment, but also touted as a model for responding to the outbreak by the World Health Organization. Critics leaped on figures last week that showed Sweden had the highest number of Covid-19 deaths in Europe per capita over a seven-day-period. However, its death rate from the outbreak remains well below other badly affected European countries that did impose strict containment measures, such as Italy, Spain and the UK. Dozens of fireworks displays erupted simultaneously across Japan on Monday to cheer up the public, urge the gods to end the pandemic and provide practice for struggling pyrotechnic artisans. More than 160 manufacturers launched their displays at precisely 8:00 pm (1100 GMT) at secret locations across the country for a five-minute display called \u201cCheer up Hanabi\u201d (fireworks). Many South Africans spent their Monday morning lining up outside liquor stores, as alcohol sales were allowed again after a two-month ban because of the coronavirus outbreak. But while South Africa with the continent\u2019s most developed economy and the highest number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 relaxed its strict lockdown, the reopening of most school classes was delayed and there was debate about how churches could safely resume services, the Associated Press reports. The government postponed the planned opening of two grades for another week so that some under-prepared schools could get ready to resume classes for grades 7 and 12, the final years of elementary school and high school. Places of worship were allowed to open from Monday with limits on the number of people in congregations, yet many religious groups said they would refuse the opportunity as they were concerned about the danger of allowing people to gather in an enclosed building. South Africa has reported over 32,000 Covid-19 cases and more than 600 people have died, with warnings the peak is not expected until August or September. The relaxation of the alcohol ban came as a relief to many, who chose restocking their liquor cabinets instead of going straight to work on the day much of the country\u2019s economy also reopened. In the township of Macassar, near Cape Town, people left home at 4.30am, residents said, to secure places in lines at liquor stores. The stores were set to open at 9am for the first time since 26 March. Some walked with plastic crates to carry the bottles of beer and wine that they planned to buy, according to the report. Cheers rose in a Johannesburg supermarket when screens were removed from wine racks to allow sales to begin. Shelves of popular brands of alcohol were emptied in two hours at one liquor shop in an affluent suburb of Johannesburg. Alcohol is only allowed to be sold from Monday to Thursday between 9am and 5pm, under the new relaxed measures. Hi. This is Caroline Davies taking over the blog for a while. You can contact me on caroline.davies@theguardian.com Prevention and treatment services for cancer, heart disease, diabetes and other non-communicable diseases have been severely disrupted around the globe by the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization has said. More than half (53%) of the countries surveyed have partially or completely disrupted services for hypertension treatment; 49% for treatment for diabetes and diabetes-related complications; 42% for cancer treatment, and 31% for cardiovascular emergencies. Rehabilitation services have been disrupted in almost two-thirds (63%) of countries, despite the importance of rehabilitation to a healthy recovery following severe cases of Covid-19. The most common reasons for discontinuing or reducing services were cancellations of planned treatments, a decrease in public transport available and a lack of staff because health workers had been reassigned to support Covid-19 services. In one in five countries reporting disruptions, one of the main reasons for discontinuing services was a shortage of medicines, diagnostics and other technologies. The 155-country survey carried out for the UN health body found that the impact was being felt the most in poorer countries. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, said: The results of this survey confirm what we have been hearing from countries for a number of weeks now. Many people who need treatment for diseases like cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes have not been receiving the health services and medicines they need since the Covid-19 pandemic began. It\u2019s vital that countries find innovative ways to ensure that essential services for non-communicable diseases continue, even as they fight Covid-19. It is now 10 days since anyone died a coronavirus-related death in Malaysia, according to the latest update from the health ministry. On Monday, the country reported 38 new coronavirus cases, bringing the cumulative total to 7,857 cases, Reuters reports. The death toll stands at 115. Cross-country and local train services have resumed in Ukraine, AFP reports. With the number of new cases falling in recent weeks, the country has been gradually easing restrictions, allowing the Kiev subway, shopping malls, outdoor cafes, beauty salons, dental clinics and parks to reopen. On Monday, about 40 long-distance train services and more than 200 suburban routes reopened, with passengers required to wear face masks and follow social distancing rules, the French news agency cited officials as saying. Passengers would have their temperatures taken and train cars would be disinfected after each trip, the national railway operator said in a statement. Ticket sales would also be limited to half of the usual seats to prevent crowding. Ukraine had recorded 24,012 coronavirus cases and 718 deaths as of Monday, fewer than in many countries but enough to raise concerns for its under-funded healthcare system. Germany recorded 333 confirmed new infections and 11 new deaths linked to Covid-19, the country\u2019s disease control body said on Monday, writes Philip Oltermann, the Guardian\u2019s Berlin bureau chief. According to the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has recorded a total of 181,815 people infected with the virus since the outbreak of the pandemic, and 8,511 deaths. The reproduction number (R), indicating how many new cases one infected person generates on average,rose to 1.04 on Sunday, staying above the critical threshold of one for the second row in a day. The Robert Koch Institute has warned that the R was more likely to fluctuate while the overall number of new infections was low, and the latest rise might be linked to an outbreak of the virus in the city of G\u00f6ttingen, in Lower Saxony. At least 36 people were tested positive and more than 150 put into quarantine after health authorities in the city linked an outbreak to a number of private parties and an illegally opened shisha bar. Greece has taken another step towards normality today lifting lockdown restrictions on hotels, open-air cinemas, golf courses and public swimming pools, writes Helena Smith, the Guardian\u2019s Athens correspondent. The measures come as the country prepares to \u201cwelcome the world,\u201d according to a new travel advisory released by the Greek foreign ministry at the weekend. All air links into Athens and Thessaloniki, Greece\u2019s northern metropolis, will resume as of 15 June which effectively means the nation will be re-opening to all foreign visitors after months of pandemic-enforced closure although regulations will be strict and ultimately dependent on points of departure: mandatory Covid-19 testing, and one or two- week periods of quarantine, will be required if passengers fly in from airports deemed by Europe\u2019s aviation safety agency, EASA, to be in \u201chigh risk\u201d coronavirus transmission areas. After enforcing strict lockdown measures early on, Greece has managed to contain the virus relatively well, recording less than 3,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and a death toll of 175. In a nation so dependent on tourism, arrivals are now eagerly awaited with Greek media reports suggesting hotels are already receiving bookings. As preparations get underway the owners of open-air cinemas \u2013 a quintessential delight of any Greek summer \u2013 were also getting in the mood this morning. At the Cine Thision, Athens\u2019 oldest outdoors cinema within view of the Acropolis, Michalis Maniakis who oversees the family-run business with his uncle, Thomas, expressed confidence even if the venerable institutions will only be able to operate at 40 % capacity thanks to the virus. \u201cWe got through ten years of economic crisis, we\u2019ll get through coronavirus too,\u201d he said. \u201cThe summer is around the corner and the heat will pick up. There\u2019ll be lots of long perfect nights to watch movies.\u201d Primary school children also went back to class today. Istanbul\u2019s 550-year-old Grand Bazaar reopened its doors on Monday for the first time in more than two months as cities across Turkey prepared to ease restrictions imposed to control the Covid-19 crisis, writes Bethan McKernan in the Turkish capital. Cafes, restaurants, public buildings, sports facilities, childcare centres, parks and beaches have been allowed to reopen from today, although in Istanbul at least torrential rain kept public spaces empty. An intercity travel ban was also lifted Monday, with cross-country rail travel and some domestic flights resuming. International flights are scheduled to restart from 10 June. Turkey currently has the tenth worst coronavirus outbreak in the world by number of cases, at 163,942, but has recorded a much lower death rate than other badly-hit countries, which reached 4,540 on Sunday. People over 60 and under the age of 18 are still subject to a curfew until further notice. Some schools in parts of Catalonia are reopening today as the region eases out of lockdown, but attendance will be voluntary, writes Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent. In nurseries and primary schools, priority is being given to the children of parents who cannot work from home, while secondary schools will be resuming with groups of no more than 15 pupils. Most Spanish children will not return to school until September. As of Monday, almost 70% of Spain is in the third and penultimate stage of the de-escalation. While much of Catalonia is in the third stage, the Barcelona metropolitan area remains in the second phase, as does the Madrid region. Both areas have been hit hard by Covid-19, which has killed 27,127 people in Spain and infected 239,479. The Balearic island of Formentera is now in the final phase, as are the Canary island of La Gomera, El Hierro and La Graciosa. Cultural institutions are also coming out of lockdown this week. Bilbao\u2019s Guggenheim museum, which reopened on Monday, has cut visitor capacity to one third, and visitors will have their temperatures taken on the way in. Madrid\u2019s famous trio of art museums \u2013 the Prado, the Reina Sof\u00eda and the Thyssen \u2013 are due to open again on Saturday. On Sunday, the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, announced that his Socialist-led coalition government would be seeking congress\u2019s approval for a sixth and final extension of the state of emergency, which has been in force since 14 March. If granted, the extension will run until 21 June. Patrick Wintour, the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor, has now written an update on the situation in Iran where, as I reported earlier, figures suggest a second wave of coronavirus infection is spreading. He writes: Fresh signs that Iran has failed to bring the Coronavirus outbreak under control emerged today when the Iranian health ministry said 3,000 new infections had been recorded in the previous 24 hours, the highest figure for two months. Iran\u2019s new infections total has been rising for nearly two weeks, but now the pace is accelerating leading the Iranian authorities to acknowledge a second wave is underway. Critics will claim Iran lifted controls prematurely. Others will claim the rise is due to an increase in the numbers being tested, and the reversal is confined to three or four provinces. The latest figures showed 2,979 new infections in the previous 24 hours taking the total of infections to 154,445. The daily figure is the highest since the end of March. The comparative figure for 1 May was 802 new infections. The number of deaths is also starting to rise with 81 dead in the previous 24 hours, the highest figure since 27 April. The government has been slowly lifting travel restrictions, and opening mosques. But the health ministry admitted that the new guidelines were not being followed in many workplaces and on public transport. Projected new buses for use in Tehran, necessary to reduce overcrowding, have not materialised. Iran has been under economic pressure to lift the restrictions, and get its economy, already shattered by sanctions, back moving. Nearly $2.5bn damage has been in 13 sectors of the economy, the government estimated yesterday. Inflation is projected to settle at 24 % next year. Afghanistan has recorded 545 new coronavirus cases and 8 deaths on Monday as Kabul recorded lowest number of new infections in more than a month, Akhtar Mohammad Makoii reports from the city of Herat. The latest update takes total number of transmissions in Afghanistan to 15,750, and the death toll to 265. There have been 1,428 recoveries. Most of the new cases on Monday were detected in the western province of Herat, which is the country\u2019s worst affected area in number of deaths. The capital, Kabul which is Afghanistan\u2019s worst affected area by number of infections, with 6,212 confirmed cases, has reported a record low day in the number of new infections for more than a month as health ministry recorded 66 new cases out 333 tests. Yesterday, the number of new infections in Kabul was 371. Wahid Majroh, deputy health minister said on Sunday that the the virus is spreading so fast in Afghanistan because people continue to break lockdown regulations. \u201cWe can control the pandemic in around four weeks if people cooperate, but in the case which witness Kabul\u2019s streets these days, the catastrophe will spread more\u201d Majroh said. He said the situation in Afghanistan is critical and asked all health workers of the country to join the health ministry to help the fight against coronavirus. The situation in southern province of Kandahar is increasingly concerning as no suspected patient had been tested in around three weeks, due to a problem in the testing process that has generated a huge backlog. Health officials have been sending samples from suspected patients to nearby provinces such as Helmand. Majroh said he has instructed the health sector of Kandahar and nearby provinces to send samples to Kabul. Elsewhere in the country, eastern province of Nangarhar and northern province of Balkh, which saw a surge in number of new infections, recorded 96 new cases combined. People in Finland and Norway can enjoy a long-awaited drink with friends today, with both countries set to reopen bars after months of closures. Things will not be as they remember them, however, as both governments are only allowing reopenings subject to new social distancing guidelines and shorter hours, the French news agency AFP reports. In Finland, where bars and restaurants have been closed to indoor customers since 4 April, they will only be allowed to admit half of their normal capacity, according to regulations that will stay in place until at least the end of October. Outdoor terraces and gardens will have no customer limits, however, with the law telling punters not to get \u201ctoo close\u201d to each other without specifying a minimum distance. Finland, a country of 5.5 million, has reported 6,776 Covid-19 infections and 314 deaths. In Norway many were expected to take advantage of the warm weather on Monday\u2019s bank holiday to enjoy an \u201cutepils\u201d - a beer consumed outdoors. Rules stipulate that groups must be limited to 20 people, with distances of 1 metre (3ft) between each person except for those living under the same roof. Only table service is allowed, regular disinfection of tables and chairs is required, and establishments must close by 11.30pm. Bars that also serve food were authorised to reopen in early May. Norway, which has confirmed 8,411 cases and 236 deaths from coronavirus, imposed strict measures to curb the spread of the virus on 12 March. Restaurants and cafes reopened under strict rules in Turkey on Monday, as the country continued easing its coronavirus restrictions. As millions of public sector workers returned to work, and an intercity travel ban was lifted, many other amenities, including parks, beaches, libraries and museums, also reopened across the country. The national flag carrier Turkish Airlines said its first plane since the ban took off from Istanbul to the capital Ankara at 0700 GMT. International flights have been suspended until 10 June. Turkey, with a population of 83 million, has recorded about 164,000 coronavirus infections and more than 4,500 virus-related deaths. But with nearly 128,000 patients now recovered, the government is boasting of its success in handling the outbreak and avoiding becoming a virus hotspot such as Italy or the UK. Officials say the pandemic is now under control, but have warned the public to respect social distancing rules and wear masks outside. Child protection experts say that Covid-19 school closures have exposed children around the world to human rights abuses such as forced genital mutilation, early marriage and sexual violence, Harriet Grant writes. Globally, the World Bank estimates that 1.6 billion children were locked out of education by Covid-19. As schools in England and around the world prepare to reopen this week, NGOs warn that millions of the world\u2019s most vulnerable children may never return to the classroom, and say that after decades fighting for girls\u2019 education the pandemic could cause gender equality in education to be set back decades. In Tanzania, girls sent home from boarding schools where they were being protected from FGM have already been cut. In the Sahel region, where early marriage is widespread, Unicef worries that many girls will never return to school. The Dutch charity Terre des Hommes runs a safe house for girls in Tanzania, protecting them from FGM. The community has taken advantage of this situation of Covid-19 and where children are now back at home they are cutting their girls. They know it is against the law but they are not afraid. We had one mother who was jailed for a year after carrying out FGM but for her she is happy. She is locked up but her girl is cut. Many girls have been cut, including girls we had managed to keep safe through the cutting season, which began in October last year. Some girls escaped and they ran to our FGM centre; we had several girls just turn up. For these children, school is a safe place. Iran has counted its most new cases of coronavirus on any day for nearly two months, with 2,979 more people testing positive for the virus since yesterday, according to the health ministry. The last time Iran counted more new infections was 1 April, when 2,988 were detected. The latest surge suggests the country is now in the grip of a second wave of widespread infection. Saeed Namaki, the health minister, warned the epidemic could come back stronger than before. \u201cThe outbreak is not over yet and at any moment it may come back stronger than before,\u201d he was quoted as saying by Reuters. \u201cIf our people fail to respect the health protocols \u2026 we must prepare ourselves for the worst situation.\u201d Government employees went back to work and mosques resumed daily prayers on Saturday as part of the continuing relaxation of the lockdown, which last week saw cafes and restaurants reopening in some parts of the country. But authorities had to reimpose restrictions in the southern provinces of Khuzestan and Sistan Baluchestan in mid-May after an uptick of cases there. In his daily update, Kianoush Jahanpour, the health ministry spokesman, said 78% of the new cases detected on Monday were mild. Eighty-one more people had died from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, he said, while 2,578 patients with the disease were in a critical condition in hospital. So far, Iran has recorded a total of 154,445 confirmed cases of coronavirus, of which 121,004 have survived and 7,878 have died, Jahanpour was quoted as saying by the Islamic Republic News Agency. Nearly 145,000 people have now tested positive for the coronavirus in Africa, the World Health Organization\u2019s regional office for the region says. So far out of those cases reported by the 54 countries on the continent, more than 61,100 people have recovered and 4,100 have died. South Africa, sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s most industrialised nation, has the most cases, while Egypt, on the other end of the continent, has counted the most deaths.

Eighty-six crew members in one of American Seafoods\u2019 fish processing vessels have tested positive for Covid-19, the fishing company has said. \u201cAmerican Seafoods Company previously reported that a crew member from the American Dynasty tested positive for Covid-19,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, the company decided to test the entire crew and on May 30 an additional 85 crew members were confirmed positive. Results are pending for nine outstanding tests.\u201d Every crew member had been tested before departure and 100% of those who sailed had tested negative. The number of people on board the boat is now known, but the American Dynasty has a carrying capacity of 142 people. The crew is now being quarantined in its home port of Seattle. In Bolivia, the interim president Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez has postponed elections, and her government, which mixes militarism with religious zeal, is accused of persecuting political opponents. Laurence Blair and Cindy Jim\u00e9nez Bercerra report: As locked-down Bolivians looked to the skies this Easter, they were met with an unusual sight. Cassock-wearing priests, some wielding statues of the apostles, sprinkled holy water and blessings over four cities from circling air force helicopters. The episode encapsulated the uneasy mix of militarism and religious zeal that has defined six months of the caretaker presidency of Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez. A little-known evangelical politician from Bolivia\u2019s tropical lowlands, \u00c1\u00f1ez was catapulted to power last November with one job: to hold new elections as soon as possible. The long-running presidency of Evo Morales had transformed the Andean-Amazonian country, bringing many of the indigenous majority out of poverty. But it ended in violent demonstrations, a police mutiny, and pressure from the army to step down amid allegations of electoral fraud. Morales and other senior figures from his Movement for Socialism (Mas) resigned and fled, and \u00c1\u00f1ez \u2013 as second vice-president of the senate \u2013 assumed interim rule pledging to \u201crebuild democracy\u201d. Six months on, even critics of Morales argue that the 52-year-old has instead deepened divisions in the multi-ethnic nation of 11 million people \u2013 and is using the coronavirus pandemic to further her own political ambitions. Much more here: Sport is happening in Britain again, as from today. The first greyhound race finished about 20 minutes ago, while somewhere between Kettering and Barnsley there are a lot of competitive pigeons: A claim by a leading Italian doctor that the new coronavirus \u201cno longer exists\u201d in the country has sparked a furore, with the government urging caution, reports AFP. Italy is preparing this week for the next big step in easing a national lockdown imposed three months ago. From Wednesday, foreign tourists will be able to enter again and people will be able to move between regions. But the government has insisted this is one of the most dangerous phases of a pandemic that has claimed 33,500 lives in the country. It has urged people to abide by social distancing rules and wear masks to prevent the virus from spreading once again. \u201cIn reality, the virus clinically no longer exists in Italy,\u201d said Alberto Zangrillo, head of the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, the capital of the northern Lombardy region, which has been the worst-hit by the pandemic. \u201cThe swabs performed over the past 10 days have showed a viral load that is absolutely infinitesimal in quantitative terms compared to those carried out a month or two months ago,\u201d he said in an interview on RAI television on Sunday. Someone has to take responsibility for terrorising the country\u201d. That prompted cries of disbelief from other experts and a warning from the government that it was too early to celebrate. \u201cPending scientific evidence to support the thesis that the virus has disappeared, I would invite those who say they are sure of it not to confuse Italians,\u201d health ministry under-secretary Sandra Zampa said in a statement. National Health Council head Franco Locatelli said he was \u201cbaffled\u201d by Zangrillo\u2019s comments. \u201cIt\u2019s enough to look at the number of new positive cases confirmed every day to see the persistent circulation in Italy of the new coronavirus,\u201d he said. The director of the prestigious Spallazani infectious diseases institute in Rome, Giuseppe Ippolito, said there was no scientific proof the virus had mutated or changed in potency. A contact-tracing app to help the country avoid a virus relapse was being launched Monday in four of the country\u2019s 20 regions, with others soon to follow. This week will see the reopening of much of France following the Covid-19 emergency. Lockdown measures have been further eased across most of the country designated \u201cgreen\u201d on the health authorities\u2019 coronavirus map. The Paris region, however, remains \u201corange\u201d on the map, meaning there are concerns that the virus is still circulating. The situation in the capital will be reassessed in three weeks. While most museums and monuments have been given the all-clear to reopen, the capital\u2019s most popular attractions, including the Louvre and the Centre Pompidou, will remain closed for a while longer. Some will require visitors to reserve tickets online before visiting. France\u2019s borders remain closed to foreign visitors except those with a \u201ccompelling\u201d family or professional reason to enter the country until at least 15 June. Cafes, bars, restaurants and hotels will open on Tuesday in green areas but not until 22 June in orange areas. Until then, establishments in the Paris area will have to serve customers on terraces only. Public gardens, parks, beaches, lakes, woods, can open across the country. Opening dates of selected sites in and around Paris: Sacr\u00e9-Coeur: Open Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles: 6 June Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay: 23 June Centre Pompidou: 1 July Louvre: 6 July The Philippines has confirmed 552 new cases of Covid-19, and three deaths. That brings its total number of deaths to 960, with 18,738 confirmed cases of which 3,979 have recovered. Indonesia has reported 467 new infections, bringing their total to 26,940, of whom 7,637 have recovered. There have also been 28 deaths since yesterday, taking the country\u2019s total to 1,641. Christiana Figueres, the head of the UN climate change convention that achieved the Paris agreement in 2015, writes on the opportunity we have been given by coronavirus to build a low-carbon future: The air is clean and fresh, fish have reappeared in urban waterways, birds are frequenting uncut gardens, wild mammals are meandering through cities and greenhouse gas emissions will likely drop by an unprecedented 8% this year. Nature has clearly benefited from several months of dramatically reduced economic activity. From a climate crisis perspective, this drop in emissions is astonishingly close to the 7.6% yearly reduction in emissions that scientists have advised will be necessary during the next decade. And yet none of this is cause for celebration. The resilience of nature is temporary, and will last only as long as the lockdown is enforced. More importantly, the reduction in greenhouse gases is not the result of decarbonising the economy, but the unintended consequence of economic paralysis that has come with painful human consequences and huge costs to lives and livelihoods. This is not what addressing the climate crisis looks like. The thoughtful reduction of greenhouse gases has to be intentional not circumstantial, sustained not temporary. Above all, it must lead to improved human wellbeing, not to human or economic suffering.

Many of the seats are blocked off to ensure social distancing, leading to long queues to get into stations: Hong Kong police have formally banned this week\u2019s vigil for the Tiananmen Square massacre, citing Covid-19 measures. It was expected, especially after the Hong Kong government extended its ban on public gatherings in groups larger than eight, but the announcement confirms that for the first time since the Chinese military killed untold numbers of protesters in 1989, there will be no event. Hong Kong\u2019s is traditionally the largest and only commemorative event in China. The sombre and peaceful event, normally attended by tens of thousands, is also often a vehicle for other causes. Attendees last year also drew awareness to the proposed extradition bill which would draw a million people to the streets in protest just a few days later, and spark months of demonstrations. Today, the Hong Kong police force wrote to organisers of the vigil to object, citing the current social distancing measures (due to expire the following day). It said public assemblies were a \u201chigh-risk activity\u201d due to the large crowds which gather. Police believe the event will not only increase participants\u2019 chances of contracting the virus, but also threaten citizens\u2019 lives and health, thus endangering public safety and affecting the rights of others. On Monday, Hong Kong reported its first locally transmitted case of the virus in more than two weeks. Numerous restrictions, including on swimming pools and religious gatherings, were recently lifted, prompting accusations that bans on public gatherings were only staying in place to prevent protests, and the vigil. Russia has reported 9,035 new cases of Covid-19 today, down slightly on the previous day, taking the country\u2019s total number of confirmed cases to 414,878, and 162 deaths, bringing the overall death toll from the virus to 4,855. On Saturday, Russian authorities approved the antiviral drug Avifavir, known generically as favipiravir, which was developed in Japan in the late 1990s but modified recently in Russia, and will start using it to treat patients from 11 June, the head of Russia\u2019s RDIF sovereign wealth fund, Kirill Dmitriev, has told Reuters. Dmitriev said that in clinical trials involving 330 people the drug successfully treated the virus in most cases within four days. \u201cWe believe this is a game changer. It will reduce strain on the healthcare system, we\u2019ll have fewer people getting into a critical condition, and for 90% of people it eliminates the virus within 10 days,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe that the drug is key to resuming full economic activity in Russia. People need to follow social distancing rules, and of course we need to have a vaccine, but it\u2019s a combination of those three levers.\u201d The big controversy in Cordoba, Spain concerns Prince Joachim of Belgium, who flew into the country on 24 May, attended a party with 26 other people when he should have been in a 14-day quarantine period and has now tested positive for coronavirus. \u201c\u201cI would like to apologise for not having respected all the quarantine measures during my trip. In these difficult moments, I did not intend to offend or disrespect anyone,\u201d the prince said in a letter released yesterday. \u201cI deeply regret my actions and accept the consequences.\u201d The good news for residents of Kolkata, India, is that hairdressers are open again.

The state anti-discrimination body has received 241 official complaints in the four months between 1 January to 30 April this year. Of those, 62 were on the grounds of race \u2013 an average of four complaints a week just in one state. This includes people being abused or spat at in public, harassed for wearing a face mask, and car windows being smashed. More here: The Armenian prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, has confirmed this morning that he and some members of his family have tested positive for Covid-19. \u201cI will continue to work from the prime minister\u2019s residence,\u201d he said. \u201cI have all means of communication, all the necessary conditions, an office. I will work from here as much as needed, but of course, under conditions of isolation. We all are in the same situation, we do not have a fever or any symptoms, but symptoms can come at any moment.\u201d The president of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, gives an update about school reopenings. Schools in the country had been told to open their doors today, only for the education ministry to back down at the last minute as teachers\u2019 unions, school staff and governing associations pledged to defy the order. Changes to lockdown regulations today also include letting people outside for work, worship, exercise or shopping, and allowing mines and factories to run at full capacity. From boxing brothers in Jordan to a domestic worker in South Africa, people tell us what they will miss about life in lockdown when it comes to an end: Morning/evening/whatever-it-is-where-you-are everyone.

My colleague Simon Burnton will be taking on the blog now to continue our round-the-clock coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. A reminder that we have a blog dedicated to the George Floyd protests here. Below are the latest developments from the last few hours: Manila eases lockdown. Traffic jams and crowds of commuters returned to the Philippine capital on Monday, as Manilla relaxed antivirus measures in a high-stakes gamble to slowly reopen the economy while fighting the coronavirus outbreak. Public transport was still limited and many commuters waited for hours to get a ride despite the government deploying special buses. School classes remain suspended for the next two weeks. Barber shops and beauty salons can open next week at a third of their capacity. The Philippines remains a south-east Asian hotspot for Covid-19, with more than 18,000 infections and 957 deaths. Japan may open doors to travellers from selected countries. Japan is considering reopening its borders to travellers from selected countries that have low levels of coronavirus infections, as it begins to ease restrictions put in place earlier this year to control the outbreak. As schools, cinemas, sports clubs and department stores reopened in Tokyo on Monday, media have reported that the government is also planning to allow travellers in from Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand in the coming months. There was no immediate comment from the foreign ministry. Hong Kong reports first locally transmitted case in two weeks. Hong Kong has confirmed its first locally transmitted coronavirus cases in more than two weeks, fuelling concerns over its spread as restrictions on movement are relaxed, Reuters reports. The Centre for Health Protection said on Sunday it was investigating two confirmed cases of coronavirus, taking the number of cases so far to 1,085. Four people have died of the disease in Hong Kong. Wuhan reports zero new asymptomatic cases. Wuhan, the Chinese city of around 11 million people where the Covid-19 pandemic began, reported no new asymptomatic cases on Sunday, according to Chinese health officials. State media, Xinhua, said on Monday more than 60,000 nucleic acid tests were conducted on Sunday, finding no asymptomatic cases. Mainland China reported 16 new cases overall on Sunday, the highest daily number in three weeks. All were reported as imported cases \u2013 11 in Sichuan province, three in Inner Mongolia, and two in Guangdong. Brazil passes 500,000 Covid-19 cases. Brazil has reported 16,409 new cases, taking the total of infected cases to 514,849. It keeps the country in second place in terms of infections, behind the US on 1.78 million cases. Brazil has moved into fourth in terms of deaths, with 29,314 fatalities, according to the health ministry. President Jair Bolsonaro has repeatedly dismissed the severity of the virus and continued to flout social distancing measures. On Sunday, he rode a horse to a rally calling for the supreme court to be shut down for investigating him. Moscow eases lockdown despite high virus caseload. Shopping malls and parks are set to reopen in Moscow on Monday as the Russian capital eases coronavirus restrictions despite having the world\u2019s third-largest caseload, with 405,843 infections. The relaxation of the confinement orders in Moscow, the centre of Russia\u2019s outbreak with a population of more than 12 million, comes after President Vladimir Putin announced the epidemic had passed its peak in the country. North Korea to reopen schools. North Korea will reopen schools this month after shuttering them over the coronavirus pandemic, reports said on Monday. Pyongyang has not confirmed a single infection but has imposed strict rules, including closing its borders and putting thousands of its people into isolation. The new school term \u2013 initially scheduled to start in early April \u2013 has been repeatedly postponed, although some universities and high schools were allowed to resume classes in mid-April. The Queen makes first public appearance. In the UK, the Queen has been pictured riding in the grounds of Windsor Castle \u2013 her first public appearance since the lockdown began. Windsor is said to be the Queen\u2019s favourite royal residence and she has been photographed over the weekend riding one of her ponies, a 14-year-old Fell pony called Balmoral Fern. The 94-year-old regularly rides in the grounds of Windsor and has been a passionate horse lover and breeder of thoroughbred racehorses throughout her reign. Spain to extend lockdown. Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, has said the country needs 15 more days of lockdown until 21 June \u201cto finish with the pandemic once and for all\u201d, and that he would ask parliament to approve a final two-week extension to the stay home rule. \u201cWe have almost achieved what we set out to do,\u201d Sanchez told a press conference, as he expressed his intense relief that the number of new cases in Spain, one of the nations hardest-hit by the virus, had fallen dramatically. Bangladesh lifts lockdown. Bangladesh lifted its coronavirus lockdown on Sunday, with millions heading back to work in densely populated cities and towns even as the country logged a record spike in deaths and new infections. \u201cThe lockdown has been lifted and we are heading almost towards our regular life,\u201d health department spokeswoman Nasima Sultana said, calling on those returning to work to wear masks and observe social distancing. It comes as Bangladesh \u2013 which on Friday took an emergency pandemic loan from the International Monetary Fund \u2013 reported its biggest daily jump in infections Sunday, with 2,545 new cases and a record 40 deaths. Not even Donald Trump\u2019s harshest critics can blame him for a virus believed to have come from a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, nor for an attendant economic collapse, nor for four centuries of slavery, segregation, police brutality and racial injustice. But they can, and do, point to how he made a bad situation so much worse. The story of Trump\u2019s presidency was arguably always leading to this moment, with its toxic mix of weak moral leadership, racial divisiveness, crass and vulgar rhetoric and an erosion of norms, institutions and trust in traditional information sources. Taken together, these ingredients created a tinderbox poised to explode when crises came. Trump, they say, was uniquely ill-qualified for this moment. He tried to wish away the threat of the coronavirus and failed to prepare, then paid no heed to how communities of colour bore the brunt of its health and economic consequences. As unrest now grips dozens of cities, he speaks an authoritarian language of \u201cthugs\u201d, \u201cvicious dogs\u201d and \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d. The front pages of US newspapers over the past few days tell of the double tragedy of a nation rocked by protests over the death of George Floyd and the growing coronavirus toll. In Australia, what started out as a fun and inclusive initiative has turned sour after the NRL\u2019s scheme to put cardboard cut-outs of fans in stadiums was hijacked. Over the weekend a photograph of mass murderer Harold Shipman made an appearance in the stands, then a TV sketch featured an image of Adolf Hitler, prompting furious criticism from Australia\u2019s Jewish community. The broadcaster and the show\u2019s host subsequently apologised, while the NRL said it would review its screening process. The Fan in the Stand scheme, an effort to keep fans involved in the game while not allowed to watch their teams live, was rolled out for the first time as the 2020 season resumed last week in empty stadiums after a 10-week break due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Most supporters took part in the scheme in good faith, uploading images of themselves for a fee of $22 plus GST, which were then printed out on 100% recyclable material and placed in the stands. But other likenesses have appeared alongside genuine fans, including an image of Shipman, Britain\u2019s most prolific serial killer, which was spotted during the Panthers\u2019 clash with the Knights in Campbelltown on Sunday afternoon. Shipman was found guilty in 2000 of murdering 15 of his patients by lethal injection, and while he may not be as infamous in Australia as he is in the UK, the inclusion of his likeness raises questions over the vetting procedure used by the NRL in its scheme. Stars on the shows that couldn\u2019t go on How does it feel to see a show you\u2019ve spent years working on being pulled? From Love Islanders to Foals, Laura Wade and Wayne McGregor, artists reveal their darkest days \u2013 and deepest worries: The Chinese city of Wuhan, where the Covid-19 pandemic began, reported no new asymptomatic cases for the first time on Sunday, according to Chinese health officials. Mainland China reported 16 new cases overall on Sunday, the highest daily number in three weeks. All were reported as imported cases \u2013 11 in Sichuan province, three in Inner Mongolia, and two in Guangdong. The virus continues to rage in other parts of the world, including Brazil which passed half a million cases on Sunday. In England, senior public health officials have pleaded for the government to cancel an easing of lockdown restrictions that starts Monday. The pandemic \u2013 which has now infected at least 6 million people worldwide, and killed more than 372,000 \u2013 began late last year in Wuhan. On Sunday, the city reported it had no new cases and no new symptomatic cases, after an ambitious push to test all 11 million residents following a small outbreak. Nationally, the health commission also reported 16 asymptomatic cases. Three of the asymptomatic cases were local transmission. Elsewhere in Asia, Japan was considering reopening to travellers from countries with low infections rates \u2013 including Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand \u2013 and the Philippines capital began easing its long lockdown. Meanwhile, the virus continued to spread rapidly in the Americas. Manila eases lockdown. Traffic jams and crowds of commuters returned to the Philippine capital on Monday, as the metropolis relaxed antivirus measures in a high-stakes gamble to slowly reopen the economy while fighting the coronavirus outbreak. Hong Kong reports first locally transmitted coronavirus case in two weeks. Hong Kong has confirmed its first locally transmitted coronavirus cases in more than two weeks, fuelling concerns over its spread as restrictions on movement are relaxed. The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) said on Sunday it was investigating two confirmed cases of coronavirus, taking the number of cases so far to 1,085. Four people have died of the disease in Hong Kong. Japan may open doors to travellers from selected countries. Japan is considering re-opening its borders to travellers from selected countries which have low levels of coronavirus infections, as it begins to ease restrictions put in place earlier this year to control the outbreak. Media have reported that the government is also planning to allow travellers from Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand into the country in the coming months. Wuhan, China reports zero new cases. Wuhan, the Chinese city of around 11m people, where the Covid-19 pandemic began, reported no new asymptomatic cases on Sunday, according to Chinese health officials. Mainland China reported 16 new cases overall on Sunday, the highest daily number in three weeks. All were reported as imported cases - 11 in Sichuan province, three in Inner Mongolia, and two in Guangdong. Moscow eases lockdown despite high virus caseload. Shopping malls and parks are set to reopen in Moscow on Monday as the Russian capital eases coronavirus restrictions despite having the world\u2019s third-largest caseload, with 405,843 infections. North Korea to reopen schools as virus fears ease. North Korea will reopen schools this month after shuttering them over the coronavirus pandemic, reports said Monday. Pyongyang has not confirmed a single infection but has imposed strict rules, including closing its borders and putting thousands of its people into isolation. Brazil passes 500,000 Covid-19 cases. Brazil has reported 16,409 new coronavirus cases taking the total of infected cases to 514,849. It keeps the country in second place in terms of infections, behind the US on 1.78 million cases. Brazil has moved into fourth in terms of deaths, with 29,314 fatalities, according to the health ministry. President Bolsonaro has repeatedly dismissed the severity of the virus and continued to flout social distancing measures. The Queen makes first public appearance. In the UK, the Queen has been pictured riding in the grounds of Windsor Castle \u2013 her first public appearance since the coronavirus lockdown began. Spain to extend lockdown. Spain\u2019s prime minister Pedro Sanchez says the country needs 15 more days of lockdown until 21 June \u201cto finish with the pandemic once and for all\u201d, and he would ask parliament to approve a final two-week extension to the stay home rule. Bangladesh lifts lockdown. Bangladesh lifted its coronavirus lockdown Sunday, with millions heading back to work in densely populated cities and towns even as the country logged a record spike in deaths and new infections. Bangladesh \u2013 which on Friday took an emergency pandemic loan from the International Monetary Fund \u2013 reported its biggest daily jump in infections Sunday, with 2,545 new cases and a record 40 deaths. India\u2019s lockdown, which was due to end on 31 May, has been extended until 30 June in a number of zones identified as \u2018high-risk\u2019 by individual states, while the rest of the country prepares to reopen. Spain\u2019s prime minister said on Sunday the country needed 15 more days of lockdown until June 21 \u201cto finish with the pandemic once and for all\u201d, and he would ask parliament to approve a final two-week extension to the stay home rule. Saudi Arabia enforced strict measures when mosques reopened on Sunday, including face masks and personal prayer mats. It comes two months after communal prayers were abandoned due to virus fears. In England, senior public health officials have made a last-minute plea for ministers to stop Monday\u2019s easing of the lockdown, warning the country is unprepared to deal with any surge in infection. More that 1,000 people have died from the coronavirus in Chile, the health ministry has reported, with 827 of the deaths occurring in May alone. The country has had 99,688 confirmed cases and 1,054 deaths. South Africa has delayed Monday\u2019s reopening of schools by a week, the Department of Basic Education has announced, saying that many are not ready to welcome back pupils. Poverty in the occupied West Bank may double as Palestinians are hammered by the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Bank has warned. Traffic jams and crowds of commuters returned to the Philippine capital on Monday, as the metropolis relaxed antivirus measures in a high-stakes gamble to slowly reopen the economy while fighting the coronavirus outbreak, AP reports. Commuter trains, taxis, ride-sharing cars, special shuttle buses and motorcycles rumbled back on the road in metropolitan Manila but were only allowed to carry a fraction of their capacity as a safeguard. Public transport was still limited by the relaxed rules and many commuters waited for hours to get a ride despite the government\u2019s deployment of buses. Classes remain suspended for the next two weeks. Barber shops and beauty salons can open next week at a third of their capacity. The Philippines remains a Southeast Asian hot spot for Covid-19, with more than 18,000 infections and 957 deaths. In the UK, the Queen has been pictured riding in the grounds of Windsor Castle \u2013 her first public appearance since the coronavirus lockdown began. Windsor is said to be the Queen\u2019s favourite royal residence and she has been photographed over the weekend riding one of her ponies, a 14-year-old Fell Pony called Balmoral Fern. The 94-year-old regularly rides in the grounds of Windsor and has been a passionate horse lover and breeder of thoroughbred racehorses throughout her reign. Wearing a colourful headscarf and smartly dressed in a tweed jacket, jodhpurs, white gloves and boots, the head of state enjoyed the sunny weather that has been a contrast to the sombre mood of the lockdown. The last public picture of the Queen was taken as she was driven away from Buckingham Palace to her Windsor Castle home on 19 March. One of the Queen\u2019s dorgis - she has two named Candy and Vulcan - could be seen next to her as they both looked out of the car window. The Queen carried out official duties the day before her planned departure, but held her weekly audience with Prime Minister Boris Johnson on the phone rather than face to face as usual. The Queen has made two televised addresses to the nation during the lockdown, the first a speech to reassure the country that coronavirus would be overcome and those in isolation \u201cwill meet again\u201d, and another on a similar theme to mark VE Day. She has been joined by the Duke of Edinburgh at Windsor Castle and it is likely a small group of household staff have been isolating with her. Asia\u2019s factory pain deepened in May as the slump in global trade caused by the coronavirus pandemic worsened, with export powerhouses Japan and South Korea suffering the sharpest declines in business activity in more than a decade, Reuters reports. A series of manufacturing surveys released on Monday suggest any rebound in businesses will be some time off, even though China\u2019s factory activity unexpectedly returned to growth in May. China\u2019s Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) hit 50.7 last month, marking the highest reading since January as easing of lockdowns allowed companies to get back to work and clear outstanding orders. But with many of China\u2019s trading partners still restricted, its new export orders remained in contraction, the private business survey showed on Monday. China\u2019s official PMI survey on Sunday showed the recovery in the world\u2019s second-largest economy intact but fragile. Japan\u2019s factory activity shrank at the fastest pace since 2009 in May, a separate private sector survey showed while South Korea also saw manufacturing slump at the sharpest pace in more than a decade. Taiwan\u2019s manufacturing activity also fell in May. Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines saw PMIs rebound from April, though the indices all remained below the 50-mark threshold that separates contraction from expansion. Official data on Monday showed South Korea extending its exports plunge for a third straight month. Asia\u2019s economic woes are likely to be echoed in other parts of the world including Europe, where economies continue to suffer huge damage in factory and service sectors. Hong Kong has confirmed its first locally transmitted coronavirus cases in more than two weeks, fuelling concerns over its spread as restrictions on movement are relaxed, Reuters reports. The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) said on Sunday it was investigating two confirmed cases of coronavirus, taking the number of cases so far to 1,085. Four people have died of the disease in Hong Kong. The global financial hub last reported a locally transmitted case on 14 May, when a 62-year-old man with no travel history was confirmed with coronavirus. The two new cases involved a 34-year-old woman and a 56-year-old man. Neither had a travel history during the incubation or infectious period, CHP said. Contact tracing was under way, it added. The woman is a night-shift worker at a Kerry Logistics warehouse in Kwai Chung district where she labels food items imported from the United Kingdom, broadcaster RTHK reported. Two co-workers, who fell ill about a month ago, tested positive for Covid-19 and authorities are investigating if the warehouse where one of the patients works represents a new cluster of infections, RTHK reported, citing CHP. About 25 staff in the warehouse and three medical staff who dealt with one of the patients are being quarantined for 14 days, RTHK reported. Australia\u2019s three decades of uninterrupted prosperity are coming to an abrupt end as the global coronavirus pandemic crashes one of its most lucrative sources of income: immigration, Reuters reports. The country has been successful in managing the outbreak and reopening its AU$2tn (US$1.33tn) economy, thanks in part to an early closure of its borders. But the policy has led to a halt in mass immigration \u2013 a key source of consumer demand, labour and growth \u2013 in an economy which is facing its first recession since the early 1990s. Net immigration, including international students and those on skilled worker visas, is expected to fall 85% in the fiscal year to June 2021, curbing demand for everything from cars and property to education and wedding rings. The drought in international student arrivals, who in recent years made up about 40% of the migrant intake, is expected to hit the AU$37bn education sector, Australia\u2019s second largest services export after tourism. A fall in new arrivals could also dampen the construction boom in Australia\u2019s all important housing sector, which has been fuelled by migrants in big cities like Sydney and Melbourne. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 333 to 181,815, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Monday. The reported death toll rose by 11 to 8,511, the tally showed. Japan is considering re-opening its borders to travellers from selected countries which have low levels of coronavirus infections, as it begins to ease restrictions put in place earlier this year to control the outbreak, Reuters reports. As schools, cinemas, sports clubs and department stores reopened in the nation\u2019s capital Tokyo on Monday, media have reported that the government is also planning to allow travellers from Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand into the country in the coming months. There was no immediate comment from the foreign ministry. 16,751 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in Japan as of early Monday, according to Johns Hopkins University figures, with 898 deaths. Since February, Japan has banned entry by foreigners to limit the spread of the virus from overseas visitors. The government is considering allowing business travellers from the four countries to enter if they test negative for Covid-19 in two separate tests conducted upon departure from their home country and arrival in Japan, the Asahi Shimbun reported, citing unnamed sources. Once permitted into the country, visitors\u2019 movements would be restricted to areas including place of stay, company offices and factories, the newspaper said, adding that use of public transportation would be banned. Wuhan, the Chinese city of around 11m people, where the Covid-19 pandemic began, reported no new asymptomatic cases on Sunday, according to Chinese health officials. State media, Xinhua, said on Monday more than 60,000 nucleic acid tests were conducted on Sunday, finding no asymptomatic cases. Earlier this month Chinese authorities drew up an ambitious plan with the apparent goal of having all 11m residents of Wuhan tested within 10 days, after an outbreak was detected in a housing residence. Authorities have reported testing up to 1.4m people a day. Xinhua said Sunday\u2019s results indicated the mass testing campaign had seen effects. Mainland China reported 16 new cases overall on Sunday, the highest daily number in three weeks. All were reported as imported cases - 11 in Sichuan province, three in Inner Mongolia, and two in Guangdong. The health commission also reported 16 asymptomatic cases - a distinction the Chinese health authorities have made since April. Three of the asymptomatic cases were local transmission. North Korea will reopen schools this month after shuttering them over the coronavirus pandemic, reports said Monday. Pyongyang has not confirmed a single infection but has imposed strict rules, including closing its borders and putting thousands of its people into isolation. The new school term - initially scheduled to start early April - has been repeatedly postponed, although some universities and high schools were allowed to resume classes in mid-April, AFP reports. \u201cEducation authorities have been asked to furnish thermometers and hand sanitisers at every gate of schools and classrooms and offices, while workers at schools and nurseries have been advised to stick to anti-virus principles,\u201d Yonhap news agency reported. Analysts say the North is unlikely to have avoided infections from the virus, which first emerged in neighbouring China and went on to sweep the world, and that its ramshackle health system could struggle to cope with a major outbreak. The number of coronavirus infections worldwide has risen to more than 6.1 million, with around 370,000 dead across 196 countries and territories. In Moscow, Russia, the regulated walks and exercise unleashed a flood of mockery on social media, with political commentator Alexander Golts calling them \u201csheer lunacy\u201d. Critics quipped that life in Moscow was beginning to imitate dystopian fiction such as the novels of Aldous Huxley and Yevgeny Zamyatin. Comedian Maxim Galkin, who has nearly eight million followers on Instagram, released a sketch in which Putin and Sobyanin discuss a \u201cbreathing schedule\u201d for Moscow residents (in Russian): The five-minute parody has been viewed nearly six million times over the past few days. When the restrictions are relaxed, dry-cleaners, laundry services and repair workshops will be allowed to reopen, while restaurants, cafes and cinemas will remain closed for now. Moscow authorities also said that no mass gatherings would be allowed during the city-wide quarantine that will remain in place until at least 14 June. Shopping malls and parks are set to reopen in Moscow on today (Monday) as the Russian capital eases coronavirus restrictions despite having the world\u2019s third-largest caseload, with 405,843 infections. The relaxation of the confinement orders in Moscow, the epicentre of Russia\u2019s outbreak with a population of more than 12 million, comes after President Vladimir Putin announced the epidemic had passed its peak in the country, AFP reports. Under lockdown since 30 March, residents of Europe\u2019s most populous city were until now only allowed to leave their homes for brief trips to shop, walk dogs or travel to essential jobs with a permit. While Muscovites welcomed the opportunity to return to parks and malls after weeks of being cooped up at home, many ridiculed the Moscow mayor\u2019s \u201cexperiment\u201d aimed at regulating people\u2019s walks and exercise. As a two-week test measure, Sergei Sobyanin said residents of Moscow will be allowed to take walks according to a staggered schedule based on their home address. Sobyanin said on his blog he feared that without limits on walking, people would throng the streets in scenes reminiscent of May Day outpourings in Soviet times. Podcast: The coronavirus crisis in Britain\u2019s prisons As Britain faced an unprecedented lockdown, the situation for the 80,000 people in prison was even more stringent. David Adams was recently released from jail and describes how prisoners were confined to their tiny cells for more than 23 hours a day: Hi, Helen Sullivan taking the reins now. I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest for the next few hours. A reminder that you can (and should!) get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com. In case you missed it, global deaths from Covid-19 currently stand nearly 372,000. The US passed the grim landmark of 100,000 last week, but the UK, which has 276,000 infections, is approaching 40,000. As of Sunday 38,571 had died from Covid-19. Senior public health officials have made a last-minute plea for ministers to scrap Monday\u2019s easing of the coronavirus lockdown in England, warning the country is unprepared to deal with any surge in infection and that public resolve to take steps to limit transmission has been eroded. The Association of Directors of Public Health (ADPH) said new rules, including allowing groups of up to six people to meet outdoors and in private gardens, were \u201cnot supported by the science\u201d and that pictures of crowded beaches and beauty spots over the weekend showed \u201cthe public is not keeping to social distancing as it was\u201d. On Saturday and Sunday, parks and seafronts were packed as people anticipated the lifting of restrictions on what has been dubbed \u201chappy Monday\u201d. Car showrooms and outdoor markets will also be reopened, millions of children will return to primary schools and the most vulnerable \u201cshielded\u201d people will be allowed out for the first time since lockdown began in March, all as long as physical distancing is maintained. You can read our full story below: I\u2019m sure many of you have been following the unrest in America with widespread protests across the country. You can follow our live coverage here, but the pictures of large crowds gathering will certainly alarm those tasked with fighting the virus, with growing concerns the proximity of so many people on the streets may lead to a surge in cases. Bangladesh lifted its coronavirus lockdown Sunday, with millions heading back to work in densely populated cities and towns even as the country logged a record spike in deaths and new infections. \u201cThe lockdown has been lifted and we are heading almost towards our regular life,\u201d health department spokeswoman Nasima Sultana said, calling on those returning to work to wear masks and observe social distancing. The lifting comes as Bangladesh \u2013 which on Friday took an emergency pandemic loan from the International Monetary Fund \u2013 reported its biggest daily jump in infections Sunday, with 2,545 new cases and a record 40 deaths. Still in the Middle East and Abu Dhabi has announced it will cordon off the UAE\u2019s capital as well as banning travel between regions within the emirate for a week from Tuesday to rein in the novel coronavirus, AFP reports. The announcement on Sunday means that residents of the United Arab Emirates will not be allowed to travel from the capital Abu Dhabi to the services hub of Dubai, 90 minutes on a major highway, without a permit. The decision came as the authorities said they were easing other restrictions within Abu Dhabi, one of the seven emirates that make up the UAE. The authorities placed \u201ca ban on movement entering and exiting the emirate and between its regions\u201d from 2 June, the Abu Dhabi media office tweeted. It added that residents may move freely within their own regions between the hours of 6am and 10pm. But malls, restaurants, and hotel beaches will be allowed to reopen on Monday at 40% capacity, the media office said. It added that outdoor activities, such as horse riding, cricket, cycling, golfing, sailing were also now allowed. The UAE has so far recorded more than 34,000 cases of the COVID-19 respiratory disease, including 264 deaths. Earlier this week, Dubai emirate moved to lift restrictions on businesses and shortened a nighttime curfew. Poverty in the occupied West Bank may double as Palestinians are hit by the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Bank warned on Monday. AFP reports that the Palestinian territories have seen low infection rates after acting quickly, with three deaths out of 450 cases registered among some five million residents in Gaza and the West Bank. But the Palestinian Authority\u2019s financial situation is \u201cexpected to become increasingly difficult\u201d due to loss of income and increased spending on healthcare and other areas, the World Bank said in a report. The fallout is expected to see the number of households living below the poverty line increase this year from 14 to 30% in the West Bank, largely due to Palestinians being unable to cross into Israel for work. Egypt has shortened its night curfew by one hour, bringing the end time forward to 5am from 6am. It begins at 8pm each night. The Health Ministry said 1,536 new cases had been confirmed including 46 deaths, bringing total cases to 24,985 and deaths to 959. We\u2019re getting some updated figures from Mexico ... the Deputy Health Minister, Hugo Lopez-Gatell, says there were 151 new coronavirus deaths and 3,152 new cases on Sunday. This takes the country\u2019s totals to 9,930 fatalities and 90,664 cases. The country\u2019s fatality curve continues to rise. Saudi Arabia has reopened its mosques after a two-month closure. Worshippers were required to take their own prayer mats and face masks and stand two metres apart. Worshippers were required to perform their ablution rite of washing their face, arms and legs before prayer, at home. The Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages, which attract millions of Muslims globally, remain suspended. Spain\u2019s prime minister Pedro Sanchez says the country needs 15 more days of lockdown until 21 June \u201cto finish with the pandemic once and for all\u201d, and he would ask parliament to approve a final two-week extension to the stay home rule. \u201cWe have almost achieved what we set out to do,\u201d Sanchez told a press conference, as he expressed his intense relief that the number of new cases in Spain, one of the nations hardest-hit by the virus, had fallen dramatically. From 21 June a national state of emergency will end and with it the lockdown, allowing citizens to move freely in their regions. From 1 July, citizens will be able to move throughout the country. Spain\u2019s death toll rose by two on Sunday to 27,127, the health ministry said, while the number of infections rose by 96 overnight to 239,429. Spain imposed a state of emergency on 14 March which involved a strict lockdown under which people could leave their homes only to buy food, seek medical care or for jobs where they could not work from home. Children were initially confined inside all day. Restrictions are being gradually eased. Indian states on Sunday began identifying high-risk zones where coronavirus lockdowns should continue while the rest of country gears up to reopen in June. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government has extended lockdown, that was due to end on 31 May, to 30 June, in so-called containment zones that continue to report a high number of infections. Restaurants, malls and religious buildings will be permitted to reopen elsewhere from 8 June. India has reported 190,609 confirmed cases, with 5,408 deaths according to the Johns Hopkins tracker. In Uttar Pradesh, the country\u2019s most populous state, a health official said 1,111 containment zones has been identified, while authorities in the western Gujarat state said that more than 400,000 houses were marked as high-risk zones. Officials in the western state of Maharastra said all markets, except malls and congested spaces, will be allowed to function in a staggered manner. West Bengal identified 285 containment zones in its capital, Kolkata. In a radio address on Sunday, Modi warned people to remain vigilant. \u201cThe fight against the coronavirus is intense, we cannot drop our guard,\u201d he said. Brazil has reported 16,409 new coronavirus cases taking the total of infected cases to 514,849. It keeps the country in second place in terms of infections, behind the US on 1.78 million cases. Brazil has moved into fourth in terms of deaths, with 29,314 fatalities, according to the health ministry. President Bolsonaro has repeatedly dismissed the severity of the virus and continued to flout social distancing measures. On Sunday he road a horse to a rally calling for the supreme court to be shut down for investigating him. Also on Sunday the White House said it would send two million doses of hydroxychloroquine and 1,000 ventilators to Brazil, despite warnings over the anti-malarial drug\u2019s safety. The White House said in a joint statement with Brazil that the drug would be used as a preventative treatment for frontline healthcare workers in Brazil, despite its known dangers. \u201cIt will also be used as a therapeutic to treat Brazilians who become infected,\u201d the statement said. The countries will also carry out a joint research effort, including \u201crandomised controlled clinical trials\u201d. Last week the WHO stopped hydroxychloroquine trials amid safety fears over the drug. The WHO\u2019s director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in light of a paper published in the Lancet medical journal that showed people taking hydroxychloroquine were at higher risk of death and heart problems than those who were not, it would pause the hydroxychloroquine arm of its solidarity global clinical trial. Hello and welcome to the Guardian\u2019s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. Brazil has passed 500,000 cases of coronavirus as the White House announced it was sending 2 million doses of hydroxychloroquine and 1,000 ventilators to the country. The move to send Brazil the anti-malarial drug comes despite medical warnings about the risks associated with it and just days after the WHO suspended testing it on Covid-19 patients due to health concerns. Mass protests in Brazil and in the US over the weekend have fuelled fears of a surge in cases. We\u2019ll be bringing you the latest virus developments but to kick off, here\u2019s a summary of the top points so far India\u2019s lockdown, which was due to end on 31 May, has been extended until 30 June in a number of zones identified as \u2018high-risk\u2019 by individual states, while the rest of the country prepares to reopen.

      "bodyText": "The international crew of Avatar 2 have been given special permission to enter New Zealand to begin filming the blockbuster sequel \u2013 despite the country\u2019s border being closed to all foreign nationals. On 16 March, prime minister Jacinda Ardern closed New Zealand\u2019s borders as a precaution against the spread of Covid-19. The country\u2019s strict lockdown appears to have worked, with fewer than 1,500 cases of coronavirus and 22 deaths. New Zealanders are now enjoying a loosened lockdown, with many aspects of normal life, such as work and school, returning. The country\u2019s tourism industry, heavily reliant on overseas visitors, has taken a massive hit, and many families and couples have been separated for months by the measures. Many businesses have also struggled to bring workers stuck overseas home. So news that Avatar director James Cameron and 55 members of his crew had arrived in the country on a privately chartered plane over the weekend angered many. Businesses are especially upset because many \u2013 such as those in the dairy industry, also a pillar of New Zealand\u2019s economy \u2013 have been unable to bring valuable employees home, even if they had previously lived and worked in New Zealand for years. Tom Hargreaves, a dairy farmer, told RNZ it was frustrating the Avatar crew were allowed in but not his second-in-command from Uruguay, who was indispensable to his farm. Her absence meant her colleagues were having to work overtime to cover her workload. Hargreaves\u2019 employee has worked in New Zealand for four years and only returned to Uruguay on a flying visit home when the borders closed behind her. Dairy workers are classified as essential workers, but Hargreaves said multiple attempts to get her back had failed. \u201cShe got stuck like many others trying to get home \u2013 turned away at the borders,\u201d Hargreaves said. June Ranson, chair of the New Zealand Association of Migration and Investment, told RNZ news the Avatar exemption came as a huge surprise and showed a \u201cdouble standard\u201d. \u201cIt shows that the minister is really only looking at his own projects because it\u2019s not really supporting what New Zealanders need \u2013 and they need these people that have been working with them to keep their operations running \u2013 it\u2019s all about rebuilding the New Zealand economy,\u201d Ranson said. Jon Landau, Cameron\u2019s producer, posted an Instagram picture of the pair arriving at Wellington international airport, with both men wearing face masks and plastic face shields. \u201cMade it to New Zealand. Our 14-day government-supervised self-isolation now begins\u201d Landau wrote. Last month Landau \u2013 who won an Oscar for his work on Titanic \u2013 posted an image of the Avatar set in New Zealand and expressed his excitement at returning to work on the film in Wellington. \u201cOur #Avatar sets are ready \u2014 and we couldn\u2019t be more excited to be headed back to New Zealand next week. Check out the Matador, a high speed forward command vessel (bottom) and the Picador jetboat (top) \u2014 can\u2019t wait to share more,\u201d said the producer. Fifty-six film workers from Los Angeles were given permission to re-enter New Zealand by the economic development minister, Phil Twyford, under the category \u201cother essential worker\u201d. They are currently in quarantine for two weeks at the QT Hotel in central Wellington. The hotel\u2019s management told the Dominion Post the Avatar crew were \u201ccompletely isolated\u201d from other guests. Los Angeles is one of the cities worst hit by coronavirus. According to Deadline magazine, Avatar 2 is the first major Hollywood blockbuster to go back into production since the pandemic shut down film sets worldwide. Twyford said \u201cother essential workers\u201d had to meet a stringent criteria for entry. They have to prove their job couldn\u2019t be done by a local resident, \u201cis urgently needed at this time\u201d, and \u201c is either critical to the Covid-19 response, maintaining critical infrastructure or there will be very significant economic benefits resulting from it\u201d. \u201cThe New Zealand border remains closed and public health remains the government\u2019s number one priority in making border exemption decisions,\u201d Twyford said in a statement. \u201cSince April 21 I have signed off 22 applications representing 154 other essential workers.

Fauci has repeatedly warned against a rush to reopen America for business and social movement until federal guidelines have been met involving a sustained decrease in new cases and adequate testing and hospital facilities being available. He said last month: \u201cThere is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you might not be able to control. Not only leading to some suffering and death, but it could even set you back on the road to get economic recovery.\u201d But the president, despite the federal guidelines, sharply and repeatedly diverged from his own leading expert and spent weeks urging state governors to reopen, while talking up the prospect of a vaccine at unprecedented speed and a swift economic recovery, both of which are far from solid prospects. Trump has also been touting misinformation about treatments for coronavirus, promoting the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as a miracle cure and then apparently taking it himself, despite pessimistic recent studies and federal regulators warning it could be dangerous when taken for, or as a prophylactic against, Covid-19, outside of a clinical trial. Fauci tried tactfully to dampen the president\u2019s hype of hydroxychloroquine and the antiviral drug chloroquine. The White House and Trump himself had previously dismissed questions about tension between the president and Fauci as \u201cmedia chatter\u201d. After conservative commentators urged his firing, the White House said: \u201cPresident Trump is not firing Dr Fauci.\u201d A drumbeat of calls for Fauci to be ousted have been promoted most aggressively by pro-Trump zealots in the far-right media ecosystem \u2013 political bomb-throwers, medical quacks and an unknown number of foreign bots posing as American internet users. When the taskforce was still holding daily press briefings, televised live, at the White House, Trump said of Fauci: \u201cToday I walk in, I hear I\u2019m going to fire him. I\u2019m not firing him. I think he is a wonderful guy.\u201d Trump held two-plus-hour briefings that veered far from their original purpose as a public information platform at the height of the coronavirus crisis in April. They petered out after he pondered dangerously whether taking disinfectant internally could be a possible treatment for coronavirus. Fauci has done fewer interviews lately, despite warning that while efforts to contain the virus were \u201cgoing in the right direction\u201d, it did \u201cnot mean by any means that we have it under control\u201d. Now there are worries that protests across the country, after police in Minneapolis killed George Floyd last week, will spread more coronavirus \u2013 while America\u2019s top public health expert is pushed to the margins.",

      "bodyText": "Saudi Arabia, one of the main belligerents in the five-year Yemen civil war, will for the first time act as the co-host of a United Nations humanitarian fund raising summit for Yemen. The virtual summit fund is hoping to raise $2.4bn (\u00a31.9bn) in the second half of the year and stave off the twin threat of famine and coronavirus. The virtual summit comes as the UN warns Yemen\u2019s health system is buckling under the strain and major aid programs are being cut. Saudi Arabia, repeatedly accused of war crimes in Yemen, has also been the main donor to the UN relief operation in Yemen, providing $15bn over the past five years. The UN had been hoping that 2020 would start to see a decline in the need for aid as peace talks led to the conflict subsiding through the war torn country. Instead, aid agencies are now confronting the twin threat of continued fighting and a largely unmonitored spread of coronavirus. Nearly 30 of the 41 US aid agency programs are set to close without additional funding, an alliance of UN aid agencies warned in a joint statement on Thursday. Mark Lowcock, the UN\u2019s under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said the United Nations received nearly $4bn last year for Yemen, but so far in 2020 it has only received $698m. Saudi Arabia pledged $525m nearly two months ago, but Lowcock said he hoped Riyadh would pay this sum in full soon. He has warned that \u201cnowhere else on earth will coronavirus spread faster, more widely, with deadlier consequences\u201d. The UK announced ahead of the pledging summit that it will provide a further \u00a3160m for this year, taking its total aid to Yemen to \u00a3970m. Jon Cunliffe, regional director for Action against Hunger in the Middle East, said: \u201cIt is a bitter irony that some of the biggest donors at the event will be countries that continue to fuel this conflict either as a direct participant or as a supplier of arms. \u201cIt isn\u2019t enough to just throw money at the problem, we need to see concrete evidence that governments are genuinely committed to a political solution. Saudi Arabia\u2019s depth of influence will be far more important than the depth of its pockets if the goal is to ease the suffering of the Yemeni people.\u201d Yemen has been gripped by a war between Iranian-backed Houthi rebels that have captured the country\u2019s capital Sana\u2019a and control most of the north, bordering Saudi Arabia. The UN-recognised, Saudi-backed government, already weakened by Houthi advances, has been undermined still further by a split in its own ranks leading to the secessionist Southern Transitional Council (STC) taking control in the southern port of Aden, and some other parts of the south. The delivery of aid \u2013 already difficult due to the growing restrictions imposed by the warring parties \u2013 has become even more complex with the spread of coronavirus, and the withdrawal of many aid workers. Official figures indicate that Covid-19 cases have been confirmed in 10 of the country\u2019s 22 governorates, even though the total number of recorded deaths is officially only 65. But the STC in a statement at the weekend said there were \u201cdozens of civilian deaths daily\u201d, and warned the crisis is likely to spread across the southern governorates. David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, one of the main aid agencies said: \u201cYemen has the lowest testing ability of any country where we work, with a case fatality ratio of 24.7%, almost four times the global average.

When you get home, you can limit the risk of spreading the virus by leaving shoes outside and putting towels and gym clothes straight in the washing machine. \u201cI mean, that might be overcautious,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I work in a hospital so I\u2019m coming from that perspective of minimising the amount of things that you might bring that have contact with the virus.\u201d Pistoll emphasises to his clients the importance of eating a healthy, balanced diet and staying socially connected to maintain a healthy frame of mind \u2013 these general lifestyle measures help keep immune systems healthy. As far as keeping fit, if you\u2019re unsure about venturing back to the gym yet, but love group dynamics, other options include well-ventilated spaces such as outdoor classes and bootcamps \u2013 which are already taking place in all Australian states.",

      "bodyText": "Last Tuesday Steve Edmondson held a staff meeting on a sailing boat. The team went to the outer Great Barrier Reef and snorkelled together among the turtles. It was a bonding exercise after Sailaway Port Douglas shut on 23 March. It was also a learning exercise about the new era of tourism, to give staff a sense of what customers would experience in a \u201cliving with Covid\u201d world. Everyone was asked whether they were feeling well. Each had their temperature checked and their name recorded. The snorkels and masks were double-sanitised, and people picked up their own masks and kept them for the day. Then they had a wonderful time in one of the most beautiful places in Australia. \u201cWe\u2019re reinventing ourselves in terms of the challenge of how to do it differently and in a very thoughtful, sensitive way to get the wheels moving again,\u201d Edmondson says. The coronavirus restrictions, with bans on large gatherings and international travel halted, have crippled tourism. The industry is \u201con its knees\u201d, according to federal minister Simon Birmingham. Queensland is the most tourism-dependant state, with one in five jobs in tropical north Queensland tourism-related. Edmondson, 55, has run Sailaway with his wife Katrina for 17 years. He has become a story himself after penning two letters to the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, pleading with her to keep to her original timeline in the state\u2019s coronavirus \u201croadmap\u201d. That anticipated opening state borders on 10 July, but Palaszczuk has said it could be September or later. That delay, wrote Edmondson, would \u201cinadvertently strangle our tourism industry and far north Queensland with a slow painful death of our economy and employment\u201d. Edmondson says everything went \u201cnuts\u201d after his letters. He did 12 media interviews in 10 days, with everyone from Alan Jones to The Project. \u201cI\u2019m not a professional protester,\u201d he says. \u201cIt takes a lot for me to rev up and write to politicians.\u201d Edmondson is not a \u201clet it rip\u201d man, and he is not one of those who claim the response to Covid-19 has been excessive. Coronavirus is \u201ca big, big deal\u201d and he had no problem shutting in March. But he argues the continued uncertainty for Queensland tourism operators \u2013 especially the closed borders with southern states \u2013 has not been fully explained, particularly as it contradicts federal health advice, which was never to close state borders. The Queensland government has indicated it wants no community transmission of the virus in New South Wales and Victoria before reopening. Edmondson characterises the weeks of closure as a \u201cgreat realisation\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s given us time to reflect, do we need that? How can we do it differently? What are those core values, to really stop the fast pace [of life]? It\u2019s given everybody a sense of vulnerability.\u201d Tourism can reinvent itself. \u201cWe have to live with Covid and keep it under control and have these practices in place and get on with life,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, authenticity, small, personal, connecting with your family and friends is more important than ever.\u201d What\u2019s happened to Sailaway is a glimpse into an industry in freefall.

It was very close to becoming polio free, with only 12 cases in 2018, but last year the number of cases rose to 147. In the same year, Pakistan was accused of covering up the resurgence of the P2 strain of the virus, which was thought to have been eradicated in 2014. Last year had been a challenge as polio bounced back, Dr Rana Muhammad Safdar, national coordinator for polio eradication, told the Guardian. \u201cWe will plan a nationwide campaign as soon as we get an opportunity.

Senator Ayesha Raza Farooq, who received an award for her work against polio, told the Guardian the pause was dangerous. \u201cIf one programme was not effective, we would call it a disaster, but missing an entire national campaign would have unimaginable consequences.\u201d Officials say the disease has spread beyond the three core areas of Karachi, Quetta and Peshawar, and is now present in central Pakistan.

Donors may not say it openly, but \u201cdefinitely, they are worried and frustrated\u201d, Farooq said. President Trump\u2019s freeze on US funding for the WHO, along with the focus on Covid-19, has also made it hard to fund the polio programme. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is one of the founding members of the GPEI, and also provides assistance and funds for the polio programme. \u201cCDC-supported programmes and activities will be put at risk the longer a funding halt continues,\u201d Benjamin Haynes, deputy branch chief of the CDC, told the Guardian.

The IMF should dip into its $35bn reserves</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On 26 March, just as the full force of the pandemic was becoming clear, the <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/g20-coronavirus-leaders-vow-whatever-it-takes-to-fight-virus-and-rescue-economy/\">G20 promised</a> \u201cto use all available policy tools\u201d to support&nbsp;countries in need.&nbsp;There&nbsp;would be a \u201cswift implementation\u201d of an&nbsp;emergency response, it said, and its&nbsp;efforts would be \u201camplified\u201d over the coming weeks. As the International Monetary Fund (IMF) <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/imf-sees-developing-nations-needing-2-5-trillion-for-virus\">said at the time</a>, emerging markets and developing nations needed at least $2.5tn (\u00a32,000bn) in support.&nbsp;But&nbsp;with new Covid-19 cases round the world running above 100,000 a day and still to peak, the&nbsp;vacuum&nbsp;left by G20 inactivity&nbsp;means that allocations from the IMF and the World Bank to poorer countries will remain a fraction of what is required.</p> <p>&nbsp;And yet the economic disruption, and the decline in hours worked across the world, is&nbsp;now equivalent to the loss of more than <a href=\"https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_743036/lang--en/index.htm\">300 million full-time jobs</a>, according to the International Labour Organization. For the first time this century, global poverty is rising, and three decades of improving living standards are now in reverse.

Developing economies and emerging markets have none of the fiscal room for manoeuvre that richer countries enjoy,&nbsp;and not surprisingly&nbsp;more than 100 such countries have applied to the IMF for emergency support.&nbsp;</p> <p>The G20\u2019s failure to meet is all the more disgraceful because the global response to Covid-19 should this month be moving from its first phase, the rescue operation, to its second, a comprehensive recovery plan \u2013 and at its heart there should&nbsp;be a globally coordinated&nbsp;stimulus with an agreed global growth plan.&nbsp;</p> <p>To make this recovery sustainable the \u201cgreen new deal\u201d needs to go global; and to help pay for it,&nbsp;a coordinated blitz is required on&nbsp;the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-offshore-wealth/super-rich-hold-32-trillion-in-offshore-havens-idUSBRE86L03U20120722\">estimated $7.4t</a><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-offshore-wealth/super-rich-hold-32-trillion-in-offshore-havens-idUSBRE86L03U20120722\">n</a> hidden untaxed in offshore&nbsp;havens.</p> <p>&nbsp;As a group of 200 former leaders state in today\u2019s letter&nbsp;to the G20, the poorest countries&nbsp;need international aid within days,&nbsp;not weeks or months. Debt relief is the quickest way of releasing resources.&nbsp;Until&nbsp;now, sub-Saharan Africa&nbsp;has been spending more on debt repayments than on health. The&nbsp;$80bn owed by the 76 poorest nations should be waived&nbsp;until at least December 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>But poor countries also need direct cash support.&nbsp;The IMF should&nbsp;dip into its $35bn reserves, and the development banks should announce&nbsp;they are prepared to&nbsp;raise additional money.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/china-gdp-growth-targets-coronavirus-beijing\">China says it's ditching GDP targets.

On 26 March, just as the full force of the pandemic was becoming clear, the G20 promised \u201cto use all available policy tools\u201d to support countries in need. There would be a \u201cswift implementation\u201d of an emergency response, it said, and its efforts would be \u201camplified\u201d over the coming weeks. As the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said at the time, emerging markets and developing nations needed at least $2.5tn (\u00a32,000bn) in support. But with new Covid-19 cases round the world running above 100,000 a day and still to peak, the vacuum left by G20 inactivity means that allocations from the IMF and the World Bank to poorer countries will remain a fraction of what is required. And yet the economic disruption, and the decline in hours worked across the world, is now equivalent to the loss of more than 300 million full-time jobs, according to the International Labour Organization. For the first time this century, global poverty is rising, and three decades of improving living standards are now in reverse. An additional 420 million more people will fall into extreme poverty and, according to the World Food Programme, 265 million face malnutrition. Developing economies and emerging markets have none of the fiscal room for manoeuvre that richer countries enjoy, and not surprisingly more than 100 such countries have applied to the IMF for emergency support. The G20\u2019s failure to meet is all the more disgraceful because the global response to Covid-19 should this month be moving from its first phase, the rescue operation, to its second, a comprehensive recovery plan \u2013 and at its heart there should be a globally coordinated stimulus with an agreed global growth plan. To make this recovery sustainable the \u201cgreen new deal\u201d needs to go global; and to help pay for it, a coordinated blitz is required on the estimated $7.4tn hidden untaxed in offshore havens. As a group of 200 former leaders state in today\u2019s letter to the G20, the poorest countries need international aid within days, not weeks or months. Debt relief is the quickest way of releasing resources. Until now, sub-Saharan Africa has been spending more on debt repayments than on health. The $80bn owed by the 76 poorest nations should be waived until at least December 2021. But poor countries also need direct cash support. The IMF should dip into its $35bn reserves, and the development banks should announce they are prepared to raise additional money. A second trillion can be raised by issuing \u2013 as we did in the global financial crisis \u2013 new international money (known as special drawing rights), which can be converted into dollars or local currency. To their credit, European countries like the UK, France and Germany have already lent some of this money to poorer countries and, if the IMF agreed, $500bn could be issued immediately and $500bn more by 2022. And we must declare now that any new vaccine and cure will be made freely available to all who need it \u2013 and resist US pressure by supporting the World Health Organization in its efforts to ensure the poorest nations do not lose out. This Thursday, at the pledging conference held for the global vaccine alliance in London, donor countries should contribute the $7bn needed to help make immunisation more widely available. No country can eliminate infectious diseases unless all countries do so. And it is because we cannot deal with the health nor the economic emergency without bringing the whole world together that Donald Trump\u2019s latest counterproposal \u2013 to parade a few favoured leaders in Washington in September \u2013 is no substitute for a G20 summit. His event would exclude Africa, the Middle East, Latin America and most of Asia, and would represent only 2 billion of the world\u2019s 7 billion people. Yet the lesson of history is that, at key moments of crisis, we require bold, united leadership, and to resist initiatives that will be seen as \u201cdivide and rule\u201d. So, it is time for the other 19 G20 members to demand an early summit, and avert what would be the greatest global social and economic policy failure of our generation. \u2022 Gordon Brown was UK prime minister from 2007 to 2010 and led the G20 financial crisis summit in 2009",

Health officials and even government scientists have warned against the easing of the coronavirus lockdown in England, saying it could lead to a surge in infections. David Hunter, professor of epidemiology and medicine at the University of Oxford, looks at the risks. Lunchtime read: Power of the crowd Even before the pandemic, mass gatherings were under threat from draconian laws and corporate seizure of public space. Yet history shows that the crowd always finds a way to return, writes Dan Hancox. Sport Two leading jockeys walked away from high-speed falls as the first day of racing in Britain since mid-March was marred by a fatal injury to a horse. The Manchester United teammates Marcus Rashford and Paul Pogba have both posted powerful anti-racism messages on social media, as outcry continues to build over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The chairman of Kick It Out has urged every Premier League footballer to take a knee when the season resumes, adding that the Football Association should not punish players who use their platforms to call for social change. A number of Formula One drivers have come forward to condemn racism after Lewis Hamilton strongly criticised the silence from his sport. And Joe Root has reunited with Peter Moores, the former England head coach, as he tunes up for July\u2019s proposed Test series against West Indies. Business Shares have been mostly higher in Asia, lifted by moves to reopen many regional economies from shutdowns aimed at containing the coronavirus pandemic. Benchmarks rose in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Seoul but fell in Shanghai and Sydney. Jakarta\u2019s main index jumped 2% and Singapore\u2019s was up 1.2% as authorities were winding down some pandemic precautions. The gains also tracked a modest advance on Wall Street overnight. The pound is worth $1.248 and \u20ac1.21 while the FTSE is trending around a quarter of a per cent higher ahead of the open. The papers Front page pictures seem like an odd combination of dystopia and hope today as youngsters are shown skipping back to school \u2013 to be greeted by staff dressed in Hazmat-lite who scan them with non-contact thermometers. The Mirror calls it \u201cSmall steps into a new normal\u201d. The i says there will be \u201cSummer camps to stop children falling behind\u201d. The Times carries a warning to the PM: \u201cSafe return of all primary pupils \u2018will be impossible\u2019\u201d. The Guardian\u2019s lead story is \u201cCritics round on No 10 over \u2018ridiculous\u2019 quarantine\u201d. Under proposals, arrivals to the UK would be able to break their 14-day self-isolation to shop for food, medicine or to meet a legal obligation \u2013 and police powers to carry out spot checks appear flimsy. The Telegraph has \u201cQuarantine plan under review as MPs revolt\u201d \u2013 we\u2019ve also covered how travel and hospitality companies think it will cripple their return to business. The Metro reports on \u201cTrack trace fraud alert\u201d, saying con artists are posing as contact tracers on the phone. \u201cONE metre is enough!\u201d declares the Mail \u2013 a questionable interpretation of the actual finding, which is that the risk of infection doubles if physical distance is halved from two metres. The Express has got the vuvuzela out for Matt Hancock again: \u201cWe\u2019re winning battle against Covid-19\u201d. The FT\u2019s lead story seems a little out of character, though admittedly this does qualify as a business story: \u201cTop Facebook staff revolt over Zuckerberg\u2019s stance on Trump\u201d. The Sun has \u201cPosh paid \u00a31m NOT to sing\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s not about a crowdfunding campaign, but her share of earnings arising from last year\u2019s reunion gig.

It has altered everyone\u2019s way of life, tested our resolve and had tragic consequences for many. But in this adversity it has also shown the willingness of the British people to pull together and help those most in need too. Hundreds of thousands of people, across the country, have helped to deliver groceries, pick up prescriptions and check in on neighbours. They have organised local mutual aid groups, helped through existing volunteering networks and offered their time in a host of different ways. Volunteers have always made an important contribution to the health and vitality of our communities.

      "body": "<p>\u2018We never ask the right question of the future,\u201d says David Greig, artistic director of Edinburgh\u2019s Royal Lyceum theatre. \u201cIf you\u2019d asked me six months ago what the big question of 2020 was going to be, I\u2019d have been asking if the theatre would get an uplift in our <a href=\"https://www.creativescotland.com/\">Creative Scotland</a> support and if the next season will attract an audience. Then suddenly something else comes along.\u201d</p> <p>Thanks to a question nobody thought to ask, his theatre has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/20/edinburgh-royal-lyceum-hibernation-cancel-2020-programme\">gone into \u201chibernation\u201d</a> for the rest of the year. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be anything like what we would have understood as normal theatre for some considerable time,\u201d he says.</p> <p>In his role as playwright on commission to <a href=\"https://pitlochryfestivaltheatre.com/\">Pitlochry Festival theatre</a>, Greig has been thinking about a similar historical shock. His latest play, Adventures with the Painted People, is set in 86AD, when the occupying Roman army pulled out of its fort <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01696lj\">at Inchtuthil</a>, in modern-day Perthshire. Eithne, a Pictish woman, has offered to rescue Lucius, a captured Roman officer, in return for him teaching her to write; their culture-clash romance is ticking along nicely until the order comes from Rome to withdraw.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about the encounter between a Roman and a Caledonian at a point when it seems utterly inevitable that Rome will be administrating Caledonia for 1,000 years,\u201d he says. \u201cThen something happens. We\u2019re not in charge of our own stories and it\u2019s foolish of us to think we are.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bce464a29108756be9e6f6c1fa19f5763409a2a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bce464a29108756be9e6f6c1fa19f5763409a2a3/0_0_1366_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zoom discussions for Painted People.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keeping a sense of the theatrical \u2026 Zoom discussions for Painted People.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fittingly, the play itself has been the victim of disrupted plans. It had been due to open in Pitlochry in July, when it would have formed the centrepiece of <a href=\"https://pitlochryfestivaltheatre.com/about/shades-of-tay/\">Shades of Tay</a>, a series of 50 art works inspired by Scotland\u2019s longest river. Instead it is making its debut on BBC Radio 3 as part of the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts\">Culture in Quarantine season</a> and will have to wait until next summer for its stage premiere.</p> <p>Even on the radio, however, Greig and director Elizabeth Newman want to keep a sense of the theatrical. \u201cIt\u2019s in the writing, the authorship and the density of ideas,\u201d says Newman, walking her dog after a morning\u2019s Zoom rehearsal with actors Kirsty Stuart and Olivier Huband. \u201cIf you think about Dennis Potter\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2004/jul/20/theatre1\">Brimstone and Treacle</a> and the Play for Today series, there\u2019s something about the way the writers use metaphor that makes them pieces of theatre rather than television. We need to keep striving to share those worlds that writers create.\u201d</p> <p>Although he\u2019s delving into ancient history, Greig has an eye on the culture clashes of today\u2019s globalised world. \u201cWe recognise the civilisation of Rome because it\u2019s what western Europe is built from,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s roads, cities and central heating. But the civilisation of the peoples of this area at that time was equally a civilisation \u2013 it just didn\u2019t use writing and straight roads.

      "bodyText": "\u2018We never ask the right question of the future,\u201d says David Greig, artistic director of Edinburgh\u2019s Royal Lyceum theatre. \u201cIf you\u2019d asked me six months ago what the big question of 2020 was going to be, I\u2019d have been asking if the theatre would get an uplift in our Creative Scotland support and if the next season will attract an audience. Then suddenly something else comes along.\u201d Thanks to a question nobody thought to ask, his theatre has gone into \u201chibernation\u201d for the rest of the year. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be anything like what we would have understood as normal theatre for some considerable time,\u201d he says. In his role as playwright on commission to Pitlochry Festival theatre, Greig has been thinking about a similar historical shock. His latest play, Adventures with the Painted People, is set in 86AD, when the occupying Roman army pulled out of its fort at Inchtuthil, in modern-day Perthshire. Eithne, a Pictish woman, has offered to rescue Lucius, a captured Roman officer, in return for him teaching her to write; their culture-clash romance is ticking along nicely until the order comes from Rome to withdraw. \u201cIt\u2019s about the encounter between a Roman and a Caledonian at a point when it seems utterly inevitable that Rome will be administrating Caledonia for 1,000 years,\u201d he says. \u201cThen something happens. We\u2019re not in charge of our own stories and it\u2019s foolish of us to think we are.\u201d Fittingly, the play itself has been the victim of disrupted plans. It had been due to open in Pitlochry in July, when it would have formed the centrepiece of Shades of Tay, a series of 50 art works inspired by Scotland\u2019s longest river. Instead it is making its debut on BBC Radio 3 as part of the Culture in Quarantine season and will have to wait until next summer for its stage premiere. Even on the radio, however, Greig and director Elizabeth Newman want to keep a sense of the theatrical. \u201cIt\u2019s in the writing, the authorship and the density of ideas,\u201d says Newman, walking her dog after a morning\u2019s Zoom rehearsal with actors Kirsty Stuart and Olivier Huband. \u201cIf you think about Dennis Potter\u2019s Brimstone and Treacle and the Play for Today series, there\u2019s something about the way the writers use metaphor that makes them pieces of theatre rather than television. We need to keep striving to share those worlds that writers create.\u201d Although he\u2019s delving into ancient history, Greig has an eye on the culture clashes of today\u2019s globalised world. \u201cWe recognise the civilisation of Rome because it\u2019s what western Europe is built from,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s roads, cities and central heating. But the civilisation of the peoples of this area at that time was equally a civilisation \u2013 it just didn\u2019t use writing and straight roads. The encounter contains interesting tensions for now.\u201d \u201cWhat David is talking about is so politically important,\u201d says Newman. \u201cIt\u2019s about what it means to be multicultural, what it means to create a culture, the difference between local and global. It\u2019s a contradiction that sits in both of us: on the one hand I\u2019m obsessed by growing food and having a theatre that generates a local community, on the other hand I believe internationalism helps us grow and change.\u201d Greig and Newman have more than the play in common.

      "bodyText": "1. England\u2019s first World Cup adventure was a voyage of the damned \u2018To hyperbole stirred up by the national prints, England were presented as certain to be returning home triumphantly from South America with the Jules Rimet trophy. Failure was never considered. Here, after all, was the greatest assembly of footballing talent ever to leave England\u2019s shores: Matthews, Finney, Mannion, Mortensen, Wright and Milburn, a confection of Boy\u2019s Own heroes. It was, after all, England\u2019s game.\u2019 2. Demons, death and dynamite dialogue: the 20 best episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer \u2018Buffy the Vampire Slayer is a witty show: funny, dry, sometimes silly and perfectly at home with embracing the absurdities of its supernatural setting. It evolved to become a brilliant show, though, because it was also capable of tackling the big stuff with tremendous skill and ingenuity.\u2018 3. \u2018Very Buckinghamshire\u2019: how \u2018society bible\u2019 Tatler fell out of royal favour \u2018It\u2019s the \u201csociety bible\u201d and arbiter of upper-class tastes, jam-packed with photographs of posh people you haven\u2019t heard of, who are also largely its subscribers.\u2018 4. When did Happy Days jump the shark? The answer may surprise you ... \u2018And so, Jump the Shark \u2013 the column in which we pinpoint the precise moment TV shows of yesteryear went pants \u2013 has itself jumped the shark, to be replaced next week by, erm, who knows? Maybe a crossword, or a column called The Eureka Moment where Guardian writers pinpoint the exact moment crap TV shows get good? So let\u2019s look at where the entire concept began.\u2019 5. Rage and anguish: how the US papers have covered the George Floyd protests \u2018Monday\u2019s Washington Post headline summed up the tension in the nation: \u201cUS at a precipice as demonstrations intensify\u201d. An editorial was headlined: \u201cAs cities burn, Trump\u2019s bullhorn drowns out the voices of our better angels\u201d. It says Trump, who it calls the \u201cdivider in chief\u201d is playing his \u201ccustomary role as human flamethrower: exactly the wrong leader for the times\u201d.\u2019 6. Q+A: Matt Canavan grilled on climate change and family links to coal industry \u2018Canavan\u2019s vocal support of the coal industry has included calls for new coal-fired power stations, despite his moderate government colleagues opposing the idea. But the senator pointed out he had disclosed his brother\u2019s senior position in the coal industry during his maiden speech to the Senate. \u2018 7. Charlie Higson: \u2018The Fast Show was never meant to offend\u2019 \u2018Together they struck upon the notion of animating Swiss Toni. They found old photos of the character, drew over them and hashed out a quick cartoon. Higson then called on Bob Mortimer \u2013 with whom he co-created the character all those years ago \u2013 for help with some of Toni\u2019s more seamy dialogue. \u201cBob always used to write the really filthy analogies,\u201d Higson recalls.\u2019 8. \u2018He is a destroyer\u2019: how the George Floyd protests left Donald Trump exposed \u2018The story of Trump\u2019s presidency was arguably always leading to this moment, with its toxic mix of weak moral leadership, racial divisiveness, crass and vulgar rhetoric and an erosion of norms, institutions and trust in traditional information sources. Taken together, these ingredients created a tinderbox poised to explode when crises came.\u2019 9. Crossword blog: the man who solved 2,000 clues in a day \u2018When I got tired, I entered that solving zone where you\u2019re not consciously thinking of every element of a clue, but solving by reading. It\u2019s difficult to explain to non-solvers, but I liken it to speaking a language. Competent speakers are good at the mechanics of another language, but still need to translate to and from their own, whereas speedy solvers become fluent in crosswordese and don\u2019t need to think in \u201cordinary\u201d English.\u2019 10. The great escapes: how Crystal Palace fought off relegation and liquidation \u2018The relegation battle went to the last day of the season in a do-or-die match against Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough. The tension-ridden 2-2 draw meant Wednesday went down to League One and Palace stayed in the Championship \u2013 but the club faced another, more significant off-the-field battle in the following weeks.\u2019 How we create the antidote Every day we measure not only how many people click on individual stories but also how long they spend reading them.

By the time they came to recognise that there were around 1 million children who wouldn\u2019t be able to access education, there was no longer much supply of laptops and tablets.\u201d</p> <p>Headteachers have been expressing frustration at the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vicgoddard/status/1262484729896603650?s=20\">lack of progress</a> in getting the help on offer. One of them is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/vic-goddard\">Vic Goddard</a>, principal at Passmores academy, Harlow, and star of the 2011 BBC programme Educating Essex. He has been promised just 29 laptops and only 13 routers to share between the 200 families at his school who say they do not have enough technology for their children to learn online.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17e8c2a3a2ae046e78ee3ea7969dd671def69b47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/17e8c2a3a2ae046e78ee3ea7969dd671def69b47/0_207_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vic Goddard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">To ensure equality, Vic Goddard, head of Passmores academy in Essex, is no longer setting work online as he has been promised just 29 laptops for 200 families.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMy reaction has been verging on the hysterical,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating.\u201d Even the 29 laptops he expects to get from the government have not arrived. \u201cI\u2019ve become increasingly cynical about it all.\u201d As far as he\u2019s concerned, it\u2019s a case of \u201cgreat headlines, small impact\u201d.</p> <p>In the meantime, to ensure all children have equal access to education at his school, he has stopped offering online learning and is now sending out packs of workbooks for all pupils to complete.</p> <p>Another headteacher says 107 children at her school were eligible for a laptop but she has been offered just 25, none of which has arrived. \u201cI have been getting messages from families daily who need them. How am I going to choose who gets one?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/16/england-plans-to-send-the-wrong-children-back-to-school-at-the-wrong-time\">England plans to send the wrong children back to school at the wrong time  | Laura McInerney</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many schools have been trying hard to reach poorer children. At <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/dec/17/children-dont-get-presents-schools-open-over-christmas\">Parklands primary</a>, in Leeds, one of the most deprived schools in the country, fewer than 20% of children have access to a dedicated tablet, computer or smartphone. The headteacher, Chris Dyson, has been loaning textbooks and ensuring the worst-off families collect food parcels along with their books. \u201cThe best home schooling work these children can do is to read. When you read a book, you can get away from all this crisis and go to a new world.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re hoping children will keep their love of learning going by doing bits and bobs, but our priority is their mental wellbeing so when they return to school, they come back safe and happy. Then we can start to pick up on the learning they\u2019ve missed.\u201d</p> <p>Maugham is sceptical about whether the government will be able to deliver on its promises and is concerned that, even when schools return, many children from poorer families may not. In a recent study by the <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14848\">Institute for Fiscal Studies</a>, higher-income parents were more willing for their child to go back to school than lower-income parents, despite the fact that children from better-off families were spending up to 75 more minutes a day \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/18/keeping-schools-closed-in-england-will-widen-educational-inequalities-study-ifs\">30% more time</a> \u2013 on home learning than poorer children.</p> <p>Rivers fears her daughters will not qualify for any government devices because they are not yet in year 10, and she is worried about them falling behind. \u201cThe most important thing I can do is to make sure they are happy and they\u2019re not stressed. But at the same time, I want them to do well in their work when they go back to school. I don\u2019t want them to need to do a big catch-up, because that will be more stressful for them\u201d</p> <p>She listens to five-year-old Scarlett read every day, and does her best to encourage her other children to talk about what they were taught in school. A typical day involves TV, board games, books, writing stories or comics, and arts and crafts activities. \u201cWe try and spend as much time as we can in the garden \u2013 it releases all the steam.\u201d </p> <p>But the pressure to teach them is taking its toll: \u201cSome days, I just don\u2019t know how I deal with it. I take my hat off to teachers. They need to be paid double.\u201d</p> <p>Rivers is also full of praise for School Home Support, a charity that works with schools to help families on low incomes and vulnerable children. Jaime McDonald from the charity, who is attached to Bethany\u2019s school, has been trying for weeks to get the family a laptop. \u201cShe\u2019s been absolutely brilliant, phoning up every day, asking how I am, even popping round to chat to me and the kids from a safe distance, bless her.\u201d</p> <p>School Home Support is rolling out a pilot that will give more than 120 families \u2013 including the Rivers family \u2013 access to technology and data over the next few weeks, thanks to donations from other charities and tech companies. \u201cWe knew that access to technology would be a real issue for the families we work with when the learning went online,\u201d said Jaine Stannard, the charity\u2019s chief executive. </p> <p>She says some families are facing financial ruin and so have more pressing problems to focus on than their children\u2019s schoolwork. Realistically, she thinks a lot of the children will not return to school until at least September: \u201cThat\u2019s a long gap to be missing school.\u201d</p> <p>The children who most need support from their teachers and the government are now further at risk, she says. \u201cThey will fall behind. The gap is going to widen.\u201d</p>",

By the time they came to recognise that there were around 1 million children who wouldn\u2019t be able to access education, there was no longer much supply of laptops and tablets.\u201d Headteachers have been expressing frustration at the lack of progress in getting the help on offer. One of them is Vic Goddard, principal at Passmores academy, Harlow, and star of the 2011 BBC programme Educating Essex. He has been promised just 29 laptops and only 13 routers to share between the 200 families at his school who say they do not have enough technology for their children to learn online. \u201cMy reaction has been verging on the hysterical,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s so frustrating.\u201d Even the 29 laptops he expects to get from the government have not arrived. \u201cI\u2019ve become increasingly cynical about it all.\u201d As far as he\u2019s concerned, it\u2019s a case of \u201cgreat headlines, small impact\u201d. In the meantime, to ensure all children have equal access to education at his school, he has stopped offering online learning and is now sending out packs of workbooks for all pupils to complete. Another headteacher says 107 children at her school were eligible for a laptop but she has been offered just 25, none of which has arrived. \u201cI have been getting messages from families daily who need them. How am I going to choose who gets one?\u201d Many schools have been trying hard to reach poorer children. At Parklands primary, in Leeds, one of the most deprived schools in the country, fewer than 20% of children have access to a dedicated tablet, computer or smartphone. The headteacher, Chris Dyson, has been loaning textbooks and ensuring the worst-off families collect food parcels along with their books. \u201cThe best home schooling work these children can do is to read. When you read a book, you can get away from all this crisis and go to a new world. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping children will keep their love of learning going by doing bits and bobs, but our priority is their mental wellbeing so when they return to school, they come back safe and happy. Then we can start to pick up on the learning they\u2019ve missed.\u201d Maugham is sceptical about whether the government will be able to deliver on its promises and is concerned that, even when schools return, many children from poorer families may not. In a recent study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, higher-income parents were more willing for their child to go back to school than lower-income parents, despite the fact that children from better-off families were spending up to 75 more minutes a day \u2013 30% more time \u2013 on home learning than poorer children. Rivers fears her daughters will not qualify for any government devices because they are not yet in year 10, and she is worried about them falling behind. \u201cThe most important thing I can do is to make sure they are happy and they\u2019re not stressed. But at the same time, I want them to do well in their work when they go back to school. I don\u2019t want them to need to do a big catch-up, because that will be more stressful for them\u201d She listens to five-year-old Scarlett read every day, and does her best to encourage her other children to talk about what they were taught in school. A typical day involves TV, board games, books, writing stories or comics, and arts and crafts activities. \u201cWe try and spend as much time as we can in the garden \u2013 it releases all the steam.\u201d But the pressure to teach them is taking its toll: \u201cSome days, I just don\u2019t know how I deal with it. I take my hat off to teachers. They need to be paid double.\u201d Rivers is also full of praise for School Home Support, a charity that works with schools to help families on low incomes and vulnerable children. Jaime McDonald from the charity, who is attached to Bethany\u2019s school, has been trying for weeks to get the family a laptop. \u201cShe\u2019s been absolutely brilliant, phoning up every day, asking how I am, even popping round to chat to me and the kids from a safe distance, bless her.\u201d School Home Support is rolling out a pilot that will give more than 120 families \u2013 including the Rivers family \u2013 access to technology and data over the next few weeks, thanks to donations from other charities and tech companies. \u201cWe knew that access to technology would be a real issue for the families we work with when the learning went online,\u201d said Jaine Stannard, the charity\u2019s chief executive. She says some families are facing financial ruin and so have more pressing problems to focus on than their children\u2019s schoolwork. Realistically, she thinks a lot of the children will not return to school until at least September: \u201cThat\u2019s a long gap to be missing school.\u201d The children who most need support from their teachers and the government are now further at risk, she says. \u201cThey will fall behind. The gap is going to widen.\u201d",

I am actually rather embarrassed to have to mention it. But I am so shocked by what Jacob Rees-Mogg is trying to shove through parliament that I am going to have to speak up,\u201d he said. The House of Commons is poised to return on Tuesday after its Whitsun recess, but without the remote voting and video participation in debates that were introduced when parliament sat during the Covid-19 lockdown. Rees-Mogg, the leader of the house, has instead proposed a motion that requires voting to take place in person at the Palace of Westminster while MPs follow Public Health England distancing guidance. Critics have claimed the plan will disenfranchise those MPs who are shielding or have caring responsibilities for anyone who could be vulnerable to the disease. As MP for the Highland constituency of Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross, Stone has flown back from Westminster for three-day weekends with Flora since his 2017 election. Now, amid the pandemic, he feels compelled to stay alongside her. \u201cIn previous times we had carers who came in at various times during the week.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, Stone took on the entirety of her care as they were worried about carers coming in and inadvertently passing on the virus. There are other considerations too, Stone said, such as why should 650 potential carriers of a deadly disease be encouraged to travel from the cramped corridors of Westminster back to areas such as his constituency with a low incidence of the disease? \u201cIf I were to go to London and pick up a disease I could come back and start a hotspot.

If the house approves the government plan on Tuesday, MPs may have to form kilometre-long queues in order to obey physical distancing rules when voting \u2013 despite the Lords planning a move online. The former cabinet minister Karen Bradley is leading a rebellion against the ending of the hybrid Commons proceedings, which allowed for remote voting and virtual debates. Bradley, now the chair of the powerful procedure committee, has put forward amendments that would allow those MPs not able to travel to Westminster to keep participating in debates via video link and to vote remotely. Stone said Rees-Mogg\u2019s proposals would abandon MPs with caring responsibilities. \u201cHe is putting me and others in a very impossible position.

The family of six \u2013 four women and two men from Ethiopia, across the Red Sea \u2013 had already walked eight miles (13km) so far that morning. They stopped to ask the soldiers for water before continuing on their journey.</p> <p>\u201cWe didn\u2019t know about the fighting in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/yemen\">Yemen</a> before we came on the boat last night,\u201d said one of the group, Abdul Saleh Tayeb. \u201cBut we are looking for money. We have to go to Saudi Arabia.\u201d They still had around 1,000 miles (1,400km) through disputed territories, mountain passes and scorching desert to go.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Guardian met Tayeb and his family during a visit to Yemen last September, swapping contact details, although their phone number has not worked since then.&nbsp;The family are some of the around 138,000 people from the Horn of Africa who made the dangerous journey across the Red Sea to Yemen last year in the hope of reaching the Gulf states and finding employment.&nbsp;</p> <p>According to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), as Europe has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/revealed-the-great-european-refugee-scandal\">cracked down</a> on routes over the Mediterranean from Turkey and Libya, the journey to Yemen is now the busiest maritime migration route in the world. Young men in an Aden park told the Guardian they paid 15,000 Ethiopian birr (\u00a3354) for the journey.</p> <p>Almost none of the new arrivals from Ethiopia and Somalia know that war has raged in Yemen for the least five years, impeding their onward journey, or that <a href=\"https://apnews.com/476e15db8b77486e9d157b33f9494b22\">torture and rape</a> could await them at the hands of smugglers and traffickers.

Everyday this is pushing more people into deep poverty. We are worried about an increase in things like survival sex and marrying off young children.\u201d</p> <p>According to the UN, Yemen is experiencing the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. Almost 80% of the 29-million-strong population is dependent on aid to survive, and a blockade imposed on Houthi-rebel held areas by the Saudi and Emirati-led coalition fighting to restore Yemen\u2019s UN-backed government has led to cholera epidemics and severe malnutrition among children. The combined death toll from fighting and disease at the end of 2019 was estimated at 230,000 people.&nbsp;</p> <p>Western governments, including the UK and the US, have been heavily criticised for their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/oct/03/a-fathers-grief-and-the-made-in-usa-bomb-dropped-in-yemen\">role in the devastation</a>, which includes selling arms and providing technical expertise to the Gulf-led coalition.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90115c98ad2e81fdbc2bc2470233bb645990baf2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90115c98ad2e81fdbc2bc2470233bb645990baf2/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"African migrant women at a checkpoint in Aden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">African migrant women at a checkpoint in Aden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Achilleas Zavallis/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That has not stopped some donors, including the US, cutting funding to UN programmes in Yemen at the beginning of the year because of Houthi attempts to consolidate control over the management and distribution of resources.&nbsp;The UK has so far pledged \u00a318m in aid to Yemen for 2020, which is less than 10% of what it provided last year.&nbsp;</p> <p>The cuts and funding shortfalls have already led 75% of UN programmes to shut their doors or reduce operations: the World Food Programme (WFP) has halved food deliveries and UN-funded health services have faced cutbacks in 189 out of 369 hospitals nationwide.&nbsp;</p> <p>Thirty out of 41 major programmes will be forced to close down completely even as Covid-19 overwhelms what is left of Yemen\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/health-workers-targeted-at-least-120-times-yemen-conflict\">collapsed health system</a>. Yemen only has 323 confirmed cases of the virus, but there are reports of deaths from Covid-19 symptoms from around the country.&nbsp;</p> <p>World Health Organization predictions estimate that even if the pandemic response is well-managed, at least 42,000 Yemenis will succumb to the virus. A worst-case scenario could see 93% of the around 30-million-strong population infected.</p> <p>For the first time, Saudi Arabia is hosting a new UN donor pledging conference on Tuesday, but many aid workers and doctors fear that whatever new assistance arrives, irreparable damage has already been done.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe have worked through crises in the war before but since coronavirus broke out it\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve seen before,\u201d said Dr Ishraq Alsubai, spokeswoman for Yemen\u2019s national committee to combat the coronavirus.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIn Aden we only have 20 ventilators and three of those are broken. I hate to be pessimistic about Yemen\u2019s future but we have not even scratched the surface of this crisis yet.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Yellow and purple headscarves and patterned dresses made a jarring contrast with the camouflage uniforms worn by soldiers milling around a bullet-ridden checkpoint in the southern Yemeni city of Aden. It was 8am, and the sun was already hot. The family of six \u2013 four women and two men from Ethiopia, across the Red Sea \u2013 had already walked eight miles (13km) so far that morning. They stopped to ask the soldiers for water before continuing on their journey. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know about the fighting in Yemen before we came on the boat last night,\u201d said one of the group, Abdul Saleh Tayeb. \u201cBut we are looking for money. We have to go to Saudi Arabia.\u201d They still had around 1,000 miles (1,400km) through disputed territories, mountain passes and scorching desert to go. The Guardian met Tayeb and his family during a visit to Yemen last September, swapping contact details, although their phone number has not worked since then. The family are some of the around 138,000 people from the Horn of Africa who made the dangerous journey across the Red Sea to Yemen last year in the hope of reaching the Gulf states and finding employment. According to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), as Europe has cracked down on routes over the Mediterranean from Turkey and Libya, the journey to Yemen is now the busiest maritime migration route in the world. Young men in an Aden park told the Guardian they paid 15,000 Ethiopian birr (\u00a3354) for the journey. Almost none of the new arrivals from Ethiopia and Somalia know that war has raged in Yemen for the least five years, impeding their onward journey, or that torture and rape could await them at the hands of smugglers and traffickers. Now, aid agencies are warning that funding shortfalls and cuts and the spread of coronavirus in the country leaves Yemen\u2019s hidden migrant population even more vulnerable. \u201cAs well as Yemenis displaced by the conflict, we are also trying to help migrants who have no money, no support networks, nothing when they get here,\u201d said Jean Nicholas Beuze, the UN refugee agency\u2019s representative to Yemen. \u201cAs of [June] we will have to stop cash payments that help people buy clothes and medicine, and by August we will run out of even the most basic shelter equipment like plastic sheeting. \u201cResponses take planning: we\u2019re not talking about 2021 here, we\u2019re talking about this week. Everyday this is pushing more people into deep poverty. We are worried about an increase in things like survival sex and marrying off young children.\u201d According to the UN, Yemen is experiencing the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. Almost 80% of the 29-million-strong population is dependent on aid to survive, and a blockade imposed on Houthi-rebel held areas by the Saudi and Emirati-led coalition fighting to restore Yemen\u2019s UN-backed government has led to cholera epidemics and severe malnutrition among children. The combined death toll from fighting and disease at the end of 2019 was estimated at 230,000 people. Western governments, including the UK and the US, have been heavily criticised for their role in the devastation, which includes selling arms and providing technical expertise to the Gulf-led coalition. That has not stopped some donors, including the US, cutting funding to UN programmes in Yemen at the beginning of the year because of Houthi attempts to consolidate control over the management and distribution of resources. The UK has so far pledged \u00a318m in aid to Yemen for 2020, which is less than 10% of what it provided last year. The cuts and funding shortfalls have already led 75% of UN programmes to shut their doors or reduce operations: the World Food Programme (WFP) has halved food deliveries and UN-funded health services have faced cutbacks in 189 out of 369 hospitals nationwide. Thirty out of 41 major programmes will be forced to close down completely even as Covid-19 overwhelms what is left of Yemen\u2019s collapsed health system. Yemen only has 323 confirmed cases of the virus, but there are reports of deaths from Covid-19 symptoms from around the country. World Health Organization predictions estimate that even if the pandemic response is well-managed, at least 42,000 Yemenis will succumb to the virus. A worst-case scenario could see 93% of the around 30-million-strong population infected. For the first time, Saudi Arabia is hosting a new UN donor pledging conference on Tuesday, but many aid workers and doctors fear that whatever new assistance arrives, irreparable damage has already been done. \u201cWe have worked through crises in the war before but since coronavirus broke out it\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve seen before,\u201d said Dr Ishraq Alsubai, spokeswoman for Yemen\u2019s national committee to combat the coronavirus. \u201cIn Aden we only have 20 ventilators and three of those are broken. I hate to be pessimistic about Yemen\u2019s future but we have not even scratched the surface of this crisis yet.\u201d",

Thousands of life-changing decisions are being made day in, day out by family judges with no idea whether they have led to an even halfway decent outcome for children, or if disaster has been the eventual result, she adds. It\u2019s a pretty devastating charge \u2013 but a concern that <a href=\"https://www.familylaw.co.uk/news_and_comment/feedback-for-judges-in-the-family-court\">family judges themselves</a> have also expressed. &nbsp;</p> <p>Harker\u2019s team surveyed more than 1,000 judges, lawyers, parents, social workers and other family court users. The <a href=\"https://www.nuffieldfjo.org.uk/app/nuffield/files-module/local/documents/nfjo_remote_hearings_20200507-2-.pdf\">report</a>, published in early May, uncovered \u201csome really eye-watering examples\u201d, says Harker, of cases heard in the early days of the crisis \u201cthat many felt should never have been conducted in the way they were\u201d.</p> <p>One mother, for example, said she \u201chad to give her evidence from her garden shed, because she could find nowhere else where her children couldn\u2019t hear her,\u201d Harker points out. Another woman, still in hospital after giving birth, had to attend a remote court hearing at which the local authority was applying to remove her newborn child. \u201cShe was in a side room, without legal representation,\u201d says Harker bleakly. \u201cShe missed hearing the outcome [that the newborn be taken into care] and had to be told later.\u201d</p> <p>There is \u201ca strong consensus\u201d from the findings of the report that when judges are asked to make drastic orders, which might end up with a child being taken permanently into care, or placed for adoption, or any situation where evidence was contested and cross-examination of witnesses would need to be done, that virtual hearings are \u201cnot justice, and not a humane approach that professionals want to take, she says.</p> <p>Harker is particularly concerned about \u201csituations when an infant may ultimately be removed from a parent\u2019s care on a permanent basis\u201d. With no contact, a mother cannot say at a final hearing that she has bonded with her baby \u2013 and one of her strongest arguments for retaining the care of her child is suddenly gone.</p> <p>The report highlighted that in the initial rush to remote hearings, technical unpreparedness had caused parents and professionals huge stress. But court users generally felt that for uncontested matters, or case management hearings \u2013 where judges and parties discuss how the main hearing will be conducted \u2013 remote courts can, in principle, operate fairly. Urgent applications for removal of&nbsp;children relating to immediate safeguarding concerns, while far from ideal, would also, it was felt, need to go ahead.&nbsp;In April there were <a href=\"https://www.cafcass.gov.uk/about-cafcass/research-and-data/public-law-data/\">1,374 applications to take children into care in England</a>, slightly down on the same month in 2019 and 2018.</p> <p>There are currently more than <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/850306/Children_looked_after_in_England_2019_Text.pdf\">78,000 children in state care</a>, living in residential care homes or with foster carers. Harker says some of her fears about those children\u2019s lack of physical contact time with birth families during lockdown have been somewhat eased. \u201cWith lockdown and contact centres closed, and complete chaos as professionals scrabbled around, our initial concern was that contact would stop completely,\u201d she says. \u201cSo what was encouraging was that our <a href=\"https://www.nuffieldfjo.org.uk/coronavirus-family-justice-system/managing-family-contact\">research</a> shows there have been attempts to keep children in touch with their families though digital means.\u201d</p> <p>And for teenagers, she points out, digital contact can be more natural and normal.&nbsp;\u201cSome social workers and foster carers have [perhaps] been too reticent about digital contact. That\u2019s not saying it should replace face-to-face [meetings], but children go through phases, and there is maybe something about the ease and the less intense sense of checking in on a more regular basis.\u201d</p> <p>However, Harker believes there needs to be an \u201curgent focus\u201d in government and among child protection professionals on the negative impact of lockdown on younger children and infants. \u201cIt needs to be a national conversation because digital contact for very young children \u2013 and particularly for babies \u2013 is not meaningful in any sense. So we have to think about balancing the health risks against the psychological risks for children who are not living with their families.

Under Spain\u2019s staggered lockdown loosening rules, from 11 May the parish priest of Sant Miquel de Deltebre-La Cava in Catalonia has been able to hold masses for a third of his parishioners. Since 25 May, half may come in.</p> \n<h2>Lessons for everyone</h2> \n<p>But during the peak of one of Europe\u2019s strictest lockdowns, Guerola resorted to less orthodox pastoral methods.</p> \n<p>In Holy Week, the 42-year-old clambered aboard a flatbed truck decked out with a huge picture of Jesus, a loudspeaker and a makeshift altar to deliver mobile blessings. \u201cPeople couldn\u2019t come to church on Holy Thursday, so I took the blessed sacrament to them,\u201d he says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c18744941cfcfdb33e3e8200da342dc45cd2f9e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c18744941cfcfdb33e3e8200da342dc45cd2f9e/151_248_2128_1277/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Father Joan Guerola offers blessings from a flatbed truck in in Deltebre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Father Joan Guerola offers blessings from a flatbed truck in in Deltebre.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The past two months have entailed other significant, if less dramatic, changes. Masses have been broadcast on YouTube or Facebook. But technology cannot yet replace physical presence: Guerola has taken communion to old people who have no internet, and tended to the sick and the dying.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhen I\u2019ve had to administer the last rites, instead of anointing with my hands I\u2019ve done it with the little wooden sticks doctors use,\u201d he says. \u201cCommunion has been with gloves and a mask. The main thing has just been being there.\u201d</p> \n<p>The past few months, he believes, have offered lessons to everyone, whatever their beliefs \u2013 or lack of them. \u201cI think this has shown you should live life day-by-day,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a reminder never to put off till tomorrow what you can do today. You never know how things could turn out.\u201d</p> \n<p>On the Danish island of Fyn, lockdown came so fast on 12 March that Claire Astley, a primary school teacher whose father is English, had no time to even say goodbye to her classes. Her last two pupils returned last week, marking the end of a long journey back to a new normality.</p> \n<p>When a batch of chicks hatched in the incubator at the back of Astley\u2019s classroom, two went straight to 10-year-olds with a parent in a risk group. \u201cThey each have a friend they can share a chick with,\u201d she explains. \u201cThey can only touch one other person, because they have to be careful.\u201d</p> \n<p>The return of those final two pupils \u2013 only made possible by their parents isolating from them at home \u2013 came a full five weeks after most of the rest of their classmates were among the first of Europe\u2019s pupils to go back to school, on 15 April.</p> \n<p>Lockdown, by contrast, happened disturbingly fast, from one day to the next. \u201cWe started with having Zoom meetings just once a week, because nobody knew how to use it,\u201d says Astley.</p> \n<h2>Stressful and exhausting</h2> \n<p>But while the school is now back, its half-day regime is one of many changes. Instead of moving between three classes, Astley has just one shared 24-pupil group. Half sit in the assembly room and half in the classroom, enabling two metres between desks. Teachers meet to plan online, despite being in adjacent classrooms.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84a62b6046fcc6f156f85f84ca13cc68c0440962\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84a62b6046fcc6f156f85f84ca13cc68c0440962/0_0_3264_1592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Claire Astley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"488\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claire Astley: \u2018It\u2019s a very strange feeling.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Orange</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very strange feeling,\u201d Astley said. \u201cBeing with people, but not being able to be \u2018there\u2019, you know?

      "body": "<p>Writing from a Birmingham jail, Martin Luther King Jr famously told his anxious fellow clergymen that his non-violent protests would force those in power to negotiate for racial justice. \u201cThe time is always ripe to do right,\u201d he wrote.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>On an early summer evening, two generations later, Donald Trump walked out of the White House, where he\u2019d been hiding in a bunker. Military police had just fired teargas and flash grenades at peaceful protesters to clear his path, so that he could wave a Bible in front of a boarded church.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>For Trump, the time is always ripe to throw kerosene on his own dumpster fire.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In the week since George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police officers, Trump has watched and tweeted helplessly as the nation he pretends to lead has reached its breaking point. After decades of supposedly legal police beatings and murders, the protests have swept America\u2019s cities more quickly than even coronavirus.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>This is no coincidence of timing. In other crises, in other eras, there have been presidents who understood their most basic duty: to calm the violence and protect the people. In this crisis, however, we have a president who built his entire political career as a gold-painted tower to incite violence.</p> \n<p>We were <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/peter-thiel-perfectly-summed-up-donald-trump-in-one-paragraph.html\">told</a>, by Trump\u2019s supporters four years ago, that we should have taken him seriously but not literally. As it happened, it was entirely appropriate to take him literally, as a serious threat to the rule of law.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-riots-violence-damage-property-police-brutality\">As the George Floyd protests continue, let's be clear where the violence is coming from | Rebecca Solnit</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>During his 2016 campaign, he encouraged his supporters to assault protesters. \u201cKnock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously, OK,\u201d he <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/back-trump-comments-perceived-encouraging-violence/story?id=48415766\">said</a> on the day of the Iowa caucuses. \u201cI promise you I will pay for the legal fees.\u201d Later in Las Vegas, he said the security guards were too gentle with another protester. \u201cI\u2019d like to punch him in the face,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/feb/23/donald-trump-says-hed-like-to-punch-protester-at-nevada-rally-video\">said</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Sure enough, a protester was <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-rally-videos-show-protester-punched/story?id=37551524\">sucker-punched</a> on his way out of a rally the following month.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>No wonder Trump was <a href=\"https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article147677504.html\">sued</a> for incitement to riot by three protesters who were assaulted as they left one of his rallies in Kentucky. The case ultimately failed, but only after a judge <a href=\"https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/2017/04/01/judge-lawsuiit-against-trump-supporters-can-proceed/99906880/\">ruled</a> that Trump recklessly incited violence against an African American woman by a crowd that included known members of hate groups.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>So when he stood, as president, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/28/donald-trump-police-long-island-speech\">told</a> a crowd of police officers to be violent with arrested citizens, it wasn\u2019t some weird joke or misstatement, no matter what his aides claimed afterwards. \u201cWhen you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see \u2019em thrown in, rough, I said, \u2018Please don\u2019t be too nice.\u2019&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cI have to tell you, you know, the laws are so horrendously stacked against us, because for years and years, they\u2019ve been made to protect the criminal,\u201d he added. \u201cTotally made to protect the criminal. Not the officers. You do something wrong, you\u2019re in more jeopardy than they are.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eefab163-d48b-4863-a7bd-2b1286e7c322\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/klPeYrlInZQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump was happily inciting police violence a year after charges were <a href=\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/crime/bs-md-ci-miller-pretrial-motions-20160727-story.html\">dropped</a> against several Baltimore officers who somehow allowed Freddie Gray to die of severe neck injuries in the back of their paddy wagon.</p> \n<p>Then again, Trump took out a full-page ad calling for the death penalty for the five boys and young men wrongfully arrested as the Central Park Five in 1989. Just last year he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/nyregion/central-park-five-trump.html\">refused</a> to apologise for his racist incitement in that case.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Trump can no more end today\u2019s violence than he can manage a pandemic that has killed more than 100,000 Americans, or create the jobs that will rescue more than 40 million unemployed.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Faced with a threefold crisis of racial, health and economic disasters, we have a three-year-old in the Oval Office.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Our get-tough president started his day by telling the nation\u2019s governors that the world was laughing at them \u2013 a recurring nightmare that he loves to project on to everyone else.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cYou have to dominate or you\u2019ll look like a bunch of jerks,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/01/politics/donald-trump-race-police/index.html\">declared</a>, speaking as something of a world-class jerk. \u201cYou have to arrest and try people,\u201d he said of the protesters that he called \u201cterrorists\u201d.</p> \n<p>One of the Democratic governor-jerks decided to draw the line at Trump\u2019s rhetoric. \u201cI need to say that people are feeling real pain out there and we\u2019ve got to have national leadership in calling for calm and making sure that we\u2019re addressing the concerns of the legitimate peaceful protesters,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/chicago-politics/pritzker-criticizes-trump-over-inflammatory-rhetoric-in-call-with-governors/2281936/\">said</a> JB Pritzker of Illinois, during a conference call between the president and state governors. \u201cThat will help us to bring order.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cOK well thank you very much, JB,\u201d our infant-in-chief reportedly responded. \u201cI don\u2019t like your rhetoric much either because I watched it with respect to the coronavirus, and I don\u2019t like your rhetoric much either. I think you could\u2019ve done a much better job, frankly.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Yeah. And he probably smells too.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Later in the day, Trump demonstrated to the world that he had learned precisely nothing in his three and a half years in charge of the world\u2019s most diverse nation.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cI am your president of law and order,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/trump-george-floyd-protests-military-deploy\">said</a> in the Rose Garden, as thousands of Americans protested against the nation\u2019s agents of law and order. Trump said he would mobilise \u201call available federal resources, civilian and military, to stop the rioting and looting\u201d to protect \u201cyour second amendment rights\u201d.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>If you\u2019ve missed all the protesters seizing weapons from NRA members, you\u2019re not alone. That last bit was a call to arms for every vigilante to escalate the violence. We have somehow devolved from dog whistle to foghorn politics.</p> \n<p>There is no end of Republican arsonists who have happily torched their lifelong support for states\u2019 rights and their diehard opposition to an all-powerful central government.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Senator Tom Cotton from Arkansas <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TomCottonAR/status/1267448171636174848\">tweeted</a> that the protesters \u2013 he prefers to call them terrorists \u2013 should face combat troops on American streets. \u201cLet\u2019s see how tough these Antifa terrorists are when they\u2019re facing off with the 101st Airborne Division,\u201d he wrote of the Screaming Eagles, who actually killed real fascists in the D-Day landings.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Never mind the actual law of the land that expressly <a href=\"https://www.northcom.mil/Newsroom/Fact-Sheets/Article-View/Article/563993/the-posse-comitatus-act/\">prohibits</a> the US military from domestic law enforcement, unless a state governor requests it.&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d14b7887-7d31-4026-9de8-038d512039f2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b2Mdnx1VxBg?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>This is a president that cannot decide if he\u2019s serious about shooting looters and protesters or just warning that they might get accidentally shot. \u201cIt was spoken as a fact, not as a statement,\u201d Trump helpfully <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266434155543506945\">explained</a> on Friday, before spending the weekend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266711223657205763\">threatening</a> them with \u201cvicious dogs\u201d and \u201cominous weapons\u201d.</p> \n<p>That was a day before he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1266850922845659143\">said</a> his administration \u201cwill always stand against violence, mayhem and disorder\u201d.</p> \n<p>Confused? That\u2019s the point of this endlessly corrupted story where the aggressor is a peace-loving victim, and the victim is a hateful aggressor.</p> \n<p>When he wrote his legendary letter, King was sitting in jail after marching in defiance of a ban against anti-segregation protests. The man who is now a national icon was jailed just one month before the city\u2019s police chief set fire hoses and dogs on children who were also defying the ban.</p> \n<p>\u201cMore and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of good will,\u201d King wrote. \u201cWe will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump has used his time in the White House far more effectively than anyone could have imagined. He ignored the dead and dying in Puerto Rico and brutalised the children at the border. He ignored the dead and dying in the pandemic and wants to brutalise the protesters in our cities.</p> \n<p>In five months, the good people can end both his hateful words and their own appalling silence.</p> \n<p>\u2022 <em>Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

      "bodyText": "Writing from a Birmingham jail, Martin Luther King Jr famously told his anxious fellow clergymen that his non-violent protests would force those in power to negotiate for racial justice. \u201cThe time is always ripe to do right,\u201d he wrote. On an early summer evening, two generations later, Donald Trump walked out of the White House, where he\u2019d been hiding in a bunker. Military police had just fired teargas and flash grenades at peaceful protesters to clear his path, so that he could wave a Bible in front of a boarded church. For Trump, the time is always ripe to throw kerosene on his own dumpster fire. In the week since George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police officers, Trump has watched and tweeted helplessly as the nation he pretends to lead has reached its breaking point. After decades of supposedly legal police beatings and murders, the protests have swept America\u2019s cities more quickly than even coronavirus. This is no coincidence of timing. In other crises, in other eras, there have been presidents who understood their most basic duty: to calm the violence and protect the people. In this crisis, however, we have a president who built his entire political career as a gold-painted tower to incite violence. We were told, by Trump\u2019s supporters four years ago, that we should have taken him seriously but not literally. As it happened, it was entirely appropriate to take him literally, as a serious threat to the rule of law. During his 2016 campaign, he encouraged his supporters to assault protesters. \u201cKnock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously, OK,\u201d he said on the day of the Iowa caucuses. \u201cI promise you I will pay for the legal fees.\u201d Later in Las Vegas, he said the security guards were too gentle with another protester. \u201cI\u2019d like to punch him in the face,\u201d he said. Sure enough, a protester was sucker-punched on his way out of a rally the following month. No wonder Trump was sued for incitement to riot by three protesters who were assaulted as they left one of his rallies in Kentucky. The case ultimately failed, but only after a judge ruled that Trump recklessly incited violence against an African American woman by a crowd that included known members of hate groups. So when he stood, as president, and told a crowd of police officers to be violent with arrested citizens, it wasn\u2019t some weird joke or misstatement, no matter what his aides claimed afterwards. \u201cWhen you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see \u2019em thrown in, rough, I said, \u2018Please don\u2019t be too nice.\u2019 \u201cI have to tell you, you know, the laws are so horrendously stacked against us, because for years and years, they\u2019ve been made to protect the criminal,\u201d he added. \u201cTotally made to protect the criminal. Not the officers. You do something wrong, you\u2019re in more jeopardy than they are.\u201d Trump was happily inciting police violence a year after charges were dropped against several Baltimore officers who somehow allowed Freddie Gray to die of severe neck injuries in the back of their paddy wagon. Then again, Trump took out a full-page ad calling for the death penalty for the five boys and young men wrongfully arrested as the Central Park Five in 1989. Just last year he refused to apologise for his racist incitement in that case. Trump can no more end today\u2019s violence than he can manage a pandemic that has killed more than 100,000 Americans, or create the jobs that will rescue more than 40 million unemployed. Faced with a threefold crisis of racial, health and economic disasters, we have a three-year-old in the Oval Office. Our get-tough president started his day by telling the nation\u2019s governors that the world was laughing at them \u2013 a recurring nightmare that he loves to project on to everyone else. \u201cYou have to dominate or you\u2019ll look like a bunch of jerks,\u201d he declared, speaking as something of a world-class jerk. \u201cYou have to arrest and try people,\u201d he said of the protesters that he called \u201cterrorists\u201d. One of the Democratic governor-jerks decided to draw the line at Trump\u2019s rhetoric. \u201cI need to say that people are feeling real pain out there and we\u2019ve got to have national leadership in calling for calm and making sure that we\u2019re addressing the concerns of the legitimate peaceful protesters,\u201d said JB Pritzker of Illinois, during a conference call between the president and state governors. \u201cThat will help us to bring order.\u201d \u201cOK well thank you very much, JB,\u201d our infant-in-chief reportedly responded. \u201cI don\u2019t like your rhetoric much either because I watched it with respect to the coronavirus, and I don\u2019t like your rhetoric much either. I think you could\u2019ve done a much better job, frankly.\u201d Yeah. And he probably smells too. Later in the day, Trump demonstrated to the world that he had learned precisely nothing in his three and a half years in charge of the world\u2019s most diverse nation. \u201cI am your president of law and order,\u201d he said in the Rose Garden, as thousands of Americans protested against the nation\u2019s agents of law and order. Trump said he would mobilise \u201call available federal resources, civilian and military, to stop the rioting and looting\u201d to protect \u201cyour second amendment rights\u201d. If you\u2019ve missed all the protesters seizing weapons from NRA members, you\u2019re not alone. That last bit was a call to arms for every vigilante to escalate the violence. We have somehow devolved from dog whistle to foghorn politics. There is no end of Republican arsonists who have happily torched their lifelong support for states\u2019 rights and their diehard opposition to an all-powerful central government. Senator Tom Cotton from Arkansas tweeted that the protesters \u2013 he prefers to call them terrorists \u2013 should face combat troops on American streets. \u201cLet\u2019s see how tough these Antifa terrorists are when they\u2019re facing off with the 101st Airborne Division,\u201d he wrote of the Screaming Eagles, who actually killed real fascists in the D-Day landings. Never mind the actual law of the land that expressly prohibits the US military from domestic law enforcement, unless a state governor requests it. This is a president that cannot decide if he\u2019s serious about shooting looters and protesters or just warning that they might get accidentally shot. \u201cIt was spoken as a fact, not as a statement,\u201d Trump helpfully explained on Friday, before spending the weekend threatening them with \u201cvicious dogs\u201d and \u201cominous weapons\u201d. That was a day before he said his administration \u201cwill always stand against violence, mayhem and disorder\u201d. Confused? That\u2019s the point of this endlessly corrupted story where the aggressor is a peace-loving victim, and the victim is a hateful aggressor. When he wrote his legendary letter, King was sitting in jail after marching in defiance of a ban against anti-segregation protests. The man who is now a national icon was jailed just one month before the city\u2019s police chief set fire hoses and dogs on children who were also defying the ban. \u201cMore and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of good will,\u201d King wrote. \u201cWe will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people.\u201d Trump has used his time in the White House far more effectively than anyone could have imagined. He ignored the dead and dying in Puerto Rico and brutalised the children at the border. He ignored the dead and dying in the pandemic and wants to brutalise the protesters in our cities. In five months, the good people can end both his hateful words and their own appalling silence. \u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

      "bodyText": "The two remaining contenders to buy stricken airline Virgin Australia now face a race against time to secure a binding deal \u2013 and potentially a government bailout \u2013 before the end of the month. On Tuesday Virgin Australia\u2019s administrators, partners at accounting firm Deloitte, said they wanted to receive binding bids from US private equity group Bain Capital and investment group Cyrus Capital Partners. The two were among five groups that on Friday lodged non-binding bids for the airline, which collapsed beneath a $6.8bn pile of debt in April after being paralysed by the coronavirus crisis. Crucial to creditor approval will be the attitude of unions keen to preserve as many as possible of the 10,000 jobs at Virgin Australia. Unions are largely hostile towards Bain, which has a history in the United States of hostility towards organised labour. Cyrus Capital, which is closely linked to the owner of the Virgin brand, billionaire Richard Branson, is likely to be a more attractive option to unions because it has committed to making sure the Australian airline remains a full-service airline. However, it too plans cuts to services, in line with a plan prepared by the Virgin Australia chief executive Paul Scurrah before the coronavirus pandemic. Unions will meet with administrators on Wednesday with a view to beginning talks with the two shortlisted bidders this week. Before negotiating with labour, the shortlisted bidders will also have to attempt to strike a deal with aircraft leasing companies, financiers and bondholders owed billions of dollars \u2013 all of whom will need to take a hefty haircut if the airline is to fly again. Sources said one key problem was that the airline flies too many different types of planes, which makes some routes inefficient. The administrator Vaughan Strawbridge said he wanted to conclude a sale by 30 June. The airline is likely to run out of cash by that time and Strawbridge has previously said the airline will need \u201cinterim funding\u201d to get it through a gap, estimated at between four to six weeks, before creditors can approve any deal at a meeting. Strawbridge said he had been discussing options with the government, which has so far given no indication of whether it is willing to fund Virgin through the gap. Michael Kaine, the national secretary of the biggest union at Virgin Australia, the Transport Workers Union, repeated his pleas for a government lifeline. \u201cThe federal government continues to jeopardise a successful outcome by staying a silent and passive observer rather than assisting the administration process by making clear funding and regulatory commitments to guarantee the future of the airline,\u201d he said. The office of the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has been contacted for comment. Kaine said it was \u201cnow up to the final bidders to show they can follow through on their commitment to ensure the best outcome for the Australian community and Virgin workers\u201d. \u201cThe TWU remains focused on bidders willing to engage constructively with the workforce and its representatives, which are planning to get the fullest possible Virgin back in the sky and which have a strong commitment to staying with the asset for the long term,\u201d he said. Strawbridge said the administrators would \u201cspend the coming weeks facilitating in-depth bidder engagement with the stakeholders of the business and work closely with both preferred bidders in the lead up to binding final offers being received\u201d. He left the door open for exiled potential purchasers to re-enter the race \u2013 or for new contenders to join the process. BGH Capital, Brookfield Asset Management and Indigo Partners also made bids last week. \u201cThere will also be speculation that entities associated with the parties that have not moved into this next phase, as well as others, could become involved in some capacity with the remaining parties,\u201d Strawbridge said. \u201cThat will, of course, be a matter for them.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Building new solar power projects would generate cheaper electricity than running most of the world\u2019s existing coal power plants, according to a global renewable energy report. New figures have revealed that more than half of the world\u2019s coal plants could be undercut by the falling cost of new large-scale solar projects, which are now more than 80% cheaper to build than in 2010. The International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) has found that up to 1,200 gigawatts of the world\u2019s existing coal capacity could cost more to run than the cost of new utility-scale solar plants. If energy companies replaced only their most expensive coal plants with new solar power projects or onshore wind farms, totalling 500 GW globally, they could save up to $23bn (\u00a318bn) every year and wipe out 5% of last year\u2019s total global carbon emissions, according to Irena. This global renewable energy boom would also stimulate $940bn in investment, or the equivalent of 1% of global GDP, as the world emerges from the economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis. Francesco La Camera, the director-general of Irena, said renewable energy is \u201cincreasingly the cheapest source of new electricity\u201d and offers \u201ctremendous potential to stimulate the global economy and get people back to work\u201d. In under a decade the cost of large-scale solar power has fallen by more than 80% while onshore wind has fallen by almost 40% and offshore wind has declined by almost 30%. Irena\u2019s latest figures have revealed that costs are continuing to fall. The cost of large-scale solar power fell 13% last year to a global average of 6.8 US cents per kilowatt hour, while onshore and offshore wind costs both fell by about 9% to 5.3 cents per kWh and 11.5 cents per kWh respectively. \u201cRenewable investments are stable, cost-effective and attractive, offering consistent and predictable returns while delivering benefits to the wider economy.

      "body": "<p>It is a strange feeling to be sick in a pandemic. I don\u2019t just mean for the ones who fall ill from the virus. I mean the rest of us. Those who were ill long before \u201ccoronavirus\u201d entered the vocabulary, who got sick and stir-crazy when it wasn\u2019t headline news. Suddenly, everyone is experiencing what those of us with chronic illness have long been familiar with: the urge to break out after being trapped inside for months \u2013 and the quiet nerves about doing it.</p> <p>Chronically ill people are the experts in this strange new world. We are well aware the human body is not an impenetrable beast, that immune systems are fragile, that nerve endings can sting,&nbsp;that lungs can struggle to gasp for air.&nbsp;We are also used to isolation: the mind-numbing boredom of the 26th Friday without going to the pub, and the unrivalled joy of the first overpriced gin afterwards.</p> <p>I have not left the house for nine months, and it is more than two years since I became largely housebound.&nbsp;I hate that word. \u201cHousebound\u201d. As if you were an inanimate object, tied to the back gate. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/28/uk-doctors-braced-for-winter-flu-outbreak\">The&nbsp;bad winter flu of 2017</a>&nbsp;combined with what I\u2019ll call some D-grade genetics and I developed a kind of post-viral fatigue.&nbsp;I\u2019d like to downplay it for laughs, but ventilators are hard to make jokes about.&nbsp;I couldn\u2019t breathe, could barely move; every muscle hurt.&nbsp;It would have been easier to have been hit by a truck, rather than just feel like it. At least I would have had a good story. But as the world is learning, viruses can be \u2013 what\u2019s the medical term? \u2013 total bastards. I became housebound. The word doesn\u2019t matter. The result is the same.&nbsp;</p> <p>As lockdown slowly eases, I have found myself thinking about what it is to leave the house after a long spell inside. The rest of the public will, in time, find themselves in a bizarre wonderland: visiting a friend\u2019s house again, getting on a train, sitting in a bar.&nbsp;These are the firsts that are not actually firsts, the new experiences you have had a thousand times before. It would be natural if you were feeling anxious. Isolation is hard going, but then so is escaping it.&nbsp;</p> <p>I\u2019ve been through that particular looking glass myself.&nbsp;When I fell ill, life in every normal way stopped. There was no going out. No inviting people in. Just bed, and my thoughts. Luckily I am fascinating, but there are limits to even my internal chat. Months pass, the pain and exhaustion hum, and&nbsp;life as you know it has fallen in on itself.&nbsp;Eventually, it is a&nbsp;Thursday night, though you have lost all knowledge of what day it is, and&nbsp;you find yourself working out how many tiny cracks there are on the walls. It is&nbsp;3am;&nbsp;you think of the last time you sat in a restaurant and wonder if you ever will again.&nbsp;</p> <p>I don\u2019t know if it was growing up with a disability, but I was always the sort of person to appreciate the everyday moments. I looked at the water as the Thames rippled in the evening light. I paused to laugh as a mate danced drunk in the road (do not try this). Stuck at home, I became grateful for that, as if each frame was safely banked and the memories could be replayed on a loop.&nbsp;</p> <p>When you are a child, they say television restricts your mind. But when you are ill, it opens it. Watching hours of&nbsp;the Tour de France inside four walls, I was out of bed and soaring over the sky-blue Alps. Dozing through the London marathon, I was back at work wading through the noise of the city. With Springwatch, I was in the park listening to the birds sing.&nbsp;</p> <p>Still, I ached for the world. I missed people: the arms of those I knew and crowds of those I didn\u2019t. I missed nights out: eating food someone else had cooked, the smell of cigarettes as we huddled next to a garden heater.&nbsp;I missed getting ready to go out as much as being out: putting on an uncomfortable bra and the way mascara smells when it sets.&nbsp;I even missed trains: the freedom of the tracks, the possibility of a departure board.&nbsp;</p> <p>A few months in, I&nbsp;began to collect photos. Photos of people I loved.&nbsp;The places I used to go; the carefree smiles and the towering buildings. Instagram squares printed and hung on a grid.&nbsp;It was my own&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/monica-lewinsky-among-thousands-to-share-last-normal-photo\">#lastnormalphoto</a>&nbsp;hashtag, except for my eyes only. When I had started to recover enough to go outside a little, I would take a photo of myself each time. At work. At the park. To prove to myself I had been there. I had done that. The trees were not a figment of my imagination. My lungs had breathed the air. I had been myself, at least for a while.

      "bodyText": "It is a strange feeling to be sick in a pandemic. I don\u2019t just mean for the ones who fall ill from the virus. I mean the rest of us. Those who were ill long before \u201ccoronavirus\u201d entered the vocabulary, who got sick and stir-crazy when it wasn\u2019t headline news. Suddenly, everyone is experiencing what those of us with chronic illness have long been familiar with: the urge to break out after being trapped inside for months \u2013 and the quiet nerves about doing it. Chronically ill people are the experts in this strange new world. We are well aware the human body is not an impenetrable beast, that immune systems are fragile, that nerve endings can sting, that lungs can struggle to gasp for air. We are also used to isolation: the mind-numbing boredom of the 26th Friday without going to the pub, and the unrivalled joy of the first overpriced gin afterwards. I have not left the house for nine months, and it is more than two years since I became largely housebound. I hate that word. \u201cHousebound\u201d. As if you were an inanimate object, tied to the back gate. The bad winter flu of 2017 combined with what I\u2019ll call some D-grade genetics and I developed a kind of post-viral fatigue. I\u2019d like to downplay it for laughs, but ventilators are hard to make jokes about. I couldn\u2019t breathe, could barely move; every muscle hurt. It would have been easier to have been hit by a truck, rather than just feel like it. At least I would have had a good story. But as the world is learning, viruses can be \u2013 what\u2019s the medical term? \u2013 total bastards. I became housebound. The word doesn\u2019t matter. The result is the same. As lockdown slowly eases, I have found myself thinking about what it is to leave the house after a long spell inside. The rest of the public will, in time, find themselves in a bizarre wonderland: visiting a friend\u2019s house again, getting on a train, sitting in a bar. These are the firsts that are not actually firsts, the new experiences you have had a thousand times before. It would be natural if you were feeling anxious. Isolation is hard going, but then so is escaping it. I\u2019ve been through that particular looking glass myself. When I fell ill, life in every normal way stopped. There was no going out. No inviting people in. Just bed, and my thoughts. Luckily I am fascinating, but there are limits to even my internal chat. Months pass, the pain and exhaustion hum, and life as you know it has fallen in on itself. Eventually, it is a Thursday night, though you have lost all knowledge of what day it is, and you find yourself working out how many tiny cracks there are on the walls. It is 3am; you think of the last time you sat in a restaurant and wonder if you ever will again. I don\u2019t know if it was growing up with a disability, but I was always the sort of person to appreciate the everyday moments. I looked at the water as the Thames rippled in the evening light. I paused to laugh as a mate danced drunk in the road (do not try this). Stuck at home, I became grateful for that, as if each frame was safely banked and the memories could be replayed on a loop. When you are a child, they say television restricts your mind. But when you are ill, it opens it. Watching hours of the Tour de France inside four walls, I was out of bed and soaring over the sky-blue Alps. Dozing through the London marathon, I was back at work wading through the noise of the city. With Springwatch, I was in the park listening to the birds sing. Still, I ached for the world. I missed people: the arms of those I knew and crowds of those I didn\u2019t. I missed nights out: eating food someone else had cooked, the smell of cigarettes as we huddled next to a garden heater. I missed getting ready to go out as much as being out: putting on an uncomfortable bra and the way mascara smells when it sets. I even missed trains: the freedom of the tracks, the possibility of a departure board. A few months in, I began to collect photos. Photos of people I loved. The places I used to go; the carefree smiles and the towering buildings. Instagram squares printed and hung on a grid. It was my own #lastnormalphoto hashtag, except for my eyes only. When I had started to recover enough to go outside a little, I would take a photo of myself each time. At work. At the park. To prove to myself I had been there. I had done that. The trees were not a figment of my imagination. My lungs had breathed the air. I had been myself, at least for a while. I call this the narcissistic phase. The first time I saw outside again was to go to the hairdresser, which in retrospect seems apt for where we are now. It had been five months since I had fallen ill and my hair had carried on, even when I had stopped. It hadn\u2019t occurred to me to try a lockdown-style home cut and I resembled a pasty Rapunzel. When your body has denied you the chance to take the mundane excursions most people do every day, having that opportunity again feels electrifying. In the spring air, the blossom unfurled and lined the streets with pink. Chunks of blond hair dropped to the floor, the smell of perming solution in the air. Manoeuvring through the streets to go back home, I fixed on the surroundings. The paths lined with blooming trees, the strangers carrying the weekly shop. It felt like a scene from that 90s Brendan Fraser film where the time-travelling caveman sees cars for the first time. Wonder mixed with terror. There is a feeling, somewhere between walking through your front door and reaching Superdrug, when your brain wants to protect you from the outside world.

      "bodyText": "The UK government has insisted plans to quarantine travellers for 14 days will go ahead for a \u201ctemporary, time-limited\u201d period, despite signs No 10 is increasingly favouring the option of \u201cair bridges\u201d with low-risk countries. Simon Clarke, a local government minister, said the moves to impose a quarantine were essential to stop the risk of new imported cases of coronavirus as the UK\u2019s infection rate came down. The MP told BBC Breakfast: \u201cThis is a temporary, time-limited measure to make sure that we avoid that risk manifesting itself. \u201cIt is very clear that as of Monday 8 June a two-week quarantine is in place for people coming into the UK from abroad and that needs to be understood very clearly. \u201cIt will obviously depend on progress and we all want these restrictions to be lifted as soon as it\u2019s safe to do so.\u201d However, a Conservative backbench rebellion has prompted Downing Street to think again about bringing in air bridges \u2013 reciprocal arrangements with some countries that have a low rate of infection. One sticking point is that some countries will not want to strike an agreement with the UK when its death and new infection rate is still relatively high, but a few such as France have indicated they would be willing to do a deal that could allow some travel to continue. Clarke refused to comment on the idea of moving from a quarantine policy to air bridges but suggested it could be one of the \u201coptions\u201d for replacing it with less draconian measures in time. Asked about the idea of air bridges, Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman said on Monday: \u201cWe\u2019ve said it\u2019s something that we\u2019re looking at, and that remains the case.\u201d Under the new rules, from next Monday tens of thousands of new arrivals to the UK will be able to go food shopping, change accommodation and use public transport from airports during a 14-day quarantine imposed to prevent a second wave of coronavirus. About a fifth of people are expected to receive a spot-check to ensure that they are staying at the address or addresses they have provided to the authorities, but enforcement of the quarantine will be limited. The rules, still being finalised and due to be published on Tuesday before coming into effect next week, have prompted cross-party concerns about the potentially limited impact on public health amid warnings of the severe damage that could be caused to the travel and aviation industry. Former transport minister Stephen Hammond called again on Tuesday for the plan to be scrapped. The Tory MP told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that air bridges would be a \u201csensible, targeted response\u201d between low-risk countries. \u201cI think the idea of air bridges are the right way forward,\u201d he added. \u201cI think, as we\u2019ve seen across the world, people are taking measures out of the lockdown and this targeted approach would be a much more sensible way to behave.\u201d Henry Smith, the Crawley MP whose constituency covers Gatwick airport, also said he hoped the quarantine measures could be short-lived. \u201cIn practical terms, making sure this quarantine is reviewed in the next few weeks with a view to hopefully being dropped by 1 July is probably the most practical way forward,\u201d he told the BBC. Smith, who is heading a cross-party group of several dozen MPs opposing the plans, previously told the Guardian the exemptions under the draft rules meant the quarantine proposals made even less sense. \u201cIt really feels like it will bring limited public health benefit for a lot of economic pain,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were already some absurdities to the idea, like backdoor routes, so you could fly to Dublin, go Dublin to London, and then not be checked.\u201d",

There\u2019s plastic barriers, creating one-lane aisles so that you minimize cross traffic. Limited seating and doing away with as many shared touch points \u2013 menus, getting your check, opening doors, the POS system, the salt and pepper shakers on the tables. Self-service? All gone.

How might social distancing requirements affect a restaurant\u2019s bottom line?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rose: </strong>The number of seats in a restaurant is one of the most foundational, fundamental metrics that\u2019s used in determining how much money the restaurant is able to generate. Cutting the number of seats in a restaurant is devastating, and this is why restaurants are pivoting almost instantaneously to see if they can go to a delivery model and pick-up model to create another revenue stream.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Max Hardy:</strong> I\u2019m just always about what\u2019s beneficial for your bottom line. Mannequins don\u2019t really help the bottom line.&nbsp;[Instead] we\u2019ll rely heavily on reservations, so every two hours I\u2019m hitting that minimum capacity, that capacity to make it beneficial, and I know that I won\u2019t be over-prepping.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What will the restaurant experience be like as restrictions are eased?</strong></p> <p><strong>Kristel Arabian:</strong>&nbsp;What I\u2019ve been hearing is patrons will wear masks until they need to take them off to eat. Some of the more thoughtful operators are thinking of providing paper envelopes to keep them safe, because they don\u2019t want the mask touching the table. We will no longer be handing things to people, we will be putting things down on the table. The host is not going to be a host any more. There\u2019s going to be more of a \u201csafety captain\u201d position instead, someone who greets you at the door. There aren\u2019t going to be any walk-ins. You can\u2019t just show up. Some restaurants are even talking about locking the doors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Could outdoor dining spaces be beneficial, especially with growing evidence that it is safer to not be in enclosed spaces?</strong>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Arabian: </strong>We\u2019re hearing that natural airflow really helps. Everyone is wanting to limit their time indoors in public places. Los Angeles is working on expanding outdoor eating on sidewalks. Other cities,&nbsp;like Washington DC, have shut down really popular streets, they\u2019ve turned them into a promenade, so that people can have distanced eating.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>What are some of the changes in procedures being implemented for restaurant staff?</strong>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Rose: </strong>Masks, mandatory hand-washing. We\u2019re seeing that in certain establishments&nbsp;every employee has their temperature taken and basically needs a daily health waiver thing, that basically states \u201cI have not traveled to any coronavirus hotspots in the last 14 days, I haven\u2019t been sick, nobody in my family is sick.\u201d You will also see the restaurant and food business start to talk about marketing their safety programs just as much as they market where their chicken comes from. There will also be new positions created, like the \u201chead of sanitation\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Hardy: </strong>Before I open I want to get all my staff tested to make sure they\u2019re good. We\u2019ve ordered sanitizer kits for every customer that comes in. I\u2019m turning my [point of sale] system to a handheld system, the customer gets handed the handheld system, they can do their own thing, versus the cashier touching it. We\u2019ve got masks, we\u2019re changing our aprons every 15 to 20 minutes, changing our gloves with every order.</p> <p><strong>Are you concerned that diners won\u2019t be ready to dine out even if restaurants are ready to open?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rose: </strong>You\u2019re going to see a lot of people that will want to gently tiptoe back into it, and you\u2019re going to see people who are dying to get out there and sit down at a bar. They\u2019re going to need to wear masks in the restaurants, take it off when their food and drink shows up, and then put the masks back on.&nbsp;If<strong> </strong>it<strong> </strong>allows us to slowly reintroduce one of the most enjoyable things in our lives, and that is dining at a restaurant, a little discomfort isn\u2019t too much to ask for.</p> <p>I hope society sees this and steps up and understands the pressure. When we do reopen at limited capacity with lots of new rules in place, people need to understand why they need to follow the rules.

      "bodyText": "The US restaurant industry employs more than 15 million people and has an economic impact in the trillions, luring Americans to eat out about five times a week.

Some restaurants are even talking about locking the doors. Could outdoor dining spaces be beneficial, especially with growing evidence that it is safer to not be in enclosed spaces? Arabian: We\u2019re hearing that natural airflow really helps. Everyone is wanting to limit their time indoors in public places. Los Angeles is working on expanding outdoor eating on sidewalks. Other cities, like Washington DC, have shut down really popular streets, they\u2019ve turned them into a promenade, so that people can have distanced eating. What are some of the changes in procedures being implemented for restaurant staff? Rose: Masks, mandatory hand-washing. We\u2019re seeing that in certain establishments every employee has their temperature taken and basically needs a daily health waiver thing, that basically states \u201cI have not traveled to any coronavirus hotspots in the last 14 days, I haven\u2019t been sick, nobody in my family is sick.\u201d You will also see the restaurant and food business start to talk about marketing their safety programs just as much as they market where their chicken comes from. There will also be new positions created, like the \u201chead of sanitation\u201d. Hardy: Before I open I want to get all my staff tested to make sure they\u2019re good. We\u2019ve ordered sanitizer kits for every customer that comes in. I\u2019m turning my [point of sale] system to a handheld system, the customer gets handed the handheld system, they can do their own thing, versus the cashier touching it. We\u2019ve got masks, we\u2019re changing our aprons every 15 to 20 minutes, changing our gloves with every order. Are you concerned that diners won\u2019t be ready to dine out even if restaurants are ready to open? Rose: You\u2019re going to see a lot of people that will want to gently tiptoe back into it, and you\u2019re going to see people who are dying to get out there and sit down at a bar. They\u2019re going to need to wear masks in the restaurants, take it off when their food and drink shows up, and then put the masks back on. If it allows us to slowly reintroduce one of the most enjoyable things in our lives, and that is dining at a restaurant, a little discomfort isn\u2019t too much to ask for. I hope society sees this and steps up and understands the pressure. When we do reopen at limited capacity with lots of new rules in place, people need to understand why they need to follow the rules. I hope that people do. Max Hardy is a chef based in Detroit and founder of the River Bistro and Coop Detroit, a fast casual Caribbean fusion restaurant.

      "bodyText": "A Chinese doctor who worked with the whistleblower Li Wenliang in Wuhan died of the virus last week, state media reported on Tuesday, becoming China\u2019s first Covid-19 fatality in weeks. Hu Weifeng, a urologist at Wuhan Central hospital, died on Friday after being treated for Covid-19 and related issues for more than four months, state broadcaster CCTV said. He is the sixth doctor from Wuhan Central hospital to have died from the virus, which emerged in the central Chinese city last year. Wuhan Central hospital has yet to give a formal statement on Hu\u2019s death. In early February, it said 68 staff members had contracted coronavirus. Hu\u2019s condition became a national concern after Chinese media showed images of him with his skin turned black due to liver damage. Fellow doctor Yi Fan showed similar symptoms, but recovered and has since been discharged from hospital. The death of their colleague Li Wenliang in February triggered a national outpouring of grief and rage against the government as he documented his final days on social media. Authorities in Wuhan separately said that city-wide testing of 9.9 million people that began in mid-May found no new cases of Covid-19, and 300 asymptomatic cases. China does not count asymptomatic cases \u2013 meaning people who are infected with the virus but do not exhibit symptoms of the disease \u2013 as confirmed cases. Meanwhile, South Korea is testing a QR code tracing system to track visitors at entertainment venues, restaurants and churches as it battles to contain persistent clusters of infection A church-linked Covid-19 cluster of 40 cases in the Seoul metropolitan area has been the third major flare-up in recent weeks, following more than 250 infections stemming from nightclubs and bars in the capital and at least 112 cases at a logistics centre in Bucheon, west of Seoul. Starting on 10 June, visitors to nightclubs, bars, karaoke clubs, daytime discos, indoor gyms that hold group exercises and indoor standing concert halls will be required to use any of a number of commercially available apps to generate a one-time personalised QR code that can be scanned at the door. The decision to trial the codes came after authorities struggled to trace people in the nightclub outbreak because much of the information on handwritten visitor logs was found to be false or incomplete. While infections from the recent clusters have eased, there are fears of a spike when 1.8 million school students return to class on Wednesday. In Pakistan, the prime minister has defended his decision to lift almost all lockdown measures because of economic losses, as deaths and infections continued to rise. In a televised address, Imran Khan said his government could not afford to continue giving cash handouts to the poor on such a large scale. \u201cOur conditions don\u2019t allow that we keep feeding money to them, how long we can give them money?\u201d he said, adding that about 130 million to 150 million people were adversely affected by the shutdowns. The country would open to tourism but cinemas, theatres and schools would remain closed. Khan urged people to act responsibly but said more infections and deaths were inevitable. \u201cThis virus will spread more. I have to say it with regret that there will be more deaths,\u201d he warned. \u201cIf people do take care they can live with the virus.\u201d New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has said restrictions may be eased again sooner than planned as the country was \u201cahead of schedule\u201d. Cabinet will decide next Monday whether to move to level-1 restrictions \u2013 the most lenient \u2013 two weeks ahead of when the government had planned to make that decision.

This did not apply for the international crew of the film Avatar 2, who were given special permission arrive and begin filming. The director, James Cameron, and 55 members of his crew arrived on a privately chartered plane over the weekend, with many people angered that they were granted an exception. There are fears the increased use of antibiotics to combat the pandemic will strengthen bacterial resistance and ultimately lead to more deaths during the crisis and beyond, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned. The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Monday a \u201cworrying number\u201d of bacterial infections were becoming increasingly resistant to the medicines traditionally used to treat them. In other coronavirus developments: The UK\u2019s death toll from Covid-19 is on the brink of exceeding 50,000, according to the latest official figures, confirming Britain\u2019s status as one of the countries worst hit by the pandemic. The White House coronavirus taskforce member Dr Anthony Fauci has said he has not spoken to Donald Trump for two weeks. It comes as fears mount over the spread of the virus at demonstrations over the death of George Floyd. The World Health Organization has praised the US\u2019s\u201cimmense\u201d and \u201cgenerous\u201d contribution to global health in a push to salvage relations after Trump said he was severing ties. The WHO also said it should have enough information in 24 hours to decide whether to continue its suspension of trials of the antimalarial drug hyrdroxychloroquine against Covid-19. Deaths in Mexico passed 10,000 as the WHO warned that Central and South America had become \u201cintense zones for transmission of this virus\u201d and had not reached their peak in cases. Brazil registered 11,598 additional cases of coronavirus and 623 new deaths on Monday, taking its confirmed cases to 526,447 and deaths to 29,937.

The call was about an invitation to attend the G7, but the PM later contacted the <strong>Australian embassy in Washington </strong>to ask how the country should lodge concern about a <strong>Channel 7 </strong>reporter and a cameraman who were attacked by police during protests in the US capital. </li> \n   <li> The<strong> NSW government </strong>will further ease lockdown restrictions to allow gyms to reopen from<strong> 13 June</strong>. Fitness centres, dance studios, indoor swimming and barre will also be allowed.</li> \n   <li>Hundreds of people have marched through Sydney in a <strong>Black Lives Matter</strong> protest against Indigenous deaths in custody in Australia and against the killing of George Floyd in the US. The event happened hours after a <strong>NSW police officer</strong> was placed on \u201crestricted duties\u201d and an investigation launched into footage that showed him slamming a 16-year-old Indigenous boy face-first onto pavement in Sydney on Monday. </li> \n   <li>The <strong>NSW upper house</strong> has reversed the state government\u2019s controversial 12-month <strong>pay freeze for public servants</strong>. MPs voted to disallow the pay pause for 400,000 workers in the state, which was introduced last week in response to the economic damage wrought by Covid-19.</li> \n   <li>The final two bidders for stricken airline <strong>Virgin Australia</strong> are <strong>Bain Capital </strong>and <strong>Cyrus Capital Partners</strong>, administrators Deloitte say.

set to reveal plans to refund robodebts, a Senate committee has been told, amid criticism the news was held until Friday afternoon.</p> \n  <p>Labor senator <strong>Murray Watt</strong> used the Senate select committee on Covid-19 to quiz department secretary <strong>Kathryn Campbel</strong>l over the handling of the announcement, which the opposition argues was timed late on Friday to avoid scrutiny.</p> \n  <p>Campbell confirmed she had provided advice to ministers in the lead-up to the decision to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/29/robodebt-government-to-repay-470000-unlawful-centrelink-debts-worth-721m\"> repay 470,000 debts</a> that were entirely or partially raised using the discredited \u201cincome-averaging\u201d calculations. </p> \n  <p>Asked when she became aware of the decision to make the refund announcement, Campbell replied: \u201cI think I became aware on Thursday.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But pressed on when the government actually made the decision, she said she would have to take the question on notice.</p> \n  <p>The next part of the questioning could have been straight out of an episode of Yes, Minister. </p> \n  <p>When asked to confirm the decision was made before the prime minister held his national cabinet press conference on Friday, Campbell made a statement of the obvious:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The decision was made before minister Robert made the announcement, senator.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Robert fronted the media at 3.45pm on Friday to announce the refunds would be received by 373,000 people, cost a total $721m and include recovery fee charges.</p> \n  <p>Watt asked Campbell whether in her current or

In April, total hours worked declined by an unprecedented 9% and more than 600,000 people lost their jobs, with many more people working zero hours. Household spending weakened very considerably and investment plans are being deferred or cancelled.</p> \n   <p>Notwithstanding these developments, it is possible that the depth of the downturn will be less than earlier expected. The rate of new infections has declined significantly and some restrictions have been eased earlier than was previously thought likely. And there are signs that hours worked stabilised in early May, after the earlier very sharp decline. There has also been a pick-up in some forms of consumer spending.</p> \n   <p>However, the outlook, including the nature and speed of the expected recovery, remains highly uncertain and the pandemic is likely to have long-lasting effects on the economy. In the period immediately ahead, much will depend on the confidence that people and businesses have about the health situation and their own finances.</p> \n   <p>The substantial, coordinated and unprecedented easing of fiscal and monetary policy in Australia is helping the economy through this difficult period.

Here\u2019s a quick rundown on everything that happened today: The Reserve Bank has left rates at 0.25%, with RBA governor Philip Lowe saying the Covid-19-induced economic downturn may not be as bad as expected. Scott Morrison spoke with Donald Trump about \u201cthe distressing situation\u201d in the United States during a phone call this morning. The call was about an invitation to attend the G7, but the PM later contacted the Australian embassy in Washington to ask how the country should lodge concern about a Channel 7 reporter and a cameraman who were attacked by police during protests in the US capital. The NSW government will further ease lockdown restrictions to allow gyms to reopen from 13 June. Fitness centres, dance studios, indoor swimming and barre will also be allowed. Hundreds of people have marched through Sydney in a Black Lives Matter protest against Indigenous deaths in custody in Australia and against the killing of George Floyd in the US. The event happened hours after a NSW police officer was placed on \u201crestricted duties\u201d and an investigation launched into footage that showed him slamming a 16-year-old Indigenous boy face-first onto pavement in Sydney on Monday. The NSW upper house has reversed the state government\u2019s controversial 12-month pay freeze for public servants. MPs voted to disallow the pay pause for 400,000 workers in the state, which was introduced last week in response to the economic damage wrought by Covid-19. The final two bidders for stricken airline Virgin Australia are Bain Capital and Cyrus Capital Partners, administrators Deloitte say. The two remaining contenders now face a race against time to secure a binding deal \u2013 and potentially a government bailout \u2013 before the end of the month. From me, Elias Visontay, have a great evening. For more on today\u2019s developments surrounding Virgin Australia, my colleague Ben Butler has written this report: The NSW upper house has reversed the state government\u2019s controversial 12-month pay freeze for public servants, AAP reports. MPs voted on Tuesday to disallow the pay pause, which was introduced last week in response to the economic damage wrought by Covid-19. The Berejiklian government had argued the freeze would guarantee jobs for public servants and free up funds for job-creating projects to support others who have lost work. But the wages policy has been opposed by unions and frontline workers including paramedics, nurses, police officers and teachers. Labor MP Adam Searle, who successfully introduced the motion to disallow the pay freeze regulation, said it was an \u201cact of economic vandalism\u201d that would cut the purchasing power of 400,000 workers in the state. From my colleague Justine Landis-Hanley: Some more footage from my colleague Naaman Zhou, who is at the Black Lives Matter solidarity protest in Sydney this evening: The speeches have begun at the protest march in Sydney. Organisers are saying: There have been too many black deaths in this country. And none of them have led to prosecution. The significance of the street we are on today, governor Macquarie ... this is where the genocide started, in Sydney. A young boy in Surry Hills got slammed by police yesterday. It happens so often. It is an Australian problem. We are sick of it. I\u2019m not going to get started on the Channel 9 report, or how little white Australians know about Aboriginal culture. Hundreds of people have marched through Sydney in a Black Lives Matter protest against Indigenous deaths in custody in Australia and against the killing of George Floyd in the US. Protesters are on Macquarie Street outside the New South Wales parliament chanting \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and \u201cAlways was, always will be Aboriginal Land\u201d. Organisers obtained permission from police and the Gadigal Land Council for the protest. With that, I will pass you over to my colleague Elias Visontay. Have a great night. Our reporter Naaman Zhou is in Hyde Park tonight. Earlier today growing calls emerged for an inquiry into robodebt. On the same topic, NSW police are holding a press conference into the incident. NSW police professional standards command are investigating and the officer is on \u201crestricted duties\u201d. Asked if the force used was necessary, NSW assistant commissioner Mick Willing declines to say, arguing \u201cthat is what the investigation is about\u201d. Willing says people are going to \u201cuse this video\u201d for their own agenda. I am concerned people will use this video, footage, to create it into something that it\u2019s not. We\u2019re all well aware of what\u2019s happening overseas. This is not the United States of America. We have very, very good relations with our local community. Asked about the circumstances that led to the incident, he says: I\u2019m advised the officers were attending an unrelated job in the vicinity. They came across the 17-year-old boy and the four others and engaged them in conversation. As your reference, you can listen to the footage yourself and see the footage yourself. There was words exchanged between them, which caused the constable to react, and whether or not that reaction is appropriate is subject to that investigation. Alan Tudge, the population minister, has been asked on the ABC about the video of an Indigenous boy who was slammed into the ground by a police man. He says: From what I can gather from watching the video, the young man did make a threat to the police officer and so the police officer therefore was taking him under arrest, then he kicked his legs from under the ground to facilitate that. Now, from what I understand, there will be an investigation into that, as to what happened. We certainly don\u2019t want to see this incident become bigger than what it is, and that is an individual incident which will be investigated and there will be proper consequences as a result of that investigation. Tudge is reluctant to criticise officer but says the video \u201cdid not look great\u201d and notes it will be investigated. It\u2019s hard to judge from just watching the video as to the precise circumstances and how much of a threat the individual police officer felt. Caroline Edwards, the acting health department secretary, has told the Covid-19 committee there have now been 6,174,008 downloads of the Covidsafe app. Edwards said the department only knew the app had been used when states made assertions publicly \u2013 and she noted Victoria has said it had been used to contact somebody who health authorities otherwise wouldn\u2019t have known about. But many jurisdictions have not had new infections for some time and have had no need to use the app. Asked about reports its range is not working, Edwards replied: The app is operating as expected. It exchanges digital handshakes of people within 1.5m of each other for 15min or more. Edwards said she had \u201cheard nothing but keenness to be involved in the app project\u201d from the states and territories. But health success meant there was \u201cvery little need for this contact tracing aid\u201d at this stage, although if there was a significant further outbreak it would \u201caugment the response\u201d. The final two bidders for stricken airline Virgin Australia are Bain Capital and Cyrus Capital Partners, administrators Deloitte say. Lead administrator Vaughan Strawbridge said: Both Bain Capital and Cyrus Capital Partners are well-funded, have deep aviation experience, and they see real value in the business and its future. We would like to thank all interested parties for the strong interest they have displayed in the business and their commitment to the process over recent weeks. We will now spend the coming weeks facilitating in-depth bidder engagement with the stakeholders of the business and work closely with both preferred bidders in the lead-up to binding final offers being received. Strawbridge said he wanted a binding sale agreement in place by the end of the month. He\u2019ll need one, because he has previously admitted the airline will run out of cash around then. Any deal will then go to creditors for approval. There\u2019s no word on how the gap between the sale agreement and the meeting, which could be as long as six weeks, will be bridged. This is where a government bailout could come in \u2013 but so far transport minister and deputy prime minister Michael McCormack hasn\u2019t indicated there\u2019ll be a cent. The head of the Department of Social Services became aware at least a day beforehand that the government was set to reveal plans to refund robodebts, a Senate committee has been told, amid criticism the news was held until Friday afternoon. Labor senator Murray Watt used the Senate select committee on Covid-19 to quiz department secretary Kathryn Campbell over the handling of the announcement, which the opposition argues was timed late on Friday to avoid scrutiny. Campbell confirmed she had provided advice to ministers in the lead-up to the decision to repay 470,000 debts that were entirely or partially raised using the discredited \u201cincome-averaging\u201d calculations. Asked when she became aware of the decision to make the refund announcement, Campbell replied: \u201cI think I became aware on Thursday.\u201d But pressed on when the government actually made the decision, she said she would have to take the question on notice. The next part of the questioning could have been straight out of an episode of Yes, Minister. When asked to confirm the decision was made before the prime minister held his national cabinet press conference on Friday, Campbell made a statement of the obvious: The decision was made before minister Robert made the announcement, senator. Robert fronted the media at 3.45pm on Friday to announce the refunds would be received by 373,000 people, cost a total $721m and include recovery fee charges. Watt asked Campbell whether in her current or former role she had advised ministers of concerns about the legality of the robodebt scheme prior to this calendar year. She said that question went to the legal advice around which the currently outstanding case revolves and it would be inappropriate to discuss while before the courts. The radio networks used by firefighting agencies in Australian states and territories are \u201clargely incompatible\u201d with each other, making it more difficult for aircraft to be deployed across state lines, the royal commission into national natural disaster arrangements has heard. Firefighting aircraft \u2013 most of which are operated by private companies that negotiate three-to-five year contracts with state or territory firefighting agencies \u2013 are fitted with at least two different radio systems so they can both communicate with air traffic control and with the fire agency they\u2019re primarily working with. But if an aircraft stationed in southern NSW is deployed to a fire in Victoria, it would need a third radio system to communicate directly with the Victorian fire authorities. Richard Alder, the general manager of the National Aerial Firefighting Centre, said it was \u201ccurrently impractical\u201d to provide standard tactical radios in all firefighting aircraft Australia-wide \u201cbecause each state and territory adopts a different system that are largely incompatible\u201d. Ruth Ryan, the corporate fire manager from HPV Plantations, the largest private landholder in Victoria, said that meant that if there were a fire in their plantations in south-west Victoria, they were unable to call aerial support from Mount Gambier, 10km over the border. I would certainly like to see the state borders dissolved, effectively, especially for aerial support, so that the closest aircraft respond to every fire \u2026 And then, you know, it is all about that common training and common systems, and common equipment. So that effectively dissolves those state borders because when we are fighting the one fire, we really need to be able to fight it most effectively. HPV Plantations has a contract with the Victorian Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning to share its firefighting resources, which includes aerial resources and 280 trained firefighters. Ryan said different radio systems used in different states meant firefighters on one side of the border could not hear what was happening on the other side, even if they were working on the same fire. So you know, if I was sitting 20km inside the Victorian border, I cannot, unless I\u2019ve got yet another radio in my vehicle, I cannot hear what\u2019s happening in SA as far as any dispatch. Palace Cinemas says it will reopen its doors nationally from 2 July. Its statement today says: New safety procedures include capped cinema capacities and seating allocation which will allow friends and families to remain seated together while distanced from other bookings. Additional measures at all Palace Cinemas will include compulsory online booking, staggered screenings to avoid unnecessary congestion in foyers, the provision of hand-sanitiser stations at cinema entrances and points of sale, and contactless payment for food and beverage purchases. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, says universities might be asked to pay for international students\u2019 two-week quarantine period when they return to Australia to study. AAP reports that Andrews has been speaking with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and university vice-chancellors about his hopes of international students being back in the country soon. We are hopeful that we can get international education back on its feet soon ... It\u2019s going to take a little bit of time. Students would also need to undergo the mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine for all returning overseas travellers. That service is currently paid for by the state, but when asked who would fit the bill for international students, Andrews suggested universities might play a role. I would want to continue having conversations with unis about that. I think that ... probably a partnership approach would be the best thing for us to do. Federal population minister Alan Tudge said about 80 % of international students were still in Australia and studying. Labor\u2019s Pat Dodson is asking about increased testing in remote communities and whether the government will engage in \u201csurveillance\u201d of the population. Caroline Edwards, the health department secretary, says the current advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee is that \u201canybody with respiratory symptoms, however mild, should get tested\u201d, but there is \u201cno proposal to do asymptomatic testing\u201d under consideration. That said, \u201cif there were an outbreak in a remote community, we\u2019d have a higher level of testing\u201d, just as when there is an outbreak in aged care. On surveillance, Edwards notes that some countries conduct \u201cserological testing \u2013 for people who may have had the disease in the past\u201d. There is \u201cno current proposal\u201d to do that form of testing in Australia because it is \u201cnot clear\u201d how accurate it is, and Australia is \u201cvery confident\u201d of its low rate of infection. Rachel Siewert is asking the National Indigenous Advancement Agency about when mutual obligations will be reimposed in the Community Development Program. Ryan Bulman replies that the general mutual obligations are being phased back in from 8 June, but will apply differently in each program, so Indigenous affairs minister Ken Wyatt will have the call on CDP. Bulman says providers have been asked not to apply penalties or suspensions until they\u2019ve returned to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, with jobseekers re-engaged and biosecurity measures eased so that activities can recommence. NIAA officials told the Covid-19 committee they had not been involved in a plan for early release of low-risk prisoners at risk of Covid-19, because it was the responsibility of the attorney general\u2019s department. My colleague Melissa Davey reports: The Australian government and security company G4S have settled a lawsuit brought against them by a security officer who claimed he was left with severe psychological injuries after riots at the Manus Island detention facility in 2014 which left one person dead and 77 people injured. There\u2019s a range of views out there from economists on the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s (completely unsurprising) decision to leave rates unchanged at a record low 0.25%. BIS Oxford Economics senior economist Sean Langcake says the bank\u2019s \u201cunconventional\u201d monetary policy \u2013 that is, directly propping up the banks \u2013 \u201cappear to be functioning smoothly\u201d. Monetary policy is at its limits, and we expect the bank will resist further policy changes, such as negative rates. Governor Lowe noted that fiscal support will be required for some time. The transition of the jobseeker and jobkeeper programs will be crucial in navigating the drop off in household support that looms in Q4. (Q4 is economist-speak for \u201cthe last three months of the year\u201d.) Over at jobs site Indeed, their Asia Pacific economist Callam Pickering is nowhere near as impressed, calling the RBA a \u201cbystander\u201d to the greatest economic challenge since the great depression. Like Westpac chief economist Bill Evans, Pickering wants the RBA to consider negative interest rates. Australia\u2019s real cash rate is well above what it needs to be to foster full-employment and inflation within the RBA\u2019s target band. We know this because the RBA has consistently failed to meet either objective, even before the onset of Covid-19. Negative rates may not be an appealing course of action but it may be necessary. Other forms of quantitative easing, whether that be further yield control or the purchase of other financial assets, may also be warranted. Hi everyone. Thanks to Amy for her efforts today. I\u2019ll be with you for the next few hours. You can get in touch at luke.henriques-gomes@theguardian.com or on Twitter @lukehgomes. Luke Henriques-Gomes will take you through the next little bit. Thank you again for joining me. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow. Please, if you can, take care of you. And those around you. The world needs it. Officials have told the Covid-19 committee there have been 59 cases of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people contracting Covid-19, but none in remote or very remote communities. There has been one complaint to the National Indigenous Australians Agency about the treatment of an Aboriginal person in custody during the Covid-19 crisis, but they\u2019ve taken details on notice. Labor\u2019s Malarndirri McCarthy is asking about $10m given to Northern Territory land councils from the Aboriginal Benefits Account, and $3m for Aboriginal mental health delivered through primary health networks (rather than Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations). Ryan Bulman said the $10m was to \u201csupport people self-isolating out in communities or going back to homeland\u201d by providing equipment such as chainsaws, cooking equipment and bedding, including 3,800 blankets and 2,340 sleeping bags. The SDA has released information on a \u201cCovid recognition\u201d payment Woolworths has agreed to give staff members. The payment will be paid to eligible employees employed before 1 March 2020 as follows: Full-time and part-time: - $250 on plus card - $750 in Woolworths shares for full-time (pro rata for part-time) Shares cannot be sold for three years but will remain yours if you leave your employment with Woolworths. Casual: - $100 on plus card Casuals must have been employed prior to 1 March 2020 and have worked one shift to receive the payment. Under 18: If you are under 18, you legally cannot receive shares and as such you will receive the same amount as other employees on your plus card. Extension of 10% discount: The 10% discount for staff will be extended for another month to the end of July. We\u2019ve been told Scott Morrison has asked the Australian embassy in the United States to investigate an incident in which Channel 7 media representatives were assaulted while covering the protest in Washington DC. It is understood the prime minister has also asked the embassy to provide the government with further advice on registering Australia\u2019s strong concerns with the relevant local authorities. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said at a media conference earlier today that Australia\u2019s ambassador Arthur Sinodinos \u201cshould be certainly making representation on behalf of these Australians who effectively have been assaulted ... for doing their job\u201d. Albanese told reporters: In a democratic society, the role of the media is critical. And it\u2019s important that the media are able to report on events, including crises, such as we\u2019re seeing in the United States, free from harassment. And the violence that has occurred towards members of the media, Australian media and domestic media as well, with tear gas being fired, with media being assaulted, is completely unacceptable.\u201d It is understood the prime minister was unaware of the incident involving the Channel 7 crew at the time of his call with Trump. Morrison has since contacted Channel 7 to check on the welfare of Amelia Brace and Tim Myers and assure them of the government\u2019s support should they wish to pursue a formal complaint with the local police authorities through the embassy in Washington. It\u2019s believed the embassy has also reached out to the pair directly to check on their wellbeing. A NSW police officer is under investigation after footage of an arrest of an Indigenous boy was put on social media: Scott Morrison and Donald Trump have discussed \u201cthe distressing situation\u201d in the United States during a phone call this morning, the prime minister\u2019s office says. They also discussed Trump\u2019s push for Australia to be one of the extra attendees of the G7 summit to be held later this year. A spokesman for Morrison said: The prime minister spoke to president Trump this morning, who confirmed his invitation for the PM to attend this year\u2019s G7. The prime minister said he was once again pleased to take up the invitation to attend the G7, as he had done last year, when invited to do so by president Macron in France. Participation at the G7 for the second year in a row will give Australia another opportunity to promote our interests during highly uncertain times in the global economy. It\u2019s important for Australians that we are there. Both leaders discussed the distressing situation in the United States and efforts to ensure it would be resolved peacefully. The RBA is leaving rates at 0.25%. Phil Lowe says the downturn may not be as bad as expected: The Australian economy is going through a very difficult period and is experiencing the biggest economic contraction since the 1930s. In April, total hours worked declined by an unprecedented 9% and more than 600,000 people lost their jobs, with many more people working zero hours. Household spending weakened very considerably and investment plans are being deferred or cancelled. Notwithstanding these developments, it is possible that the depth of the downturn will be less than earlier expected. The rate of new infections has declined significantly and some restrictions have been eased earlier than was previously thought likely. And there are signs that hours worked stabilised in early May, after the earlier very sharp decline. There has also been a pick-up in some forms of consumer spending. However, the outlook, including the nature and speed of the expected recovery, remains highly uncertain and the pandemic is likely to have long-lasting effects on the economy. In the period immediately ahead, much will depend on the confidence that people and businesses have about the health situation and their own finances. The substantial, coordinated and unprecedented easing of fiscal and monetary policy in Australia is helping the economy through this difficult period. It is likely that this fiscal and monetary support will be required for some time. The board is committed to do what it can to support jobs, incomes and businesses and to make sure that Australia is well placed for the recovery. Its actions are keeping funding costs low and supporting the supply of credit to households and businesses. This accommodative approach will be maintained as long as it is required. The board will not increase the cash rate target until progress is being made towards full employment and it is confident that inflation will be sustainably within the 2\u20133% target band. In the NSW parliament: In the Covid-19 committee, Labor\u2019s Pat Dodson has asked about measures to close remote Aboriginal communities to fight against Covid-19. Caroline Edwards, the health department secretary, explained that minister Greg Hunt made the decision to declare them designated areas on advice from state and territory leaders, Aboriginal groups and the chief medical officer as part of \u201cefforts to protect what is believed to be a more vulnerable group\u201d. Gavin Matthews said those returning to remote communities were required to self-isolate for 14 days, while Lucas De Toca rejected the suggestion any government decisions had \u201ctriggered\u201d people returning, saying state and territory governments were \u201cassisting people who wanted to return\u201d on a voluntary basis. Dodson is concerned that more needs to be done to address \u201cfundamental causes\u201d of risk such as overcrowding, because \u201cwe are still in the threat of a pandemic\u201d. Edwards says the government is aware of the impact a second wave would have on remote communities, and other officials point to $550m given by the federal government for a partnership with the Northern Territory to reduce overcrowding. There\u2019s a brief consideration of Ken Wyatt\u2019s announcement that a referendum is \u201cunlikely\u201d on constitutional recognition in this term of parliament. Officials respond that the $160m set aside will remain in the contingency reserve, rather than be reallocated. Don\u2019t for a second think Australia has been different. So just to reiterate from Daniel\u2019s post on jobseeker \u2013 there are now almost 1.7 million on unemployment benefits, a projection the department was anticipating the nation would reach by September. So we have hit that forecast three months early. The department is still working through 45,000 claims. The number of people receiving the jobseeker or youth allowance payments has increased by 300,000 in the space of a month, the Senate select committee on Covid-19 has heard. The number of recipients increased from 1,346,172 on 24 April to 1,640,773 on 22 May, said Shane Bennett, the acting deputy secretary (social security) of the Department of Social Services. The chair of the committee, Labor senator Katy Gallagher, said the number of recipients on jobseeker or youth allowance had doubled between 28 February and now, which she described as \u201cpretty staggering and distressing numbers\u201d. The committee has previously heard costing assumptions were based on reaching 1.7 million recipients at the end of September 2020. When asked whether the new figures changed the forecast about the situation in September, Kathryn Campbell, the secretary of the Department of Social Services, said they relied on Treasury to forecast numbers of unemployment benefit recipients. The department would feed actual results into that process and Treasury would update the forecasts, she said. Jim Chalmers held a press conference in Brisbane ahead of the release of the national accounts tomorrow: The country desperately needs an effective response to this crisis to be confidently executed, and a plan to bolster the recovery and set Australia up for the future. It\u2019s not getting any of those things from the Morison government. The Reserve Bank has been doing its bit, and playing its part, but the Morison government has been letting the side down by bungling important programs like the jobkeeper program. In the coming days, we\u2019ll hear what the government has to say about residential construction, and what we can do to support the building industry. Anthony Albanese, Jason Clare and the Labor Party have made a constructive contribution by laying out what we think needs to be done to deal with what will be serial weakness in the residential construction sector. David Littleproud has responded to the live cattle export decision by the federal court (which found the Labor government ban was invalid): I acknowledge the decision that has been made by the federal court today. The government will now carefully work through the judgement before making any further comment. The Greens senator Rachel Siewert says the government needs to hold a royal commission into robodebt: The government thinks they can get away with only refunding victims served notices after 2015. I am sure that people who received debt notices before 2015 will come forward ... and I will not forget the pain and anguish caused by this illegal process. This scheme traumatised many already vulnerable people in our community. The government has been heartless and cruel throughout this entire process and their failure to even consider apologising means we cannot trust them to not do it again. It\u2019s absolutely beyond the pale that after all this unnecessary pain and suffering, the government still hasn\u2019t ruled out introducing new laws to allow a future reboot of a robodebt-type scheme. The National Farmers\u2019 Federation\u2019s Tony Maher says Australian beef and cattle producers have been vindicated by the federal court\u2019s ruling that the Labor government\u2019s live export ban was unlawful: The agricultural community, live exporters, rural and regional businesses and communities that depend on them have been vindicated. And we have had a great outcome from the courts, that have recognised the reckless decision made by the then-government that decimated and devastated an agricultural industry and live export industry in parts of rural and regional Australia. Today, we thank the Australian Farmers Fighting Fund for their commitment and support for this case as a demonstration of what agriculture can do as a community when we stand united. Today righted a wrong that was committed by the then-government, and we are extremely pleased, delighted, that the courts have decided that that was a reckless decision, and that farmers and the agricultural community have been vindicated today. Meanwhile, back in America, the attorney general appears to be riding around in a tank. For those wanting more on the situation in Blackwater, Queensland, you can find it here: All that ABS data which was just released has left the ASX flat. As AAP reports: The S&amp;P/ASX200 benchmark index was higher by 1.8 points, or 0.03 per cent, at 5821.0 points at 1200 AEST on Tuesday. The All Ordinaries index was 6.2 points, or 0.1 per cent, higher at 5944.6. The All Ordinaries reached a daily peak of 5965.2 points at 1115 AEST but since then investors have had plenty of data to consider. On protests in Australia, Linda Burney says: I think that probably people could say that particularly when you look at the seven days of absolute activism that\u2019s just grown and grown in America and is reaching out across the world, including the United Kingdom, including Australia, and I suspect a number of other places. But when you really examine what the issues are for First Nations people in this country, it is a tragedy. The social justice outcomes are just absolutely appalling. You have a look at the rate of Aboriginal people in jail and the reasons they go to jail. Many of them are very short sentences. There has to be a better way to do things, and I think that this issue that\u2019s brought this to light in America is a chance for Australia to re-examine what the record is here, and make some substantial changes into the way that custodial sentences are dealt with and the way in which Aboriginal people are incarcerated in Australia. The Senate committee looking into the Covid response is about to start its latest round of hearings. Today will focus on the Indigenous response. How many of the recommendations from the royal commission have been implemented? Linda Burney: Well, not very many. What happened is that royal commission laid responsibility at both the federal and state governments and, of course, there was various committees set up to monitor the implementation. But I have to say that that report of the recommendations of the royal commission were cherry-picked and not all of them were implemented anywhere. And I think that\u2019s the tragedy of it, really. Perhaps if they had been all implemented, we would not be seeing the terrible outcomes for First Nations people in custody in Australia that we see today. There are many things that could be done to, I think, address the situation. But when you actually look at the statistics, they\u2019re absolutely stark, and these are just statistics. But they are also real people, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to remember. In the Northern Territory, for example, something like 90% of the adult prison population is Aboriginal. In many other states and territories, including Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and New South Wales, the Indigenous prison population is over 30%. And one of the enormous tragedies is that the rate of Aboriginal children going into statutory care is up around 40% across the country. And the rate of Aboriginal young people in custody is also absolutely enormous. Linda Burney, Labor\u2019s spokeswoman for Indigenous affairs, is speaking to the ABC: I make no comment on what\u2019s going on in America. That\u2019s not my place, except to say that I was listening to the radio overnight and I think it\u2019s become a much bigger issue than the death of Mr Floyd. And it seems to me that this is an issue of equality and frustration ... We had the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody, which still is a very significant reminder of the situation for First Nations people in this country, and it\u2019s a very big issue in the Aboriginal community. There have been over 430 deaths in custody since that royal commission, which examined 99 deaths, and we also know, Andrew, just in the last 12 months, there\u2019s been a death in Victoria, two deaths in Western Australia, and of course the shooting death just last December. Victoria\u2019s alpine resorts are opening for the season, but with new rules in place: People will still be able to visit the resorts this Queen\u2019s Birthday long weekend in line with current guidelines allowing overnight travel, but should be aware of the limited offering ahead of the season starting later in the month. Visitors travelling to the alpine resorts from the long weekend must pre-purchase vehicle entry passes prior to arrival. Those staying overnight will also need to pre-book their accommodation. No tobogganing is currently permitted, and the downhill ski areas and most visitor facilities are not expected to open before 22 June. My colleague Helen Sullivan has pointed out that the DC police are pointing the finger at the federal police in the video showing an Australian Network Seven news crew being targeted by police. Peter Gutwein says Tasmania will move to stage 2 earlier, after no new cases of Covid have been reported in the past 17 days. He is bringing forward the relaxation of the stage 2 restrictions to 3pm Friday: I know many businesses are hurting and many businesses will welcome these changes. But the most important thing that we need to do is to step back into this sensibly, responsibly and importantly; that we all use or common sense. We have put in place the building blocks. We have contact tracking and tracing available and rapid response. Tasmanians, if you haven\u2019t, please download the Covidsafe app. But, importantly, continue to follow the rules, continue to use common sense, and we will be able to step out of this and continue to have the very good result that we have had. In terms of obviously stage 3 restrictions, by nature of the announcement today, they will be move forward as well. We will be reviewing towards the end of June. The relaxation means up to 20 people will be able to gather together outdoors, hospitality businesses will be able to welcome more customers, and gyms and beauty salons will also be able to serve up to 20 people at once. The Queensland town of Blackwater, where 30-year-old Nathan Turner returned a post-mortem postive Covid test but was later found to be Covid negative (a second negative test was discounted after it was found to be contaminated) want the health minister, Steven Miles, to come to the town and apologise and explain what happened. Miles offered this, this morning, from Brisbane: The loss of any life, particularly a life so young, is incredibly sad. I know it\u2019s been incredibly distressing for them and to have to grieve under these circumstances, under this level of scrutiny, in some cases in quarantine, has only compounded that tragedy and that grief, and to them, I am so deeply sorry. This is from AAP: Prime minister Jacinda Ardern has scolded thousands of New Zealanders for breaking coronavirus restrictions at Black Lives Matter protests. New Zealand has just one active case of Covid-19, a 50-something Aucklander currently in isolation, and will achieve elimination of the disease this week without the discovery of another positive test. On Tuesday, health officials reported their 11th straight day without a new case of the deadly virus. Ms Ardern\u2019s coronavirus response has insisted on strict social distancing and caps on gatherings. Both of those rules were flouted at rallies in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch on Monday. Ms Ardern said that was unfair to Kiwis who had abided by the rules, including those who had postponed weddings or funerals. They had breached the rules. It was not right. Many New Zealanders have sacrificed an enormous amount and we continue to expect that of our team for everyone. I need to keep asking the team of 5 million to stay together so that we can reach the finish line. New Zealand\u2019s protests included powerful hakas and were conducted peacefully. The big Australian Bureau of Statistics release this week will be the GDP figures for the March quarter, out tomorrow. A negative result means Australia is guaranteed to enter a technical recession, because the June quarter will show a massive beating from Covid-19 health impacts and restrictions. After today\u2019s trade and spending results, Capital Economics said: In light of the solid data on net trade and government spending, we are raising our estimate for Q1 GDP a touch from -0.6% q/q to -0.5% q/q (actual data due tomorrow). That pales in comparison to the negative shock coming in Q2 when the bulk of the restrictions on activity to limit the spread of the coronavirus took effect. Capital Economics noted in today\u2019s figures the current account surplus widened by more than expected, from $1bn in the December quarter to $8.4bn in the March quarter. It said: The big unknown is still household consumption, for which we\u2019ve pencilled in a 1.5% [quarter on quarter] decline as we think the weakness in services outweighed the panic-buying-fuelled pick-up in retail sales. Adding everything up, we now estimate that GDP fell by 0.5% q/q in Q1. Sarah Hanson-Young says the Greens welcome reports that an arts and entertainment rescue package from the government is close, but that it will wait and see what is in it before handing out praise. She says in a statement: The prime minister likes his sport. I hope today\u2019s reports are a sign he\u2019s starting to recognise the arts and entertainment sector is important too. But the devil will be in the detail. The arts and entertainment industry was effectively shut down overnight as the first of the social distancing restrictions came in back in March. Finally, some three months later, the PM has now checked his blind spot and started talking about the need for specific industry assistance. Backing Australian artists and the entertainment industry is backing Australian jobs and Australian-made products. It\u2019s a no-brainer for the community, jobs and the economy. There is a real opportunity here to simulate the economy, put people back into work and create new jobs, not just in arts and entertainment but our hospitality and tourism industries too. NSW recorded a futher six people tested positive for Covid-19 in the last 24 hours to 8pm, but all were returned travelers and are in quarantine. The NSW deputy premier, John Barilaro says \u201csummer bodies are made in winter\u201d because that is where we are at in Australia at the moment, while announcing that the gym is back in NSW: As of June 13, we are going to allow gymnasiums, fitness centres and studios like dance studios to be open, giving a couple of weeks\u2019 notice, so that\u2019s exciting for those businesses. That will be capped at 10 people per class, maximum of 100 per venue. That will give them the ability to make sure they get some level of scale. More importantly, they can conduct their businesses. We all know that physical fitness is important to, of course, your mental fitness and that\u2019s why it\u2019s timely that we\u2019ve made this announcement and that will include even community centres, where we know a number of organisations use those community centres for the purpose of running a range of different programs, including dance studios. Indoor swimming pools, saunas, will also be opened up with some level of restrictions. Tattoo parlours are, again, another area that we\u2019re allowing to open up, including massage parlours, with a maximum of 10 clients per time. This is on top of that of 1 July we\u2019re also announcing that we will be lifting the restrictions on community sport, firstly for those 18 years and under. In other words, junior sport and kids\u2019 sport will be open and for us, that\u2019s important again to get some level of normality as we enter the winter. (Seriously though, any body is a summer body and ... ugh.) The Australian Bureau of Statistics has released some new info on the performance of the economy. Highlights: Wages were flat, with 0% growth in the quarter from December to March 2020; but for the year to March 2020 are up 3.8% Inventories fell by 1.2% in the last quarter, down a total of 1.8% in the last year Gross company operating profits are up 1.1% this quarter and 1.5% the last year Wages data varied greatly by industry: The worst hit sectors were accommodation and food services, where wages and salaries fell 4.2% this quarter, and arts and recreation (down 4.6%) There were also falls in real estate and transport postal and warehousing (both down 1.6%); and education (down 0.9%) In retail trade, wages and salaries were unchanged; and health care and social assistance was up just 0.1% Some other industries recorded small wage rises including mining (1.7%), manufacturing (1.7%), IT (1.3%), finance and insurance (1.1%) The ABS has revealed that \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 government revenues are down and expenses are up, as automatic stabilisers ensure less money is taken out of the economy, which should be a good thing for economic recovery. Specifically, in the March quarter: taxation revenue decreased 5.4% to $137bn expenses exceeded revenue resulting in a net operating balance of -$7.2bn The government borrowed $14.8bn Meanwhile, the first group of US Marines have arrived in Darwin as part of the ninth Marine Rotational Force. The deployment had been delayed because of the pandemic. The Pacific Islands Forum due to be held in Vanuatu in August has been cancelled due to coronavirus concerns. The annual meeting is a key event on the diplomatic calendar and sees leaders from Australia, New Zealand and Pacific Island nations gather to discuss regional issues. Last year\u2019s gathering in Tuvalu, attended by Scott Morrison and Jacinda Ardern, proved fraught for the Australian prime minister, as Pacific Island leaders pushed for a strong resolution on the climate crisis, which was resisted by the Australian camp. The tense leaders\u2019 meeting lasted well into the night, nearly broke down twice, and pushed at least one national leader to the point of tears. The Vanuatu Daily Post reports that Vanuatu made the decision to cancel the August meeting due to the uncertainty and economic impacts facing the country due to Covid-19 and Tropical Cyclone Harold, which recently devastated parts of the country. Vanuatu has no recorded cases of coronavirus, like many Pacific nations, but the financial impact of the outbreak has been crippling, with the tourism-dependent country suffering from the cessation of international travel. The Vanuatu government will seek to negotiate with Fiji \u2013 which is due to host PIF in 2021 \u2013 to see if the Vanuatu forum might be able to be pushed back by a year. Victoria has seen 10 more people return positive Covid tests in the last 24 hours. From Victoria Health: Four new cases of Covid-19 have been linked to the outbreak at quarantine hotel Rydges on Swanston in Melbourne, bringing the total for this outbreak to 12. The new cases are all close contacts of existing cases. One of the new cases has been linked to a staff member at Embracia Aged Care in Reservoir. The facility has been advised and all staff and visitors considered as close contacts will be placed into quarantine. A new case has also been detected in a staff member at Macleod Preschool in Macleod who attended community testing after displaying symptoms. The source of transmission for this case is under investigation. Close contacts of the staff member, including some colleagues and a number of children associated with the preschool, will be contacted and placed into quarantine. The preschool has been closed for at least today so a deep clean can be undertaken, alongside contact tracing, isolation, quarantine and disinfection. Yesterday\u2019s four remaining cases were identified through community testing. There are no new cases linked to any other known outbreaks, including the Keilor Downs family outbreak. On the Network Seven crew who were hit by police while doing their job, covering what had been a peaceful protest outside the White House, Anthony Albanese said: Well, our ambassador should be certainly making representation on behalf of these Australians who effectively have been assaulted. That\u2019s what it is. For doing their job. In a democratic society, the role of the media is critical. And it\u2019s important that the media are able to report on events, including crises, such as we\u2019re seeing in the United States, free from harassment. And the violence that has occurred towards members of the media, Australian media and domestic media as well, with tear gas being fired, with media being assaulted is completely unacceptable. Anthony Albanese was asked about the US situation this morning while in Eden-Monaro: Q: What is your response to the words and actions of Donald Trump this morning? Albanese: I haven\u2019t seen all of Donald Trump\u2019s statements. I\u2019ll leave it to Penny Wong, our foreign affairs spokesperson, to comment on that. But it\u2019s very clear that the United States is a deeply divided society. And that is problematic. The United States historically has played such an important role in world leadership. And it is tragic the events that we\u2019re seeing in the United States. I say that it\u2019s important that leaders seek to unite, not divide. And that\u2019s a critical factor in our democratic system. Q: Do you think Mr Trump has divided his country? Albanese: Well, I think people will make their own judgments about the state of the United States at the moment. Very clearly, there are major issues there. And it is a tragedy what is occurring. And certainly, the disruption that\u2019s occurring, the tragedy, of course, of the murder of George Floyd was devastating for anyone who watched that footage. It was traumatic. It was horrifying, frankly, that could occur during daytime, or anytime. In those ABS statistics just released, you can see how Australia\u2019s major trade partners were hit during the March quarter: The conditions in the global economy showed a decline in growth in all of Australia\u2019s major trading partner countries in the March quarter 2020. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) (footnote 2) preliminary growth rates compared to last quarter in seasonally adjusted terms showed quarterly growth for China (-9.8%), France (-5.8%), Spain (-5.2%), Belgium (-3.9%), EU 27 (-3.3%), Germany (-2.2%), UK (-2.0%), Netherlands (-1.7%), South Korea (-1.4%), USA (-1.2%), Japan (-0.9%), and Indonesia (-0.7%). Australia\u2019s share market decreased 24.3% in that same quarter \u2013 you can see how other global share markets fared: [Australia] compared to a decrease of 0.7% in the December quarter 2019. Decreases were recorded in France (26.1%), Germany (25.5%), UK (24.9%), Singapore (24.1%), Canada (21.0%), the USA (20.0%), Japan (18.2%), Hong Kong (18.2%), Switzerland (12.4%), China (10.3%) and New Zealand (5.5%). A market price change of $232.2b was recorded for foreign equity assets and -$240.5b for foreign equity liabilities in the March quarter 2020. Meanwhile, here is what the ABS says about the Australian dollar \u2013 it depreciated against all major and minor currencies listed here: The Australian dollar depreciated against almost all major and minor trading currencies in the March quarter 2020. The Australian dollar depreciated 12.22% against the Japanese yen, 12.21% against the Hong Kong dollar, 11.86% against the US dollar, 10.45% against the Chinese renminbi, 10.38% against the European euro, 6.25% against the UK pound sterling, 4.12% against the Canadian dollar and 1.49% against the New Zealand dollar. The Australian dollar appreciated 3.90% against the Indonesian rupiah. The Trade Weighted Index (TWI) (footnote 5) fell 9.29% to 54.700 in the March quarter 2020. These movements were reflected in exchange rate changes for foreign assets of -$208.3b and foreign liabilities of $145.6b in the March quarter 2020. Looks like Donald Trump has taken time out of his busy hiding in a bunker and threatening to call in the military and dispersing legal peaceful protests for photo ops to call Scott Morrison to talk about the extended G7 invitation. As Phil Coorey from the AFR reports: Sources said Mr Trump rang Mr Morrison this morning to enlist his support. Mr Trump wants Australia, South Korea and India as possible additions to the delayed meeting of some of the world\u2019s most powerful economies. The three countries have all had testy relations with China. Mr Trump\u2019s administration has praised Mr Morrison for publicly calling for an international inquiry into the virus, including its source. The ABS has an update on Australia\u2019s accounts: Another quarterly goods and services surplus at $13.9bn and a narrowing net income deficit to $12.5bn, contributed to Australia recording a seasonally adjusted $1bn current account surplus for the December quarter 2019, according to latest information released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). This is Australia\u2019s third consecutive current account surplus. ABS chief economist Bruce Hockman said: \u201cDecember quarter 2019 marks the third consecutive current account surplus.\u201d \u201cFalling prices for bulk commodities and a decrease in non-monetary gold volumes drove the smaller current account surplus for this quarter. Net exports in volume terms remained steady overall, with rises across several categories offset by the fall in non-monetary gold. As a result, net exports have a limited contribution of 0.1 percentage points to GDP.\u201d Greg Hunt is speaking in Melbourne where he is announcing $66m in additional funding for Covid research, including for developing a vaccine: I\u2019m delighted to announce that the Australian government will invest $66m in research into vaccines, into antivirals, and also into respiratory clinical trials as well as health system management. This funding is about saving lives and protecting lives and it\u2019s part of our dual process of containment and flattening the curve and increase the ability of our health system to respond, in particular in relation to the containment. Now, what we\u2019ve seen is that, overnight eight cases \u2013 and Australia is now at 7,203 cases and 102 lives, sadly, lost. And of those eight cases in the last 24 hours, five came through the hotel quarantine system. In other words, what that shows is that our border controls remain absolutely vital to protecting Australia. In an earlier three-day period that the Department of Health\u2019s epidemiology unit has provided to me, 30 out of 43 cases came from overseas and have come through either the hotel quarantine or the navigation and shipping protections that have been put in place in this case in Western Australia. So all of these things are protecting Australians. The construction award is the latest under the microscope: Master Builders Australia, Housing Industry Association and Australian Industry Group have made a joint submission to the Fair Work Commission asking for temporary award changes. Under the proposal, 38-hour ordinary working weeks could be performed between 6am and 7pm Monday to Friday and 6am and 2pm on Saturday. Casual shifts could be as short as two hours, while workers and bosses could agree to time off instead of overtime. The CFMEU argues the pandemic is being used to attack wages and conditions, accusing employer groups of opportunism. The construction union is opposed to changing the award. (via AAP) The ABC is reporting Papua New Guinea has declared an end to its state of emergency because of the Covid pandemic. It recorded eight cases. Rating agency S&amp;P has a new set of economic forecasts out and they make for depressing reading. The agency\u2019s analysts now think Australia\u2019s economic slump will be worse than they previously thought, and are tipping wages growth to remain all but nonexistent. Australia\u2019s economy will shrink by 4% before rebounding by 5.7% next year and unemployment will hit 7.5%, S&amp;P says. It is predicting a fall in house prices of 10% - far less than the worst-case scenarios of some economists of around 30% to 40%. S&amp;P says people have already begun defaulting on their mortgages, but the real impact of the coronavirus crisis won\u2019t be felt for another 12 months. The agency says areas hit by the bushfires are already under stress and the total effect of the coronavirus crisis on people\u2019s ability to pay their mortgages will be worse than the global financial crisis. So far, the pain has fallen hardest on postcodes in the west and north of the country. Darwin has the highest proportion of mortgages in arrears, at 7.04%, closely followed by three WA postcodes, Maddington (6.59%), Blythewood (6.45%) and Byford (6.06%), S&amp;P said in a report, released today. \u201cOverall increases in arrears likely will be higher than what occurred after the 2008 financial crisis because forecast increases in unemployment are larger,\u201d S&amp;P said. \u201cArrears are likely to be higher in areas more dependent on tourism for local employment; international travel restrictions are likely to continue for some time.\u201d Linda Burney spoke to Fran Kelly on ABC radio this morning, in response to Scott Morrison\u2019s comments from yesterday: \u2018We have our faults, we have our flaws, but thank God we\u2019re not like the US.\u2019 Burney: The Prime Minister made these comments, as you said, yesterday. And I just wonder whether he is fully across the way in which the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in the late 80s-early 90s, still resonates with First Nations people. And I wonder whether he\u2019s fully cognisant of the terrible outcomes, particularly as you said Fran, the over-430 deaths in custody since the Royal Commission. And in fact, two in the last 12 months \u2013 three in the last 12 months. ...I don\u2019t know that making a comparison is all that useful. But the fact is this: is that there are more Aboriginal people, particularly young people and women in custody now than there was at the time of the Royal Commission. In fact, Fran, in some parts of Australia, almost 100 per cent of young people locked up and adults are Aboriginal people \u2013 particularly, the north of Australia. And when you look at the death of Kumanjayi Walker in Yuendumu last November. When you have a look at the death of Ms [Clarke] in Geraldton. You just have to ask yourself, how do these things happen? I mean, the level of poverty; the level of disenfranchisement; the level of relationships between Aboriginal people and the police, varies across the country. But in essence, the level of poverty is just shocking. And I just don\u2019t think that a lot of people like us living in cities, when you go out to some of these communities, particularly remote communities, the level of poverty is almost indescribable. The RBA will meet today. Westpac chief economist Bill Evans has called for the bank to consider negative interest rates (dropping below zero) which the RBA has already ruled out. At 0.25% the RBA has hit its floor. (I keep saying 0.5% - that is my fault) The push is on, in earnest now, for the government to provide a rescue package for the arts and entertainment industry. Tony Burke spoke to Melbourne ABC this morning, after the prime minister said on Sydney radio 2GB yesterday, that it was an area the government would need to look at: It\u2019s been three months that the sector which was pretty much the first to be shut down, ever since the ban happened on 50 if you\u2019re outdoors and 100 if you\u2019re indoors, they were the first industry shut down. And so there\u2019s a lot of hope that finally the government has recognised there\u2019s a problem. Because we\u2019ve been calling for there to be a package all of that time. I think what they need to do, and there\u2019s different ways of doing it, but what matters is that they hit both sorts of groups. There are the companies that employ artists, technicians, labourers, all the people who are responsible for bringing performance together. And then there are the workers themselves, and the workers themselves have largely been locked out of jobkeeper. Some of them because of lumpy income had problems with jobseeker as well. But what matters is that the government deals with both. Now what\u2019s been put into the newspapers today says that they\u2019re looking at the employer side of it and that\u2019s important. And that\u2019s really going to matter. They\u2019re also going to need to make sure that they do something about the people who work for those companies, because they certainly shouldn\u2019t and I don\u2019t see how they can be, left at a loose end not for months and months and months while we wait for the industry to be opened back up. Annastacia Palaszczuk is in Townsville, where she is speaking about the false positive for Covid a post-mortem test on 30-year-old Nathan Turner returned: Of course we are very sorry for the distress at the family is going through at the moment and has experienced, and to the people of Blackwater, thank you very much for cooperating and we have to take the advice of health at the time and that rapid response was deployed. Like we know, we are still not out of the woods yet but our response to Covid-19 has been across-the-board, across Queensland, has been very good, but I do understand that there is a lot of concern about that case how it came back as a false positive. ... We find that it [false positives] has happened in other states as well and it is a whole new virus, and we have to take the health advice at the time and if we don\u2019t act, and it ends up being worse than we would be negligent for not act on, so I really thank the community for their understanding, and once again express my sympathies to the family for the loss of their loved one. And of course, these are not the only Indigenous people who have died while in police and government custody (a national tragedy still occurring) (Via AAP) The hundreds of Indigenous men and boys who died while imprisoned on WA\u2019s Rottnest Island will be commemorated in a bid towards healing and reconciling the past. Elder Farley Garlett said on Tuesday the Whadjuk people would lead the WA government project, aimed at reconciling the history of indigenous captivity on the island off the coast of Fremantle. \u201cIt is a responsibility we take up in the spirit of healing and moving forward,\u201d he said. Fellow elder Neville Collard said it was an important issue for indigenous people and believed it was time to work with the West Australian government to recognise the island\u2019s history. The Wadjemup Project, named after the Noongar name for Rottnest Island, will honour almost 400 Indigenous men and boys who were buried there in unmarked graves between 1838 and 1931. During those years, more than 4,000 Indigenous men and boys from across WA were sent to the island, imprisoned and used as forced labour. The state\u2019s Aboriginal affairs minister, Ben Wyatt, said there had been years of research and community consultation about the recognition of those prisoners. \u201cEnsuring the history of Aboriginal people on the island is recognised is imperative for reconciliation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will begin the healing process of historic and intergenerational trauma from the colonisation of Aboriginal people.\u201d Also worth paying attention to: Netball Australia has officially cancelled its Australian Netball League season. That\u2019s because of financial pressures, plus inconsistent training and matches in the different states and territories. The 2020 Super Netball season is due to start on 1 August. An update: Take the silver linings where you can get them. From AAP: Queensland\u2019s deputy premier has apologised to the grieving family of a Blackwater man who was wrongly identified as having coronavirus. Steven Miles says he\u2019s sorry for the suffering of Nathan Turner\u2019s family and his partner, who has had to grieve his death in isolation. Turner initially tested positive for coronavirus after his death last week, but subsequent tests have confirmed he was not infected. Miles has defended the government\u2019s response, saying it had to put Blackwater on alert and test widely after the former miner\u2019s initial positive test. But he said it was a regrettable outcome that the family had suffered unnecessarily, in light of \u201cmultiple\u201d subsequent negative tests. \u201cOur ability to control this virus requires us to respond rapidly to every single positive test,\u201d the deputy premier and health minister told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cWe have to treat every positive test as though it is a positive case. \u201cHowever, I would like to personally apologise to his partner and his family for any distress that our actions in responding rapidly has caused them. I know it\u2019s been incredibly distressing for them.\u201d The state\u2019s chief health officer, Jeannette Young, said false positive tests for coronavirus were extremely rare. She said the results were compromised by the fact that one sample from Turner was contaminated with excessive blood from the post-mortem process. \u201cThere are two potential answers here. One is that it was a false positive. The other is that it was a true positive,\u201d Young said. \u201cAnd we won\u2019t know which it was, but I am confident about the actions that were taken on that night to protect the community of Blackwater.\u201d Queensland recorded one new coronavirus case overnight involving a 41-year-old woman who arrived on a flight from Africa.Young said she was infectious while she was on the plane and she and all other passengers were now in quarantine. The state now has five active coronavirus cases. Back in Australia, Victoria has moved passengers quarantining at the Rydges hotel to a different hotel, because of the number of staff who have had to go into self isolation, after an outbreak of Covid. That footage being being beamed around the world of police attacking a camera operator is of Network Seven cameraman Tim Myers and journalist Amelia Brace Meanwhile Victoria is also commissioning a mural to celebrate year of the nurse and midwife. It will be painted on one of the major hospitals. Victorian health minister Jenny Mikakos says Victoria will be strengthening the nurse and midwife to patient ratio. A new bill will be put into the parliament today, to deliver another 500 nursing and midwife positions (that is on top of the 600 new positions created last year). You can\u2019t help but have your heart in your throat watching today\u2019s events. You can follow what is happening in the States, here In the US, Donald Trump has stood up in the Rose Garden and seemingly threatened to install martial law as protests against police brutality against black people continue across the States. Paul Fletcher will visit the National Gallery of Australia to celebrate it welcoming back visitors under the ACT\u2019s relaxed restrictions. Under new guidelines to protect the health and safety of everyone in the building, visitors to the gallery are taking part in timed ticketed sessions, which need to be pre-booked. Other safety measures include sanitiser stations throughout the building, additional cleaning, and the closure of small exhibition spaces. David Littleproud is back to attacking the supermarkets. After calling for a boycott of Target for its announcement it was closing down stores as it continued to have market issues, which was supposed to teach it a lesson, because that is absolutely how capitalism works, Littleproud is once again angry about milk prices. From AAP: Woolworths has announced an extension of a 10-cent levy on its own brand two- and three-litre milk, which it says will see $30m flow to producers. But Littleproud said the grocery giant was creating a corporate feel-good fund to promote its own brand. \u201cIt is utterly disrespectful of Woolworths to try to capitalise on world milk day with this pitiful offering, duping consumers into thinking the dairy farmers are getting genuine help from the supermarket,\u201d he said. \u201cThe supermarkets aren\u2019t listening to me or dairy farmers when we are clearly saying they need to restore the value they stripped from the dairy industry with $1-a-litre milk.\u201d Woolworths fresh food director Paul Harker said the levy would give millions to farmers over the next year beyond the farmgate price paid by processors. \u201cOur levy has provided much-needed relief to dairy farmers and we\u2019re grateful for our customers\u2019 support of the program,\u201d he said. Industry lobby group Australian Dairy Farmers wants to increase the retail price of milk and pass the increase back to dairy farmers via processors. Littleproud said farmers wanted a fair price for milk instead of relying on charity or grants and Woolworths should stop hiding behind fear of moving first and stump up. \u201cStop holding back the extra $90m in value from the Australian dairy supply chain and claiming to be dairy\u2019s saviour with $5m dollars of grants that farmers need to grovel for,\u201d Littleproud said. \u201cWe just need fair prices for dairy farmers not tokenism.\u201d Woolworths will also establish a $5m fund to provide infrastructure and technology grants to dairy farmers over the next three years. On the border issue, here is what Scott Morrison had to say about that last Friday following the national cabinet meeting: Now, under the three-step plan, it wasn\u2019t until step three that it was envisaged that there would be interstate travel. Now, whether you have a border or you don\u2019t have a border formally put in place, step three of the plan, which was expected to be in place in July, is when that was expected to be the case. Now, I note that all states and territories are working towards that, whether they have borders or not. But the truth is, and I\u2019m sure, and this was discussed [at national cabinet], that it\u2019s preferable to be able to be in a situation where you don\u2019t have borders [closed] as soon as possible because, obviously, that means that the tourism industries in particular and particularly with school holidays coming up might be able to benefit from that travel. So, I think we\u2019ve got to keep the issue in perspective. We don\u2019t agree on everything. Not everyone always does. It would be a bit weird if they did in a democracy. And we have to bear in mind that in the vast majority of cases, the states and territories have worked very well with the commonwealth on these issues and I still remain absolutely optimistic that common sense will ultimately prevail on the timetable that national cabinet has set out. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and the state\u2019s chief medical officer, Dr Jeannette Young, will front the media today to talk about Nathan Turner, a 30-year-old who tested positive for Covid after he died but in later tests was found to have been negtative for Covid. At 30, Nathan was thought to be the youngest person in Australia to die after contracting Covid. He had what was described as a \u201ccomplicated\u201d medical history, and had been displaying respiratory symptoms for weeks leading up to his death in his Blackwater home. A second test for Covid proved negative, but was said to have been contaminated and was ignored. No other cases of Covid have been reported in Blackwater. As AAP reports: Queensland Health said Turner \u2013 who had serious underlying health issues \u2013 tested positive for the virus after he died and his partner reported he\u2019d had flu-like symptoms. But on Monday, officials said a subsequent test had returned a negative result. Locals are seeking answers, and an online petition demanding an apology from the premier and chief health officer has attracted more than 2,500 signatures. Late yesterday, Queensland authorities confirmed later testing on Nathan had proved negative. The coroner will determine his cause of death. Meanwhile, Anthony Albanese is continuing to campaign with Labor\u2019s Eden-Monaro candidate, Kristy McBain. He has an event scheduled with her at 10am. Greg Hunt will announce $66m for Covid vaccine development and treatment today. That 11am announcement comes with a tour of Melbourne\u2019s Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. The Berejiklian government plan to freeze public servant pay has hit a snag, with the Australian Paramedics Association protesting the move by not billing patients. The union said: For months we have put our health and our lives on the line in the Covid-19 pandemic, prior to that we worked through months of fires and then floods. Despite this, all the NSW government has for us is empty words. There will be moves afoot in the parliament to stop the pay freeze hitting frontline workers, which includes paramedics. It\u2019s the same issue Queensland has run into. Speaking of Queensland, another legal challenge to open the border is underway. As AAP reports: \u201cWe are arguing that the Queensland government did not have the constitutional right to shut the border,\u201d Mahoneys litigation partner Mitchell Downes said in a statement on the firm\u2019s website. He said the move was part of a wider effort to help Queensland\u2019s tourism industry recover from the effects that Covid-19 had had on the industry and businesses and people that rely on it. A Gofundme page has been set up to fund the challenge and allow the plaintiffs to start the case in the high court \u201cas soon as possible\u201d. The Australian reported the challenge had been lodged on Monday, with six plaintiffs including a Brisbane travel agency and a Cairns charter operator, plus interstate individuals and a company.\u201d There is still the challenge that Pauline Hanson has threatened, plus Clive Palmer was adding Queensland to his Western Australia challenge, so all in all, the high court seems like it will be asked to deal with this one way or the other. We\u2019ll have that, and everything else that happens today. You have Amy Remeikis for the majority of the day. Ready?",

      "bodyText": "\u201cWhen fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross,\u201d goes an oft-quoted line of uncertain origin. On Monday evening, Donald Trump, with four US flags behind him, threatened to send in the military against the American people, then crossed the road to pose for a photo outside a historic church while clutching a Bible. He was only able to get there after heavily armed police and horse-mounted national guardsmen fired teargas and rubber bullets to chase away peaceful protesters and journalists. The shocking split-screen moment probably left millions of Americans shaken, frightened and outraged. Comparisons to dictators, fashionable during Trump\u2019s political ascent, have fallen out of favour in recent years. Now they might be in for a comeback. Certainly top Democrats did not hold back. Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator for Oregon, tweeted: \u201cThe fascist speech Donald Trump just delivered verged on a declaration of war against American citizens. I fear for our country tonight and will not stop defending America against Trump\u2019s assault.\u201d Kamala Harris, a Democratic senator for California, told the MSNBC network: \u201cThese are not the words of a president. They are the words of a dictator.\u201d Trump\u2019s speech sowed fear and uncertainty, not least because of its vagueness. Legally, he would have to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act for active-duty troops to conduct law enforcement on US soil, but he does not appear to have done so yet. It is possible that, for now, he is using it as a threat to force the hand of state governors to call up more troops from the national guard, just as he used the Defense Production Act to push companies to manufacture ventilators for people with coronavirus. Politically, he would face intense criticism from Democrats but he probably assumes that, as ever, Republicans will remain in lockstep with him. There were few signs of dissent on Monday night from within his own party. The alarming development ended days of speculation over how the president, already overwhelmed by the coronavirus pandemic, might respond to the most widespread civil unrest in America in more than half a century. Media reports suggested heated debates among White House officials over whether Trump should deliver an Oval Office address. In the end, there was a familiar winner: Trump himself. The choreography of his remarks in the White House Rose Garden and protesters being roughed up just outside was a made-for-television moment around the time of the evening news. Trump remains a reality-TV impresario. The darkness of his tone was also true to his instincts. His authoritarian tendencies include a love of military parades, putting his name on buildings, hiring family members, staging populist rallies, berating the media and threatening to \u201clock up\u201d political opponents. He thrives on conflict. It was clear that those advising a moderate course had lost. On Sunday the Axios website reported that advisers inside and outside the White House pleaded with him to curb divisive outbursts that threatened to hurt him at the ballot box with independent voters and suburban women. The Axios report named Hope Hicks, a longtime aide who returned to the White House in February from the Fox Corporation, as expressing concern about a tweet in the early hours of Friday in which Trump used a historically loaded phrase: \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d Hicks reports to Jared Kushner, senior adviser to Trump and husband of his daughter Ivanka.

The Covid-19 pandemic could have forced the luxury knitwear manufacturer to shutter the doors to the Moray mill that it has run since 1797 \u2013 but, at the riverside works, sewing machines are still whirring away.</p> <p>For now, instead of making cashmere joggers, batwing jumpers and elegant stoles for customers across the globe, Johnstons of Elgin is making scrubs, vital for local primary care centres and a hospital.</p> <p>By pivoting from Mongolian cashmere to medical gear, Johnstons of Elgin has kept its mill open and been able to bring staff out of furlough as well as plan for the weeks and months ahead.</p> <p>It\u2019s a story seen across Scotland, whether in the hand sanitiser being produced by distiller Loch Lomond Group, or the meals being cooked for vulnerable people by Buzzworks, a family-run hospitality business based in Prestwick, which has had to furlough 500 workers because its restaurants and bars are shut.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ee0975c6a7e6faec847e046bfa9e6ac2c8fd0aea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee0975c6a7e6faec847e046bfa9e6ac2c8fd0aea/526_0_2336_2336/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Liz Cameron\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julie Tinton/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWith government support \u2013 and agility and innovation on the part of businesses \u2013 many companies are utilising their expertise and stock to help support those that need it,\u201d says Liz Cameron, chief executive and director of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, which represents 12,000 companies, from the Outer Hebrides to Dumfries &amp; Galloway.</p> <p>But not every business is able to switch to providing essential services, which means, says Cameron, that the multibillion-pound package of loans and support from the UK and Scottish governments has been invaluable.</p> <p>\u201cHolyrood and Westminster have worked together providing different but complementary business support,\u201d she says. \u201cWithout it, we\u2019d be facing millions of job losses. It\u2019s been a lifeline for employers and employees alike.\u201d</p> <p>The most helpful package, by a long way, has been the job retention scheme.

      "bodyText": "Johnstons of Elgin has survived two world wars, flash floods and a devastating fire in the 1950s. The Covid-19 pandemic could have forced the luxury knitwear manufacturer to shutter the doors to the Moray mill that it has run since 1797 \u2013 but, at the riverside works, sewing machines are still whirring away. For now, instead of making cashmere joggers, batwing jumpers and elegant stoles for customers across the globe, Johnstons of Elgin is making scrubs, vital for local primary care centres and a hospital. By pivoting from Mongolian cashmere to medical gear, Johnstons of Elgin has kept its mill open and been able to bring staff out of furlough as well as plan for the weeks and months ahead. It\u2019s a story seen across Scotland, whether in the hand sanitiser being produced by distiller Loch Lomond Group, or the meals being cooked for vulnerable people by Buzzworks, a family-run hospitality business based in Prestwick, which has had to furlough 500 workers because its restaurants and bars are shut. \u201cWith government support \u2013 and agility and innovation on the part of businesses \u2013 many companies are utilising their expertise and stock to help support those that need it,\u201d says Liz Cameron, chief executive and director of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, which represents 12,000 companies, from the Outer Hebrides to Dumfries &amp; Galloway. But not every business is able to switch to providing essential services, which means, says Cameron, that the multibillion-pound package of loans and support from the UK and Scottish governments has been invaluable. \u201cHolyrood and Westminster have worked together providing different but complementary business support,\u201d she says. \u201cWithout it, we\u2019d be facing millions of job losses. It\u2019s been a lifeline for employers and employees alike.\u201d The most helpful package, by a long way, has been the job retention scheme. With HMRC currently reimbursing 80% of furloughed workers\u2019 wages, capped at \u00a32,500 a month, the scheme has helped 1m businesses and 8.4 million workers across the UK. Such has been its impact that recent Scottish Chambers of Commerce research found that 58% of businesses surveyed thought they\u2019d be up and running within a week of lockdown ending. For the Aberdeenshire trawler fleet, which has seen a slump in foreign demand for langoustines, the furlough scheme has enabled it to retain experienced staff. On top of this help, the Scottish government has provided \u00a322.5m in support for Scotland\u2019s seafood industry, including \u00a310m for onshore fish processing and \u00a33.5m for large shellfish vessels. The Perthshire paddle-sports firm Beyond Adventure is among the companies that believe the job retention scheme has helped them stay in business. \u201cThe biggest challenges for businesses have been about the ability to survive,\u201d says Cameron. \u201cIt\u2019s not about growth right now, but survival: getting cash in the door and managing possibly fragile cash flows.\u201d The recent announcement that the job retention scheme would be extended until the end of October has saved many Scottish firms from staring into a financial abyss, according to Cameron. \u201cBusinesses were anxious that if furloughing finished in June, they wouldn\u2019t have had time to restore trading to previous levels,\u201d she says.

The now-closed \u00a3120m Scottish Government Pivotal Enterprise Resilience Fund provided grants for SMEs, plus sector- relevant packages for industries ranging from charities to the creative sector. The support has been most keenly received by Scotland\u2019s tourism industry, which is among the sectors expected to take longer to recover. At this time of year, hotels, B&amp;Bs, loch-side camping sites, restaurants and whisky distilleries would usually be bracing themselves for the summer rush. \u201cMany Scottish rural communities are 100% reliant on tourism,\u201d says Cameron. \u201cWe need to make sure government support will be there.\u201d For remote and island communities that don\u2019t depend on tourism, but whose lives and jobs are reliant on local manufacturing and other businesses, a \u00a320m Supporting Communities Fund is in the process of being distributed.

Peru is not the only country in the region to report the death of journalists from Covid-19. At least 12 journalists have reportedly died from the virus in Ecuador\u2019s hard-hit city of Guayaquil, about eight in Brazil, and at least one in Nicaragua, among deaths in other countries. Around the world, at least 117 journalists have died as a result of the coronavirus pandemic in 31 countries, according to one estimate by the Swiss NGO the Press Emblem Club. \u201cThis pandemic has stripped bare the labour conditions for journalists in Peru,\u201d said Zuliana Lainez, secretary general of Peru\u2019s National Journalists Association, known as the ANP. At least six journalists died in Peru\u2019s hard-hit Amazon city of Iquitos, four in the capital Lima, and others on the country\u2019s northern coast, a coronavirus hotspot, according to the ANP. Dozens more journalists are reportedly recovering from the virus. About half of the victims were working when they became infected, Lainez reported, and most were freelancers while just four worked for national media outlets. \u201cMedia companies have the legal and moral obligation to provide personal protective equipment [PPE] for their personnel, especially those who do reporting,\u201d Lainez added. In Iquitos, most journalists had to provide their own PPE, just as many finance their own airtime by drumming up advertising for local radio stations, explained Otoniel Vela, 55, a radio host recovering from Covid-19 at home. \u201cNone of us are staff, we do this because it\u2019s a passion,\u201d he said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any protective equipment here, we just went out and did our job.\u201d Peru\u2019s public television and radio broadcaster ordered employees over 60 to stay at home when the pandemic struck. But Manuel S\u00e1nchez, the correspondent in Iquitos, was 59 and kept working. He caught Covid-19 and died in a public hospital. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s gone. He was honest, helpful, noble; such a good guy,\u201d said Jorge Carrillo, his colleague and friend of 25 years. Dozens of other colleagues were recovering from the virus in Iquitos, which saw one of Peru\u2019s worst outbreaks, Carrillo said. \u201cI know many of them didn\u2019t take the right precautions,\u201d he added. The virus also killed a veteran journalist, Victor Hemeryth del \u00c1guila, 78, who worked with Canal 23, a local television station. \u201cThose that died, like my uncle, died precisely because we have to finance ourselves and when the money runs out you don\u2019t think of buying a new mask,\u201d said his nephew Hertz Hemeryth, also a journalist. The former president of Peru\u2019s public television and radio institute, Hugo Coya, said: \u201cJournalists are expected to go to the frontline but they weren\u2019t trained how to protect themselves from points of contagion.\u201d Others fell victim to a lack of medical equipment. Azucena Roman\u00ed, 59, a reporter for the state news agency Andina, died in one of Lima\u2019s main coronavirus hospitals before her colleagues could get her a ventilator, according to local reports. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it was trying to track cases of journalists who had died from Covid-19 \u2013 but it was difficult to confirm how many of them had become infected while working. \u201cMany journalists in Latin America lack the basic protective equipment necessary to keep themselves and their sources safe while reporting,\u201d said Natalie Southwick, the CPJ\u2019s South America programme coordinator. \u201cJournalists are a vital source of reliable information in this moment of crisis, but they should not have to risk their lives on a daily basis to keep their fellow citizens informed,\u201d she added. As in other countries, a slump in advertising also caused by the pandemic has led to wage cuts and mass layoffs in media outlets. Coya said the dismissals would drive more journalists to freelance and take more risks to get the story. \u201cIf it was precarious for journalists before it\u2019s going to be even more so post-pandemic,\u201d he added.",

Bonneville has also worked to tailor specific solutions to the diverse community the school serves. \u201cIn terms of the country Lambeth is hugely diverse\u201d, says Parker, citing the borough\u2019s significant Caribbean, African and Asian communities, as well as pupils from Spanish-, French- and Portuguese-speaking backgrounds. \u201cWe know that the BAME community have surfaced as being prone to having a higher rate of infection\u201d, says Parker, explaining that the school\u2019s risk assessment process is being developed with the heightened vulnerability of BAME students, staff and their wider community in mind. Communicating to children why their schools have changed is a crucial part of helping them adapt to their new regimes, so Parker plans to share a virtual tour of the new school layout with pupils, and plug lessons about the roles of key workers into the curriculum. As well as the children\u2019s emotional health, there are plans in place should a child show symptoms of the coronavirus. \u201cThe point of the bubbles is that if a child presents with any symptoms of illness, we\u2019ll know exactly who they\u2019ve been in contact with,\u201d she says. \u201cThen, if they test positive [for Covid-19], the whole bubble, including their teacher, will self-isolate.\u201d Parker\u2019s plans have focused on building confidence among children, staff and parents, and communicating with them every step of the way. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to adapt, even though we don\u2019t know how long we\u2019re going to be adapting for,\u201d she says.

      "bodyText": "Good morning. Donald Trump walked from the White House to the nearby St John\u2019s Episcopal church on Monday. Not to worship or pray there, as many presidents have done before, but to pose for a photo holding a copy of the bible aloft. Just beforehand, police had used teargas and rubber bullets to clear a crowd of peaceful protesters from his path. The photo op came shortly after Trump described himself as \u201cyour president of law and order\u201d, and threatened to deploy federal troops to quell the nationwide protests over the police killing of George Floyd \u2013 a threat that would require him to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act, last used during the LA riots of 1992. Church leaders responded to his behaviour with outrage, but the president was unrepentant. Also on Monday, he ranted at governors and other officials that they must \u201cdominate\u201d their states and cities, saying otherwise they would \u201clook like a bunch of jerks.\u201d This president has \u201cbuilt his entire political career as a gold-painted tower to incite violence,\u201d says Richard Wolffe. And in threatening to deploy the military, writes David Smith, Trump has raised the spectre of fascism: Comparisons to dictators, fashionable during Trump\u2019s political ascent, have fallen out of favour in recent years. Now they might be in for a comeback. Barack Obama applauded the peaceful protesters in a Medium post that presented a stark contrast to Trump\u2019s response. The former president offered advice on translating the demonstrations into a \u201cturning point\u201d for the struggle to address structural racism. The protests go on in big cities, small towns \u2013 and overseas The demonstrations over police brutality and structural racism, inspired by the death of Floyd, continued across the US on Monday night, despite the curfews enacted in New York, Philadelphia and other cities. Protesters marched and chanted from Maine to California, in big cities and small towns, while solidarity protests took place in other nations including the UK and Australia. A Kentucky police chief was fired on Monday after the mayor learned officers involved in a shooting that killed the popular owner of a local barbecue spot had failed to activate their body cameras during the clash with protesters. A medical examiner says Floyd\u2019s death was a \u2018homicide\u2019 Derek Chauvin, the police officer who knelt on George Floyd\u2019s neck for almost nine minutes, has already been charged with his murder. But calls to charge the other three officers involved in his fatal arrest are growing, after a medical examiner in Minneapolis classified the 46-year-old\u2019s death as a homicide, caused by \u201ca cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s).\u201d The chief of Minneapolis police, Medaria Arradondo, said in an interview on Sunday that the decision over whether to charge the officers would come through the Hennepin county attorney\u2019s office, but added that \u201call four officers\u201d involved in Floyd\u2019s death were \u201ccomplicit\u201d in what he described as \u201ca violation of humanity\u201d. Floyd Mayweather is covering George Floyd\u2019s funeral expenses. The former boxing world champion\u2019s promotional company announced his offer to pay for the funeral on Twitter, and the Floyd family has reportedly accepted it. Dr Fauci hasn\u2019t spoken to Trump in more than two weeks For months, Dr Anthony Fauci was the face of the US response to the coronavirus. But on Monday the Trump administration\u2019s top infectious disease expert admitted he had not spoken to the president since 18 May, despite the pandemic\u2019s continued spread through American communities. The news seems likely to raise fears that Fauci has been frozen out by the White House \u2013 and that Trump has lost interest in tackling the disease. The coronavirus crisis continues\u2026 \u2026 in Pakistan, where the prime minister, Imran Khan, has lifted lockdown measures to prevent further economic losses, saying people must \u201clive with the virus\u201d. There are concerns, too, about a potential surge in polio cases after 40 million Pakistani children missed out on vaccinations due to the lockdown. \u2026 In Mexico the Covid-19 death toll passed 10,000 on Monday. \u2026 But in New Zealand, lockdown restrictions may be lifted early, after the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, announced the country was on track to eliminate the virus \u201cahead of schedule\u201d. In other news\u2026 More than 500 land mammal species are on the brink of extinction and likely to be lost over the next 20 years, according to scientists who have warned that the sixth mass extinction of wildlife on Earth is accelerating, and may herald the collapse of human civilisation. Facebook employees are rebelling against Mark Zuckerberg over his refusal to act against Trump\u2019s recent postings, with some senior employees voicing dissent on social media, and others staging an unprecedented \u201cvirtual walkout\u201d. Trump offered to invite Vladimir Putin to the G7 meeting in September, during a call with the Russian leader on Monday. But other members of the group, including the UK and Canada, have already expressed their opposition to Putin\u2019s attendance. Great reads Run the Jewels: \u2018I\u2019m just rapping about the societal conditions.\u2019 Killer Mike\u2019s impassioned speech about the death of George Floyd went viral last week. He and his Run the Jewels collaborator El-P tell Alexis Petridis about being the right band for the times. \u201cIf anything, it\u2019s a source of mild discomfort to us that our music is seemingly relevant.\u201d The power of crowds Even before the coronavirus lockdown, the opportunity to gather freely in crowds was under threat from mass surveillance, or the seizure of public space. But whether for protest or celebration, the human desire to form a crowd will persist, writes Dan Hancox. Opinion: the G20 should be leading us out of the Covid crisis In 2009, Gordon Brown led a G20 summit at which world leaders come together to forge solutions to the global financial crash. Yet in 2020, Brown writes, the world\u2019s premier forum for international economic cooperation has gone awol amid an even deeper crisis. This is not just an abdication of responsibility; it is, potentially, a death sentence for the world\u2019s poorest people, whose healthcare requires international aid and who the richest countries depend on to prevent a second wave of the disease hitting our shores. Last Thing: \u2018No one can ignore a black woman on a horse\u2019 Brianna Noble was one of thousands of protesters on the streets of Oakland on Friday. But she was probably the only one riding a horse. \u201cI know that what makes headlines is breaking windows and people smashing things,\u201d the 25 year-old horse trainer told the Guardian. \u201cSo I thought, \u2018Let\u2019s go out and give the media something to look at that is positive and change the narrative\u2019 \u2026 I felt helpless and thought to myself, \u2018I\u2019m just another protester if I go down there alone, but no one can ignore a black woman sitting on top of a horse.\u2019\u201d Sign up First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

Five African Americans were killed by police, and approximately 500 Black men and women were arrested, according to an NYPD report.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T01:29:10.147Z\">at 2.29am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed593a28f087122eca53b49\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T23:51:38.682Z\">12.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Officers clearing out crowds near the White House pushed and hit an Australian camera crew, according to video captured of the incident. </strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/benyc/status/1267592904081629185\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">And here\u2019s the video - police repeatedly pushing and hitting an Australian camera crew at 6:30 as they cleared out the area around the White House. <a href=\"https://t.co/YNotvJ3LH6\">https://t.co/YNotvJ3LH6</a></p>\u2014 Ben Siegel (@benyc) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/benyc/status/1267592904081629185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 1, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>During his brief address, Trump said he is an \u201cally of all peaceful protestors\u201d, even as a crowd of peaceful protesters and journalists gathered outside the White House were cleared out with force. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T23:54:02.044Z\">at 12.54am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed591cf8f084df971c8ddec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T23:47:02.811Z\">12.47am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Maanvi Singh, here, writing from the Bay Area. </p> \n  <p>It seems the area around the White House has now calmed. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/benrileysmith/status/1267601227396919301\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The scene is much more calm now a block from White House.

It is expected to be extremely competitive this year and is considered a must-win state for both Trump and <strong>Joe Biden</strong> if they want to win the presidency.</p> \n  <p>The case involves <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/18/wisconsin-rightwing-group-will-voter-purge\">a challenge</a> from the Wisconsin Institute for Law &amp; Liberty (Will), a conservative legal group. Will wants the voters removed because it says the state has \u201creliable evidence\u201d they may have moved. In 2019, the state sent out a mass-mailing to more than 232,000 people it believed had moved, based on data from other government agencies. </p> \n  <p>Will sued the state last year, saying it needed to remove people who didn\u2019t respond to the mailing within 30 days. Voting rights groups say such a quick removal would amount to voter suppression because there may be many people who are still qualified to vote and haven\u2019t moved, but just didn\u2019t respond to the mailing.</p> \n  <p>Wisconsin election officials want to wait to do the removals until well after the 2020 presidential election, saying they don\u2019t want to disenfranchise anyone who hasn\u2019t moved and is still eligible. A circuit court judge sided with Will in December and ordered the state to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/18/wisconsin-rightwing-group-will-voter-purge\">immediately purge</a> the voters, but he was later overruled<a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/01/14/appeals-court-blocks-purge-wisconsin-voter-rolls-time-being/4465158002/\"> by an appellate court</a>.</p> \n  <p>The Wisconsin Elections Commission <a href=\"https://elections.wi.gov/sites/elections.wi.gov/files/2020-05/May%2020%2C%202020.Final_.pdf\">reported</a> last month that 4,709 voters who received the 2019 mailing had sent back postcards indicating they wanted to stay registered at their current address. Just over 57,000 had re-registered at a new address. 41,637 people on the list had become inactive based on other information that they were ineligible to vote. </p> \n  <p>129,151 voters have not updated their voter registration and could be affected by the supreme court\u2019s decision. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/18/wisconsin-rightwing-group-will-voter-purge\">Rightwing group pushes Wisconsin voter purge that 'could tip' 2020 election</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed569478f087122eca53a68\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/davidsmith\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-01T20:51:02.532Z\">9.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>A dispatch from the Guardian\u2019s </em><em>Washington DC bureau chief inside the west wing today:</em></p> \n  <p>Since protests broke out, the world is waiting for Donald Trump to give an address from the Oval Office or elsewhere at the White House.

I was on the phone with the president at least half a dozen times yesterday and every time I talk to him, he was telling me about a different action he has taken whether it was talking to a governor about this or a foreign leader about ventilators. This president has been leading.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Bridling at the idea that Trump has failed to speak out, the press secretary also insisted: \u201cMake no mistake, this president has not been silent.

Our live coverage continues here: The European Commission has backed Twitter in its row with Donald Trump following the social media platform\u2019s decision to hide one of the US president\u2019s tweets with a warning over its glorification of violence. The EU executive branch\u2019s vice president, V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, said politicians should answer \u201ccriticism with facts, not with threats and attacks,\u201d in her response to the dispute. After the addition of a fact-checking label to one of Trump\u2019s tweets, the president had signed an executive order to reduce the social media platform\u2019s protections against civil claims. In a statement, Jourov\u00e1 said: \u201cI support Twitter in their efforts to develop and implement a transparent, clear and consistent moderation policy. This is not about censorship. This is about flagging verifiably false or misleading information that may cause public harm, linking to reliable information, or flagging content violating their policies. \u201cThe role of public authorities is not to interfere with content policies of private companies but to ensure that fundamental rights are protected online as well as offline \u2013 rights such as freedom of expression and information, non-discrimination, right to security. \u201cThese rights protect all citizens, not only those in power. As politicians, we have to be held to account, and answer to criticism with facts, not with threats and attacks.\u201d The comments come ahead of next week\u2019s expected launch of an overhaul of EU regulation of digital platforms. The commission will look at whether the big tech giants should be held responsible for content published on their sites or goods sold online. A local television channel in Las Vegas is reporting that a city police officer was shot in the head tonight. 8 News Now said the incident, reportedly near the Circus Circus hotel and casino, was one of two shootings in the city. The second occurred at the federal courthouse, the report said, when police fired at a suspect after they allegedly fired a shot. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department confirmed two shootings had taken place and that one officer had been hit, but did not provide details on their condition. Protesters have been gathering on the main Las Vegas strip in recent days. On Monday evening, local media the demonstrations were largely peaceful although police broke up the crowds later in the night with tear gas. Watch this video of protesters around the US explaining why they came out to demonstrate against systemic racism. George Floyd\u2019s killing and the ensuing US protests have resonated around the world, with solidarity demonstrations held in multiple countries. It has also energised many outside the US to refocus on the injustices faced by ethnic minorities. My colleague in Australia, Naaman Zhou, is currently at a significantly-sized protest in Sydney, where people are demanding an end to violence there, especially against Aboriginal people who have died while in custody. We reported on Monday that 432 Indigenous Australians have died in custody since 1991. One of them, David Dungay, 26, said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 12 times before he died while being restrained by five prison guards. His family said they had been traumatised anew by the footage of the death of Floyd, who used those same words while under restraint. Read the Guardian Australia full analysis and story here: The Associated Press has reported that two people have been killed in the Chicago suburb of Cicero as protests continued over the death of George Floyd. Town Spokesman Ray Hanania said 60 people were arrested during protests, and people broke into a liquor store and other businesses. Hanania did not provide additional information about those killed or how they died. We hope to have more details later on. More police have been wounded tonight in apparent attacks. In Buffalo, NY, a car ploughed through a group of officers at a protest, injuring at least two people. The above video shows the car accelerating through lines of riot police as they quickly disperse. What appears to be gunshots can be heard. While the person who posted the video warned they might have been fatalities, authorities said the two injured officers were in stable condition. Police in Missouri have said four of their officers were struck by gunfire tonight. None of the injuries are believed to be life-threatening. St. Louis\u2019 police chief, John Hayden, said two were shot in the leg, one in the foot and one in the arm. \u201cWhat constructive thing is going on?\u201d he told reporters. \u201cPeople have decided to steal and break windows. That\u2019s all they are doing. So I don\u2019t understand what that has to do with Mr Floyd\u2019s death? That\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand.\u201d \u201cSome coward fired shots at officers,\u201d Hayden said, before his voice cracked up. You can see his full comments here: Here\u2019s a little more on Blackout Tuesday from my colleague, Justine Landis-Hanley: Influencers across Instagram and Youtube are cancelling scheduled content this week to take part in Blackout Tuesday, in response to the death of George Floyd. Last Friday, music executives Jamila Thomas and Brianna Agyemang, called on music companies and artists to bring parts of the $19bn industry to a halt, using the hashtag #TheShowMustBePaused. Video creators, The TryGuys, who have over 8 million followers across Youtube and Instagram, have said they will participate in Blackout Tuesday and push back their regularly scheduled Wednesday Youtube video \u201cto continue supporting the community and the #BlackLivesMatter movement\u201d. They are joined by sketch comedy channel Smosh (26 million+ followers across Youtube and Instagram). Some of the world\u2019s most prominent Youtubers Dude Perfect (60 million+) and Markiplier (33 million+) have also posted content supporting the Black Lives Matter movement. Meanwhile, model and Youtuber Karlie Kloss, model Gigi Hadid, influencer Maddie Ziegler, actress and Youtuber Lana Condor, and Australian fitness Youtuber Sarahs Day are just a few of the social media stars to post black squares to their Instagram feeds and stories in solidarity. Los Angeles\u2019 chief of police has apologised after he said people exploiting the protests to loot were also responsible for the death of George Floyd. \u201cHis death is on their hands, as much as it is on those officers. And that is a strong statement,\u201d Chief Michel Moore told a press conference on Monday. Hours later, following an outcry, Moore retracted the comments on Twitter, acknowledging that they had been \u201cterribly offensive\u201d: The city\u2019s mayor, Eric Garcetti, has also spoken on the issue: Hello to all those following. Oliver Holmes here, taking over the blog for the next few hours. We\u2019re now deep into the night across the US. Please do get in contact with me if you spot anything, no matter how local it may seem, and also for any questions or feedback. You can reach me via Twitter or on email, too: oliver.holmes [at] theguardian.com That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan for today. My colleague Oliver Holmes will be taking you through the latest US developments for the next few hours. Many thanks to those of you who got in touch on Twitter with information from your cities and elsewhere \u2013 it is hugely appreciated. And, as always, thanks for following along. Celebrities, influencers, brands and other users are publishing all-black posts on Instagram in support of protestors. Film star Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet posted this three times, tagging Black Lives Matter. Surfing champion Stephanie Gilmore took part, too: The music industry is also observing a \u201cblackoutday\u201d on Tuesday: The demonstration stands to bring major music companies, significant pieces of a $19bn industry, to a halt. The event organizer Live Nation will \u201cpull the plug\u201d on its operations and close offices for the day; radio shows will go silent; MTV, VH1, Comedy Central and other ViacomCBS-owned channels will \u201cgo dark\u201d. Minneapolis public schools are considering whether to end their contract with the city\u2019s police department following the death of George Floyd. The city\u2019s public school board will vote on Tuesday evening on a resolution that would terminate the school district\u2019s contract with the police department to provide \u201cschool resource officers\u201d and mandate that the superintendent prepare an alternate plan for keeping students safe. Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka has added her voice to protests over George Floyd\u2019s death. Osaka, who was born in Japan to a Haitian father and Japanese mother, has previously passed her time in quarantine posting lighthearted selfies in stylish clothes or by the side of a pool. But her social media feed changed following Floyd\u2019s death, as she posted news footage of his death and the statement \u201cThere comes a time when silence is betrayal\u201d as well as tweeting: On Monday she posted on Twitter: Osaka joins other sports figures in speaking out against racism and police violence, including basketball great Michael Jordan and Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton. Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Former boxing champion Floyd Mayweather has offered to pay for George Floyd\u2019s funeral and memorial services, and the family has accepted the offer, AP reports. Mayweather personally has been in touch with the family, according to Leonard Ellerbe, the CEO of Mayweather Promotions. He will handle costs for the funeral on June 9 in Floyd\u2019s hometown of Houston, as well as other expenses. TMZ originally reported Mayweather\u2019s offer. \u201cHe\u2019ll probably get mad at me for saying that, but yes, he is definitely paying for the funeral,\u201d Ellerbe told ESPN.com on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached the \u2018mad emperor\u2019 stage, and it\u2019s terrifying to behold,\u201d writes Guardian columnist Richard Wolffe. In the week since George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police officers, Trump has watched and tweeted helplessly as the nation he pretends to lead has reached its breaking point. After decades of supposedly legal police beatings and murders, the protests have swept America\u2019s cities more quickly than even coronavirus. This is no coincidence of timing. In other crises, in other eras, there have been presidents who understood their most basic duty: to calm the violence and protect the people. In this crisis, however, we have a president who built his entire political career as a gold-painted tower to incite violence. Here is a video of the incident referred to earlier, where police violently dispersed protestors ahead of Trump\u2019s bible photo op: US president Donald Trump has visited the 200-year-old church near the White House that was set on fire as demonstrators clashed with police over the weekend. Beginning with James Madison, every person who has held the office of president has attended a service at St John\u2019s Church. Law enforcement cleared protesters out of the area with tear gas before Trump\u2019s visit. Tear gas canisters could be heard exploding as Trump spoke in the Rose Garden. He then walked over to the church. The protesters appeared to be acting peacefully before they were dispersed by force. Hallie Golden reports for the Guardian from Seattle: Officials from the Seattle Office of Police Accountability reported Monday that they received over 12,000 complaints related to how the city\u2019s police responded to protests over the weekend. The majority of the complaints had to do with 10 key incidents, including pepper spraying a young girl on Saturday, punching two people who were already on the ground and being arrested on two separate occasions and covering their badge numbers. The next step will be for officials to run civilian led investigations, which, according to a statement from the office, will be completed \u201cquickly due to the immense public concern.\u201d The report came on the fourth consecutive night of protests in Seattle, which, while mainly peaceful, have included a number of cases of looting. At 6 p.m. Monday, the city\u2019s curfew went into effect, but thousands of protesters remained on the streets. On Twitter, Seattle Police declared a demonstration in the Seattle neighborhood of Capitol Hill a riot, saying the crowd had \u201cthrown rocks, bottles and fireworks at officers and is attempting to breach barricades.\u201d Law enforcement reportedly fired pepper spray and used flash bangs on the crowd. The Hill reports that a Texas journalist has lost his eye in the protests: Outside the Allen County Courthouse in Fort Wayne, Ind., one of those canisters hit 21-year-old Balin Brake, a weekend editor at a local television station. Brake was taken to the hospital with a ruptured eye and fractured occipital bone, according to a post tied to a Facebook fundraiser set up by his mother, Rachel Simonis. In a selfie taken after surgery, Brake revealed that he had lost his eye. The Guardian\u2019s Michael Safi has been compiling a list of incidents where journalists were harmed during the protests: Here are some images from the past few hours: The White House has released a video of Trump\u2019s visit to the St John\u2019s episcopal church on Monday. The video shows Trump walking to and from the church, as well as holding a bible while standing outside. Shortly after Trump\u2019s visit, the Episcopal bishop of Washington DC said she was \u201coutraged\u201d after officers used teargas to clear a crowd of peaceful protesters from near the White House to make way for the US president. The video, set to rousing music, does not show protestors or police clearing the area: Here is our full story on the response from religious leaders to Trump\u2019s visit: Kari Paul reports for the Guardian from Oakland: In Oakland, California, Gig car share has blocked users from checking out or parking cars in parts of the city, as protests continued in the East Bay City into Monday evening. The company, which rents a fleet of hybrid Toyota Priuses and electric Chevrolet Bolts in the Bay Area and Sacramento, has blocked off areas in downtown Oakland where protests have broken out this week regarding the death of George Floyd. The app also showed West Oakland, a historically black neighborhood where fewer protests have occurred, blocked off. Another ride sharing app, Revel Scooters, also blocked user access in certain areas on Monday night as San Francisco and Alameda County, where Oakland is located, instituted a curfew from 8 pm Monday evening to 5 am on Tuesday. The areas on the Gig app were blocked off as people made their way home from a peaceful protest of more than 15,000 people Monday night, which was organized by students at local high school Oakland Tech. Gig Workers Rising, an activist group that monitors the sharing and gig economy, accused the company of \u201cdoing the bidding of [Oakland Police Department]\u201d by preventing members of those neighborhoods from getting home. \u201cTech companies are complicit with the carceral state,\u201d the group said. Gig Car Share did not immediately respond to request for comment. In Austin, Texas, a black man is in critical condition after police fired \u201cless critical munitions\u201d at protestors on Sunday, the Austin Chronicle reports: Investigations have begun into several incidents in which protesters suffered severe injuries from \u201cless lethal impact munitions\u201d fired by Austin police this weekend, Police Chief Brian Manley told reporters Monday evening. ... Manley addressed the weekend\u2019s most serious incidents, which have been widely discussed on social media. On Sunday, a Black man who was recording video of the protests in front of APD headquarters at IH-35 and Eighth Street was hit by a beanbag projectile apparently aimed at the person standing next to him, who (Manley said, citing the city\u2019s HALO security camera footage of the events) was throwing items at the phalanx of officers blocking the entrance. The victim, whose name has not been released, then fell and may have sustained a further head injury; when volunteer medics sought to remove him from the scene for treatment, Manley conceded, spectator video shows them in turn being fired upon by officers. The victim is currently in critical condition and \u201cfighting for his life,\u201d Manley said, choking back tears. Hi, Helen Sullivan taking over the reins of this blog now. I\u2019ll be with you for the next few hours \u2013 please do get in touch on Twitter with questions, feedback, and, of course, news from your part of the US. I\u2019m @helenrsullivan. Alternatively, send me an email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com Police cracked down on protestors as curfews hit cities across the Nation. Officers used pepper spray, tear gas, flash-bang grenades and even military helicopters as crowd control measures. Donald Trump threatened to deploy military forces against US citizens if governors didn\u2019t activate National Guardsmen to control protesters. Federal troops are prohibited from performing domestic policing, but in extreme cases, the president can invoke the Insurrection Act, which allows the use of active-duty or National Guard troops for law enforcement. Clearing the way for a presidential photo-op in front of a church near the White House that was damaged during protests, officers teargassed peaceful protestors who were out before curfew. The bishop of the diocese that includes St John\u2019s church, where the president posed with a bible once protestors were dispersed, said the president\u2019s actions were \u201cantithetical\u201d to what the church stands for. The Louisville police chief was fired after officers shot and killed David McAtee, a local restaurant owner and beloved community member early Monday morning. Officers who shot at a crowd gathered near McAtee\u2019s restaurants did so without activating body cameras. They claimed they were returning fire. In Philadelphia, police responded to protestors with aggression, using tear gas and rubber bullets against those out past a curfew that was enacted with short notice. Such violent tactics were not used against a group of armed white men who gathered in the city\u2019s Fishtown neighborhood who said they had turned up to protect businesses from looting. In Washington DC, military helicopters flew low to disperse crowds, and officers doused protestors with pepper spray. General Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the senior-most military officer in the US, walked the streets of DC, saying he was observing National Guard on patrol. I\u2019m signing off for tonight, but my colleague Helen Sullivan in Australia will continue providing live updates. In Oakland, mass arrests were made of protesors out after curfew. Officers appeared to box in protestors before apprehending them. In Washington, DC police surrounded and pepper-sprayed protestors, according to reporters at the scene. A local resident provided shelter more than 100 protestors, according to a reporter for The Washington Post. Military helicopters were also used to disperse the crowds. Earlier, General Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the highest-ranking and senior-most military officer in the US was walking the streets of DC. He told reporters he was there to observe as the DC National Guard joined other law enforcement officers to patrol the city. A car has driven through a group of law enforcement officers during a demonstration over the death of George Floyd in Buffalo, New York, injuring at least two people. Video footage from the incident on Monday night shows the car speeding through a group of officers at an intersection knocking some to the ground, before accelerating off down a road. Officers appear to drag injured people off the road and onto the sidewalk.The officers were taken to Erie County Medical Center. Mayor Byron Brown told local media the injured police officers were in a stable condition. The group of officers appeared to have tackled a person on the street and handcuffed them before the incident, the Associated Press reported. With almost zero provocation and no audible warning, Oakland Police launches a barrage of tear gas at a crowd of about 500 to 600 protesters, who quickly dispersed as canisters of the stinging gas were thrown after them. A reporter on the scene heard no warning from police, nor did it appear that an unlawful assembly had been declared. A few plastic bottles of water were thrown toward the police phalanx immediately before the barrage, but the crowd was almost entirely peaceful and many were leaving when the assault began. Police were in full riot gear and behind barricades. The chemical weapons were deployed about 20 minutes before the 8pm curfew. Video footage shared on social media shows several stores in midtown Manhattan being looted shortly before New York city\u2019s curfew, which came into force at 11pm ET. Hundreds of people were captured on camera streaming into Macy\u2019s flagship store in Herald Square, which had been boarded up earlier today in anticipation of further unrest in the city after several nights of mass protests over the death of George Floyd. Footage showed dozens of NYPD officers also entering the Macy\u2019s store, and many more patrolling nearby streets. Nearby Footlocker, Microsoft and Sprint stores were also looted. Police were seen making several arrests. The New York Times is facing criticism for its framing of the demonstrations against police brutality across the nation as a \u201cchaos\u201d that Donald Trump has vowed to squelch. \u201cAs chaos spreads, Trump vows to \u2018End it now,\u2019\u201d The Times\u2019 front page is headlined. New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was among those who disparaged the choice. In Dallas, police officers reportedly shot at kneeling protestors with tear gas and flash bombs. A reporter for KERA, who at the scene said he left the scene after having a gun pointed at him. Officers have apparently surrounded protestors on the bridge and are making arrests. A citywide curfew comes into force in New York City at 11pm local time, but that hasn\u2019t stopped hundreds of protesters from gathering at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn for a peaceful candlelit vigil. The Barclays Center, an indoor arena that is home to the Brooklyn Nets, has become one of the main gathering places for protests in New York City in recent days. In Washington, DC, as protesters headed to the city\u2019s Chinatown district, a helicopter with US military markings flew low, kicking up dirt and snapping a tree that nearly hit demonstrators, according to reporters at the scene. A New York Times reporter who witnessed the scene said the maneuver by Blackhawk helicopters was similar to one low-flying jets conduct in war zones to scatter insurgents. In Los Angeles, a group of Black residents apparently trying to get the attention of police officers when their business was threatened by looters was immediately handcuffed. On live television, a local news reporter tried to explain to the officers that they were cuffing the wrong people. The sun shone and the bells of Oakland\u2019s First Presbyterian church rang out as thousands of Oakland residents - led by student organizers - marched from Oakland Tech High School to City Hall. Boarded up windows on Broadway were the only remnants of the volatile protests in recent nights that have seen police use chemical weapons on crowds and some businesses looted or burned. \u201cThis time feels like it\u2019s going to be a little different,\u201d said Christopher Foster, pastor of the Rock church in nearby Pittsburg. Foster said he felt hopeful that protests were occurring all around the country, and were not just focused in one city, as with Ferguson. He also spoke hopefully of a time when people will \u201celiminate segregation inside their hearts.\u201d Many demonstrators were attending a protest for the first time. Three roommates from West Oakland had gone to the dollar store to buy supplies for care packages for other protesters. It was their first protest, and they would not be staying out past curfew, they said, but they wanted to help their community. Protests have continued in Louisville, where David McAtee, a Black man and the owner of a popular barbeque restaurant was shot and killed by police officers just after midnight this morning. Officers and National Guard soldiers enforcing curfew, and officers shot into the crowd while their body cameras were turned off. A large group marched this evening to the site near McAtee\u2019s restaurant where the 53-year-old was killed, and his body reportedly left for 12 hours. The owner YaYa\u2019s BBQ, McAtee was a beloved local figure who offered police officers free meals. Police claimed they were returning fire when they shot at the crowd. The police chief, Steve Conrad, was fired as a result of the incident,l but will retain his pension. McAtee was known to \u201cdonate all his time and all his food,\u201d community member Greg Cotton Jr told the Louisville Courier Journal. \u201cEverybody could just come up and take it and he wouldn\u2019t charge because it was for the neighborhood.\u201d Opinion: A boot is crushing the neck of American democracy Philosopher and civil rights activist Cornel West writes for the Guardian: The fundamental question at this moment is: can this failed social experiment be reformed? The political duopoly of an escalating neofascist Donald Trump-led Republican party and a fatigued Joe Biden-led neoliberal Democratic party \u2013 in no way equivalent, yet both beholden to Wall Street and the Pentagon \u2013 are symptoms of a decadent leadership class. The weakness of the labor movement and the present difficulty of the radical left to unite around a nonviolent revolutionary project of democratic sharing and redistribution of power, wealth and respect are signs of a society unable to regenerate the best of its past and present. Any society that refuses to eliminate or attenuate dilapidated housing, decrepit school systems, mass incarceration, massive unemployment and underemployment, inadequate healthcare and its violations of rights and liberties is undesirable and unsustainable. Yet the magnificent moral courage and spiritual sensitivity of the multiracial response to the police killing of George Floyd that now spills over into a political resistance to the legalized looting of Wall Street greed, the plundering of the planet and the degradation of women and LGBTQ+ peoples means we are still fighting regardless of the odds. If radical democracy dies in America, let it be said of us that we gave our all-and-all as the boots of American fascism tried to crush our necks. Maine is one of the whitest states in the US, but protests against police violence have been growing there, last night and again today. On Sunday, the Associated Press reported that a racially diverse crowd of about 300 people in Portland had marched, blocked traffic and vandalized police headquarters to protest George Floyd\u2019s death in Minneapolis. Tonight, journalist Karen Turner shared footage of another protest in Portland, saying it was the biggest crowd she had seen yet. And the protests weren\u2019t limited to Portland, Maine\u2019s largest city. Local news outlets reported that hundreds of people gathered to protest George Floyd\u2019s death in Bangor, Maine, a town of about 30,000 people, 90% of them white. \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot!\u201d the protesters in Bangor chanted. A federal judge has agreed to release on bail two lawyers accused of throwing a molotov cocktail into a police van during protests in Manhattan on Friday night. Urooj Rahman, 31, and Colinford Mattis, 32, were approved for release on Monday, each on a $250,000 bond, according to local media reports. They are expected to be confined to their homes as they await trial. Prosecutors had strongly argued against their release on bail. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe this is the time to be releasing a bomb thrower into the community,\u201d one prosecutor said of Rahman, according to a Pix11 local news report. Defense lawyers for the pair argued that the government was alleging a \u201cproperty offense\u201d and highlighted the heightened risks of contracting Covid-19 in the Medical Detention Center in Brooklyn.Rahman, a human rights lawyer who studied at Fordham University School of Law, and Mattis, who works for a Manhattan law firm and was educated at Princeton, were charged with causing damage to a police vehicle by throwing a home made incendiary device into an empty NYPD van outside the 88th precinct as protests over the killing of George Floyd turned violent. The turnout in Oakland is huge today, for a protest organized by local students. Thousands of students, teachers, parents and other locals gathered at a high school, before marching through the city. The Oakland police chief said 15,000 people came out, more than the estimated 8,000 who participated in Friday\u2019s turbulent demonstration, according to local journalist (and former Guardian reporter) Darwin BondGraham. From The Guardian\u2019s Ankita Rao in Brooklyn: A few hundred people who gathered in downtown Brooklyn made their way across the bridge to Manhattan for the fourth night in a row. The evening started with a rally of speeches from residents and activists, calling on people to \u201ctake care of your body, they want us to get tired.\u201d They promised to protest every day until \u201cjustice was served.\u201d With the first night of curfew looming ahead, the police presence remained heavy though seemingly calm, more officers dressed down than on previous nights. New York governor Andrew Cuomo had promised double the number of police forces tonight to enforce the 11 pm deadline. Making their way through Brooklyn bridge traffic, cars honked in support. Spray painted slogans on the bridge marked previous nights of protest. In Philadelphia tonight, more than two dozen protesters were arrested after hundreds marched through the city. Teargas and rubber bullets were used on the crowd, which defied the city\u2019s 6pm curfew, according to local reporters. In the Fishtown neighborhood, a crowd of mostly white men with bats, hammers, and golf clubs took to the streets, saying they were there to protect the area from looters, according to local reporters. A separate group of people in the neighborhood asked police officers to send the armed group home. One man who appeared to have a hatchet was taken into police custody, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. A producer for WHYY, the local public radio station, who documented the scene said the mostly white crowd with weapons was dispersed by police. A black man appeared to have been arrested while saying that a bat was thrown at him. Producer Jon Ehrens tweeted that he was \u201ccalled out\u201d for recording the crowd of self-described vigilantes, \u201cand they beat the shit out of me and pushed my girlfriend.\u201d Joe Biden is set to deliver remarks in Philadelphia tomorrow. Earlier today, the Biden emerged from isolation and addressed community leaders at the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Wilmington, Deleware. He listened to community members and said he would not take Black voters for granted, promising a set of policy proposals. Going forward, Biden\u2019s record of supporting \u201ctough-on-crime\u201d measures that escalated the policing issues that Americans are protesting this week is likely to face more scrutiny. Speaking on CNN, bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the episcopal diocese of Washington denounced the \u201cabuse of sacred symbols for the people of faith in this country\u201d on CNN. The president\u2019s photo opportunity in front of St John\u2019s church, which is a part of her diocese, was \u201cantithetical to everything we stand for\u201d she said. The protests across the nation are fueled by systematic issues, she added. \u201cWe need to understand the deep-rooted causes of these things...If we don\u2019t understand the context, we miss the opportunity to be agents of healing,\u201d She told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. \u201cThat\u2019s what we saw from the president tonight. He missed one opportunity after another after another.\u201d Scenes of protest from around the nation: New Orleans Brooklyn Oakland Bobby Rush, an Illinois congressman and a Civil Rights era leader who co-founded the Illinois chapter of the Black Panthers in 1967, responded to Trump\u2019s Rose Garden address with this: The Episcopal bishop of DC told The Washington Post that she was \u201coutraged\u201d after the officers cleared peaceful protesters gathered near the White House with tear gas and rubber bullets, to clear the way for Donald Trump to take photos outside St. John\u2019s Church. The fifth day of protests in New York have gotten a relatively quiet start, with New Yorkers gathering at Times Square. The city is bracing for more unrest, despite an 11pm curfew enacted by Governor Andrew Cuomo. The number of NYPD officers patrolling the streets would be doubled from 4,000 this weekend to 8,000 the Cuomo said. A citywide curfew like the one implemented today is highy unusual. The last time such a curfew was enacted was in 1943, when Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia called a curfew in response to the Harlem riots, as the Gothamist pointed out. The 1943 riots were also in response to police brutality against Black Americans. In response, more than 16,000 officers including police and state guardsmen were deployed to quell the demonstration. Five African Americans were killed by police, and approximately 500 Black men and women were arrested, according to an NYPD report. Officers clearing out crowds near the White House pushed and hit an Australian camera crew, according to video captured of the incident. During his brief address, Trump said he is an \u201cally of all peaceful protestors\u201d, even as a crowd of peaceful protesters and journalists gathered outside the White House were cleared out with force. Maanvi Singh, here, writing from the Bay Area. It seems the area around the White House has now calmed. The president is being widely criticized for using tear gas and rubber bullets against peaceful protestors in order to make way for a presidential photo op. White House pool reporters breathed in tear gas lingering in the air and were treated roughly by White House staff, according to Steven Portnoy of CBS News. Under the Civil War-era Posse Comitatus Act, federal troops are prohibited from performing domestic law enforcement actions such as making arrests, seizing property or searching people, the AP notes. In extreme cases, however, the president can invoke the Insurrection Act, also from the Civil War, which allows the use of active-duty or National Guard troops for law enforcement. From the Atlantic last year when there was talk of Trump using this act for immigration enforcement, Stephen I Vladeck, a professor of law at the University of Texas, wrote: \u201cThe \u2018Insurrection Act\u2019 is an umbrella term for a series of statutes that date all the way back to the Founding, and through which Congress has exercised its authority under Article I, Section 8, Clause 15 of the Constitution \u2018to provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions\u2019. The Constitution\u2019s drafters understood that there would be circumstances in which local authorities were inadequate to protect the populace and enforce the laws, and so went out of their way not only to identify three circumstances in which troops could be used, but also to give the power to delimit those circumstances to Congress, not the president.\u201d One crucial Supreme Court opinion, Vladek noted, said, \u201cCongress, not the Executive, should control utilization of the war power as an instrument of domestic policy.\u201d With that, I\u2019m handing over the blog to my colleague Maanvi Singh in Oakland, who will continue our coverage of the ongoing protests and curfews into the night. - Sam Levin It appears that police teargassed protesters at a Washington DC church, before the city\u2019s curfew went into effect, in an effort to clear the area for the president\u2019s photo op tied to his threat to deploy the military on his own citizens. The church visit was brief and Trump has ignored questions about how his threats could further enflame tensions. Protesters were previously moved away from St John\u2019s church to make way for Trump\u2019s photo op. The president is now headed to St John\u2019s Church, an orchestrated walk on live television that comes after reports of him rushing to an underground bunker during the protests on Friday. He has not responded to questions. CNN\u2019s Don Lemon, reacting to Trump\u2019s threats to deploy the US military against its own citizens, urged America to \u201cwake up\u201d, saying, \u201cWe are teetering on a dictatorship.\u201d Fact check: Trump said he \u201cstrongly encouraged\u201d states to activate the National Guard. He did not note that many states have already done this. According to one estimate, there are now more than 17,000 National Guard troops activated in 23 states and the District of Columbia. Some have argued that the presence of the National Guard has only further escalated tensions and resulted in increased clashes and violence by police. Trump\u2019s extraordinary remarks have sparked widespread concern, with some noting that he is threatening to deploy the US military against citizens of this country. His speech took place as police were simultaneously teargassing protesters outside the White House. In his remarks, Trump also said the 7pm curfew in DC would be \u201cstrictly enforced\u201d. The teargassing began prior. Here\u2019s the exact language of Trump\u2019s threat from the brief press conference: I have strongly recommended to every governor to deploy the National Guard in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets. Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled. If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them. The president has left after brief remarks, without taking questions. In his remarks, he said, \u201cI am your president of law and order\u201d and called himself an \u201cally of all peaceful protesters\u201d but quickly moved to more divisive and threatening remarks, highlighting specific examples of violence across the country, and saying the nation needed \u201csecurity not anarchy\u201d. He also spoke briefly of George Floyd in the beginning of his comments, but said nothing of police violence or racial injustice in America, which is what sparked the nationwide demonstrations. In a startling scene, police are using teargas to disperse crowds of protesters near the White House while Trump is speaking in the Rose Garden. The president has threatened to send in military if governors don\u2019t act. He said he also encouraged governors to bring in the National Guard, which many states have already done. Trump is predictably painting a picture of violent protests, focusing on \u201cprofessional anarchists\u201d and \u201cAntifa\u201d. He says \u201cwe are ending the riots and lawlessness\u201d and \u201cinnocent people have been savagely beaten\u201d. Trump is now speaking at the Rose Garden. We fill follow along here. \u201cI swore an oath to uphold the laws of the nation and that is what I will do,\u201d he said at the start. Oakland, California is now doing a curfew, starting at 8pm, and Los Angeles is once again doing a countywide curfew. This is the first time during George Floyd protests that Oakland\u2019s mayor, Libby Schaaf, has implemented a curfew. Alameda county, which includes Oakland, Berkeley, Richmond and other East Bay cities in northern California, has also adopted a countywide curfew. LA is the largest county in the nation, a sprawling region with more than 10m people, and is doing a curfew for a second night in a row. In both regions, there have been complaints of police brutality and excessive force at the protests. Legions of K-Pop fans spammed a surveillance tool launched by the Dallas police department on Saturday after the department encouraged people to send in \u201cvideo of illegal activity\u201d from protests of police violence there. As protests raged on around the US related to death of George Floyd, an Black man who was allegedly killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis last Monday, the Dallas police department tweeted an appeal that videos, texts, or other tips of protestors be uploaded anonymously to its iWatch app. But by Sunday, the app was temporarily shut down due to \u201ctechnical difficulties\u201d after hundreds of K-pop fans flooded it with videos of their favorite Korean pop stars and the app was flooded with one-star reviews on iTunes. Police had encouraged users to upload footage as the city of Dallas experienced protests related to the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota. Police arrested more than 70 people in the protest on charges of \u201cinciting a riot\u201d and violating curfews. It is unclear if the iWatch app was overwhelmed by traffic after Twitter users mobilized against it or was voluntarily taken down due to the onslaught of spam videos. Dallas Police did not respond to requests for comment. California demonstrations have sprung up not just in cities known for protest, such as Oakland and Los Angeles, but throughout the state, from Eureka, near the Oregon border, to La Mesa in southern California, from the coastal Santa Cruz to the conservative stronghold of the Central Valley. In many cities, the protesters remembered and honored the lives of their own who were killed or mistreated by police. In Oakland, they marched from a plaza renamed during the Occupy protests for Oscar Grant, the 22-year-old black man who was fatally shot in the back as he laid handcuffed on the ground by a transit police officer in 2009. So far, spokespeople for the medical examiner\u2019s office in Minneapolis have not commented on why its new report has concluded that George Floyd\u2019s death was a homicide. The Hennepin county\u2019s preliminary report sparked widespread backlash across the country for saying the examiner found \u201cno physical findings that support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxiation or strangulation\u201d. The announcement of the updated report emphasized that its finding is \u201cnot a legal determination of culpability or intent\u201d. In numerous high-profile cases of killings by police, charges were not filed even after the government autopsy reports have ruled the deaths a homicide. Floyd\u2019s family and people across the US have urged prosecutors in Minnesota to file charges against the three other officers who were present for the killing. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has said it is also assisting with response to the ongoing protests in Washington DC, raising further concerns about an escalation by law enforcement. Here\u2019s an announcement from the acting commission who has repeated the president\u2019s talking points about domestic terrorism and \u201cagitators\u201d. There has been little evidence to support claims of outside people agitating crowds on the ground as protests have swelled in cities across the nation, attracting a wide range of people and organizations condemning police violence. Trump is expected to speak soon at the Rose Garden. Stay tuned. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner has declared the death of George Floyd a homicide, saying he died of \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual restraint, and neck compression\u201d, Reuters reported, citing a local a Minneapolis station. The updated report from the examiner stated that Floyd died from a loss of blood flow due to compression on his neck while being restrained by Minneapolis police, local Fox television affiliate Fox 9 reported. The Hennepin County medical examiner did not immediately respond to request for comment. The official autopsy by the Hennepin county medical examiner, covering the jurisdiction where Floyd died, last week gave preliminary results that found cause of death to be the \u201ccombined effects of Mr Floyd\u2019s being restrained by police, underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system\u201d. Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top public health expert and Covid-19 task force member, said he was no longer in frequent contact with president Trump. Asked whether the president talks to him often about Covid vaccine work, he told a reporter with Stat News, \u201cNo ... As you probably noticed, that the task force meetings have not occurred as often lately. And certainly my meetings with the president have been dramatically decreased.\u201d Fauci noted that they used to have task force meetings daily, including on the weekend, and said that frequently, the two would talk after the meeting, estimating that a month ago, they met four times a week. Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also told a CNN reporter that he has not spoken or met with Trump in two weeks and that their last interaction was 18 May, during a teleconference with the nation\u2019s governors. The comments from Fauci come as states across the US have continued to reopen and end lockdowns, even as reports of new Covid-19 cases and deaths continue. Last week, the US recorded more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19, moving past a grim milestone while states are relaxing mitigation measures. In his STAT interview, Fauci said he understood the desire to reopen states as quickly as possible: \u201cI certainly have sensitivity for the need of the public to start getting to some form of normalization.\u201d But he said he was still concerned about the pace of the reopening: When I see a situation where there is a region, a state, a city, a county where there\u2019s a considerable amount of viral activity there, and you see people crowding around bars \u2014 and there were several pictures of that, that was quite striking over the last couple of days \u2014 or on boardwalks, where they\u2019re very, very close to each other, I do get concerned. He said he was not concerned about the 12-18 month vaccine timetable, but added, \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee that it\u2019s going to be effective. In May during Senate testimony, Fauci also expressed concerns about the potential for ongoing outbreaks: \u201cThere is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you might not be able to control. Not only leading to some suffering and death, but it could even set you back on the road to get economic recovery.\u201d Protests continued at the White House this afternoon, as the mayor of Washington DC has announced 7pm curfews tonight and Tuesday. Active duty military police battalion is now in process of deploying to DC could be in place by tonight, according to CNN, citing defense officials, who say the mission is security not law enforcement. Two defense officials said troops will be coming from Fort Bragg North Carolina, the station reported. Staff have largely left their White House officers early this afternoon, according to a Bloomberg News reporter. Here\u2019s the current scene at the White House: The Guardian\u2019s Kenya Evelyn has more from attorneys representing the family of George Floyd: In a press conference Monday, attorneys for the family of George Floyd announced that an independent autopsy by third party medical examiners hired by the family determined that the 46-year Houston native died \u201cby asphyxia due to neck and back compression that led to a lack of blood flow to the brain\u201d. \u201cGeorge died because he needed a breath, a breath of air,\u201d family attorney Ben Crump said during a virtual conference. Attorneys added that \u201cfor George Floyd, the ambulance was his hearse\u201d, as an EMT report determined Floyd likely \u201cdied at the scene\u201d. Medics \u201cperformed pulse checks several times finding none and delivered one shock by their monitor but George\u2019s condition did not change\u201d. Michael Baden, a medical examiner, and Dr Allecia Wilson of the University of Michigan handled the examination. The analysis directly contradicted preliminary results from an examination by the Hennepin County medical examiner\u2019s office that ruled Floyd was not strangled, but died from preexisting health conditions combined with being restrained. Crump had previously stated that the family was \u201cnot surprised\u201d but \u201ctragically disappointed in the preliminary autopsy findings,\u201d as they could \u201ccreate a false narrative for the reason George Floyd died. \u201cAttempts to avoid the hard truth will not stand,\u201d he said Saturday after preliminary autopsy results were released. A Nebraska bar owner won\u2019t be charged for the fatal shooting of a 22-year-old man during protests in Omaha, officials have announced. The shooting occurred around 11pm on Saturday, and police arrested a bar owner, Jake Gardner, soon after he killed a protester, James Scurlock, the AP reported. But Douglas county attorney Don Kleine said today that Gardner fired the fatal shot during a scuffle with protesters outside one of his bars, claiming he \u201cfeared for his life\u201d and it was self defense. The killing and the decision not to charge has sparked further outrage. The victim was black, and the bar owner is white. Dallas police officials are investing two incidents of use of force during the Sunday protests, officials have announced. The police department said the injuries of the protesters were serious but did not provide further details: As a result, two individuals were seriously injured, requiring hospitalization and surgery. We are currently waiting for the victims to recover in order to garner all the facts surrounding these incidents. Police said the investigations were ongoing and did not provide any information about whether involved officers were on leave or had faced other consequences. San Francisco and Los Angeles will both be under curfew again tonight: Across LA, the largest county in the US which had a mandatory curfew last night, nearly 1,200 were arrested on Sunday. Dozens were arrested in San Francisco. Police across the country have faced criticism for their aggressive use of force in response to the protests, which were ignited by ongoing outcries on police brutality and violence. The ACLU of Southern California has condemned the curfews and the decision to bring in the National Guard, saying: \u201cCombined with the aggressive show of military force and the troubling accounts of police using batons and rubber bullets not just in response to threatened force but against peaceful protestors, these approaches repeat the very problems at the root of the protests.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports on a pivotal voting rights case: The Wisconsin supreme court has agreed to hear a closely-watched case seeking to remove nearly 130,000 voters from the rolls ahead of the November election. The stakes are high for the case because Donald Trump won Wisconsin by just under 23,000 votes in 2016. It is expected to be extremely competitive this year and is considered a must-win state for both Trump and Joe Biden if they want to win the presidency. The case involves a challenge from the Wisconsin Institute for Law &amp; Liberty (Will), a conservative legal group. Will wants the voters removed because it says the state has \u201creliable evidence\u201d they may have moved. In 2019, the state sent out a mass-mailing to more than 232,000 people it believed had moved, based on data from other government agencies. Will sued the state last year, saying it needed to remove people who didn\u2019t respond to the mailing within 30 days. Voting rights groups say such a quick removal would amount to voter suppression because there may be many people who are still qualified to vote and haven\u2019t moved, but just didn\u2019t respond to the mailing. Wisconsin election officials want to wait to do the removals until well after the 2020 presidential election, saying they don\u2019t want to disenfranchise anyone who hasn\u2019t moved and is still eligible. A circuit court judge sided with Will in December and ordered the state to immediately purge the voters, but he was later overruled by an appellate court. The Wisconsin Elections Commission reported last month that 4,709 voters who received the 2019 mailing had sent back postcards indicating they wanted to stay registered at their current address. Just over 57,000 had re-registered at a new address. 41,637 people on the list had become inactive based on other information that they were ineligible to vote. 129,151 voters have not updated their voter registration and could be affected by the supreme court\u2019s decision. A dispatch from the Guardian\u2019s Washington DC bureau chief inside the west wing today: Since protests broke out, the world is waiting for Donald Trump to give an address from the Oval Office or elsewhere at the White House. Instead he dispatched Kayleigh McEnany, his press secretary, to the west wing briefing room on Monday. One reporter noted that the president was literally taken to an underground bunker for his own safety on Friday night. \u201cWould you agree that he is hiding out on this issue and is that a good posture to be in?\u201d he asked. McEnany replied: \u201cI would not agree with that at all. I was on the phone with the president at least half a dozen times yesterday and every time I talk to him, he was telling me about a different action he has taken whether it was talking to a governor about this or a foreign leader about ventilators. This president has been leading.\u201d Bridling at the idea that Trump has failed to speak out, the press secretary also insisted: \u201cMake no mistake, this president has not been silent. At this moment he is acting to protect this country from the lawlessness we saw just out here in Lafayette Park last night.\u201d It is now customary for all reporters at the White House briefings to wear masks. McEnany and her colleagues did not. Despite his long history of divisive rhetoric and championing of tough policing, the press secretary also noted Trump\u2019s \u201clong history of condemning white supremacy and racism\u201d. Critics have compiled long lists that go in the opposite direction. I asked if Trump regretted his weekend references to \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d and \u201cvicious dogs\u201d. McEnany claimed that he had been \u201ctaken wildly out of context\u201d and denied that, as Twitter concluded, he was inciting violence. Americans should not allow themselves to be divided, she went on. \u201cThe American spirit is defined by love and mutual acceptance and kindness. Despite the horrific scenes we\u2019ve seen played throughout the media there are some things that we haven\u2019t seen.\u201d McEnany proceeded to play a series of video clips of protesters and police working together. She then departed. \u201cI just want to leave you with a quote from Martin Luther King, Jr. that \u2018We must learn to live together as brothers or we will perish together as fools The US judge hearing the criminal prosecution of former Trump administration official Michael Flynn defended himself this afternoon. Federal judge Emmet Sullivan said it was proper to seek outside views on whether to drop a charge to which Flynn has pleaded guilty, as the Justice Department has requested. Lawyers representing Sullivan said in a court filing today that he is not a \u201cmere rubber stamp\u201d and needed to carefully consider the department\u2019s \u201cunprecedented\u201d request, Reuters reports. Democrats and former federal prosecutors have accused Attorney General William Barr of politicizing the criminal justice system to go light on Trump associates in key cases. The US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit had ordered Sullivan to respond to an emergency petition in which Flynn said the Justice Department\u2019s request to drop the prosecution should be quickly granted. Sullivan, who has tapped former federal prosecutor Beth Wilkinson to represent him in the appellate court case, has not yet ruled on the department\u2019s May 7 request to drop the false-statement charge against Flynn. The department made the request after Trump and his allies publicly criticized the case against Flynn Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with former Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the weeks before Trump took office. Sullivan asked retired judge John Gleeson to serve as a \u201cfriend of the court\u201d and instructed him to present arguments against the department\u2019s request - including whether he should hold Flynn in contempt for perjury. Gleeson\u2019s legal brief is due June 10. Hi all - Sam Levin here, taking over the blog for now in Los Angeles, where officials have put in place afternoon curfews in Beverly Hills, Santa Monica and Long Beach. Here\u2019s the chief of police in Houston telling Trump to \u201ckeep your mouth shut\u201d in an interview: Earlier, Trump told governors they need to \u201cdominate\u201d protesters out on the street, sparking widespread criticism. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Sam Levin, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: A private autopsy of George Floyd concluded he died of asphyxiation from sustained pressure, Floyd\u2019s family and attorneys announced. The Hennepin county medical examiner concluded Floyd\u2019s death while in police custody was caused by the \u201ccombined effects of Mr Floyd\u2019s being restrained by police, underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system\u201d. New York will enforce a curfew tonight starting at 11 pm. Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York mayor Bill de Blasio said the curfew would be in effect from 11 pm to 5 am and would be accompanied by an increased police presence on New York\u2019s streets. Louisville\u2019s police chief was reportedly fired over the death of David McAtee early this morning. Kentucky\u2019s governor said today that one man had died after police officers and the national guard \u201creturned fire\u201d as they tried to disperse a crowd. According to reports, the officers involved did not have their body cameras on when McAtee was shot. Trump told governors they need to \u201cdominate\u201d the activists who are protesting the killing of George Floyd. The president repeatedly told governors that they needed to get tougher against the demonstrators, sparking alarm among those on the call. Barack Obama offered advice to the protesters while condemning violence from the demonstrations. \u201cIf, going forward, we can channel our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action, then this moment can be a real turning point in our nation\u2019s long journey to live up to our highest ideals,\u201d Obama wrote in a Medium post. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The Louisville chief of police has reportedly been fired after officers shot and killed a man named David McAtee while their body cameras were not turned on. The Kentucky governor said earlier today that one person had died after police officers and the National Guard \u201creturned fire\u201d while trying to disperse a crowd in a Louisville parking lot. Governor Andy Beshear said the Kentucky state police would investigate the incident. The victim was later identified as McAtee, the owner of the local business YaYa\u2019s BBQ in western Louisville. McAtee\u2019s business is located next to the parking lot where the shooting occurred. Police officers guarding Trump International Hotel kneeled as peaceful protesters marched past the president\u2019s DC property. The sight of the kneeling officers sparked cheers from the demonstrators, who were on their way to the White House to once again protest the killing of George Floyd. The \u201ccity that never sleeps\u201d is going to be under curfew, from 11pm tonight to 5am tomorrow, the city\u2019s mayor, Bill de Blasio, and state governor, Andrew Cuomo, agreed today. There will also be an increase in policing. In a radio interview, Cuomo said: \u201cIn New York City, I spoke with the mayor, there\u2019s going to be a curfew in New York City that we think could be helpful ... More importantly, there is going to be an increase in the force. \u201cThere were about 4,000 officers on duty last night. There\u2019ll be double that tonight, about 8,000,\u201d Cuomo added. The curfew initially is only tonight. Nothing has been decided about any subsequent restriction. Cuomo has said he is prepared to call in the national guard. The New York police department has been widely criticized for heavy-handedness amid angry but peaceful protests in downtown Brooklyn on Friday where people decried the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and police brutality and racial bias in killings of black people by police across the country. Incidents elsewhere where police vehicles drove into protesters standing in front of them are being investigated. There were protests in numerous city neighborhoods at the weekend, some of which escalated out of control. The family of George Floyd has had a private autopsy performed on his body, with pathologists concluding that the cause of death was asphyxiation from sustained pressure. Pathologists who conducted the examination \u201cfound the manner of Mr Floyd\u2019s death was homicide caused by asphyxia due to neck and back compression that led to a lack of blood flow to the brain ... and impeded his ability to breathe\u201d, a statement released by the family and their attorneys said today. Lead attorney for the family, Ben Crump, released the news ahead of a press briefing in Minneapolis, where Floyd died a week ago after a police officer kneeled on his neck for almost nine minutes after he was detained on the street following a complaint from a store. Pathologists Michael Baden and Allecia Wilson found that weight being applied to Floyd\u2019s back, his hands being cuffed behind his back and the position of his body, where he was also at times being restrained by other officers as he lay on the ground, \u201cwere contributory factors because they impaired the ability of Mr. Floyd\u2019s diaphragm to function\u201d. The official autopsy by the Hennepin county medical examiner, covering the jurisdiction where Floyd died, last week gave preliminary results that found cause of death to be the \u201ccombined effects of Mr Floyd\u2019s being restrained by police, underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system\u201d. Video of Floyd\u2019s treatment by the police went viral. Baden said: \u201cWhat we found is consistent with what people saw. There is no other health issue that could cause or contribute to the death.\u201d The pathologists believe Floyd died at the scene. Crump said: \u201cFor George Floyd, the ambulance was his hearse.\u201d The family wants fired officer Derek Chauvin, who was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter last Friday, and the three officers who also detained Floyd but have yet to be arrested or charged, all to be charged with first-degree murder. A public memorial is planned for Floyd in Minneapolis on Thursday. He was originally from Houston, Texas, and there are plans for that city to be his final resting place, with details to be confirmed. The White House has released its readout of Trump\u2019s call with Russian President Vladimir Putin today, which came two days after the US president suggested inviting Putin to an expanded G7 summit. \u201cPresident Trump and President Putin discussed the latest efforts to defeat the coronavirus pandemic and reopen global economies,\u201d White House spokesperson Judd Deere said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump conveyed that the United States is working hard to care for Americans at home and provide assistance to other countries in need, including the donation of 200 ventilators to the Russian people. President Trump also reiterated the need for effective arms control. Additionally, the two leaders discussed progress toward convening the G7.\u201d White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany confirmed moments ago that the call had occurred, but she did not offer any details about what was discussed. The Kremlin said earlier today that the two leaders had discussed Trump\u2019s suggestion to invite Putin to the expanded summit, while the White House readout does not specfically mention the US president\u2019s invitation. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was opposed to allowing Russia to rejoin the G7, after Trump floated the idea of allowing Russian President Vladimir Putin to attend an expanded summit in September. \u201cRussia was excluded from the G7 after it invaded Crimea a number of years ago, and its continued disrespect and flaunting of international rules and norms is why it remains outside of the G7, and it will continue to remain out,\u201d Trudeau said during his daily news conference. The Canadian leader\u2019s comments come after a spokesperson for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would veto any proposal to allow Russia to rejoin the group. Trump said Saturday that he would cancel the next G7 summit, which was scheduled for June, and intead planned to hold an expanded summit in September and invite Russia, South Korea, Australia and India to the event. During a virtual roundtable with the mayors of Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, and St. Paul, Minnesota, Joe Biden sought advice on how to find the balance between \u201ckeeping people safe\u201d and \u201cacknowledging the incredible pain and anger that is the root of these protests.\u201d \u201cPeople are angry,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019m angry. And the fact is we need that anger, we need that to tell us to move forward, it helps us push through this pain to reach the other side, to hopefully greater progress, equality and inclusion and opportunity in our country.\u201d Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said community engagement was key, using her city as an example of how to build bridges between officers and the communities they police. After urgently pleading for calm following a violent night of protests on Friday, Bottoms said her city \u201cwas able to receive some grace\u201d in the streets. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot outlined the need for more training and community engagement for police officers. Biden then asked St Paul Mayor Melvin Carter whether it was a \u201cpipe dream\u201d to integrate officers so closely with the community that they know residents by name: \u201c\u2018Hey Deshaun, how are you?\u2019 Or \u2018hey George,\u2019\u201d he said, offering an example. Carter said he believed it was possible and that it was already happening in cities like St. Paul. \u201cAs we figure out how we move forward from this moment, one of the things that we\u2019re learning from people is that our residents are ... very willing if there\u2019s an avenue to speak up and protest peacefully,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what they\u2019re not willing to do is to return to quiet.\u201d After being rocked first by a public health crisis, then economic turmoil and now social unrest, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said what cities from the federal government was \u201cmoney and morals\u201d \u2013 a cash infusion to help cities deal with the compounding crises and leadership to help move the country forward. Earlier on Monday, Biden met with community leaders on Monday at Bethel AME Church in Wilmington, Delaware, a day after he visited some of the protest sites on Sunday. \u201cThe people in this room, we love you,\u201d state Senator Darius Brown told Biden. \u201cBut we\u2019re here not only to love you, but to push you, because if we can publicly support every other Democratic base, then we should publicly support the African-American Democratic base.\u201d White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany concluded her press briefing by playing clips of instances where police officers and protesters came together this weekend to honor the memory of George Floyd, such as the one below. \u201cAcross the country, we\u2019ve seen examples of police protecting protesters and protesters embracing police, and it\u2019s been beautiful to watch,\u201d McEnany said. The press secretary did not mention some of the more controversial encounters between police and protesters this weekend, such as when two NYPD cruisers drove into a crowd of protesters. McEnany said of the uplifting clips, \u201cThose images have not been played all that often.\u201d But that comment seemed odd considering some of the clips the press secretary showed had been taken directly from news broadcasts. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany insisted Trump is \u201chard at work,\u201d as the president receives criticisim for being relatively quiet about the George Floyd protests. \u201cI was on the phone with the president at least half a dozen times yesterday, and every time he was telling me about a different action he had taken,\u201d McEnany said. A number of commentators have suggested the president should deliver some kind of national address to respond to the nationwide unrest, but McEnany earlier dodged a question about whether Trump would do so. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany claimed Trump\u2019s comments to governors about needing to \u201cdominate\u201d the protests had been \u201ctaken out of context.\u201d \u201cWhat the president has said is he wants to dominate the streets with National Guard, with a police presence,\u201d McEnany said during her White House briefing. \u201cAnytime he\u2019s used the word \u2018dominate,\u2019 it is in regard to dominating the streets and ensuring we have peace in our streets.\u201d Speaking to governors earlier today, Trump said, \u201cYou have to dominate. If you don\u2019t dominate, you\u2019re wasting your time. They\u2019re going to run over you. You\u2019re going to look like a bunch of jerks.\u201d Massachusetts senator Ed Markey called Trump \u201cscum\u201d for how he has reponded to the George Floyd protests that are intensifying across the country. Many Democratic lawmakers have criticized the president for lashing out against the protesters, accusing him of intensifying divisions as the country grapples with the issue of police brutality. George Floyd\u2019s brother has arrived at the site of his brother\u2019s death, where Minneapolis residents have created a mural to honor his memory. Floyd\u2019s brother became very emotional upon arriving at the site, and others joined him in prayer when he kneeled on the ground. Floyd\u2019s brother implored the protesters to remain peaceful, insisting his late brother would not have wanted to see destruction taking place in his name. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to bring my brother back at all,\u201d Floyd\u2019s brother said of the demonstrations that have turned violent. \u201cMy family is a peaceful family; my family is God-fearing.\u201d Trump informed Russian President Vladimir Putin of his plan to host an expanded G7 summit in September during a phone call today. According to Reuters, the two leaders spoke about the potential G7 summit later this year, after Trump canceled the summit planned for June, and the OPEC deal on oil output cuts. The president said Saturday he wanted to invite Russia, as well as Australia, India and South Korea, to the expanded summit. However, the idea of inviting Putin was quickly met with criticism, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesperson said today that he would veto any effort to readmit Russia to the G7. Trump spoke to South Korean President Moon Jae-in today, two days after the US president floated the idea of allowing the foreign ally of joining an expanded G7 summit later this year. \u201cThe two leaders discussed a range of economic and national security issues, including the coronavirus pandemic and restoring the strength of the global economy,\u201d White House spokesperson Judd Deere said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump and President Moon also discussed progress toward convening the G7 later this year.\u201d Trump announced on Saturday that the June G7 summit would be canceled and he planned to host an expanded meeting in September, which would focus on confronting China. The president said he hoped to invite Russia, as well as South Korea, Australia and India, to the expanded summit. But the idea of inviting Vladimir Putin back to the G7, after Russia was ousted from the group over its annexation of Crimea, was quickly met with widespread criticism abroad. Jacksonville Jaguars safety Peyton Thompson has described the NFL\u2019s statement on the death of George Floyd as \u201ctrash\u201d and says he was told by his coaches not to kneel during the national anthem protests in 2016. \u201cThe statement issued by the @nfl is complete trash,\u201d Thompson wrote on Twitter on Monday. \u201cI specifically remember [Jaguars executive vice-president] Tom Coughlin and [head coach] Doug Marone telling us we couldn\u2019t kneel. Thank God we had an owner of minority [Shahid Khan] who weighed in and got us to kneel together! My job security was on the line if I supported my people.\u201d On Saturday, the NFL put out a statement saying it was saddened by the death of Floyd as well as the recent high-profile killings of two other African Americans, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Many pointed out that NFL teams have effectively exiled former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick after he highlighted the same racial injustice in the United States that has cost the lives of Americans such as Floyd, Arbery and Taylor. Houston Texans receiver Kenny Stills described the NFL\u2019s statement as \u201cbullshit\u201d. The league has also been criticized for its failure to recruit minority coaches. There were eight NFL head coaches from minority background in 2018, now there are four. Thompson\u2019s comments come as an increasing number of athletes from the NBA and NFL, in both of which the majority of players are black, express anger at racism in the United States. On Sunday Michael Jordan, widely acknowledged as the greatest NBA player in history, broke from his usual apolitical stance to condemn America\u2019s \u201cingrained racism\u201d. Others have pointed out the uncomfortable fact that it is most often rich white men who profit from young black men in US sports. North Carolina Central men\u2019s basketball coach LeVelle Moton said on Sunday he has been disappointed by the failure of white coaches to speak out about the death of Floyd. Moton, who is black, says that the top coaches, who are paid millions of dollars a year, profit from the African American community but do little to protect it. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Trump told governors they need to \u201cdominate\u201d the activists who are protesting the killing of George Floyd. The president repeatedly told governors that they needed to get tougher against the demonstrators, sparking alarm among those on the call. Barack Obama offered advice to the protesters while condemning violence from the demonstrations. \u201cIf, going forward, we can channel our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action, then this moment can be a real turning point in our nation\u2019s long journey to live up to our highest ideals,\u201d Obama wrote in a Medium post. One person was killed in Kentucky after police officers and the National Guard \u201creturned fire\u201d while trying to disperse a crowd of demonstrators in a Louisville parking lot. Democratic governor Andy Beshear said the incident would be investigated by the Kentucky state police. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The Guardian\u2019s Daniel Strauss reports: Donald Trump has urged governors, law enforcement officials and national security officials to take a more forceful approach in responding to protests around the country sparked by the death of George Floyd. The president held a call with officials on Monday morning, after a week of protests and riots around the US. On the call, the president urged governors and law enforcement officials to \u201cdominate\u201d the protesters, according to a source who listened in. Trump, the source said, repeatedly urged the participants to act more forcefully, and also urged the officials and governors not to be weak. Some governors pushed back, though others did not, at what multiple officials listening in characterized it as an extended rant by the president. Trump also said states should enact laws against flag burning. CBS News has obtained the audio of some of Trump\u2019s remarks to the country\u2019s governors, in which he urged the state leaders to \u201cdominate\u201d the activists protesting the killing of George Floyd. \u201cYou have to dominate,\u201d Trump says in the clip. \u201cIf you don\u2019t dominate, you\u2019re wasting your time. They\u2019re going to run over you. You\u2019re going to look like a bunch of jerks.\u201d As Trump told governors that they needed to \u201cdominate\u201d the demonstrators protesting the killing of George Floyd, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden was talking about how \u201cit matters what presidents say.\u201d Biden held an event at Bethel AME Church in Wilmington, Delaware, this morning to address the protests, marking his first in-person campaign event since March. The former vice president attended a Memorial Day event last week, which was his first public appearance since the start of the coronavirus crisis. During his video teleconference with the nation\u2019s governors, Trump told the state leaders that they needed to \u201cdominate\u201d the protesters, according to the Guardian\u2019s Daniel Strauss. The president repeatedly told the governors that they needed to take more severe action against the demonstrators who are protesting in response to the killing of George Floyd. Several people on the call were alarmed by the president\u2019s message, according to a Washington Post reporter. Trump reportedly told the nation\u2019s govenors that they needed to more harshly crack down on the George Floyd protests currently intensifying across the country. \u201cMost of you are weak,\u201d the president told the governors during a video teleconference, according to the Associated Press. The remarks appear to be another attempt by the president to shift responsibility from the federal government to state and local officials. Trump similarly insisted that states were in charge of overseeing and expanding coronavirus testing, as his administration was criticized for failing to meet testing demands amid the pandemic. DC mayor Muriel Bowser has announced the city will enforce a 7 pm curfew for the next two nights, after a church near the White House caught fire last night and police officers fired teargas into crowds of protesters. Bowser enforced an 11 pm curfew last night, which White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany criticized as too lenient in a Fox News interview this morning. \u201cI think when you look at some of the befuddling actions, like right here in DC, the mayor of D.C. didn\u2019t issue a curfew until 11 pm,\u201d McEnany said. \u201cWell, guess what? At 10 pm you had St. John\u2019s Church burning. Several other cities had curfews at 4 pm, at 5 pm, at 6 pm.\u201d McEnany added, \u201cSome of the actions are really not tough enough, as the president noted, particularly with the mayor here in DC.\u201d New York mayor Bill de Blasio added that he did not know his daughter had been arrested while protesting Saturday night until his office was contacted by journalists. \u201cI found out when my staff got the media inquiry,\u201d de Blasio told reporters this morning. \u201cI knew that she\u2019d been out protesting peacefully on Thursday night. I never heard from her after.\u201d According to reports, Chiara de Blasio, 25, was taken into custody after blocking an intersection in Manhattan. She gave her address as a residence on East End Avenue, where the mayor\u2019s home is located, but she did not tell police officers she was de Blasio\u2019s daughter. New York mayor Bill de Blasio said two NYPD cruisers driving into a crowd of protesters Saturday was \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cunacceptable.\u201d \u201cThere is no situation where a police vehicle should drive into a crowd of protesters or New Yorkers of any kind,\u201d de Blasio said. The mayor\u2019s comments came two days after a video of the incident went viral and sparked severe criticism of the NYPD. De Blasio initially offered a much softer review of the incident. \u201cI\u2019ve seen that video and I\u2019ve obviously heard about a number of other instances,\u201d the mayor said Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s inappropriate for protesters to surround a police vehicle and threaten police officers. That\u2019s wrong on its face, and that hasn\u2019t happened in the history of protests in the city.\u201d Well-known congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez took a much more severe line on the issue, saying the officers involved \u201cneed to be brought to justice.\u201d Leyland Cecco reports for the Guardian from Toronto, Canada: As protests intensified throughout the United States over the weekend, thousands also took to the streets in Canada, both to express outrage over the killing of George Floyd \u2014 but also to highlight systemic troubles rampant within Canada\u2019s own police systems. In Toronto, attendees paid to tribute to the life of 29-year-old Regis Korchinski-Paquet, an Afro-Indigenous woman who died last week after police responded to a mental health emergency at her family\u2019s apartment. Korchinski-Paquet fell 24 stories from her balcony\u2014 an incident a police watchdog is now probing. \u201cI want to acknowledge the hurt, frustration, anger and emotional fatigue many people are feeling across North America including in our own city,\u201d Toronto mayor John Tory said in a statement, praising the peaceful gathering. In Vancouver, thousands gathered downtown to pay tribute to Floyd, calling for justice after the unarmed Minnesota man was killed by a police officer. Large crowds also gathered in Montreal to protest against police brutality. \u201cIt\u2019s important for everyone to be here today so that we can have a lot of voices to say the George Floyd event is not a singular event,\u201d Marie-Livia Beauge, one of the event organizers, told the Canadian Press. \u201cIt keeps happening and it\u2019s happening here in Montreal so to be here together is to show solidarity and denounce the injustice.\u201d Organizers used the event to express anger over the killing of Floyd, but also of the victims of police violence within Montreal in recent years. Hours after the rally ended Sunday afternoon, police used teargas to disperse a small group of demonstrators that had returned to the city\u2019s police headquarters. Police claimed that protestors hurled projectiles at officers as the two sides clashed. A number of windows along the downtown Ste Catherine Street were also smashed. Barack Obama has once again weighed in on the George Floyd protests, suggesting the demonstrations could translate to \u201cpeaceful, sustained, and effective action\u201d to address structural racism. In a new Medium post, the former president applauded the peaceful protesters who had marched to draw attention to Floyd\u2019s killing, but he condemned those who had engaged in violent behavior. \u201cThe overwhelming majority of participants have been peaceful, courageous, responsible, and inspiring. They deserve our respect and support, not condemnation,\u201d Obama said. \u201cOn the other hand, the small minority of folks who\u2019ve resorted to violence in various forms, whether out of genuine anger or mere opportunism, are putting innocent people at risk.\u201d Obama emphasized that the protests had to translate into policy that would help to prevent more deaths like Floyd\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019ve heard some suggest that the recurrent problem of racial bias in our criminal justice system proves that only protests and direct action can bring about change, and that voting and participation in electoral politics is a waste of time,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t disagree more.\u201d He continued, \u201c[E]ventually, aspirations have to be translated into specific laws and institutional practices \u2014 and in a democracy, that only happens when we elect government officials who are responsive to our demands.\u201d Obama concluded by saying these protests could mark the beginning of a new chapter for the country. \u201cIf, going forward, we can channel our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action, then this moment can be a real turning point in our nation\u2019s long journey to live up to our highest ideals,\u201d he wrote. The Guardian\u2019s Chris McGreal, Julian Borger, Sam Levin and Maanvi Singh report: Protests in response to the killing of George Floyd continued across the country last night, as many cities\u2019 curfews went ignored by demonstrators. Here are some the key events that took place yesterday: Minneapolis: A fuel semi-truck drove into a demonstration of thousands of people on a bridge near the city\u2019s downtown, though authorities say no one was injured after the \u201cdisturbing\u201d incident. Outside the White House: Intense unrest broke out in Lafayette Park, right in front of the White House, when police advanced to enforce the curfew. The basement of the \u201cChurch of the Presidents,\u201d located opposite the White House briefly caught fire, before firefighters rushed to put it out. Elsewhere in Washington: Officers fired teargas into the crowds, and US marshals personnel and DEA agents were deployed in addition to national guard and Secret Service to assist the police. Los Angeles: Police fired teargas and other projectiles at protesters blocking a main shopping road in the Santa Monica neighborhood. On one shopping street numerous buildings and businesses were looted, including clothing and shoe stores. New York: Thousands of protesters returned to the streets, marching through Manhattan during the day and later congregating at Union Square, where numerous police cars had been torched on Saturday night. Fires were again set on the streets amid clashes between officers and protesters. Atlanta: Teargas was again used by police on the streets; two officers were fired and three placed on desk duty over excessive use of force on Saturday night. The blog will be following additional updates from each of those cities, so stay tuned. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said she would hold a briefing today at 2 pm ET, which did not appear on the original White House schedule. McEnany made the announcement during a Fox News interview, during which she was also asked if Trump would deliver a national address about the George Floyd protests. \u201cA national Oval Office address is not going to stop antifa. What\u2019s going to stop antifa is action,\u201d McEnany said, adding that Trump \u201chas several meetings pertaining to that today.\u201d \u201cAnd that\u2019s his focus, is acting and keeping our streets safe,\u201d McEnany said. Trump will meet today with attorney general William Barr, who spent the weekend echoing the president\u2019s talking points by blaming the protests on \u201cfar-left extremist groups\u201d and demanding \u201claw and order\u201d be restored. Several hundred \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d protesters marched on the headquarters of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s state government on Sunday to denounce a wave of police killings. Rio police gunned down 177 people in April - many of them young black men from Rio\u2019s favelas such as Jo\u00e3o Pedro Mattos Pinto. Jo\u00e3o Pedro, a church-going high school student, was gunned down on 18 May during a police raid on a favela in S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo, a city 10 miles northeast of the state capital. The 14-year-old had been playing with friends at the home of his uncle and aunt when heavily armed police stormed the building. Dozens of bullet holes were found inside the home and friends and relatives believe the teenager was shot through the back by police during the botched raid. Protestors at Sunday\u2019s demo demanded justice for Jo\u00e3o Pedro and carried banners reading: \u201cBlack and favela lives matter\u201d and \u201cStop killing us!\u201d Many drew parallels with the rallies taking place in the US in response to the killing of George Floyd. \u201cJust like our brothers and sisters across the Americas, we will shout: \u2018IF THERE IS NO JUSTICE, THERE WILL BE NO PEACE FOR OUR EXECUTIONERS\u2019,\u201d tweeted Buba Aguiar, a favela activist from west Rio. One poster circulated on social media featuring the pictures of both George Floyd and Jo\u00e3o Pedro. Further #VidasNegrasImportam (#BlackLivesMatter) protests are planned for this weekend amid growing anger that Rio\u2019s notoriously violent police force continues to launch often deadly assaults on the favelas despite the coronavirus crisis. Only once in the last 20 years have Rio police killed more people in a single month than in April 2020. A person died in Louisville early this morning after police officers and the Kentucky National Guard \u201creturned fire\u201d from a group of protestes, according to governor Andy Beshear. The Democratic governor said the Kentucky state police would \u201cindependently investigate the event.\u201d Louisville metro police chief Steve Conrad said his officers had been sent to disperse a crowd in a parking lot at approximately 12.15 am. \u201cOfficers and soldiers began to clear the lot and at some point were shot at,\u201d Conrad said in a statement. \u201cBoth LMPD and national guard members returned fire, we have one man dead at scene.\u201d Protests have been particularly tense in Louisville, where a black woman named Breonna Taylor was killed in her home in March by Louisville police while they were executing a \u201cno-knock\u201d warrant for her residence. Correction: A previous version of this post said the warrant was issued for Taylor\u2019s boyfriend, but it was issued for her residence in connection to a narcotics investigation, of which Taylor was not the main focus. This is Joan Greve, taking over for Martin Pengelly. The daughter of the current mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, was reportedly arrested during protests in Manhattan on Saturday night. Chiara de Blasio, 25, was reportedly taken into custody after refusing to move from the intersection of 12th Street and Broadway, where protesters were blocking traffic. According to the New York Post, de Blasio gave her address as a residence on East End Avenue, where the mayor\u2019s home is located, but she did not tell police officers who she was. About an hour after his daughter\u2019s arrest, de Blasio told protesters that it was \u201ctime to go home.\u201d \u201cWe appreciate and respect all peaceful protests, but now it is time for people to go home,\u201d de Blasio said at a press conference. \u201cIf you went out peacefully to make a point about the need for change, you have been heard and change is coming in the city. I have no doubt about that. It\u2019s time to go home so we can all move forward.\u201d Rudy Giuliani, former mayor of New York City, Trump personal attorney and key player in/cause of Trump\u2019s impeachment, is up and tweeting, giving voice to a theme we are sure to hear more and more as a presidential election draws near: Now with 7 days of Mob rule of cities with mostly DEMOCRAT MAYORS, it is obvious that these Mayors are incapable of protecting their citizens. They enable the rioters by abandoning police precincts for burning and ordering police to stand down and be assaulted without arrest.\u201d Trump himself put the Republican campaign message more pithily on Sunday night, tweeting Nixonianly, if also as Twitter noted gleefully Sam Waterston-ly: \u201cLAW &amp; ORDER!\u201d Many Democratic mayors, some of them African American, spoke to the nation via the Sunday talk shows. Among them, Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta, Muriel Bowser of Washington DC and Melvin Carter, mayor of St Paul, twin city of Minneapolis, the fierce centre of the current rage. Bottoms and Bowser gave a joint interview to NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. Giuliani followed up on Monday by claiming \u201ca riot was impossible when I was Mayor\u201d. It\u2019s true that he wasn\u2019t mayor, instead a candidate for mayor, when in September 1992 he stoked a racist riot by police officers. As we reported in 2016, officers dissatisfied with mayor David Dinkins marched across the Brooklyn Bridge and gathered at City Hall, where \u201cThe New York Times described \u2026 a \u201cbeer-swilling, traffic-snarling, epithet-hurling melee\u201d [and] Newsday compared city hall to an \u201cembassy in some far-off hostile land \u2026 under siege\u201d. Here\u2019s more from Spencer Ackerman, Lois Beckett and Jamiles Lartey: Giuliani\u2019s approach to policing created \u201can environment of terror for communities of color\u201d, said Lumumba Bandele, a lifelong New Yorker and police reform advocate. If he takes on a national role, \u201cWe should all be preparing for worst-case scenarios,\u201d he said. His record on police abuses and freedom of expression is \u201cfrightening\u201d, said Patrisse Cullors, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter. In bizarre scenes in Cincinnati on Sunday, a sheriff confirmed that a \u201cThin Blue Line\u201d flag was raised outside a law enforcement building, in place of the Stars and Stripes. Pictures of the flag went viral, stoking anger nationwide among people protesting the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man, the latest case to fuel the Black Lives Matter movement against police brutality. In the words of the Associated Press, \u201cthe Blue Lives Matter flag is a black-and-white US flag with a blue stripe replacing one white stripe. Thin Blue Line USA, the group that sells the flags, says the thin blue line represents officers in the line of duty and the black represents fallen officers.\u201d Cincinnati has like other major cities been the setting for protest over the last three nights. Local media has extensive coverage. On Sunday, Hamilton County sheriff Jim Neil said the American flag that usually flies outside the county Justice Center \u201cwas stolen during the Vandalism of the Justice Center. The Thin Blue Line was raised by our deputies to honor the CPD Officer who was shot. The flag has been removed and we will replace it with the American Flag in the morning.\u201d Local media reported that the officer in question had been struck on his helmet by a bullet, but was not injured. Chris Seelbach, chair of the Cincinnati city council, who was tagged in the sheriff\u2019s tweet, tweeted back at his fellow Democrat: \u201cShould have been replaced with American flag immediately. Not replaced with a politically charged blue lives matter flag when thousands are protesting in our streets because #BlackLivesMatter. Sheriff Neil has only made things worse. Again.\u201d In Portland, Oregon last year, a government employee won $100,000 in a settlement after she alleged she was bullied by fellow employees who displayed the flag in her office. As the AP reported then, in her lawsuit against Multnomah county, Karimah Guion-Pledgure said the flag demeaned the Black Lives Matter movement.\u201d In Cincinnati on Monday, local ABC affiliate WCPO reported that protest organisers had released a list of goals, intending \u201cto deliver a clear message to the media, local politicians, the Cincinnati police department and people of Cincinnati as to the goal of recent protests. \u201cThe first item on the list calls for Derek Chauvin, the officer arrested for Floyd\u2019s death, to receive the maximum sentence for his charges and for the other three officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death to be charged as well. \u201cThe remaining items on the list concern the Cincinnati area. Some of the items include a call for the demilitarization of the Cincinnati police department, independent internal affairs investigators and civilian oversight boards and a call for CPD officers to spend \u201880 hours a year volunteering in the communities they patrol\u2019.\u201d Here\u2019s some further reading from Nathan Robinson, on how across America, police are responding to peaceful protests with violence: On Donald Trump\u2019s schedule today, a meeting with attorney general William Barr, who over the weekend played legal bulldog to Trump\u2019s snapping German Shepherd (or Belgian Malinois?), making statements to back up the president\u2019s fury at \u201cantifa\u201d anti-fascist groups he blames for the trouble consuming the nation. Then, at 11am, Trump \u201chosts a video teleconference with governors, law enforcement, and national security officials on keeping American communities safe\u201d. On Twitter, the various former Republican consultants at the Lincoln Project, among others, have been attempting to fuel ridicule of the president for being taken on Friday night to the reinforced bunker under the White House which Dick Cheney and George W Bush used on and after 9/11. It might be a little unfair \u2013 the Secret Service determined to take the president there, the New York Times reported \u2013 but remember that the following morning Trump was up and crowing on Twitter about the \u201cvicious dogs\u201d and \u201cominous weapons\u201d that would\u2019ve awaited protesters in Lafayette Square had they somehow breached the White House walls. Many African American politicians, among them Washington mayor Muriel Bowser, rebuked Trump for using such imagery, redolent as it is of the worst excesses of authority in the civil rights era. Of William Barr, by the by, this is from Stuart Gerson, a former acting attorney general, to the New York Times, in a piece entitled \u201cWilliam Barr\u2019s State of Emergency\u201d: \u201cThose who think he\u2019s a tool of Donald Trump are missing the point. If anything, it\u2019s the other way around. Barr is vastly more intelligent than Donald Trump. What Trump gives Bill Barr is a canvas upon which to paint. Bill has longstanding views about how society should be organized, which can now be manifested and acted upon to a degree that they never could have before.\u201d As far as what Barr is hoping to do with his canvas, Gerson says he is committed to the \u201chierarchical\u201d and \u201cauthoritarian\u201d premise that \u201ca top-down ordering of society will produce a more moral society.\u201d \u2026and welcome to another day of coverage of the protests arising from the police killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man who died in Minneapolis a week ago, when a police officer kneeled on his neck. The US is now in the grip of the worst civil unrest since the assassination of Dr Martin Luther King Jr, in the violent year of 1968. With overnight curfews ignored, major and minor cities have become the scene of confrontation between protesters and riot police, looters and the national guard. Thousands have been arrested. There have been fatalities and frightening attacks. Fires have been reported in many cities, Washington and Philadelphia among them. Julian Borger, our world affairs editor, reports from DC: Violent protest has lapped up against the White House, where on Sunday night officials confirmed that Donald Trump was taken to a protective bunker on Friday. Trump, who did not address the nation on Sunday other than by tweeting \u2013 he did speak of his shock at Floyd\u2019s death in Florida on Saturday \u2013 blames leftwing agitators for the trouble and has tweeted harsh and insensitive words, attracting criticism from many sides for an abdication of leadership in a time of crisis. Here\u2019s a powerful piece from our columnist Robert Reich. And here\u2019s an equally powerful take from David Smith, our Washington bureau chief, who spoke to leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement about how this moment in American history has left the president exposed: LaTosha Brown, a civil rights activist and co-founder of Black Voters Matter: \u201cIf it would take the destruction of the country for him to protect his position, he is willing to do that. He has shown that he is willing to kill every single thing in this country, including its people, if it protects him. \u201cHe\u2019s willing to kill democracy. He is willing to kill any sense of real respect or trust in his government. He is willing to kill America\u2019s international and global relationships. He is a destroyer.\u201d All this, remember, comes on top of a coronavirus pandemic which has killed more than 104,000 people in America, cratering the economy and stoking political and cultural battles over how quickly to open back up. On Sunday, governors and mayors warned of the potential toll in Covid-19 cases from so many protests in so many tightly packed \u2013 and tightly wound \u2013 cities. More to come, as America wakes.",

It also supports eradication of existing diseases such as malaria and polio and promotes global public health.</p>\n    <p>While its role on emerging diseases is most familiar in the developed world, its practical involvement is far more marked in the global south, where it has been working to expand basic healthcare, support vaccination and sustain weak and often stressed health systems through its emergencies programmes.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is the WHO under fire from Trump?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Trump has presented <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/trump-who-china-white-house-us\">withdrawing funding and cutting ties with WHO</a> as a direct response to what he claims was its slow reaction in raising the alarm over the global threat from the coronavirus and being too \u201cChina-centric\u201d in its response. The allegation that the WHO was slow to warn of the risk of human-to-human transmission, and that it failed to cross-examine Chinese transparency early on, is largely not borne out by the evidence. And the organisation\u2019s funding was already in his sights on 7 February,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/02/10/trump-world-health-organization-funding-coronavirus-state-department-usaid-budget-cuts/\">when his administration was suggesting cutting the US contribution</a>&nbsp;by half.</p>\n    <p>The WHO, to whom the US theoretically contributes roughly 10-15% of its budget as its largest contributor, has been appealing for an extra $1bn to help fight the coronavirus. While the suspension of funding by the US for 60-90 days is relatively small \u2013 not least because the US is so far in arrears in its annual payments \u2013 a general US withdrawal from global health funding under the cover of this announcement would be very serious and felt most profoundly in places that need the most support.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont\"><b>Peter Beaumont</b></a>&nbsp;<i>and</i>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sarahboseley\"><b>Sarah Boseley</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The WHO has been criticised for consistently lauding China, even as questions emerged over the suppression of early warnings and information.

Hu Weifeng, a urologist at Wuhan central hospital, died on Friday after being treated for Covid-19 and related issues for more than four months, state broadcaster CCTV said. Meanwhile city-wide testing of 9.9 million people between 14 May and 1 June found no new cases of Covid-19, and&nbsp;300 asymptomatic cases.

AP reports that health officials only released the genome after a Chinese lab published it on a virology website on 11 January.

      "bodyText": "Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: Wuhan doctor dies after four-month illness A Wuhan doctor who worked with the coronavirus whistleblower Li Wenliang died of the virus last week, state media reported, becoming China\u2019s first Covid-19 fatality in weeks. Hu Weifeng, a urologist at Wuhan central hospital, died on Friday after being treated for Covid-19 and related issues for more than four months, state broadcaster CCTV said. Meanwhile city-wide testing of 9.9 million people between 14 May and 1 June found no new cases of Covid-19, and 300 asymptomatic cases. China does not count asymptomatic cases, meaning people who are infected with the virus but do not exhibit symptoms of the disease, as confirmed cases. Chinese officials delayed releasing virus genome for over a week The Associated Press is carrying a report that says Chinese officials sat on releasing the genetic map, or genome, of the coronavirus for over a week after multiple government labs had fully decoded it, not sharing details key to designing tests, drugs and vaccines. AP reports that health officials only released the genome after a Chinese lab published it on a virology website on 11 January. Even then, China stalled for at least two weeks more on giving the World Health Organization the details it needed, according to recordings of multiple internal meetings held by the UN health agency in January.

The Irish airline, which has warned it may cut up to 3,000 jobs in Europe, told staff in France it was imposing 20% salary cuts for flight crew and 10% for attendants. Those who are already on legal minimum wages will have their hours reduced. Staff unions have accused the company of \u201credundancy blackmail\u201d and acting like cowboys. \u201cFrance isn\u2019t the wild west,\u201d Damien Mourgues, a cabin crew union representative, told AFP. According to confidential documents seen by French media, Ryanair wrote to staff proposing wage cuts take effect from 1 July 2020. The lower wages would be progressively increased over the five years so flight crew would be paid their full current salaries by July 2025. The loss of salary works out at an average 12% over five years for the pilots. Ryanair also proposed to pay new pilots and co-pilots the lower wages. The Syndicat National des Pilots de Ligne said it had been given a maximum of five days to respond to the ultimatum. If not, it said the company warned it would have \u201cno choice\u201d but to lay off 29% of its pilots and 27% of co-pilots in France. The airline also wrote to cabin crew representatives proposing a 10% salary cut during the same five-year period and reducing their paid working time from 2,000 hours a year to 1,600 hours, meaning a loss of \u20ac308 (\u00a3274) a month for those earning \u20ac1,539 a month. The flight attendants\u2019 union, SNPNC-FO, said pay cuts would take cabin crew below the minimum wage and demanded \u201cexplanations to justify the planned loss of income\u201d but said Ryanair had not responded. SNPNC-FO said it had also been given five days to agree or face having 27 out of 160 France-based cabin staff laid off. Ryanair has confirmed it would have to lose up to 3,000 jobs and close certain bases in Europe until business recovers from the Covid-19 crisis. The company confirmed the proposed pay cuts and said it was in talks with French unions. \u201cThe measures are reasonable and time limited and aimed at saving as many jobs as possible at a moment when all airlines in Europe are losing jobs to survive this unprecedented crisis,\u201d Ryanair told RTL radio. In a company statement last month, Ryanair blamed the \u201cexpected significant decline\u201d in passenger traffic this year and accused European governments of distorting competition with \u201cselected state aid doping\u201d with \u20ac30bn bailout packages for rival airlines. Fiodor Rilov, a lawyer for SNPNC-FO, said Ryanair\u2019s proposals were \u201cunacceptable\u201d. \u201cThey can\u2019t use the Covid crisis as an excuse to implement significant wage cuts and call into question all the guarantees staff have managed to wrest from a difficult management.

Only their equipment would have given them away: metal detectors, a shovel and a spade, that they humped uncomfortably up a vertiginous path.</p> <p>They turned off the main road and drove a quarter of a mile down a single track dark with trees, past the occasional house and fields of rolling countryside. It was probably early morning when the car pulled up at a wooden fence, on which were carved the words \u201cGRAY HILL, COMPTON\u201d. From here, it is a stiff, scrambling climb up Gray Hill, towards a cluster of ancient standing stones that loom out of scrubland like broken teeth. Here, if the weather is clear, you can look out towards the Severn estuary.</p> <p>But these people \u2013 there was probably more than one of them \u2013 were not here to enjoy the view, but to commit a crime. Stealthily, they beep-beeped their way across the scrubland, metal detectors in hand. They dug four large holes, pocketing whatever they found, replaced the turf and disappeared. No one knows what they stole that day and no one knows how they came to be there; Gray Hill is not a place you happen upon by chance. But we know what they were doing: nighthawking, illegally metal-detecting for historic artefacts, to be kept for personal collections or sold on the black market for private gain.</p> <p>Even the coronavirus lockdown did not stop nighthawkers. The Gray Hill nighthawking was discovered by Gwent police on 6 May. A week earlier, on 20 April, PCSO Sarah Wilson of Cheshire police\u2019s rural crime team was on a routine patrol when she noticed two men metal-detecting in a stream in the village of Wildboarclough.</p> <p>Wilson asked the men if they had permission to metal-detect there and if they realised they were breaking the lockdown rules. The men claimed they thought metal-detecting was a form of permitted exercise (it was not), and said that they had been given permission by the landowner. Wilson took their details and went to check with the landowner. No consent had been given. Wilson had just caught two nighthawkers in the act \u2013 or she would have, had they not scarpered.</p> <p>No one knows the full extent of nighthawking in the UK, or whether it is increasing. There is no marker on the national police database for the crime, so police forces vary in how they record it (although there is one for nighthawking on scheduled monuments). Many simply mark it as theft, or trespass, while many cases are never reported because it is impossible to say what has been taken. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s just a hole in a field,\u201d says Dr Louise Nicholas, an expert on heritage crime at Loughborough University. A 2010 report from Historic England, however, hints at how widespread the crime may really be: 17% of the farmers it had surveyed had been afflicted by nighthawks. Nighthawkers have targeted some of our most famous historical sites, including Hadrian\u2019s Wall and Old Sarum in Dorset.</p> <p>Those tasked with fighting this crime also disagree on whether&nbsp;it is increasing. \u201cI think it is going up, as metal-detecting equipment becomes cheaper and more easily available, and more people take up the hobby,\u201d says Sgt Rob Simpson of Cheshire police\u2019s rural crime team. But Mark Harrison, who heads Historic England\u2019s nighthawking investigations, is not so sure. \u201cI am not seeing more cases in my in-tray,\u201d says the former policeman. According to Nicholas, \u201cThe data is really<em>&nbsp;</em>bad on it ... the data we have got suggests it is increasing, but that may be because more attention is paid to it now.\u201d In other words, we simply do not know, because most nighthawkers tend to get away with it. After all, who can police all the fields in the country?</p> <p>The law varies across the UK. In Northern Ireland, it is illegal to remove any archaeological items from the ground without the landowner\u2019s written consent. All objects found must be reported within two weeks. A similar law exists in Scotland. In England and Wales, you need permission from the landowner to go metal-detecting, unless the site is historically protected, in which case all metal-detecting is illegal. If you find treasure \u2013 gold or silver \u2013 you have to report it. Failure to do so is a crime. If your find is significant, you may be in line for financial compensation from the treasure valuation committee.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59428cb2bc6b063d0eb8841fd62b5ca6f9bb477b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59428cb2bc6b063d0eb8841fd62b5ca6f9bb477b/0_105_3508_2105/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Some of the treasures, believed to be Anglo-Saxon, that were discovered in the biggest nighthawking case in British history, involving George Powell and Layton Davies.

Privately, police officers express irritation that the show can be used as an idiot\u2019s guide to the choicest places to nighthawk. That, and a hi-vis vest: Harrison tells me that nighthawkers will don them in the middle of the day to give the impression of legitimacy.</p> <p>The biggest nighthawking case in British history took place in a field near Leominster in 2015. George Powell and Layton Davies found 300 Viking coins, as well as a ninth-century gold ring, dragon\u2019s head bracelet and crystal rock pendant, on land belonging to Lord Cawley of Leominster. The coins revealed an alliance between King Alfred and King Ceolwulf II that historians did not know existed \u2013 they literally rewrote history. The men did not hand in their find to the authorities, but sold almost all of it on the black market. In 2019, Powell and Davies were jailed for a combined 18 and a half years.</p> <p>Amanda Blakeman, the national police lead for heritage crime, tells me that the Leominster hoard was one of the most interesting cases of her career. \u201cIt would be a stretch to say they were organised criminals,\u201d she says of Powell and Davies. Their undoing, Blakeman says, came from their decision to take one of the coins to the National Museum of Wales. \u201cThey wanted to get an identification of what they had got, but they did not declare that they had recovered a significant amount of coins,\u201d she explains. Later, when Powell and Davies tried to offload the rest of the stash, a potential buyer became suspicious and contacted the police. \u201cDuring the subsequent investigation into how the coins came to be sold, we were able to find them, because they had made that initial visit to a museum,\u201d Blakeman says. (The museum had taken their details.)</p> <p>We may never know the true extent of what was lost. Apart from 31 coins and some jewellery, almost all of the Leominster hoard remains missing. \u201cThose coins dated from the Anglo-Saxon period, which is a relatively poorly understood period of history,\u201d Harrison says. \u201cBy removing the coins illegally, and not declaring the location they were found in, the context has been destroyed. We have lost the ability to learn more about the period they were from.\u201d</p> <p>Nighthawkers tend to offload their illicit gains through specialist dealers or online marketplaces such as eBay or Facebook. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any archaeological experts on staff at eBay UK who monitor sales to ensure that antiquities sourced from looting or nighthawking aren\u2019t being sold,\u201d says Dr Lauren Dundler of Macquarie University, an expert in stolen antiquities. \u201cThere are serious issues that need to be addressed in how Facebook Marketplace, and the wider platform, is regulated,\u201d she adds. \u201cExperts have been warning Facebook since 2014 that the platform could be utilised by illicit looters ... and yet nothing has been done.\u201d Some of these stolen antiquities are sold on private Facebook groups, but others are in plain sight.</p> <p>\u201cAll listings must comply with the law,\u201d an eBay spokesperson comments. \u201cOur listing policies are informed and influenced by experts from relevant organisations, including the British Museum and the International Council of Museums, and authorities including the Met Police. We also closely cooperate with these experts when enforcing our policies. We will remove any listings that do not comply, and take action against the sellers.\u201d</p> <p>At Facebook, meanwhile, a spokesperson says: \u201cCoordinating illegal activity is not allowed on Facebook. We are continuing to improve the methods we use to detect and remove posts and listings that involve the illegal sale of historical artefacts.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Powell and Davies are not the only nighthawkers to defraud us of our cultural history. In 2012, Peter Cox and Darren West looted artefacts from the site of a former Roman town in Northamptonshire. Mark Harrison of Historic England says that because Cox and West kept returning to the scene of the crime, they were caught red-handed. \u201cTheir holes were so big that we thought some form of archeological excavation had been going on,\u201d says Harrison, \u201cso we sent some inspectors to assess the damage. They caught them in the act \u2026 when we downloaded their cameras, we found that they had taken pictures of themselves digging the holes.\u201d</p> <p>Wait a minute, I say. They actually photographed themselves committing a crime? Harrison\u2019s stern mien slips for a second. \u201cIt\u2019s like a fisherman,\u201d he says. \u201cThey want to take a picture of the fish.\u201d</p> <p>Is there a profile of a typical nighthawker? Harrison says not. \u201cAnyone could be involved in it,\u201d he says darkly. Other experts agree. But reading through the list of nighthawking cases Harrison has worked on during his career \u2013 he helpfully sends it over \u2013 a few things stand out. Every case involved a white male, usually middle-aged, working alone or in a pair. One case even involved a former police officer.</p> <p>What makes someone wave a metal detector in a rainy, pockmarked field for hours on end? \u201cFor those who don\u2019t do it, metal-detecting is seen as a strange passion,\u201d says Professor Michael Lewis of the British Museum. Catherine Lange of the National Council for Metal Detecting attempts to explain its appeal. \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2026 opening a Christmas present,\u201d Lange says. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way I can describe it. I bring things home and my husband rolls his eyes and I think, \u2018That\u2019s something we lost 700 years ago and it\u2019s still there.\u2019\u201d She exhales. \u201cI find that <em> </em>fascinating.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9e2b85c0f1ef6d3578310f613679520fe26df5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c9e2b85c0f1ef6d3578310f613679520fe26df5e/0_306_5120_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Man with metal detector silhouetted against  blue sky\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Archaeologists rely on the goodwill of the metal-detecting community to record their finds.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Burt/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The police take nighthawking seriously. But there is a split over the best way to deal with metal detectorists who do not technically break the law, but hang on to items that they should be handing in. In England and Wales, treasure must be reported. But other archeological finds, such as belts, buckles, fragments of Anglo-Saxon pottery, you can keep. Metal detectorists are strongly encouraged to hand them in to the British Museum and the National Museum Wales\u2019s <a href=\"https://finds.org.uk/database\">portable </a><a href=\"https://finds.org.uk/database\">antiquities </a><a href=\"https://finds.org.uk/database\">scheme</a> (PAS), so that historians can document them for posterity. But it is not illegal if you do not. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, however, all archeological finds have to be reported.</p> <p>Not everyone thinks our leniency is a good thing. \u201cThe portable antiquities scheme tries to make it look like metal detectorists are helping archeology,\u201d says Paul Barford, an archeologist and blogger. \u201cThat would be true if the majority of stuff were being reported. But it\u2019s not! People are just walking off with objects.\u201d Barford would like to see metal-detecting become taboo to prevent this plundering. \u201cPeople need to start thinking, \u2018Is this right?\u2019\u201d Barford says. \u201cIt should be socially unacceptable. That\u2019s the way artefact-hunting should have been treated all along.\u201d</p> <p>Barford is a controversial figure \u2013 many in the archeological establishment do not agree with him, at least not publicly. Barford characterises himself as an outsider who can say what he is thinking without fear of losing funding: \u201cPeople are afraid to speak out.\u201d There may be some truth to his claim. One 2017 paper <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311886.2017.1298397\">suggested</a> there could be between 14,419 and 27,897 metal detectorists in England and Wales, and that even if the lower estimate was accepted, only 30% of them were reporting any of their finds to the PAS. (These figures have been disputed.)</p> <p>Lewis heads the PAS, and accepts that the system is imperfect. \u201cThe problem we have is that we can\u2019t instruct people that they <em>have </em>to record their finds, we can only advise them that they should,\u201d he says. \u201cI would like a bit more of a stick to go with a carrot at times.\u201d</p> <p>He would like to see metal detectorists having to sign up to codes of practice and promising to register their finds. \u201cThe way I see it is that all these objects out there are like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle,\u201d Lewis says, \u201cand the more we have of them, the bigger our picture of the past. If people aren\u2019t reporting their finds, the picture isn\u2019t as big as it could be. It\u2019s a bigger picture than just nighthawking.\u201d But he believes that most metal detectorists are<em> </em>responsible and do hand things in.</p> <p>And Lewis is adamant that stigmatising detectorists is not the way to go. \u201cWe\u2019d lose a lot of information in this country if we banned metal-detecting,\u201d he says. \u201cMany of the most important archeological finds in Britain over the last 20 years have come through metal-detecting.\u201d The Staffordshire hoard, the Watlington hoard, the Frome hoard: all were found by metal detectorists who did the right thing. Because they were on private land, they could have been destroyed by agricultural ploughing, had they not been detected.</p> <p>Archaeologists rely on the goodwill of the metal-detecting community to record their finds and, at the moment, relations are good \u2013 but this wasn\u2019t always the case. In the 1980s, the Stop Taking Our Past campaign tried to have metal-detecting banned, but failed. The rift between archeologists and the metal-detecting community took decades to heal. \u201cHostility doesn\u2019t help anybody,\u201d says Lange. \u201cAll it does is drive it underground.\u201d</p> <p>She dislikes the term nighthawking. \u201cWe want it called what it is,\u201d Lange says, \u201cwhich is theft. There\u2019s almost a romanticism about the word nighthawking.\u201d She hates the way that responsible detectorists get lumped in with the criminals. \u201cPeople think that\u2019s what metal detectorists do, and that\u2019s not what we recognise among our members,\u201d she says. \u201cWe know the vast majority report their finds.\u201d</p> <p>Lange reports all her finds. Recently, she discovered a 14th-century brooch in the north Oxfordshire countryside. \u201cIt was bronze and had three lions on it with their tails wiggling around,\u201d she says reverentially. She gave it back to the landowner, who will donate it to the local village\u2019s archives for posterity.</p> <p>A lion\u2019s head brooch winking in the soil. A pot of gold buried by departing Viking invaders in the certainty that they would return. A bracelet warmed on the body of a woman now turned to dust, whose name has been forgotten. All these things and more, glinting relics of our common history, salvaged from the earth. Yours to find, if not to keep.</p> <p><br></p>",

I bring things home and my husband rolls his eyes and I think, \u2018That\u2019s something we lost 700 years ago and it\u2019s still there.\u2019\u201d She exhales. \u201cI find that fascinating.\u201d The police take nighthawking seriously. But there is a split over the best way to deal with metal detectorists who do not technically break the law, but hang on to items that they should be handing in. In England and Wales, treasure must be reported. But other archeological finds, such as belts, buckles, fragments of Anglo-Saxon pottery, you can keep. Metal detectorists are strongly encouraged to hand them in to the British Museum and the National Museum Wales\u2019s portable antiquities scheme (PAS), so that historians can document them for posterity. But it is not illegal if you do not. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, however, all archeological finds have to be reported. Not everyone thinks our leniency is a good thing. \u201cThe portable antiquities scheme tries to make it look like metal detectorists are helping archeology,\u201d says Paul Barford, an archeologist and blogger. \u201cThat would be true if the majority of stuff were being reported. But it\u2019s not! People are just walking off with objects.\u201d Barford would like to see metal-detecting become taboo to prevent this plundering. \u201cPeople need to start thinking, \u2018Is this right?\u2019\u201d Barford says. \u201cIt should be socially unacceptable. That\u2019s the way artefact-hunting should have been treated all along.\u201d Barford is a controversial figure \u2013 many in the archeological establishment do not agree with him, at least not publicly. Barford characterises himself as an outsider who can say what he is thinking without fear of losing funding: \u201cPeople are afraid to speak out.\u201d There may be some truth to his claim. One 2017 paper suggested there could be between 14,419 and 27,897 metal detectorists in England and Wales, and that even if the lower estimate was accepted, only 30% of them were reporting any of their finds to the PAS. (These figures have been disputed.) Lewis heads the PAS, and accepts that the system is imperfect. \u201cThe problem we have is that we can\u2019t instruct people that they have to record their finds, we can only advise them that they should,\u201d he says. \u201cI would like a bit more of a stick to go with a carrot at times.\u201d He would like to see metal detectorists having to sign up to codes of practice and promising to register their finds. \u201cThe way I see it is that all these objects out there are like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle,\u201d Lewis says, \u201cand the more we have of them, the bigger our picture of the past. If people aren\u2019t reporting their finds, the picture isn\u2019t as big as it could be. It\u2019s a bigger picture than just nighthawking.\u201d But he believes that most metal detectorists are responsible and do hand things in. And Lewis is adamant that stigmatising detectorists is not the way to go. \u201cWe\u2019d lose a lot of information in this country if we banned metal-detecting,\u201d he says. \u201cMany of the most important archeological finds in Britain over the last 20 years have come through metal-detecting.\u201d The Staffordshire hoard, the Watlington hoard, the Frome hoard: all were found by metal detectorists who did the right thing. Because they were on private land, they could have been destroyed by agricultural ploughing, had they not been detected. Archaeologists rely on the goodwill of the metal-detecting community to record their finds and, at the moment, relations are good \u2013 but this wasn\u2019t always the case. In the 1980s, the Stop Taking Our Past campaign tried to have metal-detecting banned, but failed. The rift between archeologists and the metal-detecting community took decades to heal. \u201cHostility doesn\u2019t help anybody,\u201d says Lange. \u201cAll it does is drive it underground.\u201d She dislikes the term nighthawking. \u201cWe want it called what it is,\u201d Lange says, \u201cwhich is theft. There\u2019s almost a romanticism about the word nighthawking.\u201d She hates the way that responsible detectorists get lumped in with the criminals. \u201cPeople think that\u2019s what metal detectorists do, and that\u2019s not what we recognise among our members,\u201d she says. \u201cWe know the vast majority report their finds.\u201d Lange reports all her finds. Recently, she discovered a 14th-century brooch in the north Oxfordshire countryside. \u201cIt was bronze and had three lions on it with their tails wiggling around,\u201d she says reverentially. She gave it back to the landowner, who will donate it to the local village\u2019s archives for posterity. A lion\u2019s head brooch winking in the soil. A pot of gold buried by departing Viking invaders in the certainty that they would return. A bracelet warmed on the body of a woman now turned to dust, whose name has been forgotten. All these things and more, glinting relics of our common history, salvaged from the earth. Yours to find, if not to keep.",

      "bodyText": "What\u2019s happening from Monday? All international arrivals into the UK, including returning British residents, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. They will be required to fill in a contact locator form with contact and travel information so they can be reached if they, or someone they may have been in contact with, develops coronavirus. The exemptions list includes road haulage workers, a registered health or care professional travelling to the UK to provide essential healthcare and Eurotunnel drivers. What can and can\u2019t I do while under quarantine? The rules mirror those established for people self-isolating with coronavirus symptoms. Individuals quarantining will be permitted to shop for food essentials and medicines but only if it is not possible to rely on others, and will be able to take public transport to their designated accommodation. A breach of self-isolation would be punishable with a \u00a31,000 fixed penalty notice in England or potential prosecution and unlimited fine. The devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will set out their own enforcement approaches. About a fifth of people are expected to receive a spot-check to ensure that they are staying at the address or addresses they have provided to the authorities, the Guardian understands. Why is the UK bringing in quarantine rules now? Amid the worldwide pandemic, arrivals at UK airports have fallen by 99% compared with a year ago, arrivals by sea are 97% lower and international rail arrivals are down by 98%. But the government says it is the right time to introduce the rules because the number of new arrivals is expected to rise as lockdowns are eased, at the same time as the rate of domestic Covid-19 infection in the UK is falling. However, the timing is contentious. Some have questioned the logic of blanket quarantine measures at a time when most European countries are in a much improved position than that of the UK. Why is it causing a political row? Dozens of cross-party MPs have raised concerns about the potentially limited impact on public health amid warnings of the severe damage that could be caused to the travel and aviation industry. More than 200 travel and hospitality companies have called on the government to change planned quarantine rules, which they say will be unworkable and deeply damaging to their industry. Are there alternatives to quarantine? There have been calls from the travel industry and politicians for \u201cair bridges\u201d to be introduced, allowing quarantine-free travel to and from countries with low Covid-19 infection rates. However, this proposal overlooks one significant requirement: the reciprocal agreement of the destination country. At a time when the UK has some of the worst infection rates in Europe, it is unlikely that all countries will be willing to welcome UK residents or allow their own citizens to travel to and return from the UK. Earlier this week, Denmark eased its border restrictions to allow travel to Norway and Germany but not to its neighbour Sweden due to the latter\u2019s controversial approach to tackling Covid-19. A few countries, such as France, have indicated they would be willing to do a deal with Britain that could allow some travel to continue. What have other countries done? Many countries in Europe are requiring a similar period of quarantine to the UK\u2019s. However, the big difference in the UK\u2019s approach is not now but what it did earlier on in the pandemic. Prof Gabriel Scally, president of epidemiology and public health at the Royal Society of Medicine, previously described the UK as an outlier in its approach to the border with more than 130 countries introducing more stringent restrictions when the coronavirus outbreak began. These included screening, quarantine and bans on travel from high-risk areas. Conversely, as the UK is set to introduce its most restrictive measures at the border to date, many countries are now looking at ways to slowly ease restrictions that have been in place since March. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 June 2020 because an earlier version omitted to make clear that individuals quarantining will be permitted to shop for food essentials and medicines, but only if it is not possible to rely on others.",

The decision to base the new boundaries on the electoral register as it stands in December this year would also greatly skew the process, Labour is arguing, as the chaos caused by coronavirus will depress numbers on electoral rolls, and many students might not be registered. The parliamentary boundaries bill, which sets the process in motion, will be scrutinised on Tuesday by the Commons for the first time, as it receives its second reading. The initial plan had been for boundaries to be redrawn through reducing the size of the Commons from 650 seats to 600, but this element has been abandoned, in part due to unrest among Conservative MPs whose seats would have vanished.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is under pressure to immediately publish the findings of an inquiry into why black and minority ethnic groups have been disproportionately affected by coronavirus, after accusations that it has been delayed over fears it could stoke racial tensions. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, and Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said the government must \u201cpublish it now\u201d so action could be taken. Starmer said the government should \u201cstop the excuses\u201d, while Khan said \u201cholding back this report does nothing except prolong this inequality and could cost more lives\u201d. The report was scheduled to be released by the end of May but it was delayed and is now not expected until the end of this week at the earliest. Sky News had reported that the review\u2019s release had been postponed because of \u201cworries\u201d around \u201ccurrent global events\u201d. A source was quoted as saying there were concerns in Whitehall about the \u201cclose proximity to the current situation in America\u201d, where protesters are demanding an end to police violence against black people. The source reportedly said it would be a \u201cbad combination\u201d if the review was released amid such tensions. Public Health England would initially say only that the \u201creport will be published shortly\u201d. The Department for Health and Social Care later added: \u201cIt is not true to say this has been delayed due to global events.\u201d On Monday night, the department denied reports the delay was caused by official concerns of potential civil unrest linked to global anger over the death of George Floyd, an African American man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on his neck. \u201cMinisters received initial findings today. They are being rapidly considered and a report will be published this week,\u201d a spokeswoman said. However, the department has refused to put a firm date on when the report will be published, with government sources only saying that it was sent to ministers on Monday for review. The report was commissioned to analyse how factors such as ethnicity, obesity and gender can affect people\u2019s vulnerability to Covid-19. Health bosses sought \u201cinsight\u201d after it was reported that deaths among BAME communities were disproportionately high. Analysis by University College London has found BAME people are two to three times more likely to die from Covid-19 than the general population. Campaigners said it was imperative that the inquiry was published as soon as possible so action could be taken to mitigate risks to vulnerable people. Dr Zubaida Haque, the interim director of the Runnymede Trust, said: \u201cThere is well-documented evidence of racial disparities, not only in in the pre-existing disparities leading up to Covid-19, as well as the outcome of Covid-19, but also how BAME people have been treated by authorities during Covid-19. So I think in that sense, there is unease and anxiety about why it\u2019s delayed. \u201cGiven the global protests around racial inequalities, it\u2019s a sensitive issue, because I think we are aware that not only do racial disparities exist in Covid-19 deaths, we are also aware that there are racial disparities in people\u2019s socioeconomic, housing and labour market status as well but also acutely aware that during Covid-19 there have been racial inequalities in the way BAME people have been fined by police using their Covid-19 powers. There have been some cases of disproportionate use of force against black people during the lockdown.\u201d Simon Woolley, the director of Operation Black Vote, said: \u201cMy view is that we need to have this report sooner rather than later. The impact on black and minority ethnic communities has been devastating and we want to work with the government on understanding the data but even more importantly having solutions to close what we see are some of the fundamental disparity gaps that have exacerbated the impact, the death, and heartache that coronavirushas had on black and minority ethnic communities.\u201d There was also criticism of the delay from unions representing healthcare workers. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the British Medical Association council\u2019s chair, whose demand for a review in April, in an interview with the Guardian, helped bring the issue to public attention, said: \u201cThe government-commissioned review by Public Health England needs to be concluded as soon as possible in order for us to make sense of why this dreadful virus is impacting so adversely on the BAME community and what needs to be done to urgently protect them.\u201d Dame Donna Kinnair, the Royal College of Nursing chief executive and general secretary, said: \u201cThe Public Health England review must be published as a matter of urgency.

      "bodyText": "The UK\u2019s fishing industry has accused the EU of using a \u201cnuclear option\u201d to secure a Brexit deal, warning that it is prepared for blockades by the French if trade talks collapse. Fishing leaders have also revealed they do not support an extension to the transition period despite being hit badly by the coronavirus pandemic, with the closure of restaurants and hotels affecting sales. Barrie Deas, the chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen\u2019s Organisations said the industry is relishing liberation from the common fisheries policy, claiming decades of injustices, such as French boats being allowed to catch 84% of the quota of cod in the Channel, for instance. Deas claims the EU\u2019s \u201chardline position\u201d involves zero compromise and \u201crequires capitulation\u201d by the UK over its demands for a fairer share of the catch from British waters. Fishing makes up 0.1% of the UK economy but it has found itself at the centre of the trade row because it is so emblematic of Brexit, with communities demanding the government \u201ctakes back control\u201d of British waters. Talks are at a crunch stage, with the EU saying there can be no trade deal without an agreement on fisheries by the end of June to allow fresh quota levels to be set for January next year when the transition period is due to end. \u201cThis is something of a nuclear option \u2026 so far, there\u2019s no sign of compromise from the member states, particularly the member states that benefit from the current arrangements, and the EU mandate doesn\u2019t really provide any scope for compromise, what it requires is capitulation by the UK. My assessment is that that\u2019s not very likely \u2013 fishing remains an emblematic issue for the government,\u201d said Deas. His comments came as the fourth round of Brexit talks about trade and the future relationship between the UK and the EU began on Tuesday. In the past week, both sides have lowered their expectations, saying they think it is unlikely the impasse on fisheries and other issues will be broken. At a press briefing, Deas said the industry did not support an extension to the transition period and that skirmishes between English and French fishing leaders would be almost inevitable. \u201cFrance benefits more than anybody else from relative stability from the current quota shares. If there\u2019s any change to that, those quota shares or any other aspect that affects French fishermen, as day follows night there will be blockades, they have done it for much less in the past,\u201d said Deas. He said other countries take \u201ca much more pragmatic\u201d view and recognise that \u201cquota shares will have to change\u201d. \u201cThere will be a reaction in France by the fishermen, that\u2019s just the nature of the beast,\u201d he said but added that that was not a reason \u201cnot to do what we\u2019re doing\u201d or to extend the transition period. Two years ago, British and French boats clashed in the Channel in what became known as the \u201cscallop wars\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Did Donald Trump just declare war on the US? Because that is certainly what it sounded like.</p> <p>After spending the weekend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/trump-flees-to-bunker-as-protests-over-george-floyd-rage-outside-white-house\">hiding in a bunker</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/george-floyd-donald-trump-protests-violence-looting\">firing off&nbsp;incendiary tweets</a>, Trump finally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/trump-george-floyd-protests-military-deploy\">addressed the country</a> on Monday evening. In his first official speech since the killing of George Floyd by police <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-protests-take-place-in-cities-around-the-world\">sparked global protests</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BunkerBoy\">#BunkerBoy</a>&nbsp;stood in the White House Rose Garden and threatened to mobilise the American military against the American people. Branding himself the \u201cpresident of law and order\u201d, Trump vowed that, if violence and looting continued, and mayors and governors did not take action, he would&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/jun/02/trump-threatens-to-deploy-military-against-protesters-video\">\u201cdeploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem\u201d</a>. It is no exaggeration to say that the president of the US, the country that likes to declare itself the world\u2019s greatest democracy, threatened to implement martial law.</p> <p>It feels as if the US is at a turning point. The unrest sweeping the country could be the undoing of Trump \u2013 or it could dramatically increase his power. Which will it be? Toss a coin. Heads means this is the beginning of the end of Trump\u2019s presidency, tails means we can expect another term.</p> <p>I am not being flippant; I am trying to be realistic. There has been a lot of speculation about how the protests will affect Trump\u2019s chance of re-election, but the truth is that none of us, not even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2018/jan/06/trump-tweets-i-am-a-stable-genius-video\">a very stable genius</a> such as me, know how this will play out. By rights, a million different crises \u2013 from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-russia-inquiry\">the Russia investigation</a> to the disputed accusation that he raped the journalist&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/30/e-jean-carroll-trump-rape-accuser-dna-sample\">E Jean Carroll</a>&nbsp;to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/trump-poll-numbers-dip-handling-coronavirus\">his handling of the pandemic</a> \u2013 should have sunk Trump by now. But when it comes to this president, the normal rules do not seem to apply. One week, Trump is suggesting that we <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/trump-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus-claims-reaction\">inject bleach to ward off the coronavirus</a>, the next he is threatening martial law. Everyone is shocked for a second, then we move on to his next drama.</p> <p>There is a school of thought that argues the urban uprisings in the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/31/opinions/carnage-trump-right-and-wrong-answers-avlon/index.html\">will help Trump</a>. There have been numerous <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-06-01/trump-riots-protests-military\">comparisons to&nbsp;1968</a>, when Richard Nixon exploited an anti-riot backlash and rode a law-and-order platform to electoral victory. Trump seems to be trying his best to pull a Nixon. Before his extraordinary speech on Monday, he held an equally&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/donald-trump-protests-george-floyd-dominate\">extraordinary&nbsp;video conference</a>&nbsp;with governors and law enforcement officials. On the call, Trump told participants that they were \u201cweak\u201d and needed to \u201cdominate\u201d the protesters. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you\u2019ll never see this stuff again,\u201d&nbsp;Trump said. In other words: lock up a lot of people who might not vote for him. That is one way to win an election.</p> <p>There is another school of thought, however, that reckons this moment will harm Trump more than it helps him. He may be trying to ape Nixon, but there are enormous differences between 1968 and 2020 \u2013 not least the fact that Nixon was not trying to win a second term. Trump is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-retweets-account-slamming-democrats-as-floyd-protests-erupt-2020-5\">doing his best to blame Democrats</a>&nbsp;for the unrest, but he can\u2019t get around the fact that he is the president. He is the one who is supposed to be in charge.</p> <p>Again, it is too early to say how the situation will play out for Trump.

      "bodyText": "Did Donald Trump just declare war on the US? Because that is certainly what it sounded like. After spending the weekend hiding in a bunker and firing off incendiary tweets, Trump finally addressed the country on Monday evening. In his first official speech since the killing of George Floyd by police sparked global protests, #BunkerBoy stood in the White House Rose Garden and threatened to mobilise the American military against the American people. Branding himself the \u201cpresident of law and order\u201d, Trump vowed that, if violence and looting continued, and mayors and governors did not take action, he would \u201cdeploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem\u201d. It is no exaggeration to say that the president of the US, the country that likes to declare itself the world\u2019s greatest democracy, threatened to implement martial law. It feels as if the US is at a turning point. The unrest sweeping the country could be the undoing of Trump \u2013 or it could dramatically increase his power. Which will it be? Toss a coin. Heads means this is the beginning of the end of Trump\u2019s presidency, tails means we can expect another term. I am not being flippant; I am trying to be realistic. There has been a lot of speculation about how the protests will affect Trump\u2019s chance of re-election, but the truth is that none of us, not even a very stable genius such as me, know how this will play out. By rights, a million different crises \u2013 from the Russia investigation to the disputed accusation that he raped the journalist E Jean Carroll to his handling of the pandemic \u2013 should have sunk Trump by now. But when it comes to this president, the normal rules do not seem to apply. One week, Trump is suggesting that we inject bleach to ward off the coronavirus, the next he is threatening martial law. Everyone is shocked for a second, then we move on to his next drama. There is a school of thought that argues the urban uprisings in the US will help Trump. There have been numerous comparisons to 1968, when Richard Nixon exploited an anti-riot backlash and rode a law-and-order platform to electoral victory. Trump seems to be trying his best to pull a Nixon. Before his extraordinary speech on Monday, he held an equally extraordinary video conference with governors and law enforcement officials. On the call, Trump told participants that they were \u201cweak\u201d and needed to \u201cdominate\u201d the protesters. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you\u2019ll never see this stuff again,\u201d Trump said. In other words: lock up a lot of people who might not vote for him. That is one way to win an election. There is another school of thought, however, that reckons this moment will harm Trump more than it helps him. He may be trying to ape Nixon, but there are enormous differences between 1968 and 2020 \u2013 not least the fact that Nixon was not trying to win a second term. Trump is doing his best to blame Democrats for the unrest, but he can\u2019t get around the fact that he is the president. He is the one who is supposed to be in charge. Again, it is too early to say how the situation will play out for Trump. It is, however, fair to say that Trump is in trouble \u2013 and he knows it. The protests don\u2019t exist in a vacuum: the coronavirus crisis means one in four American workers has filed for unemployment benefits and some of the country\u2019s swing states are expected to see prolonged job losses. Trump is also doing very badly in the polls: Joe Biden has a 10-point lead over him in an ABC News/Washington Post poll from Sunday and the president\u2019s approval rating has dipped below 43%. Trump is in trouble, which means trouble for the US. As the president made clear in his speech on Monday, he will not disappear without a fight \u2013 no matter how much collateral damage that causes. Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist",

      "bodyText": "Electric and hybrid cars gained traction among European buyers in April despite coronavirus lockdowns stalling the market, suggesting carmakers are likely to avoid potential fines potentially worth billions of euros if they fail to reduce average emissions. Battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid cars accounted for 17% of sales across all European markets, including the UK, in April, according to data collated by industry analysts Jato Dynamics. That was more than double the 7% market share achieved in April 2019. The data show buyers were more likely to opt for electric and hybrid cars even as overall sales fell dramatically. Total car sales, including petrol and diesel models, fell from 1.34m units in April 2019 to 292,600 vehicles in April 2020, the lowest level since the 1970s, Jato said. Sales of battery electric cars fell by 29% during the month compared with the previous year, but performed far stronger than the 78% decline seen across the market as a whole as sales of petrol and diesel cars decreased much faster. Sales of plug-in hybrid cars rose by 7% according to Jato. Volkswagen, Volvo and Ford all benefited from strong growth in sales of plug-in hybrids. The data suggests that \u2013 if the market share gains are sustained as showrooms in the UK and Europe reopen \u2013 carmakers are making progress towards meeting emissions reductions targets that came into force at the start of the year.

Cities still have a future, but the specific kind of&nbsp;city&nbsp;that has become globally dominant today shouldn\u2019t have a place in it.</p> <p>In&nbsp;places&nbsp;like London and New York, the development model over the past few decades has catered to the needs of elite individuals, powerful corporations and wealthy investors. These cities have been inundated with luxury housing, expensive office buildings, new business districts, amenities for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/1671891/did-the-creative-class-really-save-your-city-probably-not\">so-called \u201ccreative class\u201d</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/11/19/how-landscape-urbanism-is-making-gentrification-look-like-fun/\">aspirational High Line-style park areas</a>. Urban space has been optimised for rent extraction, real estate speculation and gentrification. Governments have pursued private sector profitability and deferred to middle-class tastes, and have been lauded by urbanists for doing so \u2013 all while allowing the deterioration of social services and public institutions&nbsp;and the intensification of inequality.</p> <p>Even before the pandemic, this paradigm was a disaster. A set of intersecting crises has made urban life increasingly difficult for all but the wealthy. Housing has become unaffordable and insecure. Work has become casualised and wages have stagnated, leaving many workers unable to sustain an adequate standard of living. Despite pretensions towards multiculturalism, a white power structure has maintained <a href=\"https://www.runnymedetrust.org/projects-and-publications/equality-and-integration/london-ethnic-inequalities.html\">racialised inequalities</a> in nearly all aspects of economic and political life, including <a href=\"http://www.irr.org.uk/news/the-london-clearances-a-background-paper-on-race-housing-and-policing/\">housing</a>, <a href=\"https://europepmc.org/article/med/26665383\">health</a> and <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/met-police-cressida-dick-no-longer-institutionally-racist-racism-black-officer-a9001176.html\">policing</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s this&nbsp;urban model&nbsp;that has&nbsp;proved&nbsp;highly vulnerable to the Covid-19 pandemic. Poorly paid but essential workers such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-36151927\">nurses</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;supermarket workers&nbsp;have been priced out of central districts, placing key economic and social sectors in jeopardy.&nbsp;Self-isolation is impossible in overcrowded housing, which has fuelled the spread of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/virus-hitting-hardest-modern-equivalent-victorian-slums?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank\">virus</a>.&nbsp;Poor and marginalised areas are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/27/us-air-pollution-north-east-mid-atlantic-analysis-union-concerned-scientists\">disproportionately affected by air pollution</a>, which has translated into higher mortality rates in low-income <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-black-plague\">communities of colour</a>.</p> <p>For many working-class city dwellers, the cost and precarity of everyday life has made quarantining a luxury they&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/business/economy/coronavirus-inequality.html%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank\">can ill afford</a>. Hence primarily working-class boroughs in extremely unequal cities \u2013 such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/01/covid-19-coronavirus-newham-london-uk-worst-affected-area\">Newham</a>&nbsp;in London and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/bronx-new-york-yankee-stadium-coronavirus/2020/04/21/3b38b460-8182-11ea-a3ee-13e1ae0a3571_story.html\">the Bronx</a>&nbsp;in New York \u2013 have been hit especially hard by coronavirus.&nbsp;Dispossessed and&nbsp;exploited urban communities&nbsp;suffered in previous epidemics, and they\u2019re bearing the brunt of the current one.</p> <p>If the pandemic is a stress test for the cities shaped by and for financialised capitalism, it\u2019s one they\u2019re failing miserably. But none of this is inherent to city life. It\u2019s the result of political and economic arrangements that can, with sufficient political pressure, be altered.</p> <p>Cities do need to radically change \u2013&nbsp;but not in the ways being promoted either by&nbsp;density sceptics or&nbsp;professional&nbsp;urbanists.&nbsp;Instead, they must become more egalitarian, more democratic, and more capable of meeting actual human needs.&nbsp;Urban development should focus on the provision of social welfare,&nbsp;health infrastructure, municipal services,&nbsp;decarbonised&nbsp;public transportation,&nbsp;real racial equality and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://homesguarantee.com/\">guaranteed housing for all</a>. The&nbsp;only&nbsp;solution to the urban crises we face is&nbsp;to establish a new direction for cities that reverses the inequities this pandemic has exposed.</p> <p>Emergency responses to coronavirus&nbsp;have shown that rapid change is possible. In neighbourhoods across the world, mutual aid networks have sprung up to coordinate everything from grocery shopping to rent strikes.&nbsp;Some cities acted swiftly to house the homeless, halt evictions,&nbsp;adjust traffic patterns&nbsp;and provide necessary health care. The reaction to the pandemic shows that the structures sustaining the unequal city are movable \u2013 and can be altered faster than had been assumed.</p> <p>As cities begin to change in response to the pandemic, it\u2019s crucial that they don\u2019t return to their previous trajectory. The real threat is not that urban life will disappear, but that the inequality and injustice of&nbsp;the&nbsp;urban status quo&nbsp;will persist.</p> <ul> <li><p>David Madden is a sociologist and co-director of the Cities Programme at the London School of Economics</p></li> </ul>",

In places like London and New York, the development model over the past few decades has catered to the needs of elite individuals, powerful corporations and wealthy investors. These cities have been inundated with luxury housing, expensive office buildings, new business districts, amenities for the so-called \u201ccreative class\u201d and aspirational High Line-style park areas. Urban space has been optimised for rent extraction, real estate speculation and gentrification. Governments have pursued private sector profitability and deferred to middle-class tastes, and have been lauded by urbanists for doing so \u2013 all while allowing the deterioration of social services and public institutions and the intensification of inequality. Even before the pandemic, this paradigm was a disaster. A set of intersecting crises has made urban life increasingly difficult for all but the wealthy. Housing has become unaffordable and insecure. Work has become casualised and wages have stagnated, leaving many workers unable to sustain an adequate standard of living. Despite pretensions towards multiculturalism, a white power structure has maintained racialised inequalities in nearly all aspects of economic and political life, including housing, health and policing. It\u2019s this urban model that has proved highly vulnerable to the Covid-19 pandemic. Poorly paid but essential workers such as nurses and supermarket workers have been priced out of central districts, placing key economic and social sectors in jeopardy. Self-isolation is impossible in overcrowded housing, which has fuelled the spread of the virus. Poor and marginalised areas are disproportionately affected by air pollution, which has translated into higher mortality rates in low-income communities of colour. For many working-class city dwellers, the cost and precarity of everyday life has made quarantining a luxury they can ill afford. Hence primarily working-class boroughs in extremely unequal cities \u2013 such as Newham in London and the Bronx in New York \u2013 have been hit especially hard by coronavirus. Dispossessed and exploited urban communities suffered in previous epidemics, and they\u2019re bearing the brunt of the current one. If the pandemic is a stress test for the cities shaped by and for financialised capitalism, it\u2019s one they\u2019re failing miserably. But none of this is inherent to city life. It\u2019s the result of political and economic arrangements that can, with sufficient political pressure, be altered. Cities do need to radically change \u2013 but not in the ways being promoted either by density sceptics or professional urbanists. Instead, they must become more egalitarian, more democratic, and more capable of meeting actual human needs. Urban development should focus on the provision of social welfare, health infrastructure, municipal services, decarbonised public transportation, real racial equality and guaranteed housing for all. The only solution to the urban crises we face is to establish a new direction for cities that reverses the inequities this pandemic has exposed. Emergency responses to coronavirus have shown that rapid change is possible. In neighbourhoods across the world, mutual aid networks have sprung up to coordinate everything from grocery shopping to rent strikes. Some cities acted swiftly to house the homeless, halt evictions, adjust traffic patterns and provide necessary health care. The reaction to the pandemic shows that the structures sustaining the unequal city are movable \u2013 and can be altered faster than had been assumed. As cities begin to change in response to the pandemic, it\u2019s crucial that they don\u2019t return to their previous trajectory. The real threat is not that urban life will disappear, but that the inequality and injustice of the urban status quo will persist.

At the time, the prime minister urged countries to pull together and share their expertise. Yet if his government\u2019s actions are anything to go by, it seems more interested in siding with big pharmaceutical corporations than turning vaccine research into a genuinely collective endeavour.</p> <p>The last straw came on Friday, when the government refused to support <a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/covid-19-technology-access-pool/solidarity-call-to-action/\">a World Health Organi</a><a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/covid-19-technology-access-pool/solidarity-call-to-action/\">zation initiative</a> to encourage countries to share research on coronavirus treatments and produce any final medicines patent-free. This would mean they could be distributed fairly according to need.&nbsp;The proposal, a voluntary scheme that would pool knowledge, intellectual property and data about coronavirus health technologies, is not particularly radical \u2013 but you wouldn\u2019t guess that from the recent protestations of pharmaceutical corporations.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b964cfb2-5f2e-4cb7-b9ad-535481495eaa\">Pfizer called the proposal \u201cnonsense\u201d</a>, while the big British companies working on coronavirus treatments, AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKlein, refused to participate. When asked whether he would attend the launch of the WHO proposal, Thomas B Cueni, the director of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wMMwDshed0&amp;t=64m23s\">International Federation of Phamaceutical Manufacturers and Associations,</a> a lobbying group, said he was \u201ctoo busy\u201d.</p> <p>The reaction from this industry shouldn\u2019t surprise us. Over the past three decades, big pharma has used its unparalleled lobbying muscle to secure market monopolies that vastly increase the power it holds over governments. Thanks to trade rules known as Trips (trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights) that were developed in the 90s to enforce minimum patent standards around the world,<strong> </strong>these corporations enjoy monopoly protection for new medicines they manufacture, allowing them to charge any price the market will endure.</p> <p>These rules provide little incentive to produce the medicines desperately needed to treat illnesses common in low-income countries, such as sleeping sickness and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/01/cholera-and-coronavirus-why-we-must-not-repeat-the-same-mistakes\">cholera</a>, but rather promote a narrow focus on drugs that mitigate chronic conditions common in the west, such as statins to treat high cholesterol. With chronic conditions, big pharmaceutical companies can sell the same medicines to the same patients for years, or even decades. Vaccines \u2013 designed to prevent diseases&nbsp;\u2013 are often used only once, and therefore don\u2019t tend to be as profitable.</p> <p>Governments have poured phenomenal sums of money into drug development to stimulate essential medical research that patents have failed to incentivise. But this money \u2013 like the UK government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-announces-record-funding-to-find-a-coronavirus-vaccine\">\u00a3500m</a><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-announces-record-funding-to-find-a-coronavirus-vaccine\"> of coronavirus research funding</a> \u2013 rarely comes with any strings attached, allowing pharmaceutical companies to monopolise the resulting medicines. A recent study estimated that one contender for a coronavirus treatment, a hepatitis C medication produced by the pharma giant Gilead, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e72d0ed3-11c7-43f6-a5e4-53e446f1e5a2\">costs $5 per course to produce</a>. The academics who authored the study said the drug is currently on sale in the US for more than $18,000 per treatment course.</p> <p>Despite the fact coronavirus medicines will be discovered using vast sums of public money, the NHS may still have to pay through the nose for any final product, while poorer countries could be unable to access the drug. It wouldn\u2019t be the first time this has happened. In the 90s<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/dec/19/theobserver.uknews6\">, millions died unnecessarily in the A</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/dec/19/theobserver.uknews6\">ids crisis in sub-Saharan Africa</a>, because the medicines to treat HIV were out of reach of most people.&nbsp;</p> <p>The WHO\u2019s initiative launched on Friday is intended to avert a repeat of this. Many countries, rich and poor, support it \u2013 including Argentina, Mexico, South Africa, Norway, Portugal and Belgium. But for the British government, the patent system is sacrosanct. The UK seems desperate not to upset its own pharmaceutical corporations or the financial sector that makes substantial returns from these companies, which spend <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/14/business/big-pharma-spends-on-share-buybacks-but-rd-not-so-much.html\">more money on share buybacks</a> than on researching drugs.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, British <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/us-and-uk-lead-push-against-global-patent-pool-for-covid-19-drugs\">officials attempted to</a> water down a resolution at the World Health Assembly to create a global \u201cpatent pool\u201d, which would have encouraged the production of patent-free coronavirus drugs. Then, on Friday, they declined to support the new WHO initiative for pooling research.

This is perfectly legal, although big pharmaceutical companies might hope to convince us otherwise.&nbsp;</p> <p>There\u2019s reason to believe that the British government has misjudged the public mood significantly. Recent polling in Britain and the US shows public support for making <a href=\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/reports/what-people-think-about-global-access-covid-19-treatments-and-vaccines\">coronavirus medicines available internationally based on need</a>, rather than ability to pay. And pharmaceutical companies have been careful to appear sympathetic to the need for \u201cfair and equal access\u201d to coronavirus treatments.

Its report, entitled Disparities in the risk and outcomes from Covid-19, says: \u201cDeath rates from Covid-19 were highest among people of black and Asian ethnic groups. \u201cThis is the opposite of what is seen in previous years, when the mortality rates were lower in Asian and black ethnic groups than white ethnic groups. Therefore the disparity in Covid-19 mortality between ethnic groups is the opposite of that seen in previous years.\u201d Labour MP David Lammy, who is shadow secretary of state for justice, said Public Health England\u2019s findings demanded urgent action by ministers. He tweeted: \u201cConfirmation: Black and Asian ethnic groups are up to twice as likely to die from covid-19. Families are living in fear. There must be no more delay. The government must take urgent action to protect at-risk groups.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Interest rates have never been lower and lenders have slashed the cost of overdrafts. Normally that would be the signal for UK consumers to flash the plastic and take on more debt.</p> <p>Not this time. According to the Bank of England, households reduced their credit card bills and paid off their non-mortgage loans at a record rate in April. Consumers tend to get warier about borrowing when times are tough: they behaved similarly during the financial crisis of the late 2000s. But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/jun/02/uk-consumers-repay-record-74bn-of-debt-amid-covid-19-lockdown\">a monthly debt repayment of \u00a37.4bn</a> is in a different league from anything seen before.</p> <p>Seen from one perspective, the repayment of debt is nothing to worry about. Consumers spent April confined to their homes and had little opportunity to blow the money provided either by their employer or by the government\u2019s wage subsidy scheme.</p> <p>Spending options were severely curtailed. Go out for a meal? Not possible because of the risk of catching the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19 </a>virus. Take out a loan to buy a new car? Not feasible with all the showrooms shut. Book a cruise and put it on the credit card? Summer \u2013 as confirmed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jun/02/stocks-shrug-off-us-unrest-china-tensions-amid-easing-of-covid-19-lockdown-pound-oil-business-live\">P&amp;O\u2019s decision to suspend sailings until mid-October </a>\u2013 has been cancelled this year.</p> <p>As a result, households saved more and spent less. They used the period of lockdown to pay off debt and put their finances in order. As the lockdown restrictions are gradually eased, consumers will be in a stronger position and will make up for lost time with a surge of spending. The debt repayments of March and April will prove to be exceptional, as will the 80% drop in mortgage approvals and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/02/uk-house-prices-fall-coronavirus-nationwide\">fall in house prices </a>reported by the Nationwide building society.</p> <p>This all looks a tad panglossian. The reason consumers tend to save more of their disposable income during difficult times is that they feel the need to build up a financial buffer in case they lose their jobs, have their hours cut or find that their wages are not keeping pace with prices. With more than 8 million workers furloughed, that\u2019s true in spades this time.</p> <p>So, not all of the reduction in borrowing has been caused by a lack of spending opportunities. Some of it is due to consumers \u2013 quite rationally \u2013 being worried about what the future may bring. Those anxiety levels will remain high for some time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden\u00a0email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>How to help make the G20 function</h2> <p>It\u2019s easy to understand the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/gordon-brown-urges-g20-countries-to-back-25tn-coronavirus-plan\">frustration of the 225 members of the global great and good </a>who have written to the leaders of the G20 demanding a stronger international response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19 </a>pandemic.</p> <p>The G20 \u2013 a gathering of the world\u2019s key developed, emerging market and developing nations \u2013 had its moment of glory during the financial crisis of the late 2000s. Now it is effectively moribund.</p> <p>The G20 showed in 2008-09 that it is capable of acting in a coordinated manner. During the financial crisis there was a collective stimulus, funding for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and a commitment to avoid protectionism.</p> <p>Today the world faces an even bigger crisis and there is plenty that the G20 could be doing.</p> <p>It could be helping to make the health systems of poor countries more resilient. It could be co-ordinating efforts to finding a vaccine for the virus. It could be developing an action plan to rebuild the global economy with a green new deal. It could be ensuring there are the funds available to help the more than 100 countries that have applied to the IMF for help, and to prevent extreme poverty from rising. It could come up with a comprehensive debt relief plan.</p> <p>The G20 could be doing all these things and more but it has gone missing in action. While individual countries have responded quickly and decisively to the twin health and economic emergencies, the international response has been feeble.</p> <p>To turn the G20 into an effective body three things need to happen. Firstly, someone needs to provide the leadership that Gordon Brown showed in 2008-09. Secondly, relations need to be improved between the world\u2019s two biggest economies \u2013 the US and China. In the early years of the 21st century, Washington wanted Beijing to have a seat at the table when the big global issues were being discussed. Now, relations between the two countries are poisonous.</p> <p>Finally, there needs to be a recognition that collective action now is the best way to minimise the risk of a second wave of Covid-19 later this year. Otherwise, the G20 is a pointless relic.</p>",

But a monthly debt repayment of \u00a37.4bn is in a different league from anything seen before. Seen from one perspective, the repayment of debt is nothing to worry about. Consumers spent April confined to their homes and had little opportunity to blow the money provided either by their employer or by the government\u2019s wage subsidy scheme. Spending options were severely curtailed. Go out for a meal? Not possible because of the risk of catching the Covid-19 virus. Take out a loan to buy a new car? Not feasible with all the showrooms shut. Book a cruise and put it on the credit card? Summer \u2013 as confirmed by P&amp;O\u2019s decision to suspend sailings until mid-October \u2013 has been cancelled this year. As a result, households saved more and spent less. They used the period of lockdown to pay off debt and put their finances in order. As the lockdown restrictions are gradually eased, consumers will be in a stronger position and will make up for lost time with a surge of spending. The debt repayments of March and April will prove to be exceptional, as will the 80% drop in mortgage approvals and the fall in house prices reported by the Nationwide building society. This all looks a tad panglossian. The reason consumers tend to save more of their disposable income during difficult times is that they feel the need to build up a financial buffer in case they lose their jobs, have their hours cut or find that their wages are not keeping pace with prices. With more than 8 million workers furloughed, that\u2019s true in spades this time. So, not all of the reduction in borrowing has been caused by a lack of spending opportunities. Some of it is due to consumers \u2013 quite rationally \u2013 being worried about what the future may bring. Those anxiety levels will remain high for some time. How to help make the G20 function It\u2019s easy to understand the frustration of the 225 members of the global great and good who have written to the leaders of the G20 demanding a stronger international response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The G20 \u2013 a gathering of the world\u2019s key developed, emerging market and developing nations \u2013 had its moment of glory during the financial crisis of the late 2000s. Now it is effectively moribund. The G20 showed in 2008-09 that it is capable of acting in a coordinated manner. During the financial crisis there was a collective stimulus, funding for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and a commitment to avoid protectionism. Today the world faces an even bigger crisis and there is plenty that the G20 could be doing. It could be helping to make the health systems of poor countries more resilient. It could be co-ordinating efforts to finding a vaccine for the virus. It could be developing an action plan to rebuild the global economy with a green new deal. It could be ensuring there are the funds available to help the more than 100 countries that have applied to the IMF for help, and to prevent extreme poverty from rising. It could come up with a comprehensive debt relief plan. The G20 could be doing all these things and more but it has gone missing in action. While individual countries have responded quickly and decisively to the twin health and economic emergencies, the international response has been feeble. To turn the G20 into an effective body three things need to happen. Firstly, someone needs to provide the leadership that Gordon Brown showed in 2008-09. Secondly, relations need to be improved between the world\u2019s two biggest economies \u2013 the US and China. In the early years of the 21st century, Washington wanted Beijing to have a seat at the table when the big global issues were being discussed. Now, relations between the two countries are poisonous. Finally, there needs to be a recognition that collective action now is the best way to minimise the risk of a second wave of Covid-19 later this year. Otherwise, the G20 is a pointless relic.",

The tests would be offered to people with symptoms, but since many people were infectious before feeling ill, and many never show symptoms at all, the system would have only limited use, the committee heard. \u201cBy the time someone shows symptoms they have probably been infectious for a day or two,\u201d said Adam Kucharski, an associate professor and infectious disease modeller at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \u201cAs soon as someone becomes symptomatic, you have a very short time window before their contacts may become infectious and then you\u2019ve got another generation of transmission to deal with.\u201d Ferguson said the test-and-trace scheme \u201cwas not a panacea\u201d because it relied not only on what proportion of people developed symptoms, but what proportion could identify past contacts, how quickly they could be contacted, and how many then abided by the self-isolation rules. He told the hearing that if the system worked perfectly, it might at best reduce R by 0.2 to 0.25, describing that as \u201csignificant, but not huge\u201d.",

Join us again from 8am tomorrow morning. Stay safe \u2013KM Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says the UK government\u2019s support schemes should be enough to help keep businesses from going bust...for now. Well, that was short-lived. US stocks are now mixed, after the Nasdaq turned negative and fell 0.19%. Gains are nowhere near what is being logged across Europe, but here\u2019s how Wall Street is trading at the open: S&amp;P 500 is up 0.3% Dow is up 0.5% Nasdaq is up 0.1% The chair of the Treasury Select Committee, Conservative MP Mel Stride, says he is concerned by the delay of the investigation into how collapsed mini-bond issuer London Capital &amp; Finance was regulated by the FCA. Dame Elizabeth Gloster said in her letter released today that she faced delays in receiving documents and information from the FCA in recent month, which set back interviews originaally planned for December/January until March 2020. She added home working as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic had also thrown up difficulties in interviewing FCA staff promptly from March. However, she was quick to stress that she wasn\u2019t suggesting it was intentional or the result of \u201cdeliberate non-cooperation\u201d on the part of the FCA. Futures are pointing to a positive start on Wall Street: S&amp;P 500 futures are up nearly 0.3% Dow futures are up 0.4% Nasdaq futures are up 0.1% Lloyds Banking Group had confirmed that it will extend its freeze on job cuts until at least October due to the pandemic. Lloyds originally halted plans for around 780 job cuts back in March, with the decision meant to be reviewed on a monthly basis from the end of May. But it\u2019s understood that a decision was taken last week to set a longer timeline. A Lloyds Banking Group spokesperson said: We have made a number of commitments to our colleagues to address their concerns during the current crisis, including continuing to pay them in full regardless of their working circumstances. We have also pledged that any colleague placed on notice of redundancy will not leave the group before October. We will continue to review these and other commitments to our colleagues on an ongoing basis. While workers in travel and leisure have been on edge about their employment prospects during the Covid-19 crisis, the pandemic has had the opposite effect on banks. Lenders like Lloyds have seen their workload increase since March, as governments put them on the frontline of coronavirus rescue plans. More staff have been needed to arrange mortgage and credit card holidays and distribute government-backed loans. Global oil prices climbed to three month highs on Tuesday ahead of talks between the Opec oil cartel and its allies over plans to extend an historic oil supply deal and shore up market prices, our energy correspondent Jillian Ambrose writes. Oil ministers from the world\u2019s most powerful oil producing countries will join a video call on Thursday to discuss plans to keep cutting 9.7 million barrels of oil a day through the summer. The record oil production curbs were put in place from April to help steady the oversupplied market after the impact of the coronavirus lockdown slashed global oil demand to 25 year lows. The original oil supply deal, the largest agreement ever struck between the group of oil giants, helped double the global oil price which fell to 21-year lows of about $16 a barrel last month. The price of Brent crude, the international oil price benchmark, rose by almost $1 to $39.29 a barrel on Tuesday while US oil, or the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, climbed by 88 cents, to $36.32 a barrel. Oil traders believe a deal to extend the production cuts has the support of most Opec and non-Opec countries, and is likely following Thursday\u2019s virtual meeting. Iraq\u2019s acting oil minister Ali Abdul Ameer Allawi said on Twitter that the country plans to deepen its planned oil production cuts, and remains committed to the so-called Opec+ deal despite falling short of its quota last month. French flight crew have accused Ryanair of blackmailing them into taking pay cuts or losing their jobs. The Irish airline, which has warned it may cut up to 3,000 jobs in Europe, told staff in France it was imposing 20% salary cuts for flight crew and 10% for attendants. Those who are already on legal minimum wages will have their hours reduced. Staff unions have accused the company of \u201credundancy blackmail\u201d and acting like cowboys. According to confidential documents seen by French media, Ryanair wrote to staff proposing wage cuts take effect from 1 July 2020. The lower wages would be progressively increased over the five years so flight crew would be paid their full current salaries by July 2025. The loss of salary works out at an average 12% over five years for the pilots. Ryanair also proposed to pay new pilots and co-pilots the lower wages. The Syndicat National des Pilots de Ligne said it had been given a maximum of five days to respond to the ultimatum. If not, it said the company warned it would have \u201cno choice\u201d but to lay off 29% of its pilots and 27% of co-pilots in France. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey is set to be interviewed within weeks as part of the investigation into the potential regulatory shortfalls linked to the demise of London Capital &amp; Finance. We already knew Bailey would be questioned, but this confirms the timeline. In an update released by Dame Elizabeth Gloster, who is conducting the independent investigation, she confirmed that \u201csenior employee interviews (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Mr Andrew Bailey)\u201c would \u201ctake place during the first half of June 2020.\u201d However, it was part of a wider notice that the report would not be completed until 30 September. It was originally expected within 12 months of Gloster\u2019s appointment by the government, which would have been 10 July. The beleaguered investment company collapsed in early 2019, owing money to thousands of customers who had bought controversial mini-bonds from LC&amp;F. The firm promised stellar returns to investors of up to 8% a year, but t little of the money went into safe interest-bearing investments, and was instead funnelled into speculative property developments, oil exploration in the Faroe Islands and even a helicopter bought for a company controlled by LC&amp;F. Some customers claim they were misled, including by the Financial Conduct Authority, over whether their investments were protected by the regulator. The City regulator\u2019s enforcement team was also warned three years ago about the company but failed to act. Time for a quick market update. European stock markets have all extended their gains after a positive start at the open. Germany is leading the pack, up 3.9% at around 12,030 points. That pushes it to levels not seen since early March, when stock markets started to react to the pandemic\u2019s migration to Europe. Here\u2019s how the rest of Europe is looking: Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar Al Baker has been speaking to Reuters and said that it will keep the airline\u2019s fleet of A380s grounded until mid to late 2021. He also said that the airline may end up laying off around less than 20% of group staff and it wasn\u2019t clear when the airline would return to profitability due to the pandemic. Problems are clearly being thrown up by its agreements with manufacturers, with the airline\u2019s boss saying it is in talks with both Airbus and Boeing to defer all pending aircraft deliveries. He also claims the airline won\u2019t do any future business with manufacturers that make it hard to delay deliveries. Qatar Airways is already on track to sell the five Boeing 737 Max aircraft that have already been delivered. Heavily indebted shopping centre owner Intu Properties is forecasting it will receive over a third (37%) less rental income this year than last from the retailers which rent space in its centres, my colleague Joanna Partridge writes. The owner of Manchester\u2019s Trafford Centre and Lakeside in Essex thinks it will collect \u00a3310m in rent in 2020, compared with \u00a3492m in 2020. Intu also predicts it will end 2020 with just \u00a324m cash, having started with \u00a382m, although this is also dependent on its lenders waiving some covenants. Despite this forecast, the company\u2019s shares rose by 93% at one point on Tuesday morning, to almost 11p, although they are still trading 90% lower than they did a year ago P&amp;O Cruises has scrapped all sailings until 15 October due to coronavirus, writing off the summer season, our transport correspondent Gwyn Topham writes. The leading British cruise line, part of the Carnival group, had previously announced a pause in operations until the end of July, as the battered industry looks to find ways of operating in a post-pandemic world. P&amp;O said it was working with public health bodies in the UK and US to enhance health and safety protocols. P&amp;O Cruises president Paul Ludlow said: As a business our operational focus is not \u201cwhen can we resume sailing?\u201d but is instead \u201chow can we develop a comprehensive restart protocol that will keep everyone on board, our crew and guests, safe and well and still give our guests an amazing holiday? The cruise line said it would give cancelled passengers a voucher worth 125% of the original booking, and \u201cwanted to apologise once again to those guests who wait for refunds, particularly at a time of financial constraints\u201d. P&amp;O is the first in the worldwide group to extend its operational \u201cpause\u201d into autumn, with most still suspended as far as mid- July. All lines are searching for ways to ensure safe passage on ships and restore public confidence. Cruises were notorious for outbreaks of bugs such as norovirus, even before the current pandemic saw passengers isolated in cabins offshore. The Treasury has also released the latest figures around the job furlough scheme this morning, as succinctly summarised by BBC Scotland\u2019s business and economy editor: Global factory production fell for the fourth straight month, but PMI data showed there was a softer contraction in output in May compared to a month earlier. That reading came in at 42.4 in May, up from 39.6 in April. The declines in output were widespread across the sector, with substantial drops across the consumer, intermediate and investment goods sub-industries, the report said. It\u2019s worth noting that China was the only country to report any output in May, and even then production was low. Still, most countries, aside from Japan and Australia, saw a smaller rate of decline over the month. Despite the recent spike in business borrowing through government-backed loan schemes, we\u2019ll have to wait another month for that to be reflected in the Bank of England data. Private businesses borrowed \u201clittle extra\u201d from banks in April, according to the BoE. SMEs drew down around \u00a3300m on a net basis, which was similar to March. Annual borrowing also grew just 1.2%, in line with the growth rate tracked since mid-2019. Large businesses meanwhile borrowed \u00a312.9bn in April, but that is down from \u00a332.4bn a month earlier. It means the annual growth rate of borrowing rose to 15.4%, much stronger than the 5% rate logged in late 2019. When looking at both bank loans and funds raised on financial markets (through bonds, commercial paper or equity), UK firms raised a total of \u00a316.3bn. However, that\u2019s down from \u00a331.6bn in March. Mortgage borrowing also tumbled April, according to the BoE data. The number of approved home loans tumbled 80% compared to February, to just 15,800. This was around half the number of approvals that were logged during the worst periods of the global financial criss and the worst since records began in 1993. Remortgaging performed a bit better, having fallen just 34% to 34,400 since February. It came as borrowers tried to take advantage of the drop in interest rates, which now sit at 0.1% Data flash: UK consumer borrowing fell and repayments rose during the Covid-19 lockdown. Bank of England data shows credit card lending tumbled to -7.8% in April, compared to a year earlier. That is the second straight negative reading and compares to growth of 3.5% in February, before the pandemic hit the UK. Weak demand overall meant that the annual growth rate for total consumer credit fell below zero to -0.4% year on year, its weakest growth rate since August 2012. There was also a notable jump in debt repayments. Households repaid \u00a37.4bn of consumer credit, on a net basis in April, which was the the largest net repayment on record. It\u2019s also double the repayments logged in March. Heathrow Airport\u2019s holding company has been put on credit watch - meaning it will be monitored closely for any changes - by ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor\u2019s. It comes as the transport hub tries to offset the impact of coronavirus travel restrictions. Heathrow explained that the agency expects Covid-19 to have a \u201cmore severe impact than anticipated on passenger traffic, while recovery to pre-crisis volumes may not occur until at least 2023.\u201d Heathrow boss Javier Echave said: We continue taking decisive steps to protect Heathrow\u2019s financial resilience. In addition to our strong liquidity position, we are reducing our operating costs by at least \u00a3300 million, cutting our capital expenditure by over \u00a3650 million and adapting our operating model to help us keep Britain\u2019s hub airport open safely and protect vital supply lines throughout this crisis. We will continue working to maintain investor confidence. The pound is one of the best performing currencies today. Cable is at one-month highs at around $1.25, but it has US dollar weakness to thank for its rise. David Madden, a market analyst at CMC Markets UK, explains: Sterling has been downbeat recently as there hasn\u2019t been much progress made in relation to the post-transition period [Brexit] agreement, but the pound has popped today. The US dollar continues to decline. The currency lost ground in the latter half of last week, so now the minor worries about the trade situation with China, along with fears about civil unrest in a number of US cities has put even more pressure on the greenback. In other housing news, the FCA has announced that it is extending mortgage payment holidays for customers struggling due to the Covid-19 outbreak and lockdown. Those who have already requested a freeze to payment will have a chance to ask for a partial or full extension for a further three months. Here are some of the other changes: Customers that have not yet had a payment holiday and who experience financial difficulty have until 31 October 2020 to request one. The current ban on lender repossessions of homes will be continued to 31 October 2020. This will ensure people are able to comply with the government\u2019s policy to self-isolate if they need to. Payment holidays offered under this guidance will not have a negative impact on credit files. However, consumers should remember that lenders may use information obtained from other sources, such as bank account information, in their lending decisions. Germany has opened for trading and the DAX has shot past its European peers, jumping 2.5% to its highest level since 5 March. Seems there\u2019s still appetite for equities this morning. Here\u2019s how Europe is looking at the open: FTSE 100 is up 0.5% France\u2019s CAC 40 is up 0.8% Spain\u2019s IBEX is up 0.6% We\u2019re still waiting for a print for the German DAX, which was closed for the Whitsun holiday on Monday. Howard Archer, chief economic advisor to the EY ITEM Club, notes that this is the first time that the coronavirus restrictions would have been reflected in the Nationwide house price index. Worth remembering (for anyone who didn\u2019t try to move) that the UK lockdown brought the housing market to an abrupt standstill. House moves were banned apart from those that were \u201creasonably necessary,\u201d estate agents were banned from listing new properties and house hunters were only able to do virtual viewings. After seven weeks of lockdown the housing market reopened in mid-May. Nationwide data released this morning shows UK house prices fell at the fastest rate since the financial crisis, my colleague Julia Kollewe writes. It came as would-be buyers said they would wait six months before returning to the housing market. The average price of a home dropped 1.7% in May from the previous month to \u00a3218,902, according to Nationwide Building Society, one of the UK\u2019s largest mortgage lenders. This comes after April\u2019s 0.9% gain and is the the biggest monthly fall since February 2009. The annual growth rate slowed to 1.8%, down from 3.7% in April and the slowest since December. Nationwide said potential buyers were now planning to wait six months on average before looking to enter the market, and that 12% of the population had put off moving because of the lockdown. Robert Gardner, Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, said: The raft of policies adopted to support the economy, including to protect businesses and jobs, to support peoples\u2019 incomes and keep borrowing costs down, should set the stage for a rebound once the shock passes, and help limit long-term damage to the economy. Good morning and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, eurozone and business It\u2019s hard to believe that during a global pandemic, when protests are raging across the US over the killing of George Floyd and geopolitical tensions are simmering over China\u2019s control of Hong Kong, that investors would still be flocking to the equity market. But here we are. Stocks in the US closed higher overnight, with the S&amp;P and Dow up around 0.35% each, even as president Donald Trump threatened to deploy the United States military to American cities to quell civil unrest. Asian markets also continued their upward march, with the Hang Send up 0.7%, Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 up nearly 1.2% and the Shanghai Stock Exchange rising 0.2%. Europe is expected to follow suit. As Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, explains: The main focus once again appeared on the longer-term prospects of the easing of lockdowns across the world, though if the violence on US streets continues for much longer US investors might have to cope with a lockdown of a different kind, imposed by the National Guard. This is something that President Trump hinted he might well do if the various states aren\u2019t able to contain the outbreaks of violence across US cities. A deluge of PMI data on Monday also seems to have buoyed sentiment, including those in Italy which were much better than expected given the impact that Covid-19 and the resulting lockdown had on the country\u2019s economy. But as Hewson points out, even as lockdowns ease across Asia and Europe there is an \u201cundercurrent of anxiety\u201d that some countries might be leaving their coronavirus lockdowns too quickly ,which could put some populations at risk of a second wave of infections. However, that is not expected to impact the positive open across major European indices, at least not this morning. We\u2019ll bring you that print once trading begins.

Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said his government would question US authorities on that specific case \u201cto find out the exact circumstances\u201d. \u201cDemocratic countries must apply the highest standards in protecting press freedom. In this context, all violence must not only be criticised by also prosecuted and clarified so that journalists can be effectively protected while carrying out their work,\u201d Maas told reporters. An Australian cameraman was also apparently assaulted in Washington, leading Canberra to say it had asked its embassy in the US to approach authorities with questions. \u201cI want to get further advice on how we would go about registering Australia\u2019s strong concerns with the responsible local authorities in Washington,\u201d the foreign minister, Marise Payne, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. On Tuesday evening in Sydney, hundreds of people marched through the city, chanting \u201cblack lives matter\u201d and protesting against the killing of Floyd but also Indigenous deaths in custody in Australia. Protesters chanted \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d and \u201cjustice today, for David Dungay\u201d \u2013 the 26-year-old Aboriginal man who said \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d 12 times before he died in 2015 while being restrained by prison guards. His family said they had been traumatised anew by the footage of the death of Floyd, who used the same words while under restraint. In France, protests were scheduled for Tuesday evening in Paris after calls from the family of a French black man who died shortly after he was arrested by police in 2016. A separate protest was also planned in The Hague, Netherlands. Agencies contributed to this report",

The tally comes 10 weeks after the nation went into lockdown and confirms Britain\u2019s status as one of the countries worst hit by a pandemic that has claimed about 375,000 lives globally. The UK death toll is higher than the other worst-affected countries in Europe: Italy, France and Spain, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, and the number of people killed by coronavirus in the UK since it emerged in China in January is only currently surpassed by the United States. The number of deaths registered in England and Wales with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 reached 44,401 by 22 May, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), but when more recent figures from the NHS and from statistics authorities in Scotland and Northern Ireland are added in, the tally hits 50,032. It brings into view a prediction in April by disease analysts in the US that the UK could record 66,000 deaths by early August. On 17 March, early in the pandemic, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, had said that keeping the death toll below 20,000 would be \u201ca good outcome in terms of where we hope to get to with this outbreak\u201d. That 20,000 milestone was reached the following month. Since the start of the pandemic, almost 15,000 people are known to have died in care homes. Hospitals, while not overwhelmed, have faced more than two months of severe pressure, with staff handling tens of thousands of fatalities while most non-urgent treatment has been suspended. The 50,000-death milestone comes as Boris Johnson continues to loosen lockdown restrictions and it will increase scrutiny of the government\u2019s response to the pandemic, which has been questioned on several fronts. The lockdown, introduced on 23 March, was seen by many as coming too late; the government\u2019s former chief scientific adviser Sir David King said that \u201cevery day cost lives\u201d. Health and care workers faced weeks of shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) required to limit the spread of infection. An early plan to contain the virus with mass testing and tracing was ended on 12 March and the health secretary, Matt Hancock, only promised to increase testing capacity to 100,000 a day by the end of April. Black and minority ethnic (BAME) people have been disproportionately affected and have been two to three times more likely to die from Covid-19 than the general population, according to a UCL study. While the figures confirm the death rate is continuing to fall, and has reached its lowest level in the last seven weeks, overall mortality in England and Wales so far this year has been running at 22% above the five-year average. April, when the virus peaked, was particularly bad, and separate ONS figures, also published on Tuesday, showed the provisional number of deaths registered in England and Wales in that month was 88,153 \u2013 double the number in 2019 and an increase of 38,430 deaths in comparison with the previous month. The north-east and east of England are the areas where the disease is still having the greatest impact, compared with normal years, with death tolls 30% and 40% above the five-year average respectively up to 22 May, according to the ONS figures. Between 23 May and 29 May, the period after the main ONS data was gathered, care homes in England and Wales notified their regulators of 578 deaths related to Covid-19. Scotland is set to publish more up-to-date death toll figures on Wednesday. Scotland has recorded 3,779 deaths in all settings where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, according to statistics published last week by the National Records of Scotland. The virus has hit 62% of care homes in Scotland and by 26 May, 18 health and social care workers had died from the virus, most of them care home staff. There were also 716 Covid-19-related deaths in all settings in Northern Ireland in 2020 up to 22 May, according to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency. More up-to-date daily figures about deaths in hospitals in England show there were 931 confirmed Covid-19 deaths from 23 May up to and including 1 June, 105 further deaths in Scotland to date, 78 in Wales and 22 in Northern Ireland. Deaths involving Covid-19 as a proportion of all deaths in care homes fell to 32.5%, but the figures showed the virus continues to have a hold in care settings. The number of deaths in care homes was 1,289 higher than the five-year average, while in hospitals the number of deaths was 24 fewer than the five-year average. By 22 May, UK care homes had reported 14,868 deaths from suspected or confirmed Covid-19. The UK\u2019s biggest care home operator, HC-One, is nearing a toll of 1,000 deaths in its facilities. \u201cWe are supporting the families of all of those residents who have been affected and those who have lost their lives, and our thoughts and condolences are with all those who have lost loved ones,\u201d HC-One said in a statement.

      "bodyText": "Great Britain\u2019s electricity system recorded its \u201cgreenest\u201d ever month in May after running without coal-fired electricity for a full calendar month. The National Grid, the energy system operator, said the country\u2019s sunniest spring on record helped generate enough solar power to reduce the carbon intensity of the grid to its lowest level ever recorded. The bright and breezy weather helped wind and solar power make up about 28% of Great Britain\u2019s electricity last month, narrowly behind gas-fired power generation, which made up 30% of the energy mix. Meanwhile, the record low demand for electricity during the coronavirus lockdown has left little room for Great Britain\u2019s last remaining coal power plants to play a role. Since April Great Britain\u2019s electricity system has run without coal-fired power for about 54 consecutive days, which has helped the carbon intensity of the electricity grid fall to the lowest average carbon intensity on record at 143 grams of CO2 per kilowatt-hour. The lowest carbon intensity ever was recorded at 46g CO2/kWh on Sunday 24 May. The record was possible, in part, because of the collapse of energy demand in Great Britain caused by the coronavirus lockdown and two bank holidays in a fortnight. But the chief reason was the unseasonably sunny spring weather, said Roisin Quinn, head of National Grid\u2019s control centre. This spring was the sunniest since records began in 1929, according to the Met Office, and the driest May for 124 years. The Met Office recorded more than 573 hours of sunshine between 1 March and 27 May, beating the previous record of 555.3 hours in 1948. \u201cGreat Britain\u2019s incredible coal-free run has continued throughout May, giving us the first full calendar month \u2013 744 straight hours \u2013 of electricity generation without coal since the Industrial Revolution,\u201d Quinn said. This article was amended on 5 June 2020 because an earlier version referred to the UK when it should have said Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland). The combination of record low demand for electricity and near-record highs for renewable energy output is a \u201cunique challenge\u201d for the National Grid\u2019s control room, Quinn said, because engineers had to make sure that the rise of renewable energy did not overload the grid. National Grid\u2019s energy system operator arm expects to spend \u00a3500m more than usual this summer because it will need to pay generators to turn off their wind farms, solar projects or power plants. Over the last bank holiday weekend alone the company reportedly paid \u00a350m to electricity generators to turn down their supplies, on top of a \u00a350m contract offered to the Sizewell B nuclear plant to run at half capacity this summer. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 June 2020 because an earlier version referred to the UK when it should have said Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland).",

It has been replicated \u2013 albeit more mildly \u2013 in subsequent flu pandemics.</p>\n    <p>How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Is there evidence of coronavirus coming back in a second wave?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/singapore-coronavirus-increase-revives-fears-of-post-lockdown-surge\">resurgence in infections</a>&nbsp;despite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.</p>\n    <p>Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/singapores-cramped-migrant-worker-dorms-hide-covid-19-surge-risk\">cramped dormitory accommodation</a>&nbsp;used by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.</p>\n    <p>Singapore\u2019s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are experts worried about?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.</p>\n    <p>The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.</p>\n    <p>In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune individuals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-vaccine-when-will-we-have-one\">a vaccine still months away</a>, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterbeaumont\"><b>Peter Beaumont</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There were, however, strict rules: Parisian bars and restaurants have been given permission to sprawl across pavements but tables must be a metre apart.

      "bodyText": "Germany lifted its blanket European travel warning as coronavirus lockdowns across the EU continued to ease, with officials saying new cases in western Europe were now in steady decline. Parisians reclaimed their cafe terraces and Berliners took back their bars as normal life inched closer to returning in many parts of the continent. Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said his government was maintaining its travel warning for non-European destinations, but from Wednesday it would issue individual advice for all Schengen-zone countries to allow holidaymakers to decide where they could safely travel this summer. In the French capital, contented customers sat outside cafes in the French capital and sipped their morning espressos for the first time in 11 weeks, while bars, casinos, fitness studios and dance schools all reopened in Germany\u2019s biggest city. There were, however, strict rules: Parisian bars and restaurants have been given permission to sprawl across pavements but tables must be a metre apart. In the rest of France, customers can now be served inside while maintaining the same distance. In Berlin, gyms must guarantee a 3-metre distance between customers, while bars can only serve at the table, not the counter. Customers in most establishments must give their name and phone number so they can be contacted in case of infection. In a further easing of restrictions in France, all travel curbs inside the country were lifted and sunbathing was allowed once again on beaches. But the country faces tough times, with the economy forecast to shrink by 11% this year, according to the finance ministry. France\u2019s Covid-19 tracking app, StopCovid, was due to be released at midday but was delayed by technical issues. The app, developed independently of Apple and Google, should allow anyone diagnosed with Covid-19 to warn those with whom they have been in contact in the previous two weeks so they can be tested. The World Health Organization said new cases of Covid-19 were falling steadily in western Europe but rising in hotspots in Russia and eastern Europe. Russia, where deaths exceeded 5,000 on Tuesday, announced a $72bn recovery plan to over the next two years. In Italy, the president, Sergio Mattarella, warned on the country\u2019s national day that, contrary to some recent statements, the coronavirus crisis \u201cis not over, and institutions and citizens alike will still have to face its consequences and trauma\u201d. Speaking a day after Alberto Zangrillo, the head of Milan\u2019s San Raffaele hospital, caused a furore by claiming the virus no longer existed in Italy, Mattarella said it would be \u201cunacceptable and unforgivable to squander this legacy of sacrifice and pain\u201d. Underlining the risk of local spikes in infections as restrictions ease, authorities said gatherings of extended families in the city of G\u00f6ttingen, north-west Germany, two weekends ago had led to 68 people contracting the virus and 300 ordered to self-isolate for 14 days. Spain\u2019s health ministry has reported no new Covid-19 deaths for a second consecutive day. However, it also said there had been 34 deaths across the country over the past week, leading to some confusion. Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies, said the death figures were \u201cyielding some problems\u201d but added that the numbers were provided by the country\u2019s regional governments. To date, the country has registered 27,127 deaths and 239,932 cases. Worldwide, coronavirus has infected more than 6,300,000 people, according to Johns Hopkins University trackers, and killed more than 375,000. A group of more than 230 former world leaders, global health experts and economists called on the G20 to convene an urgent summit to provide a \u201cstrongly coordinated global response\u201d to what they described as an unprecedented global crisis. Noting poorer countries were most at risk, they demanded the developed world release 76 countries from debt payments, double the World Bank\u2019s emergency aid fund and honour billions of dollars committed to Covid-19 vaccine efforts. \u201cThe consequences of not acting now would be felt for the rest of the decade,\u201d said the signatories, who included the former UK prime minsters Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, Helen Clark of New Zealand and the ex-UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon. In other developments: Sweden recorded 775 more confirmed cases of coronavirus and 65 more deaths, according to its public health agency. The number of new jobseekers in Spain in May was close to 27,000, roughly 10 times lower than in March and April, the labour ministry said. The number of confirmed cases in Africa passed 150,000, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, with 4,344 deaths. Iran recorded its second-highest number of new coronavirus cases since its outbreak began, with 3,117 people testing positive in the past 24 hours. At least 20 journalists have died from Covid-19 in Peru, Latin America\u2019s worst hit country after Brazil. Hong Kong\u2019s annual candlelit vigil for those killed in China\u2019s 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown has been banned for the first time. A 71-year-old man has become the first Rohingya in the vast refugee camps in Bangladesh to die from coronavirus. In Wuhan, China, where the virus originated, tests on almost 10 million people over the past two weeks uncovered only 300 asymptomatic carriers. Hu Weifeng, a Wuhan doctor who worked with the whistleblower Li Wenliang died of Covid-19 last week, state media reported. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 June 2020 because an earlier version referred to Germany\u2019s travel warning, as a travel ban.

Since lockdown, there had been additional evidence of self-harm and increased attempted suicide, which was being tested.</p> \n<p>\u201cWas it acceptable on 23 March to shut down regime, including education, so that you can assess the situation and start delivering a service safely to children? Absolutely it was,\u201d said Angus Mulready-Jones, the inspectorate of prisons lead for children and young people.</p> \n<p>\u201cIs it still acceptable, 10 weeks down the line, to be in a position where children across the estate are locked up for in excess of 22 hours a day? No. I think that is not an acceptable position, and the estate needed to have moved quicker.\u201d</p> \n<p>Findings from four weeks into the coronavirus crisis \u2013 around 20 April \u2013 discovered that time out of cell was \u201cvery poor in the public sector estate\u201d, with the privately-run Parc Prison and young offender institute in south Wales performing \u201cfive times better\u201d than Cookham Wood young offender institution, said Mulready-Jones.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThose differences remain today, where Cookham Wood is delivering less than one hour out of cell each day for the children there, whereas Parc in South Wales is delivering closer to four hours out of cell.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said the key difference was the amount of educational activities on offer. At Parc, provision was more akin to that offered to vulnerable children in the community. \u201cMost children in custody would fit that description , and so in my opinion, custody needed to have moved quicker to deliver education in the sites that it has, particularly those children\u2019s sites.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd, until they deliver adequately some form of education, those regimes will still remain inadequate,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Peter Clarke, chief inspector of prisons, said some YOIs had wanted to introduce face-to-face education after lockdown \u201cbut were prevented from doing so because there was central direction\u201d.</p> \n<p>Clarke added there now needed to be flexibility and the ability to mitigate \u201cthe bad effects of long-term isolation, which is what boys in YOIs are experiencing at the moment.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have spoken to governors, not only in the YOIs, but wider across the custodials, who are becoming frustrated with their inability to innovate and mitigate at a local level. And, I think it needs to happen.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are being told now that whilst prisoners and children in YOIs have understood the need for restrictions so far, as they begin to see the situation changing in the community they will lose patience if they don\u2019t see a similar progression, not necessarily at the same pace, but some progression within the custodial state in terms of relaxing regimes,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "MPs have been warned it is \u201cunacceptable\u201d that children in young offenders institutions are still being locked up for in excess of 22 hours a day, 10 weeks after lockdown. Many of them have had no access to face-to-face education during that time, the justice select committee hearing on the impact of Covid-19 on the youth justice system was told. The custody estate should have moved more swiftly, and there are now real concerns that young offenders, who had initially accepted the restrictions placed on them, would lose patience if they see changes to lockdown in the community, but no relaxation of regimes in YOIs. Very few children had been released under the early release scheme, the committee heard. Since lockdown, there had been additional evidence of self-harm and increased attempted suicide, which was being tested. \u201cWas it acceptable on 23 March to shut down regime, including education, so that you can assess the situation and start delivering a service safely to children? Absolutely it was,\u201d said Angus Mulready-Jones, the inspectorate of prisons lead for children and young people. \u201cIs it still acceptable, 10 weeks down the line, to be in a position where children across the estate are locked up for in excess of 22 hours a day? No. I think that is not an acceptable position, and the estate needed to have moved quicker.\u201d Findings from four weeks into the coronavirus crisis \u2013 around 20 April \u2013 discovered that time out of cell was \u201cvery poor in the public sector estate\u201d, with the privately-run Parc Prison and young offender institute in south Wales performing \u201cfive times better\u201d than Cookham Wood young offender institution, said Mulready-Jones. \u201cThose differences remain today, where Cookham Wood is delivering less than one hour out of cell each day for the children there, whereas Parc in South Wales is delivering closer to four hours out of cell.\u201d He said the key difference was the amount of educational activities on offer. At Parc, provision was more akin to that offered to vulnerable children in the community. \u201cMost children in custody would fit that description , and so in my opinion, custody needed to have moved quicker to deliver education in the sites that it has, particularly those children\u2019s sites. \u201cAnd, until they deliver adequately some form of education, those regimes will still remain inadequate,\u201d he said. Peter Clarke, chief inspector of prisons, said some YOIs had wanted to introduce face-to-face education after lockdown \u201cbut were prevented from doing so because there was central direction\u201d. Clarke added there now needed to be flexibility and the ability to mitigate \u201cthe bad effects of long-term isolation, which is what boys in YOIs are experiencing at the moment.\u201d \u201cWe have spoken to governors, not only in the YOIs, but wider across the custodials, who are becoming frustrated with their inability to innovate and mitigate at a local level. And, I think it needs to happen. \u201cWe are being told now that whilst prisoners and children in YOIs have understood the need for restrictions so far, as they begin to see the situation changing in the community they will lose patience if they don\u2019t see a similar progression, not necessarily at the same pace, but some progression within the custodial state in terms of relaxing regimes,\u201d he said.",

      "body": "<p>Unions have raised fresh concerns about the wider reopening of primary schools in England after a school in Derby was forced to remain closed this week when seven members of staff tested positive for Covid-19.</p> <p>Administrative and teaching staff at Arboretum primary school began to develop symptoms last week when the school was closed during half-term, so plans to open to more pupils had to be postponed until next Monday.</p> <p>In a separate incident, one of England\u2019s largest academy chains has been reported to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), accused of failing to consult staff properly on Covid-19 risk planning before wider reopening of primary schools to more pupils.</p> <p>Government proposals for a phased reopening, starting with nursery, reception, year 1 and year 6, got off to a patchy start this week with one union suggesting there had been only a \u201cvery, very partial reopening\u201d.</p> <p>Arboretum staff sicknesses will add to fears about the sustainability of the government\u2019s plans to open primary schools to all year groups before the summer holidays, including concerns about space constraints and staff availability.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Derby Diocesan academy trust, which is responsible for Arboretum, said those who tested positive for coronavirus were mainly administrative staff who had been working alone, and were not in contact with children. \u201cThey have mild symptoms. Parents have been kept fully informed,\u201d it said. Four other staff tested negative.</p> <p>The Department for Education has not yet published any data on pupils returning or schools opening more widely, but it is likely to say the numbers are in line with expectations and this week is the first step in a gradual return of pupils.</p> <p>The NASUWT teachers\u2019 union said it had been inundated in recent days with calls from anxious members who were worried about inadequate risk assessments at their schools and the possible safety risks to staff and pupils.</p> <p>The Unison and GMB unions have lodged a formal complaint with the HSE against the David Ross education trust, which is responsible for 34 schools in London, the east Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside, accusing it of putting the safety of employees and pupils at \u201cserious and imminent risk\u201d.</p> <p>The unions, which represent school support staff, said the trust failed to provide&nbsp;full details of its Covid-19 risk assessments&nbsp;and left insufficient time to train staff on how to manage the return of pupils. The unions said they were also concerned staff were not informed that an employee at one school had been infected with the coronavirus.</p> <p>The complaint said: \u201cWe are extremely concerned that the trust has opened its schools to an increasing number of pupils and staff during an epidemic without fully engaging staff and unions on the risk in each school and the measures needed to be taken to mitigate these risks.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the trust said it had worked hard to share all information with the unions, adding: \u201cWe are confident that the risk assessments we carried out for each of our schools are robust and rigorous, and our primaries that reopened yesterday all did so without any issues, having followed all government guidance.\u201d</p> <p>Amid growing concern about the risk of local Covid-19 hotspots with wider school reopening, the Local Government Association has called for additional powers to help tackle outbreaks in schools and other settings.</p> <p>Judith Blake, the chair of the LGA\u2019s children and young people board, said:&nbsp;\u201cAs more children return to schools, it will be essential that schools and councils have the appropriate resources to deal with any additional support needed for children\u2019s emotional wellbeing.<br><br>\u201cIt is also important to give councils powers to manage outbreaks in places like schools, care homes, businesses and communities if new Covid-19 clusters emerge.\u201d</p> <p>Most schools have remained open throughout the lockdown to children of care workers and vulnerable pupils. A DfE spokesperson said: \u201cWe will continue to support schools who haven\u2019t yet been able to open more widely to do so as soon as possible.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Unions have raised fresh concerns about the wider reopening of primary schools in England after a school in Derby was forced to remain closed this week when seven members of staff tested positive for Covid-19. Administrative and teaching staff at Arboretum primary school began to develop symptoms last week when the school was closed during half-term, so plans to open to more pupils had to be postponed until next Monday. In a separate incident, one of England\u2019s largest academy chains has been reported to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), accused of failing to consult staff properly on Covid-19 risk planning before wider reopening of primary schools to more pupils. Government proposals for a phased reopening, starting with nursery, reception, year 1 and year 6, got off to a patchy start this week with one union suggesting there had been only a \u201cvery, very partial reopening\u201d. Arboretum staff sicknesses will add to fears about the sustainability of the government\u2019s plans to open primary schools to all year groups before the summer holidays, including concerns about space constraints and staff availability. A spokesman for the Derby Diocesan academy trust, which is responsible for Arboretum, said those who tested positive for coronavirus were mainly administrative staff who had been working alone, and were not in contact with children. \u201cThey have mild symptoms. Parents have been kept fully informed,\u201d it said. Four other staff tested negative. The Department for Education has not yet published any data on pupils returning or schools opening more widely, but it is likely to say the numbers are in line with expectations and this week is the first step in a gradual return of pupils. The NASUWT teachers\u2019 union said it had been inundated in recent days with calls from anxious members who were worried about inadequate risk assessments at their schools and the possible safety risks to staff and pupils. The Unison and GMB unions have lodged a formal complaint with the HSE against the David Ross education trust, which is responsible for 34 schools in London, the east Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside, accusing it of putting the safety of employees and pupils at \u201cserious and imminent risk\u201d. The unions, which represent school support staff, said the trust failed to provide full details of its Covid-19 risk assessments and left insufficient time to train staff on how to manage the return of pupils. The unions said they were also concerned staff were not informed that an employee at one school had been infected with the coronavirus. The complaint said: \u201cWe are extremely concerned that the trust has opened its schools to an increasing number of pupils and staff during an epidemic without fully engaging staff and unions on the risk in each school and the measures needed to be taken to mitigate these risks.\u201d A spokesperson for the trust said it had worked hard to share all information with the unions, adding: \u201cWe are confident that the risk assessments we carried out for each of our schools are robust and rigorous, and our primaries that reopened yesterday all did so without any issues, having followed all government guidance.\u201d Amid growing concern about the risk of local Covid-19 hotspots with wider school reopening, the Local Government Association has called for additional powers to help tackle outbreaks in schools and other settings. Judith Blake, the chair of the LGA\u2019s children and young people board, said: \u201cAs more children return to schools, it will be essential that schools and councils have the appropriate resources to deal with any additional support needed for children\u2019s emotional wellbeing. \u201cIt is also important to give councils powers to manage outbreaks in places like schools, care homes, businesses and communities if new Covid-19 clusters emerge.\u201d Most schools have remained open throughout the lockdown to children of care workers and vulnerable pupils. A DfE spokesperson said: \u201cWe will continue to support schools who haven\u2019t yet been able to open more widely to do so as soon as possible.\u201d",

Mike addressed the audience beforehand, his voice breaking with emotion as he talked about his fears for his children.</p> \n<p>Footage of his speech went viral.<strong> </strong>Now, another of his speeches, made in horrifyingly similar circumstances, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/30/killer-mike-you-have-a-duty-not-to-burn-your-own-house-down-video\">has gone viral again</a>.<strong> </strong>I speak to the pair two days after George Floyd, an unarmed black man, died after a white police officer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-death-minneapolis-police-chief-medaria-arradondo-officers-complicit\">Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck for nine minutes</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-death-minneapolis-police-chief-medaria-arradondo-officers-complicit\"> as he complained he could not breathe</a>. Rioting had yet to spread from Minneapolis across the US, but the lyrics of Walking in the Snow \u2013 a track from their forthcoming album, RTJ4, that references the 2014 death of Eric Garner \u2013 have already taken on a terrible new currency: \u201cAnd you so numb you watch the cops choke out a man like me / Till my voice goes from a shriek to whisper, \u2018I can\u2019t breathe\u2019 / And you sit there in the house on the couch and watch it on TV / The most you give\u2019s a Twitter rant and call it a tragedy.\u201d</p> \n<p>After our meeting, Mike\u2019s op-ed for the daily news website Colorlines is published, under his real name, Mike Render,&nbsp;encouraging \u201cpeople who look like me\u201d to \u201ctake seriously their second amendment rights \u2026 The only person you can count on to protect yourself and your family is you \u2026 I encourage gun ownership to my wife, my son and daughters, your sons and daughters and all black people.\u201d</p> \n<p>Then, when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/atlanta-police-chief-erika-shields-george-floyd-protest\">rioting spreads to Atlanta</a>, he appears at a press conference with the city\u2019s mayor, fighting back tears as he gives an extraordinary, eloquent speech. \u201cIt is your duty not to burn your own house down for anger with the enemy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is your duty to fortify your own house so that you may be a house of refuge in times of organisation. Now is the time to plot, plan, strategise, organise and mobilise \u2026 we don\u2019t want to see Targets burning, we want to see the system that sets up for systemic racism burnt to the ground.\u201d The speech struck such a chord that there are calls for Mike to run for office: \u201cKiller Mike is a leader I hope to vote for one day,\u201d offers the comedian Sarah Silverman.</p> \n<p>All that is to come, but the sentiment is mirrored in our interview. On rioting, he says: \u201cIt feels like nobody gives a shit when you\u2019re black.

      "bodyText": "Run the Jewels have enjoyed one of the more improbable rises to fame in recent hip-hop history. Two figures nearing 40, from the genre\u2019s margins \u2013 Killer Mike on the fringes of Outkast\u2019s Atlanta-based circle of rappers and producers, his partner El-P a founder member of Company Flow and longstanding critical darling of east coast underground rap \u2013 who pooled their resources to record a mixtape. They gave it away and watched, astonished, as it and its two successors became runaway successes. It happened despite the fact that their music \u2013 political, angry, more about lyrics than hooks \u2013 is grounded in the golden age hip-hop of Public Enemy and EPMD, and swims against the genre\u2019s prevalent trends. Yet for all they profess a certain mystification over Run the Jewels\u2019 success, it\u2019s hard to avoid the feeling that they\u2019re the right band for the moment: an alternately surreal and furious response to a world spinning bizarrely, horribly out of control. The key moment in their history may have been the night in 2014 they played St Louis hours after the announcement that the police officer Darren Wilson would not face charges after shooting an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, Missouri. Every other gig in the city was cancelled, but Run the Jewels performed. Mike addressed the audience beforehand, his voice breaking with emotion as he talked about his fears for his children. Footage of his speech went viral. Now, another of his speeches, made in horrifyingly similar circumstances, has gone viral again. I speak to the pair two days after George Floyd, an unarmed black man, died after a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck for nine minutes as he complained he could not breathe. Rioting had yet to spread from Minneapolis across the US, but the lyrics of Walking in the Snow \u2013 a track from their forthcoming album, RTJ4, that references the 2014 death of Eric Garner \u2013 have already taken on a terrible new currency: \u201cAnd you so numb you watch the cops choke out a man like me / Till my voice goes from a shriek to whisper, \u2018I can\u2019t breathe\u2019 / And you sit there in the house on the couch and watch it on TV / The most you give\u2019s a Twitter rant and call it a tragedy.\u201d After our meeting, Mike\u2019s op-ed for the daily news website Colorlines is published, under his real name, Mike Render, encouraging \u201cpeople who look like me\u201d to \u201ctake seriously their second amendment rights \u2026 The only person you can count on to protect yourself and your family is you \u2026 I encourage gun ownership to my wife, my son and daughters, your sons and daughters and all black people.\u201d Then, when the rioting spreads to Atlanta, he appears at a press conference with the city\u2019s mayor, fighting back tears as he gives an extraordinary, eloquent speech. \u201cIt is your duty not to burn your own house down for anger with the enemy,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is your duty to fortify your own house so that you may be a house of refuge in times of organisation. Now is the time to plot, plan, strategise, organise and mobilise \u2026 we don\u2019t want to see Targets burning, we want to see the system that sets up for systemic racism burnt to the ground.\u201d The speech struck such a chord that there are calls for Mike to run for office: \u201cKiller Mike is a leader I hope to vote for one day,\u201d offers the comedian Sarah Silverman. All that is to come, but the sentiment is mirrored in our interview. On rioting, he says: \u201cIt feels like nobody gives a shit when you\u2019re black.

Well, you\u2019ve never had the exhilaration of entertaining thousands of people, then going back to your room alone, away from your wife and children and family \u2013 coupled with drugs and anxiety; you might tear up a room.

Doesn\u2019t make rioting right.\u201d The media reporting on protests doesn\u2019t help this feeling that the killing of black people doesn\u2019t trouble the majority, he says. \u201cIt really does feel like nobody gives a shit, even when they do, because the media is \u2026 not going to tell you that there were white people on the ground and black people on the ground, different races and sexes. \u201cThey\u2019re going to preach separation, they\u2019re going to preach fear, conservatism v liberalism \u2013 they\u2019re going to keep stoking those fires. So, we have some action to do now. Giving a shit is the first phase: now let\u2019s progress it.\u201d Meanwhile, El-P, real name Jaime Meline, is optimistic that this could be time of real change \u2013 and that the status quo may be tilting. \u201cI want the oppressors, the enemy, to know that they haven\u2019t created complete hopelessness yet,\u201d he says. \u201cI want motherfuckers to know that there are people from every cultural line that are ultimately not going to accept this. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to think they are off the hook.

The pair were \u201cexhausted, not only as performers, but a little bit as friends, too,\u201d says El-P, a striking admission given their celebrated bromance.

You wake up and think: \u2018How can I kill you and get away with it? How can I kill you, but still be in the group?\u2019\u201d Mike became a political pundit, activist, TV star and a loud advocate for the presidential candidacy of Bernie Sanders (who was photographed making Run the Jewels\u2019 signature hand gesture \u2013 one hand cocked in imitation of a pistol, the other clenched in a fist). \u201cWhat I learned from [campaigning with Sanders] is that it\u2019s all about money,\u201d he sighs. \u201cMoney has totally rotted and corrupted our system, and, more than that, we\u2019ve grown so apathetic that we are not beating their heads on a local level to change that.

Trump is interchangeable with Nixon is interchangeable with Reagan is interchangeable with so many other evil motherfuckers who have held that office. \u201cAs bad as Trump is for our time, imagine what it was like when other presidents were in even worse times, when Eugene Debs [an American socialist] was running for president against Woodrow Wilson \u2013 they locked him up [on charges of sedition for his opposition to the first world war].\u201d \u201cIf anything, it\u2019s a source of mild discomfort to us that our music is seemingly relevant,\u201d sighs El-P. \u201cThe best thing that could ever happen to the world is if Run the Jewels was just blathering nonsense, if we\u2019re just two assholes who are completely out of touch with reality. We don\u2019t want this shit to be on point. It\u2019s because of that truth that we allow ourselves to be completely stupid and surreal on our records as well. We need that, too.\u201d And, as if to prove their point, they move on to talking about their plans for a Run the Jewels feature film: \u201cA buddy criminal action comedy \u2026 a fucked-up version of The Blues Brothers.\u201d \u201cIt looks like it\u2019s very possible that it will happen,\u201d smiles El-P. \u201cHopefully, you\u2019ll see me and Mike screeching through the streets in a Grand National, shooting Nazis.\u201d \u2022 RTJ4 is released on 5 June on Jewel Runners.",

The Conservatives made a clear commitment to address this in their election manifesto, he said. And he said that work on this issue had continued during the coronavirus crisis. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the positive things amid the terrible things that have happened during this crisis is that people have recognised social care and just how important it is.</p> <p>We need to follow that up with reforms to the way social care is supported and make sure more people get that dignity in their older age, and that people of working age get the support they need \u2026<br></p> <p>I am determined to push forward the social care reforms that I know so many [people] are interested in.</p> </blockquote> <p>But when pressed as to when the plans would appear, he replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, the timeframe has been clear, which is that we have got to get these reforms done in this parliament and the prime minister has previously said we will get them set out this year.</p> <p>That was before coronavirus. We will still try to do that but it is not straightforward.</p> </blockquote> <p>A delay until 2021 would be hugely embarrassing for Boris Johnson. On the day he became prime minister in July last year, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/boris-johnsons-first-speech-as-prime-minister-24-july-2019\">in his speech in Downing Street,</a> he implied he had a policy that was all set to be implemented (\u201coven-ready\u201d, to use the phrase he applied in a different context). He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am announcing now \u2013 on the steps of Downing Street \u2013 that we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared to give every older person the dignity and security they deserve.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>Hancock declared that \u201cblack lives matter\u201d as he stressed the importance of addressing why BAME people are more at risk from coronavirus - while failing to announce any concrete proposals.</strong> Earlier, the government published the Public Health England report into why BAME people and other demographic groups are more at risk from coronavirus. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-uk-live-news-updates-covid-19-quarantine-plans-mps-westminster?page=with:block-5ed63b968f08f5e373013033#block-5ed63b968f08f5e373013033\">12.56pm.)</a> Referring to the report, Hancock used the slogan championed by the eponymous US-based human rights group. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is a particularly timely publication because right across the world people are angry about racial injustice. And I get that. Black lives matter. And I want to say this to everyone who works in the NHS and in social care: I value the contribution that you make, everybody equally.</p> </blockquote> <p>But the report, which does not say much more about why BAME people are more at risk from coronavirus than earlier reports (like<a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/coronavirusrelateddeathsbyethnicgroupenglandandwales/2march2020to10april2020\"> this ONS one)</a>, has disappointed people hoping for firm policy recommendations. Hancock has responded by promising \u2026 a further review, headed by the junior equalities minister Kemi Badenoch. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is much more work to do to understand what\u2019s driving these disparities and how the different risk factors interact, and we are absolutely determined to get to the bottom of this and find ways of closing that gap.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7947bb79f7eceeca22f5b06ced40049195e542d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7947bb79f7eceeca22f5b06ced40049195e542d/0_0_4191_2516/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Hancock at the press conference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Hancock at the press conference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pippa Fowles/DOWNING STREET HANDOUT/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T18:25:20.710Z\">at 7.25pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed6882a8f084df971c8e6df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/carolinedavies\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T17:14:12.298Z\">6.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>MPs have been told it is \u201cunacceptable\u201d that children in <strong>young offenders institutions</strong> are still being locked up for more than 22 hours a day, 10 weeks after lockdown.</p> <p>Many of them have had no access to face-to-face education during that time, the justice select committee hearing on the impact of Covid-19 on the youth justice system was told.</p> <p>The custody estate should have moved more swiftly, and there were real concerns that young offenders, who had initially accepted the restrictions placed on them, would lose patience if they saw changes to lockdown in the community, but no relaxation of regimes in YOIs. </p> <p>Very few children had been released under the early release scheme, the committee heard.

class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The UK has reached another grim milestone in its battle with coronavirus today as the death toll surpassed 50,000 for the first time, according to official figures.</p> <p>This morning the ONS released figures showing that 44,401 Covid-19 deaths had occurred in <strong>England and Wales</strong> by 22 May (these figure differ from the <a

<p>This follows last week\u2019s release from <strong>National Records of Scotland</strong> which showed that 3,779 deaths had been registered there up to 24 March. </p> <p>A further 716 deaths had occurred in <strong>Northern Ireland</strong> by 22 May, NISRA figures show. </p> <p>However, figures from NHS England show there were 931 deaths since then, a number which includes hospital deaths but not those occurring in care homes and other settings.</p> <p>Scottish government figures released today show there have been 105 deaths newly registered after 24 May. </p> <p>A further 78 deaths have occurred in Wales since 23 May while there were 22 deaths reported in Northern Ireland in the same period. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a

the most draconian introduced by any British government in peacetime. It may not feel like that, but that is because the lockdown has widespread public support. On paper the powers taken by the state have been extraordinary (as<a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11752310/sex-illegal-coronavirus-lockdown-another-household-police/\"> even the Sun newspaper has twigged)</a>.</p> <p>Yet ministers have managed to introduce these rules without putting a bill through parliament. The lockdown has been imposed under the Public Health Act 1984 using secondary legislation. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-uk-live-news-updates-covid-19-quarantine-plans-mps-westminster?page=with:block-5ed64d288f084df971c8e3a2#block-5ed64d288f084df971c8e3a2\">2.04pm.)</a> The actual regulations have only received minimal parliamentary scrutiny.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hpO7XzpNa8DyxZsWNgckexHeezN1PYR1/view\">a letter (pdf)</a> to Matt Hancock, the health secretary, the <strong>Good Law Project </strong>claims this is illegal. It says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For the emergency procedure under section 45R of the 1984 act to be used, a minister must declare that s/he \u201cof the opinion that, by reason of urgency, it is necessary to make the order without a draft being so laid and approved\u201d. This provision must be interpreted in the light of the authorities referred to above which confirm parliamentary accountability as a fundamental constitutional principle ...</p> <p>We simply do not understand how the amendment regulations were so urgent that it was not possible to put them to votes in both houses. There was no justification for parliamentary accountability to be jettisoned. It is inconceivable that parliament, when passing the 1984 act, would have conceived that the emergency procedure would be used repeatedly in order to avoid parliamentary accountability over the course of months.</p> </blockquote> <p>It is not unusual to hear lawyers make arguments like this, but Hancock might be advised to take it seriously. It is run by <strong>Jolyon Maugham</strong> QC and it was one of the parties involved in the successful attempt to get the supreme court last year to rule Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation illegal.</p> <p>Maugham is not taking Hancock to court - yet. But <a href=\"https://goodlawproject.org/news/it-is-not-good-enough/\">he reserves the right to do so.</a> In its letter the Good Law Project says it supports the aim of the lockdown. But it says that restrictions as sweeping as this should not be introduced via a mechanism that does not allow full parliamentary scrutiny, and it says it might launch a legal challenge using judicial review if Hancock tries to amend the lockdown again using the 1984 act.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T16:15:17.168Z\">at 5.15pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed671728f08f5e3730132b0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T15:39:46.079Z\">4.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Further 324 Covid-19 deaths in UK</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A further 324 people have died after contracting Covid-19, the Department of Health and Social Care has confirmed, taking the UK\u2019s official coronavirus death toll across all settings to 39,369.</p> <p>Another 1,653 people have tested positive for the virus, with 277,985 people having now tested positive since the start of the outbreak. </p> <p>A total of 135,643 tests were carried out yesterday, 7,000 more than the previous day.

She said the government had pledged to test all Scotland\u2019s care home staff regardless of whether they showed symptoms or not, after substantial outbreaks and mounting fatalities in care homes; those testing figures showed that promise had not been met.</p> <p> Johnstone, a list MSP for the Lothians, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>These figures simply don\u2019t add up. Scotland is testing an average of 4,600 people a day, and that is across all sectors. </p> <p>If regular testing of care home staff had begun, as she claims, then that alone would use up to 7,570 tests per day, and that\u2019s before any residents, patients or NHS workers are tested.</p> <p>There is no point in increasing Scotland\u2019s capacity to test for Covid-19 if we are not going to use it.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jackie Baillie</strong>, Scottish Labour\u2019s deputy leader, said the latest figures suggested only 2.1% of Scotland\u2019s population had been tested, when the WHO had urged governments to test as many people as possible.</p> <p>Baillie said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Having to change the testing eligibility guidance seven times in three months clearly shows that the Scottish government got this badly wrong at the start of this pandemic and have been too slow to rectify the situation.</p> <p>Without a rapid expansion in testing we cannot move to the \u201ctest, trace and isolate\u201d stage and so cannot safely continue to ease the lockdown. </p> <p>It is time for the SNP government to swallow its pride and get to work to expand testing.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T15:52:29.941Z\">at 4.52pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed66b9d8f087122eca542bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T15:09:38.158Z\">4.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At least MPs can queue in the shade, Labour\u2019s <strong>Ian Murray</strong> points out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/IanMurrayMP/status/1267835220939677696\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We now appear to have entered the foliage in this voting fiasco <a href=\"https://t.co/6X1dyWYOU9\">pic.twitter.com/6X1dyWYOU9</a></p>&mdash; Ian Murray MP (@IanMurrayMP) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IanMurrayMP/status/1267835220939677696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 2, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed66ad58f08f5e37301325c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T15:08:22.319Z\">4.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Downing Street has announced that <strong>Iain Stewart</strong>, a former whip, has been made a junior minister in the Scotland Office following the resignation of Douglas Ross.

People of BAME groups are also more likely than people of white British ethnicity to be born abroad, which means they may face additional barriers in accessing services that are created by, for example, cultural and language differences.</p> <p>Secondly, people of BAME communities are also likely to be at increased risk of poorer outcomes once they acquire the infection. For example, some comorbidities which increase the risk of poorer outcomes from Covid-19 are more common among certain ethnic groups. People of Bangladeshi and Pakistani background have higher rates of cardiovascular disease than people from White British ethnicity, and people of black Caribbean and black African ethnicity have higher rates of hypertension compared with other ethnic groups. Data from the National Diabetes Audit suggests that type II diabetes prevalence is higher in people from BAME communities.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T12:10:28.610Z\">at 1.10pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed63e498f084df971c8e304\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/haroonsiddique\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T11:56:57.797Z\">12.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The delayed report into into why black, Asian and minority ethnic groups have been disproportionately affected by coronavirus <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/889195/disparities_review.pdf\">has just been published.</a></p> <p>It says, after accounting for the effect of sex, age, deprivation and region: \u201cPeople of Bangladeshi ethnicity had around twice the risk of death when compared to people of white British ethnicity.

It examines how coronavirus affects different demographic groups. It runs to 89 pages and it is<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/889195/disparities_review.pdf\"> here (pdf).</a></p> <p>There has been particular focus on what it will say about why BAME people are so much more at risk. This is what it says on this in the summary.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>People from black ethnic groups were most likely to be diagnosed. Death rates from Covid-19 were highest among people of black and Asian ethnic groups. This is the opposite of what is seen in previous years, when the mortality rates were lower in Asian and black ethnic groups than white ethnic groups. Therefore, the disparity in Covid-19 mortality between ethnic groups is the opposite of that seen in previous years. </p> <p>An analysis of survival among confirmed Covid-19 cases and using more detailed ethnic groups, shows that after accounting for the effect of sex, age, deprivation and region, people of Bangladeshi ethnicity had around twice the risk of death than people of white British ethnicity. People of Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, other Asian, Caribbean and other black ethnicity had between 10 and 50% higher risk of death when compared to white British. </p> <p>These analyses did not account for the effect of occupation, comorbidities or obesity. These are important factors because they are associated with the risk of acquiring Covid-19, the risk of dying, or both. Other evidence has shown that when comorbidities are included, the difference in risk of death among hospitalised patients is greatly reduced.</p> </blockquote> <p>And this is what the summary says about comorbidities (underlying health conditions).</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Among deaths with COVID-19 mentioned on the death certificate, a higher percentage mentioned diabetes, hypertensive diseases, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and dementia than all cause death certificates. </p> <p>Diabetes was mentioned on 21% of death certificates where Covid-19 was also mentioned. This finding is consistent with other studies that have reported a higher risk of death from Covid-19 among patients with diabetes. This proportion was higher in all BAME groups when compared to white ethnic groups and was 43% in the Asian group and 45% in the black group. The same disparities were seen for hypertensive disease. </p> <p>Several studies, although measuring the different outcomes from Covid-19, report an increased risk of adverse outcomes in obese or morbidly obese people.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T12:28:57.268Z\">at 1.28pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed63d5a8f087122eca5408f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T11:55:31.889Z\">12.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Sturgeon concluded her speech by rejecting suggestions one-metre distancing is enough to stop the spread of Covid-19. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You might be reading or hearing in the media today some voices saying that one metre is sufficient, so I want to take the opportunity today to say the clear and strong advice from the Scottish government is to stay two metres apart from those in other households. </p> </blockquote> <p>She reiterated that people shouldn\u2019t meet up with more than one household, only once a day, and there should never be more than eight people in a group. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ed63c0d8f084df971c8e2ed\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T11:51:15.153Z\">12.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>During her speech today, <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong> paid tribute to unpaid carers and volunteers.</p> <p>She said that an additional \u00a3230 payment to those eligible for the <strong>carer\u2019s allowance supplement</strong> - to help cover the strain of the coronavirus pandemic - will be paid automatically at the end of this month.</p> <p>The carer\u2019s allowance supplement, worth \u00a3460 a year, is paid to 83,000 people in Scotland.</p> <p>She also acknowledged that it is Volunteers\u2019 Week and said the efforts of volunteers are more important than ever during this period.<br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T11:53:23.293Z\">at 12.53pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ed638dc8f084df971c8e2b5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T11:39:16.345Z\">12.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The latest coronavirus numbers from <strong>Scotland</strong> as the first minister, <strong>Nicola Sturgeon,</strong> begins her daily press conference.</p> <p>As of 9am this morning:</p> <ul> <li>There have been a 53 further confirmed cases, taking the total to 15,471 positive cases.

Ferguson was appearing with three other academics. (See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-uk-live-news-updates-covid-19-quarantine-plans-mps-westminster?page=with:block-5ed6150a8f08f5e373012e05#block-5ed6150a8f08f5e373012e05\">10.10am.)</a> At no point was he asked, or did he allude to, the circumstances that led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/05/uk-coronavirus-adviser-prof-neil-ferguson-resigns-after-breaking-lockdown-rules\">his resignation from Sage, the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies</a>, although at one point in his evidence, when speaking about care homes, he did sound like someone holding back strong views about government ministers. (When Ferguson resigned from Sage, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/government-scientists-lockdown-breach-a-matter-for-the-police-says-speechless-matt-hancock\">seemed to relish denouncing him.)</a></p> <ul> <li><strong>Ferguson said that he expected coronavirus levels to remain \u201crelatively flat\u201d as the lockdown was gradually eased over the summer but that it was \u201cvery unclear\u201d what would happen in September, when a fuller relaxation is expected.</strong> He implied a second spike was a real possibility. Asked what would happen, he said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of the key issues is how much will relaxation of current controls lead to potential increases in transmission. I should say that it is not clear that it automatically will do so. But most of the modelling would suggest that we might get a small increase, but it\u2019s very unclear whether that will lead to the reproduction number being [above 1] ....</p> <p>I suspect, though, under any scenario that levels of transmission, and numbers of cases, will remain relatively flat between now and September - short of very big policy changes, or behavioural changes in the community.</p> <p>The real uncertainty is if there are larger policy changes in September, as we move into the time of year when respiratory viruses tend to transmit slightly better, what will happen then? And that remains very unclear. </p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said that experts underestimated the extent of coronavirus in the UK in February, and that helped to explain why the death rate was higher than hoped</strong>. He said the experts had not realised how much infection was coming from Spain. He said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One thing the genetic data is showing us now is most chains of transmission still existing in the UK originated from Spain, to some extent Italy. We have been worrying about importations, infections from China - we\u2019re a very well connected country in the world, other Asian countries, the US - but it is clear that before we were even in a position to measure it, before surveillance systems were even set up, there were many hundreds, if not thousands, of individuals coming into the country in late February and early March from that area. And that meant that the epidemic was further ahead than we had anticipated.</p> <p>That explains some of the acceleration of policy then. It also explains, to some extent, why mortality figures ended up being higher than we had hoped.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><strong>He said he was \u201cshocked\u201d at how bad countries around the world had been at protecting people in care homes.</strong> He was not talking specifically about the UK, but he was not omitting it either.

</p> <p>Flights will be at a lower frequency than normal, meaning the airline will operate at around 30% of its normal capacity between July and September. </p> <p>EasyJet previously announced it would resume operations on 15 June, but flights will mainly be restricted to domestic routes in the UK and France. </p> <p>A series of new safety measures will be introduced by the airline, including

Opposition parties want to retain electronic voting. But the vote on this issue will be resolved this afternoon by an \u201cin person\u201d vote. Social distancing rules do not allow MPs to congregate in the division lobbies, as they used to do pre-Covid, and instead they will have to form a long, socially-distanced queue.

MPs who are able to go in and vote will be able to show off to their constituents, like Giant Haystacks in the wrestling ring, yet those MPs who genuinely cannot come back to Westminster, will face questions from local residents why they are not voting, have to explain their personal circumstances, which may be uncomfortable for them to do, and, see their voting record trashed in the internet league tables.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for the UK live blog today, thanks for reading along - you can continue following the latest coronavirus coverage over on our global blog: Here\u2019s a roundup of all the latest stories from across the UK today: UK coronavirus death toll passes 50,000, official figures show. The tally confirms Britain\u2019s status as one of the countries worst hit by a pandemic that has claimed about 375,000 lives globally and brings into view a prediction in April by disease analysts in the US that the UK could record 66,000 deaths by early August. Covid-19 death rate in England higher among BAME people. Death rates from Covid-19 in England have been higher among people of black and Asian origin than any other ethnic group, a government-ordered inquiry has found. In addition, those people of black backgrounds are the ethnic group most likely to be diagnosed with the disease. MPs vote to discontinue virtual parliament. MPs voted in favour of the government\u2019s proposals to end virtual voting by 261 votes to 163, despite the Equality and Human Rights Commission condemning the plan for excluding older MPs or those with disabilities or illnesses. Ministers are still misleading the public on coronavirus tests, according to statistics watchdog. The head of the UK Statistics Authority has accused the government of continuing to mislead the public over the numbers of tests carried out for Covid-19. \u201cThe aim seems to be to show the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding,\u201d said Sir David Norgrove in a letter to the health secretary, Matt Hancock. Covid-19 spreading out of hospitals and care homes, says UK expert. Coronavirus infections in hospitals and care homes are spilling into the community and sustaining the outbreak to the point that cases will remain steady until September, a leading scientist has warned. Downing Street scraps weekend press conferences. Briefings have been held on all but two days since 16 March, but the government has decided to scrap them on Saturdays and Sundays, starting this coming weekend, when viewing figures are \u201csignificantly lower\u201d. Fresh fears over primary schools after staff test positive for Covid-19. Unions have raised fresh concerns about the wider reopening of primary schools in England after a school in Derby was forced to remain closed this week when seven members of staff tested positive for Covid-19. The Scottish parliament could sit through its usual summer recess so members can continue to scrutinise the Scottish government\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic. The presiding officer, Ken Macintosh, wrote to members on Tuesday outlining the proposed changes for what he described was \u201cgoing to be a very unusual summer for everyone across Scotland\u201d. The Parliamentary Bureau agreed members should have the opportunity to meet each Thursday, with the majority as \u201cvirtual statement-led sessions\u201d. In the proposals, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, is scheduled to make two statements to parliament at the beginning and end of next month, with members allowed to participate remotely, before parliament would resume on 11 August when Scottish schools are also expected to return. Macintosh wrote: Following discussion earlier today, the Parliamentary Bureau has unanimously agreed that members should have the opportunity to meet on a weekly basis each Thursday throughout the summer period. MSPs will decide on the plans on Wednesday. In the letter, Macintosh said: I hope you would agree that the bureau\u2019s proposals for the summer period strike the balance of enabling members to continue to scrutinise the government at this changing and uncertain time while avoiding any undue risk to members and staff. 1,749 people have been contacted by NHS Test and Trace since the scheme started, according to Channel 4 News. The programme has seen a leaked copy of the data from Thursday \u2013 the day the system was launched \u2013 to Sunday. Across England, 4,456 confirmed Covid-19 cases had been reported to Test and Trace, and of those, 1,831 self-registered on the website or were called and had completed the form providing information about their contacts. The number of contacts they provided was 4,634, of which just 1,749 had been contacted, Channel 4 News reported. Many non-essential shopping chains are preparing to let customers back into stores as the Covid-19 lockdown eases, adapting their stores to abide by government\u2019s social distancing and health and safety guidelines. Following the example of lockdown procedures already introduced by supermarkets, DIY chains and furniture retailers, these measures include limiting the number of shoppers in stores with queuing systems, as well as installing plastic screens at tills and supplying face masks and other PPE to staff. Other measures include keeping changing rooms closed, operating one-way systems on the shop floors, restrictions on touching merchandise and quarantining products that customers pick up and then return to shelves. Government guidance requires goods returned to stores to be quarantined for up to 72 hours before being returned to store shelves. The precise detail of these measures may vary between different retail chains and types of store. Here is a list of shop and restaurant chains that have confirmed plans to reopen: Clothing and fashion stores reopening from 15 June: Primark (all 153 stores in England) Marks &amp; Spencer (reopening the majority of its clothing stores) Next (25 stores) Debenhams (90 stores) Frasers Group: Sports Direct, Jack Wills, Flannels (number of stores reopening as yet unknown) Harrods department store (Knightsbridge, London) House of Fraser (number of stores reopening as yet unknown. Opening by the end of the week starting 15 June) Ted Baker (all stores from mid-June) General/other retail reopening from 15 June: John Lewis (2 on 15 June in Poole and Kingston upon Thames and a further 11 on 18 June) The Entertainer (all 173 stores) Card Factory (about 100 of its stores) Here are the main points from Matt Hancock\u2019s press conference. The health and social care secretary hinted that the unveiling of the government\u2019s long-awaited plan for the reform of social care could be delayed until 2021. Asked when it would be published, he said that he thought this issue had been \u201cpushed to the side for too long\u201d. The Conservatives made a clear commitment to address this in their election manifesto, he said. And he said that work on this issue had continued during the coronavirus crisis. He said: One of the positive things amid the terrible things that have happened during this crisis is that people have recognised social care and just how important it is. We need to follow that up with reforms to the way social care is supported and make sure more people get that dignity in their older age, and that people of working age get the support they need \u2026 I am determined to push forward the social care reforms that I know so many [people] are interested in. But when pressed as to when the plans would appear, he replied: Well, the timeframe has been clear, which is that we have got to get these reforms done in this parliament and the prime minister has previously said we will get them set out this year. That was before coronavirus. We will still try to do that but it is not straightforward. A delay until 2021 would be hugely embarrassing for Boris Johnson. On the day he became prime minister in July last year, in his speech in Downing Street, he implied he had a policy that was all set to be implemented (\u201coven-ready\u201d, to use the phrase he applied in a different context). He said: I am announcing now \u2013 on the steps of Downing Street \u2013 that we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared to give every older person the dignity and security they deserve. Hancock declared that \u201cblack lives matter\u201d as he stressed the importance of addressing why BAME people are more at risk from coronavirus - while failing to announce any concrete proposals. Earlier, the government published the Public Health England report into why BAME people and other demographic groups are more at risk from coronavirus. (See 12.56pm.) Referring to the report, Hancock used the slogan championed by the eponymous US-based human rights group. He said: This is a particularly timely publication because right across the world people are angry about racial injustice. And I get that. Black lives matter. And I want to say this to everyone who works in the NHS and in social care: I value the contribution that you make, everybody equally. But the report, which does not say much more about why BAME people are more at risk from coronavirus than earlier reports (like this ONS one), has disappointed people hoping for firm policy recommendations. Hancock has responded by promising \u2026 a further review, headed by the junior equalities minister Kemi Badenoch. He said: There is much more work to do to understand what\u2019s driving these disparities and how the different risk factors interact, and we are absolutely determined to get to the bottom of this and find ways of closing that gap. MPs have been told it is \u201cunacceptable\u201d that children in young offenders institutions are still being locked up for more than 22 hours a day, 10 weeks after lockdown. Many of them have had no access to face-to-face education during that time, the justice select committee hearing on the impact of Covid-19 on the youth justice system was told. The custody estate should have moved more swiftly, and there were real concerns that young offenders, who had initially accepted the restrictions placed on them, would lose patience if they saw changes to lockdown in the community, but no relaxation of regimes in YOIs. Very few children had been released under the early release scheme, the committee heard. Since lockdown, there had been additional evidence of self-harm and increased suicide attempts. Angus Mulready-Jones, the Inspectorate of Prisons\u2019 lead for children and young people, said: Was it acceptable on 23 March to shut down regime, including education, so that you can assess the situation and start delivering a service safely to children? Absolutely it was. Is it still acceptable, 10 weeks down the line, to be in a position where children across the estate are locked up for in excess of 22 hours a day? No. I think that is not an acceptable position, and the estate needed to have moved quicker. On a typical day, 60,000 people fly out of Gatwick airport. Last Saturday, there were just 21. The Guardian reporter Archie Bland reports from the eerily deserted airport as the two-week quarantine for arrivals looms. Just seven flights were scheduled at the airport on Tuesday, to and from Jersey, Dublin, Kingston and Sofia. At about 2pm, in one major thoroughfare that normally bustles with passengers, staff and whiteboard-wielding cab drivers, there were six people, or one-fifth the number of hand sanitiser stations. Even stranger than the emptiness was the silence; with almost no passengers, the usually ubiquitous tannoy announcements had been muted completely. As the lockdown begins to lift, the desertion of Gatwick is a reminder of the vast challenges that remain for the aviation sector, with the announcement of a 14-day quarantine period from 8 June, and continuing advice to only travel when necessary, meaning that services will be restored at a glacial pace. The airport fears that the quarantine rules will have \u201ca significant impact on our ability to restart\u201d, a spokesperson said, adding that the airport would be lobbying for the guidelines to be regularly reviewed. In the meantime, a single branch of Boots is all that remains of the usually rich retail offerings. There were no queues. \u201cI\u2019ve got no idea how long it\u2019s been like this now, honestly,\u201d a cashier said. \u201cOne day just merges into another.\u201d The headline figure today for the latest number of UK coronavirus deaths is 324. (See 4.39pm.) For reference, here are the equivalent figures announced in the last two weeks. Tuesday 19 May - 545 Wednesday 20 May - 363 Thursday 21 May - 338 Friday 22 May - 351 Saturday 23 May - 282 Sunday 24 May - 118 Monday 25 May - 121 Tuesday 26 May - 134 Wednesday 27 May - 412 Thursday 28 May - 377 Friday 29 May - 324 Saturday 30 May - 215 Sunday 31 May - 113 Monday 1 June - 111 The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has said the government\u2019s report into BAME Covid-19 deaths \u201cis not nearly enough\u201d and called for a full independent inquiry into the issue. The government needs to wake up to the structural problems in our society that are being laid bare by this virus and take proper and decisive action to rectify them. This report alone is not nearly enough - we need to know now why the virus disproportionately impacts these communities and crucially what is being done to stop it. The government needs to also review the impacts of their policies that have led to a hostile environment and measures like \u2018no recourse to public funds\u2019. The government needs to agree to a full independent inquiry into BAME Covid-19 deaths - with a commitment to implement the recommendations. He added that the coronavirus crisis had increased inequality in the country, affecting \u201cBAME people, those on the lowest incomes and Londoners living in the most deprived areas of the capital\u201d. He said the government should ensure ethnicity was recorded at death registration. \u201cA continued failure to do so means there is no accurate way to measure inequalities in our society,\u201d he said. Hancock says it was clear to him right at the start of the crisis that BAME people were most at risk. He says three of the four doctors to die first were black or minority ethnic people. Q: When will the follow-up report come out? Hancock says he \u201cgets that yearning\u201d for action. He needs to speak to Kemi Badenoch about a timeline for her report. But he won\u2019t necessarily wait until it is done before acting, he says. And that\u2019s it. The press conference is over. Q: When are we getting the long-promised reform of social care? Hancock says this has been delayed \u201cfor too long\u201d. Work on the plan has been continuing during this crisis, he says. He says he hopes the plans will be published before the end of the year. Q: What is the scientific rationale for having a quarantine for people coming into the UK from countries with low rates of coronavirus, like Greece? Newton says he is not a member of Sage, and it is Sage\u2019s advice that counts. He says anyone coming into the country should be treated as an unknown. That would justify quarantine. He says one reason to exempt people might be because they were coming from a low-risk country. And another might be because it was possible to respond quickly with test and trace. He says he thinks those are the principles behind the decision. Q: Do you still think people will not be able to have a foreign holiday this year? Hancock says he answered a question that way some time ago. Last week he gave a slightly more optimistic answer, he says. Historic England has gathered 200 images which best reflect the nation\u2019s experience during lockdown for its archive. They issued an appeal for photographs on 29 April and after 3,000 submissions have selected the most \u201cevocative, informative and inspiring\u201d for the Picturing Lockdown collection. The photos document experiences in England during one week in lockdown. The collection will also feature 50 newly commissioned works by 10 contemporary artists and 50 more from Historic England\u2019s photographers. Here are a small selection of the images: The rest of the collection can be viewed here. Q: Shouldn\u2019t all ethnic minorities now be in an at-risk category? Newton says that although people from ethnic minorities are at a higher risk, that is not necessarily because of their ethnicity. Other factors are relevant, he says. Q: You said the review of the impact of coronavirus on different groups would include recommendations. Where are those recommendations? Hancock says more work needs to be done on this. Prof John Newton from Public Health England says there are recommendations in the report out today, but more work is needed. He says some of the factors that explain why some groups are more at risk explain health inequalities generally. Hancock says the government is determined to find out why some groups are more at risk from coronavirus. He says Kemi Badenoch, the junior equalities minister, will be in charge of the review into this. (Earlier in the Commons he just said this would be led by the equalities minister. I wrongly took that as a reference to Liz Truss, Badenoch\u2019s boss, who combines being international trade secretary with being minister for women and equalities. See 1.25pm.) Here are the latest death figures. In a reference to the fact that the headline figure announced yesterday, 111, omitted 445 deaths that happened before 24 May but that had only just been added to the total, Hancock says the government tries to keep the figures as accurate as possible, and that this sometimes involves revisions to the data. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is holding the daily press conference now. He starts with a chart for testing and new cases. The UK has reached another grim milestone in its battle with coronavirus today as the death toll surpassed 50,000 for the first time, according to official figures. This morning the ONS released figures showing that 44,401 Covid-19 deaths had occurred in England and Wales by 22 May (these figure differ from the daily figures put out by the government, which only include deaths that have occurred in hospitals and care homes where the person has had a positive Covid-19 test prior to their death). This follows last week\u2019s release from National Records of Scotland which showed that 3,779 deaths had been registered there up to 24 March. A further 716 deaths had occurred in Northern Ireland by 22 May, NISRA figures show. However, figures from NHS England show there were 931 deaths since then, a number which includes hospital deaths but not those occurring in care homes and other settings. Scottish government figures released today show there have been 105 deaths newly registered after 24 May. A further 78 deaths have occurred in Wales since 23 May while there were 22 deaths reported in Northern Ireland in the same period. The law enforcing the lockdown is one of the most draconian introduced by any British government in peacetime. It may not feel like that, but that is because the lockdown has widespread public support. On paper the powers taken by the state have been extraordinary (as even the Sun newspaper has twigged). Yet ministers have managed to introduce these rules without putting a bill through parliament. The lockdown has been imposed under the Public Health Act 1984 using secondary legislation. (See 2.04pm.) The actual regulations have only received minimal parliamentary scrutiny. In a letter (pdf) to Matt Hancock, the health secretary, the Good Law Project claims this is illegal. It says: For the emergency procedure under section 45R of the 1984 act to be used, a minister must declare that s/he \u201cof the opinion that, by reason of urgency, it is necessary to make the order without a draft being so laid and approved\u201d. This provision must be interpreted in the light of the authorities referred to above which confirm parliamentary accountability as a fundamental constitutional principle ... We simply do not understand how the amendment regulations were so urgent that it was not possible to put them to votes in both houses. There was no justification for parliamentary accountability to be jettisoned. It is inconceivable that parliament, when passing the 1984 act, would have conceived that the emergency procedure would be used repeatedly in order to avoid parliamentary accountability over the course of months. It is not unusual to hear lawyers make arguments like this, but Hancock might be advised to take it seriously. It is run by Jolyon Maugham QC and it was one of the parties involved in the successful attempt to get the supreme court last year to rule Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation illegal. Maugham is not taking Hancock to court - yet. But he reserves the right to do so. In its letter the Good Law Project says it supports the aim of the lockdown. But it says that restrictions as sweeping as this should not be introduced via a mechanism that does not allow full parliamentary scrutiny, and it says it might launch a legal challenge using judicial review if Hancock tries to amend the lockdown again using the 1984 act. A further 324 people have died after contracting Covid-19, the Department of Health and Social Care has confirmed, taking the UK\u2019s official coronavirus death toll across all settings to 39,369. Another 1,653 people have tested positive for the virus, with 277,985 people having now tested positive since the start of the outbreak. A total of 135,643 tests were carried out yesterday, 7,000 more than the previous day. In total, 4,615,146 coronavirus tests have now been conducted. People should not be put off seeking urgent NHS care during the coronavirus pandemic, Wales\u2019s health minister has said, while the country\u2019s chief medical officer warned stricter lockdown measures could return in the winter if virus transmissions increase. Health minister Vaughan Gething said emergency department activity in May across the country was between 25% and 40% lower than would normally be expected, with attendances by children under 16 having more than halved. Gething told the Welsh government\u2019s daily press briefing \u201cthe NHS is here for everyone\u201d after saying people should still be seeking emergency or urgent care. One of the reasons for this will be because the majority of us have been staying at home, and we haven\u2019t seen the same demand for emergency care. But we do know some people have put off seeking care because they have been worried about going into hospital during the pandemic. It is really important that people do not put off urgent or emergency treatment. The NHS is here for everyone who needs it. Gething said more essential services were returning, while maternity, cancer, and mental health services \u201cwere all still available\u201d. But the health minister was unable to give a restart date for cancer screening services, admitting he was concerned about the \u201cpotential hidden harm\u201d caused to patients whose screenings have been suspended. Earlier on Tuesday, Wales\u2019 chief medical officer, Frank Atherton, published a statement to the Welsh government which said though Covid-19 transmission rates were currently decreasing, any early or extensive reducing of restrictions would lead to \u201ca return of exponential growth of viral transmission\u201d. Dr Atherton also wrote that Wales\u2019s recent relaxing of lockdown rules could be reversed, saying: \u201cI recommend that public messaging highlights the potential need to re-impose more restrictive measures in the winter if viral activity increases.\u201d Asked about the statement, Gething said that the winter would prove a \u201cdifficult period of time\u201d as more people would be indoors where there was a greater risk of the virus surviving. He said a range of key factors would decide on whether restrictions are re-imposed, including the number of people testing positive, the success of Wales\u2019s Test, Trace, Protect programme, and numbers of hospital admissions and people in critical care. The government has won. The Karen Bradley amendment (see 3.48pm) was defeated by 242 votes to 185 - a majority of 57. MPs are now debating on the main government motion. That means they have to go through the whole procedure all over again, even though the result is likely to be much the same. The voting has now finished. It took about 40 minutes. And here is a picture from one of the few Conservative MPs tweeting critically about the queue. Tim Loughton is a former minister. And here are some more tweets from the Mogg meander through Westminster Hall. From Labour\u2019s Neil Coyle From Labour\u2019s Kate Hollern From Labour\u2019s Ian Byrne From Labour\u2019s Kevin Brennan From Labour\u2019s Justin Madders It is claimed the British have a great love of queuing. For obvious reasons, MPs don\u2019t share that sentiment. Here are some more tweets about their experiences of the Westminster Hall wait. From Labour\u2019s John Healey From Labour\u2019s Matt Western From the SNP\u2019s Joanna Cherry From Labour\u2019s Alex Cunningham From Labour\u2019s Alex Sobel From Labour\u2019s Luke Pollard From Tan Dhesi From Sarah Olney, a Lib Dem From Labour\u2019s Neil Coyle Opposition parties have pressed Scottish ministers to explain why the number of people being tested for Covid-19 for the first time in Scotland fell yesterday to less than a thousand, despite World Health Organization advice. Labour and the Scottish Greens challenged Jeane Freeman, the Scottish health secretary, over the figures in Holyrood, contrasting the average test rate of 4,624 per day last week with government pledges to expand testing capacity to 15,000 per day. Freeman insisted that the promise to increase capacity was met, but it was demand-led, she said. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, has suggested the falling number of tests being sought could reflect falling infection rates. Alison Johnstone, for the Scottish Greens, disputed that rationale. She said the government had pledged to test all Scotland\u2019s care home staff regardless of whether they showed symptoms or not, after substantial outbreaks and mounting fatalities in care homes; those testing figures showed that promise had not been met. Johnstone, a list MSP for the Lothians, said: These figures simply don\u2019t add up. Scotland is testing an average of 4,600 people a day, and that is across all sectors. If regular testing of care home staff had begun, as she claims, then that alone would use up to 7,570 tests per day, and that\u2019s before any residents, patients or NHS workers are tested. There is no point in increasing Scotland\u2019s capacity to test for Covid-19 if we are not going to use it. Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour\u2019s deputy leader, said the latest figures suggested only 2.1% of Scotland\u2019s population had been tested, when the WHO had urged governments to test as many people as possible. Baillie said: Having to change the testing eligibility guidance seven times in three months clearly shows that the Scottish government got this badly wrong at the start of this pandemic and have been too slow to rectify the situation. Without a rapid expansion in testing we cannot move to the \u201ctest, trace and isolate\u201d stage and so cannot safely continue to ease the lockdown. It is time for the SNP government to swallow its pride and get to work to expand testing. At least MPs can queue in the shade, Labour\u2019s Ian Murray points out. Downing Street has announced that Iain Stewart, a former whip, has been made a junior minister in the Scotland Office following the resignation of Douglas Ross. Ross resigned to protest about Dominic Cummings being allowed to keep his post as a No 10 adviser after he broke lockdown rules. And David Duguid is joining the government as an unpaid junior minister in the Scotland Office and an unpaid government whip. Labour\u2019s Louise Haigh has also posted a picture of herself queuing up to vote in the Commons. The new system they are using today may not be speedy, but it does mean that MPs have to cast their vote on camera. And, if you were so minded, you could keep a running tally of all the votes being cast for each side. In a tight or controversial division, this would at least heighten the drama ... At least 169 care workers and home carers have now died with Covid-19, data from Public Health England has found. Deaths among those in the care sector were 1.7 times higher during the pandemic compared with previous years, according to figures published on Tuesday. The PHE review found that, between 21 March and 8 May, there were 548 deaths of all causes among care workers and home carers. This is an increase of 232 from the same period in 2014 to 2018, while some 169 (73%) of those excess deaths were due to Covid-19. Six senior care workers were reported to have died with coronavirus, in addition to the 169 care workers and home carers. Some 81 nurses, 51 nursing auxiliaries and assistants and 20 social workers have died with the virus according to PHE figures, which are of deaths registered of 20 to 64-year-olds in England. Outside of the health and social care sector, data shows there were 122 coronavirus-related deaths registered of taxi and cab drivers and chauffeurs between 21 March and 8 May. Deaths of all causes among this sector were 2.5 times higher in this period compared with the period of 2014 to 2018 - increasing from 87 deaths to 217. In comparison, PHE says that deaths of people aged 20 to 64 during this period were 1.5 times higher than average. You can watch MPs voting on the live feed at the top of the blog. The Lib Dem MP Layla Moran has posted this on Twitter, showing where MPs are lining up in Westminster Hall as they join the queue to vote. In the chamber Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, keeps trying to hurry the MPs up. The 90-minute Commons debate is over. MPs are now voting on how they will hold votes in the future. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, called amendment b), an amendment tabled by Karen Bradley, the chair of the Commons procedure committee. A Labour amendment backed by almost all other opposition parties was not called. The Bradley amendment would allow the current \u201chybrid\u201d arrangements in place during the lockdown until now, including allowing remote voting, to carry on until 7 July. In the Commons debate Caroline Nokes, the Conservative MP who chairs the women and equalities committee, has just said that the abolition of remote voting in the Commons does not just look discriminatory; it is discriminatory. She said she would be voting for the anti-government amendment. The London borough of Brent has recorded the highest coronavirus death rates in England among confirmed cases of the disease, new figures show. Up to 13 May, the mortality rate for male confirmed Covid-19 cases in Brent stood at 244.9 deaths per 100,000 population, while for women the rate was 119.4 per 100,000. The figures, published by NHS England, also show that the eight local authority areas with the highest death rates among male confirmed cases were all in London, with Brent followed by Lambeth (213.3 deaths per 100,000 population), Newham (196.6) and Lewisham (181.5). The local authority area outside London with the highest death rate among males is Middlesbrough (156.0) followed by Luton (154.7). For women, seven of the top 10 areas are in London, though Middlesbrough is ranked second (104.7 deaths per 100,000 population), followed by the London boroughs of Lambeth (100.8) and Lewisham (100.0). Salford is ranked seventh (91.6) and Sunderland is ranked 10th (80.6). Across England as a whole, the death rate among confirmed cases was highest in London for both males (140.3 per 100,000 population) and females (66.8). South-west England had the lowest death rate among confirmed cases for both males (33.1) and females (16.3). In every region of England, the death rate in males was higher than females. All figures are age-standardised death rates and are based on laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19. Here are the figures for each region in England: Males London: 140.3 per 100,000 population North-west England: 91.2 West Midlands: 90.6 North-east England: 77.6 East of England: 70.1 Yorkshire and the Humber: 68.7 East Midlands: 61.6 South-east England: 55.7 South-west England: 33.1 Females London: 66.8 per 100,000 population North-east England: 48.6 North-west England: 48.0 West Midlands: 47.5 Yorkshire and the Humber: 34.4 East of England: 33.5 East Midlands: 31.0 South-east England: 28.3 South-west England: 16.3 Labour MP Dr Rosena Allin-Khan has said Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s proposals to end remote parliament voting is \u201cdemocracy for the elite\u201d. Two people have been charged under Scotland\u2019s coronavirus legislation after they needed to be rescued from a munro last Saturday. Police Scotland confirmed that a 27-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman have been charged in connection with culpable and reckless conduct after travelling more than 60 miles from Glasgow to climb Beinn A\u2019 Chroin, near Crianlarich. While Scotland\u2019s mountain bothies were closed at the beginning of the pandemic, the country\u2019s mountain rescue teams said they were \u201cnervous\u201d about easing restrictions over the weekend, after they reported the longest period in 20 years without a single rescue during lockdown. It is clear that the sunny weather encouraged urban hikers to head for the closest munros to Glasgow, with traffic on the A82 at Loch Lomond and in Glen Coe 200% higher than the previous weekend. After beaches and beauty spots across Scotland were crowded with visitors, Nicola Sturgeon yesterday warned that day-trippers were risking lives and threatened to introduce new laws to limit travel for leisure to local areas. Police received reports of the pair \u2013 who were not suitably equipped for the climb - being in difficulty on the munro at around 2.40pm on Saturday, when officers and members of Killin mountain rescue team were deployed to rescue them. Chief Inspector Gill Marshall, area commander for Stirling, said: The actions of this man and woman and their lack of equipment not only placed themselves at risk of injury, but also the officers and mountain rescue volunteers who were called to assist them. We recognise that people have made significant sacrifices until now and while the temptation may be to head straight for one of our beauty spots, we would ask people to use their judgement and avoid going to places which are normally busy during the good weather or, in this case, could put individuals\u2019 lives at risk. We want people to enjoy our outdoor spaces safely and exercise should be done locally, not exceeding five miles from your home. So lockdown is eased, sparking one of nature\u2019s most stunning spectacles: the great migration of the humans across the Ikea car park, writes Guardian columnist Marina Hyde. The Swedish store has replaced Wimbledon as the perfect sport for people who don\u2019t like sport. They even have the dawn queuing. Do you have tickets this year? I\u2019m indifferent to the furniture but I do like to watch the arguments. Seeing couples becoming a singles match over a side table is a quintessential part of British life, like cream teas and the Conservative party polling over 40%. Meanwhile, and all of a sudden, the government has announced that some of the most vulnerable people in the country can go outside again. \u201cGovernment eases lockdown for shielders\u201d, was the big news. And it\u2019s hard to think of a more reassuring headline for this particular group, coming from this particular government. Maybe \u201cGovernment asks shielders to help them lift a sofa into the back of a van\u201d. \u201cGovernment waves from storm drain at shielders looking for their paper boats\u201d. \u201cGovernment responds to shielders saying \u2018Dominic Cummings\u2019 into a mirror three times\u201d. \u201cGovernment asks shielders to check in at a family-run motel\u201d. \u201cGovernment asks shielders to engage a 1980s Wall Street bro to take care of any household repairs/tree surgery they\u2019ve been putting off during lockdown. Contractor will provide own nailgun and chainsaw.\u201d NHS England has announced 143 new deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals in England to 26,865. Of the 143 new deaths announced on Tuesday: 19 occurred on 1 June 34 occurred on 31 May 20 occurred on 30 May The figures also show 58 of the new deaths took place between 5 May and 29 May, eight occurred in April, and the remaining four deaths took place in March, with the earliest on 22 March. NHS England releases updated figures each day showing the dates of every coronavirus-related death in hospitals in England, often including previously uncounted deaths that took place several days or even weeks ago. This is because of the time it takes for deaths to be confirmed as testing positive for Covid-19, for postmortem examinations to be processed and for data from the tests to be validated. The figures published on Tuesday by NHS England show 8 April continues to have the highest number of hospital deaths on a single day, with a current total of 895. British households repaid record amounts of debt racked up on credit cards and personal loans in April as consumers stayed away from the high street during lockdown. Figures from the Bank of England show \u00a37.4bn of consumer credit was repaid during the first full month of strict restrictions on business and social life, the largest net repayment since records began in 1993. Reflecting a record plunge in retail spending in April as people stayed indoors, the Bank said \u00a35bn in credit card debt was paid off in April, more than double the previous month and far more than the typical \u00a3300m paid back monthly by consumers. However, outstanding debts on credit cards remain about \u00a364bn. Experts also warned that while many households managed to repay their debts during lockdown, the hit to workers\u2019 wages and rising job losses at the onset of the deepest recession in living memory would force others deep into the red. A further seven people have died after testing positive for coronavirus in Wales, taking the total number of deaths to 1,354. Another 67 people have tested positive for Covid-19, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in the country to 14,121. The daily Downing Street press conferences will no longer take place at weekends when viewing figures are \u201csignificantly lower\u201d, Number 10 has said. Briefings have been held on all but two days since 16 March, but the government has decided to scrap them on Saturdays and Sundays from this week. The prime minister\u2019s official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: From this week, the press conferences will be on weekdays only, so no longer on Saturdays and Sundays. The PM will take a press conference every week alongside ... the scientific and medical experts. Others will be led by secretaries of state, alongside scientific and medical experts where relevant. Asked why the change was being made, the spokesman said: \u201cIt is just a fact that the numbers who are viewing at weekends do tend to be significantly lower.\u201d Number 10 insisted the government was \u201cabsolutely committed to keeping people updated\u201d. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has led the most Downing Street press conferences so far, totalling 17 as of Tuesday, while Boris Johnson has led 12 and the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has taken 11. In the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg accepts the new voting system will involve some \u201cteething problems\u201d. An MP asks if Rees-Mogg has ever been to Alton Towers. (The queuing system has been compared to the one at the attraction - see 2.26pm.) To the surprise of some MPs, Rees-Mogg tells them he has been there. He took his sister, Annunziata, many years ago, he says. A further two people have died after contracting Covid-19 in Northern Ireland, bringing the total toll to 526. Four more positive tests brought the total diagnosed, largely in hospitals, to 4,732. In the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, said that he disapproved of remote voting because voting was a serious act. He said that it was wrong for MPs to be able to exercise their vote while at home, perhaps watching TV. He also said that he did not accept that, under his plan, MPs who had to shield at home were being disenfranchised. They would still be able to participate in other parliamentary affairs, such as by asking questions, he said. MPs unable to attend parliament to vote in person could in theory pair with an MP from another party. (That would mean both agreeing not to vote, cancelling each other out.) But the political parties never reveal which MPs are paired, with the result that if an MP pairs, people do not know why they were absent. Asked if pairing information should be published, Rees-Mogg said he could not give a commitment on this, but he suggested the idea should be raised with party whips. And, asked if the proxy voting system (that allows MPs on maternity leave to vote by proxy) could be extended for those shielding, Rees-Mogg did not embrace the idea - but he said he was not ruling it out either. The decision for England\u2019s official coronavirus alert level to remain at four despite this week\u2019s easing of some lockdown restrictions was made by the chief medical officer, Downing Street has said, indicating he vetoed the government\u2019s wish for it to be lowered. Our colleague Peter Walker has the full story here. In the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has just opened the debate on his plan to end electronic, or remote, voting in the Commons. This is hugely controversial because MPs who have been told they cannot attend parliament because they are shielding say they will be disenfranchised. (See 9.35am and 2.14pm.) Rees-Mogg said he would tomorrow table a plan to allow MPs who cannot attend the Commons on health grounds to participate in debates (presumably via Zoom, as MPs were able to do under the \u201chybrid\u201d proceedings arrangements in place before the Whitsun recess.) But he is receiving many hostile interventions from MPs who argue that the new system will not work. The DUP\u2019s Ian Paisley said it was hard for MPs to travel from Northern Ireland to London at the moment and that, if they came to London, they wanted to concentrate on debating. He said that under the Rees-Mogg plan, which would involve MPs having to queue at great length to vote in person, divisions would take too much time. Rees-Mogg did not accept the point. He said voting would only take a little longer. The Labour MP Luke Pollard has posted this video showing the scene in Westminster Hall this afternoon, where MPs will be expected to queue as they line up to vote later. The Equality and Human Rights Commission has condemned the UK government\u2019s plan to only allow MPs to participate in Commons debates and votes in person, saying it \u201ccannot be right\u201d to exclude older MPs or those with disabilities or illnesses, our colleague Peter Walker reports. In a joint statement welcoming the move the Conservative MP Robert Halfon, chair of the Commons education committee, and Labour\u2019s Vicky Foxcroft, the shadow minister for disabilities, said: What stronger message can you get than the EHRC, one of the government\u2019s own non-departmental public bodies, confirming that the ending of remote participation for those of us who are shielding or otherwise unable to attend parliament is discriminatory? As MPs - from opposite sides of the house - who are shielding, we have many important issues we need to raise on behalf of disabled people and our fellow shielders. Disabled people have felt like an afterthought throughout this pandemic and it is therefore vital that the government looks again at the proposed return to physical participation. This briefing, produced by barristers from Cloisters chambers, looks at the equality and human rights implications of Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s plan to end electronic voting, and whether it could be challenged in the courts. It concludes: The ability of MPs to participate in the parliamentary process on an equal basis regardless of age, disability, ethnicity, sex and carer status engages fundamental equality and human rights principles. The legal mechanisms for enforcing these principles through the courts are far from straightforward ... However, although the legal issues are technical, the basic question is not. What kind of democracy are we, if our elected representatives can be excluded from carrying out their democratic functions because of, or for reasons relating, to their age, race, sex or state of health? Under the initial lockdown law - the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020 - the rules had to be reviewed at least every three weeks. But, in a Commons written statement, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has said they will now be reviewed every four weeks. He explained: This will allow decisions to align more closely with the period of time necessary to assess the impact of previous changes on key data feeds, including the R (infection) rate. The government will also keep all the measures under continual review and will account to parliament on an ongoing basis. Boris Johnson told his Italian counterpart, Giuseppe Conte, in early March that the UK was aiming for \u201cherd immunity\u201d as part of its approach to coronavirus, a TV documentary claims. Channel 4\u2019s Dispatches spoke to the Italian health minister, Pierpaolo Sileri, who said this is what was said in a conversation between Johnson and Conte on 13 March. Sileri told the programme: I spoke with Conte to tell President Conte that I\u2019d tested positive [for coronavirus]. And he told me that he\u2019d spoken with Boris Johnson and that they\u2019d also talked about the situation in Italy. I remember he said, \u2018He told me that he wants herd immunity\u2019. I remember that after hanging up, I said to myself that I hope Boris Johnson goes for a lockdown. In late February and early March the government\u2019s scientific adviser were relatively open about saying that they thought it would be impossible to entirely suppress coronavirus and that there were advantages from allowing \u201cherd immunity\u201d to build up. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, said this publicly, including in a Today programme interview on 13 March (the day the Johnson/Conte conversation took place). But very soon afterwards the government abruptly changed policy, in response to modelling saying that anything other than a policy aimed at full suppression of coronavirus would led to the NHS being overwhelmed. Subsequently ministers became averse to being associated with the \u201cherd immunity\u201d concept, because that implied toleration or even support for people dying from coronavirus in manageable numbers, and now they insist it was never part of their policy. According to PA Media, the Dispatches programme also quotes Prof Graham Medley, who sits on the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), saying he was dismayed by government complacency at the early stages of the outbreak. Medley told the programme: We already knew that this virus was going to cause an awful lot of death and disability and would require an awful lot of NHS resource ... so it was with some dismay that we were watching senior politicians behaving in a way that suggested that this was not something that was too serious. This is what Matt Hancock, the health secretary, told MPs about the Public Health England report (see 12.56pm) and the new review being led by the equalities minister. He said: This work underlines that being black or from a minority ethnic background is a major risk factor. This racial disparity holds even after accounting for the effect of age, deprivation, region and sex. The PHE ethnicity analysis did not adjust for factors such as comorbidities and obesity, so there is much more work to do to understand the key drivers of these disparities, the relationship between the risk factors and what we can do to close the gap. I\u2019m determined that we continue to develop our understanding and shape our response. And I\u2019m pleased to announce that the equalities minister will be leading on this work and taking it forward, working with [Public Health England] and others to further understand the impact. UPDATE: Hancock said the equalities minister would lead this review and originally this post said he was referring to Liz Truss, the cabinet minister responsible for equalities (as well as international trade, her main job). But later Hancock said Kemi Badenoch would take on this role. See 5.15pm. I\u2019ve amended the post to make allowance for this. Ten of the UK\u2019s biggest disability charities have written to ministers to warn that they may have to close or drastically reduce care services if they do not receive emergency financial support from the government. The charities estimate that they face a collective shortfall of between \u00a350m and \u00a375m over the next few months because of a collapse in fundraising income and extra spending on Covid-19 costs such as PPE. The Leonard Cheshire charity, which runs residential care homes and community services, said it faced losses of up to \u00a325m this year \u2013 around 15% of its total spending \u2013 and was currently drawing on financial reserves to meet PPE costs of \u00a3800,000 a month. The letter, to charities minister Lady Barran, said, the government\u2019s \u00a3750m charity support package announced in April was insufficient and had overlooked the needs of disabled people and their families. It said: Our services are often the only place disabled people and their families have to turn and we want to be there for everyone who needs us. Without vital funds, we will have stark choices to make about cutting vital services that are not provided by anyone else and in some cases closing our doors. We are deeply concerned that it appears disabled people and their families have fallen through the cracks of government work and funding and are in real danger of being forgotten. Our organisations and our services are doing the best we can to support thousands of people each week yet without material support from government many of us will be unable to do so for much longer. The 10 charities, which form the disability charity consortium are: Scope, Sense, Mind, Action on Hearing Loss, Business Disability Forum, Mencap, National Autistic Society, RNIB, Disability Rights UK and Leonard Cheshire. Here are some graphs from the review into Covid-19 deaths among BAME people which help demonstrate the report\u2019s overall findings. Among both males and females, the report has found black, Asian, mixed and other ethnic groups have suffered a disproportionate amount of deaths during the Covid-19 outbreak in England. The report states: Black males were 3.9 times more likely to die than the white group, compared with 2.5 times in Asian males. Among females, death rates were 3.3 times higher in the black ethnic group, and 2.3 times higher in the Asian ethnic group than the White group. However, the baseline all-cause rates show lower mortality in Asian and black ethnic groups than the white group, therefore the inequality in Covid-19 mortality between these groups is the opposite of that seen for all causes of death in previous years. The rates in the \u201cother\u201d ethnic group are likely to be an overestimate due to the difference in the source of allocating ethnicity codes to the mortality data and the population data used to calculate the rates. This may explain the high mortality rates in the other group, which cannot be interpreted and requires further investigation. In the Commons Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is making a statement about coronavirus, and the Public Health England report into the impact of coronavirus on different groups. He says, even allowing for age, deprivation, region and sex, BAME people are at much greater risk. He says the equalities minister will take charge of a review looking at what more can be done to address this. Some further information from the BAME Covid-19 report that has just been published On the reasons for the disparities, the report says: Firstly, people of BAME communities are likely to be at increased risk of acquiring the infection. This is because BAME people are more likely to live in urban areas, in overcrowded households, in deprived areas, and have jobs that expose them to higher risk. People of BAME groups are also more likely than people of white British ethnicity to be born abroad, which means they may face additional barriers in accessing services that are created by, for example, cultural and language differences. Secondly, people of BAME communities are also likely to be at increased risk of poorer outcomes once they acquire the infection. For example, some comorbidities which increase the risk of poorer outcomes from Covid-19 are more common among certain ethnic groups. People of Bangladeshi and Pakistani background have higher rates of cardiovascular disease than people from White British ethnicity, and people of black Caribbean and black African ethnicity have higher rates of hypertension compared with other ethnic groups. Data from the National Diabetes Audit suggests that type II diabetes prevalence is higher in people from BAME communities. The delayed report into into why black, Asian and minority ethnic groups have been disproportionately affected by coronavirus has just been published. It says, after accounting for the effect of sex, age, deprivation and region: \u201cPeople of Bangladeshi ethnicity had around twice the risk of death when compared to people of white British ethnicity. People of Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, Other Asian, Caribbean and Other Black ethnicity had between 10% and 50% higher risk of death when compared to white British.\u201d Crucially, it says the analyses did not account for the effect of occupation, comorbidities or obesity. There has been particular concern that BAME people are more exposed because of their occupations. For example, the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that a third of all working-age black Africans are employed in key worker roles, 50% more than the share of the white British population. Additionally it said that Pakistani, Indian and black African men are respectively 90%, 150% and 310% more likely to work in healthcare than white British men. The report also looks at other risk factors for Covid-19, including age, sex and obesity. The largest disparity found was by age, with people already diagnosed with Covid. The government has just published the Public Health England report \u201cDisparities in the risk and outcomes of Covid-19\u201d. It examines how coronavirus affects different demographic groups. It runs to 89 pages and it is here (pdf). There has been particular focus on what it will say about why BAME people are so much more at risk. This is what it says on this in the summary. People from black ethnic groups were most likely to be diagnosed. Death rates from Covid-19 were highest among people of black and Asian ethnic groups. This is the opposite of what is seen in previous years, when the mortality rates were lower in Asian and black ethnic groups than white ethnic groups. Therefore, the disparity in Covid-19 mortality between ethnic groups is the opposite of that seen in previous years. An analysis of survival among confirmed Covid-19 cases and using more detailed ethnic groups, shows that after accounting for the effect of sex, age, deprivation and region, people of Bangladeshi ethnicity had around twice the risk of death than people of white British ethnicity. People of Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, other Asian, Caribbean and other black ethnicity had between 10 and 50% higher risk of death when compared to white British. These analyses did not account for the effect of occupation, comorbidities or obesity. These are important factors because they are associated with the risk of acquiring Covid-19, the risk of dying, or both. Other evidence has shown that when comorbidities are included, the difference in risk of death among hospitalised patients is greatly reduced. And this is what the summary says about comorbidities (underlying health conditions). Among deaths with COVID-19 mentioned on the death certificate, a higher percentage mentioned diabetes, hypertensive diseases, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and dementia than all cause death certificates. Diabetes was mentioned on 21% of death certificates where Covid-19 was also mentioned. This finding is consistent with other studies that have reported a higher risk of death from Covid-19 among patients with diabetes. This proportion was higher in all BAME groups when compared to white ethnic groups and was 43% in the Asian group and 45% in the black group. The same disparities were seen for hypertensive disease. Several studies, although measuring the different outcomes from Covid-19, report an increased risk of adverse outcomes in obese or morbidly obese people. Sturgeon concluded her speech by rejecting suggestions one-metre distancing is enough to stop the spread of Covid-19. You might be reading or hearing in the media today some voices saying that one metre is sufficient, so I want to take the opportunity today to say the clear and strong advice from the Scottish government is to stay two metres apart from those in other households. She reiterated that people shouldn\u2019t meet up with more than one household, only once a day, and there should never be more than eight people in a group. During her speech today, Nicola Sturgeon paid tribute to unpaid carers and volunteers. She said that an additional \u00a3230 payment to those eligible for the carer\u2019s allowance supplement - to help cover the strain of the coronavirus pandemic - will be paid automatically at the end of this month. The carer\u2019s allowance supplement, worth \u00a3460 a year, is paid to 83,000 people in Scotland. She also acknowledged that it is Volunteers\u2019 Week and said the efforts of volunteers are more important than ever during this period. The latest coronavirus numbers from Scotland as the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, begins her daily press conference. As of 9am this morning: There have been a 53 further confirmed cases, taking the total to 15,471 positive cases. This includes 40 older cases which have only been received today. The number of patients in hospital with Covid-19 increased by 122, taking the total to 1,168 There are 34 people in intensive care, an increase of seven from yesterday - all of these seven patients are suspected not confirmed cases A total of 3,721 have left hospital after recovering from Covid-19. A further 12 Covid-19 deaths have been registered from hospitals, taking the total death toll to 2,375. HM Coastguard responded to nearly 450 incidents during its \u201cbusiest weekend of 2020\u201d, as thousands of people flocked to beaches and beauty spots to enjoy the hot weather. On Sunday, it had the highest number of callouts so far this year, with 241 incidents - a 168% increase on the May 2019 average. It experienced its second busiest day of the year on Saturday, with 206 incidents - a total of 447 incidents over the weekend. It warned \u201ccoronavirus hasn\u2019t gone away\u201d, and that \u201cwe all need to follow the rules\u201d. HM Coastguard duty commander Matt Leat said: Boating, swimming and other sea-based activities are now allowed again across the UK, as is spending time on the beach. However, now more than ever, people need to respect the sea and the coast to ensure the safety of themselves and their families. Regardless of how well you know the coast, or how experienced you are in your chosen sport, the sea can still catch you out. On Saturday, three people were seriously injured after jumping off cliffs into the sea at a beach in Dorset, leading the local council leader to call on the government to restrict people from travelling over five miles for leisure. In the Commons Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, has been making a statement about Hong Kong, where Beijing is imposing a draconian new security law. He said the new law would be a \u201cclear violation\u201d of China\u2019s international obligations in relation to Hong Kong. He told MPs: We have not yet seen the detailed, published text of the legislation, but I can tell the house that if legislation in these terms is imposed by China on Hong Kong it would violate China\u2019s own basic law, it would upend China\u2019s \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 paradigm and it would be a clear violation of China\u2019s international obligations, including those specifically made to the United Kingdom under the joint declaration. A primary school in Derby has temporarily closed after reporting that seven staff members tested positive for Covid-19. Arboretum primary school is due to be shut for a week with all affected parties instructed to isolate for 14 days. Derby Diocesan Academy Trust (DDAT), which runs the school, said four members of staff tested negative for the virus. DDAT added that the affected staff had only suffered mild symptoms and were recovering well at home. In a statement, the trust said: Following one member of staff reporting symptoms, the school quickly identified any other members of staff, parents/carers and/or children who may have been in contact and instructed them to isolate for the government\u2019s recommended period of 14 days. Since then, six members of staff have tested positive and four members of staff who were in contact have tested negative. There have been no reports of parents/carers or children displaying symptoms. In line with guidance, the school has closed this week to allow a deep-clean to be completed and will reopen next week, initially to children of key workers and vulnerable children. A Derby city council spokesperson said none of the seven staff members who tested has \u201cbeen in touch with children\u201d. \u201cThe school will re-open on Monday June 8 and all of those adults who may have been in contact with the affected staff have been informed,\u201d they added. Here are the main lines from Lords science committee hearing with Prof Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College London academic whose coronavirus modelling led to No 10 introducing the lockdown. Ferguson was appearing with three other academics. (See 10.10am.) At no point was he asked, or did he allude to, the circumstances that led to his resignation from Sage, the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, although at one point in his evidence, when speaking about care homes, he did sound like someone holding back strong views about government ministers. (When Ferguson resigned from Sage, Matt Hancock, the health secretary, seemed to relish denouncing him.) Ferguson said that he expected coronavirus levels to remain \u201crelatively flat\u201d as the lockdown was gradually eased over the summer but that it was \u201cvery unclear\u201d what would happen in September, when a fuller relaxation is expected. He implied a second spike was a real possibility. Asked what would happen, he said: One of the key issues is how much will relaxation of current controls lead to potential increases in transmission. I should say that it is not clear that it automatically will do so. But most of the modelling would suggest that we might get a small increase, but it\u2019s very unclear whether that will lead to the reproduction number being [above 1] .... I suspect, though, under any scenario that levels of transmission, and numbers of cases, will remain relatively flat between now and September - short of very big policy changes, or behavioural changes in the community. The real uncertainty is if there are larger policy changes in September, as we move into the time of year when respiratory viruses tend to transmit slightly better, what will happen then? And that remains very unclear. He said that experts underestimated the extent of coronavirus in the UK in February, and that helped to explain why the death rate was higher than hoped. He said the experts had not realised how much infection was coming from Spain. He said: One thing the genetic data is showing us now is most chains of transmission still existing in the UK originated from Spain, to some extent Italy. We have been worrying about importations, infections from China - we\u2019re a very well connected country in the world, other Asian countries, the US - but it is clear that before we were even in a position to measure it, before surveillance systems were even set up, there were many hundreds, if not thousands, of individuals coming into the country in late February and early March from that area. And that meant that the epidemic was further ahead than we had anticipated. That explains some of the acceleration of policy then. It also explains, to some extent, why mortality figures ended up being higher than we had hoped. He said he was \u201cshocked\u201d at how bad countries around the world had been at protecting people in care homes. He was not talking specifically about the UK, but he was not omitting it either. He said: I, like many people, am shocked about how badly European - or countries around the world - have protected care home populations. Prof Matt Keeling from Warwick University also said that more could have been done to protect people in care homes. He suggested that the academic modellers were partly at fault. He said: If the lockdown had been very strict, if we\u2019d have thought more about what was happening in care homes and hospitals, as you\u2019ve heard, early on maybe that was one of the areas where modellers did drop the ball. With hindsight, it\u2019s very easy to say we know care homes and hospitals are these huge collections of very vulnerable individuals, so maybe with hindsight we could have modelled those early on and thought about the impacts there. EasyJet will resume flights on half its routes by the end of next month. The Luton-based carrier, which has grounded its entire fleet during the coronavirus pandemic, announced its plan to ramp up flights in the coming weeks. Half of its 1,022 routes will be reopened by the end of July, increasing to 75% during August. Flights will be at a lower frequency than normal, meaning the airline will operate at around 30% of its normal capacity between July and September. EasyJet previously announced it would resume operations on 15 June, but flights will mainly be restricted to domestic routes in the UK and France. A series of new safety measures will be introduced by the airline, including requiring passengers to wear face masks at airports and on aircraft. It has produced thousands of face mask covers inspired by comic books to be handed to children flying on selected routes in a bid to ease their anxiety about the new rule. Other steps to boost hygiene include not selling food during flights, enhanced cleaning of planes, and disinfection wipes and hand sanitiser being provided. Passengers will be invited to sit away from people not in their party on flights with empty seats. EasyJet\u2019s chief commercial and planning officer, Robert Carey, said: We are delighted to announce that we will be flying the majority of our route network across Europe, meaning customers can still get to their chosen destination for their summer holidays this year. We\u2019re passionate about helping our customers get back flying, which is why we\u2019re offering one million seats at \u00a329.99 for those planning on booking a holiday this summer. BAME campaigners have said it is imperative to publish an inquiry into why black and minority ethnic groups have been disproportionately affected by coronavirus as soon as possible so action can be taken to mitigate the risks to vulnerable people. The findings were meant to be released by the end of May but publication has been delayed and is now not expected until the end of this week at the earliest. Simon Woolley, director of Operation Black Vote, said: My view is that we need to have this report sooner rather than later. The impact on black and minority ethnic communities has been devastating and we want to work with the government on understanding the data, but even more importantly, having solutions to close what we see are some of the fundamental disparity gaps that at the very least have exacerbated the impact, the death, and heartache that it [coronavirus] has had on black and minority ethnic communities. There was also criticism of the delay from unions representing healthcare workers. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the British Medical Association council chair, whose demand for a review in April, in an interview with the Guardian, helped bring the issue to public attention, said: The government-commissioned review by Public Health England needs to be concluded as soon as possible in order for us to make sense of why this dreadful virus is impacting so adversely on the BAME community and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 what needs to be done to urgently protect them. Dame Donna Kinnair, the Royal College of Nursing chief executive and general secretary, concurred. \u201cThe Public Health England review must be published as a matter of urgency,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery day we go without knowing why BAME health and care staff are disproportionately affected by Covid-19 is another day these workers are needlessly put at extra risk.\u201d The Liberal Democrats say the UK Statistics Authority letter released today (see 10.37am) about the official testing statistics shows that government ministers have been \u201cwilfully misleading the public\u201d. The party has released this statement from the MP Layla Moran. The UK Statistics chief has rightly criticised the government for their shocking misuse and spinning of statistics. The number of tests posted out is not the same as the number of people actually tested. Everyone sees through this and all it does, in the end, is erode trust in politics and politicians. At a time like this, the government should be having honest, grown-up conversations with people based on clear reporting and facts. They should be making decisions based on actual numbers of people tested, rather than stats that are spun to fit a political agenda. By continuing to withhold figures on the actual numbers of people being tested, and providing inadequate and confusing data, government ministers are standing up in Downing Street and wilfully misleading the public. The Chartered Institute of Environmental Health (CIEH) has urged the government not to reduce the 2-metre physical distancing rule as it seeks to reopen the economy. The CIEH said it was vital ministers did not reduce the distance to 1 metre \u201cdue to pressure from industry\u201d. The World Health Organization (WHO) advises people to stay \u201cat least one metre\u201d away from others in order to reduce the chance of catching the coronavirus. However, the most comprehensive study of the issue \u2013 part-funded by the WHO and published today in the Lancet \u2013 found that reducing social distancing to one metre could double the risk of infection. Kate Thompson, CIEH Wales director, said: We call on the government to stand firm in its stance on the 2m rule when it comes to social distancing, especially as the riskier businesses, like pubs and hairdressers, are set to re-open from next month. In the Lords committee Prof Neil Ferguson says relaxing the lockdown measures will not automatically lead to more incidents of coronavirus. He says he expects rates of coronavirus to remain relatively flat over the summer. But he says the real uncertainty is about what might happen in September, when the lockdown could be be relaxed further. He says it is \u201cvery unclear\u201d what will happen at that point. In the Lords committee Lady Manningham-Buller, the former head of MI5, asks what has gone wrong. She says at the start of the crisis Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, said the UK would be doing well to have just 20,000 deaths. The death toll is now about double that, she says. Prof Matt Keeling from the University of Warwick said Vallance was talking about what would have happened if things had gone well. He suggests the lockdown could have been stricter. And more could have been done to protect people in care homes. He says he thought the modelling gave a good indication as to what might happen. Prof Neil Ferguson says genetic analysis says most strains of coronavirus in the UK originated in Spain or Italy. He says many thousands of infected people come into the country in February and early March. That helps to explain why death figures ended up being higher than hoped, he says. Dr Adam Kucharski from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) says the lockdown in the UK has not been the same as the lockdown in other countries. Different measures will have different results, he says. The number of mortgage approvals made to homebuyers slumped to a record low in April as the housing market was held at a near-standstill, Bank of England figures show. As PA Media reports, some 15,848 mortgage approvals for house purchase were recorded - around 80% below February levels before coronavirus lockdown measures were imposed - the Bank\u2019s money and credit report revealed. This was around half the number of approvals taking place in the trough during the financial crisis, and the lowest since the figures started in 1993, the report said. In the Lords science committee Prof Neil Ferguson says he has been \u201cshocked\u201d at how bad countries around the world have been at protecting people in care homes. In the Lords Viscount Ridley, a Conservative, says the modelling does not seem to have been very accurate. He says the death toll in Sweden is much lower than the modelling suggested. Prof Neil Ferguson says Sweden did not use the Imperial College modelling, as Ridley suggested. And he says that, even though Sweden did not introduce a full lockdown, there was nevertheless considerable social distancing. As a result the reproduction number, R, came down to about 1, he says. In the Lords science committee Lady Rock asks if there was any difference in the modelling scenarios used by Sage. Prof Neil Ferguson says Sage uses different models. He says Sage\u2019s reasonable worst-case scenario is currently based on the Warwick model. But he says the problem in early March was that the reasonable worst-case scenario was also close to the best estimate of what would happen. He says the models do not produce the same results, but generally they support the same policy recommendations because the differences are not great. Britain\u2019s statistics watchdog has again warned the health secretary, Matt Hancock, that figures on coronavirus tests remain \u201cfar from complete and comprehensible\u201d. In a strongly-worded letter, Sir David Norgrove, chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, said the way the government presented the figures appeared to be aimed at showing \u201cthe largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding\u201d. The government has faced repeated criticism for its daily testing figures, in which it counts in its headline figure the number of tests posted out to people as well as the number of those completed. It is also not clear from the government data how many of the tests carried out are repeat tests on the same person. Norgrove said the government\u2019s current statistics figures were misleading people during the daily No 10 briefing as they often do not explain how the headline figure on the number of tests has been calculated. He said the way the tests were presented at the televised press conference gives \u201can artificially low impression of the proportion of tests returning a positive diagnosis\u201d. Norgrove said it was also \u201chard to believe the statistics work to support the testing programme itself\u201d, adding that they \u201cstill fall well short\u201d of the statistics code of practice which Hancock has said he supported. He added: It is not surprising that given their inadequacy that data on testing are so widely criticised and often mistrusted. You can read the letter in full below: In the Lords science committee Lady Sheehan asks if the scientists took into account \u201clockdown fatigue\u201d - people getting less compliant over time - in their modelling. Prof Neil Ferguson says fatigue with lockdown measures was not something everyone modelled. But he says they assumed that the lockdown would lead to a 75% drop in contacts outside the home. But in practice there was an 85% reduction, he says. P&amp;O Cruises has extended the suspension of its sailings until at least 15 October, PA Media reports. The firm said it is \u201cworking in close co-ordination with all relevant public health bodies to approve further enhancement of the company\u2019s already stringent health and safety protocols\u201d. Prof Neil Ferguson tells the Lords that in March they learned that the UK had been more heavily affected than people expected. Going forward, the UK has \u201climited room for manoeuvre\u201d, he says. He says it is necessary to keep infection suppressed by 65%. Asked about the impact of coronavirus on BAME people, he says it is clear they have been heavily affected. But he says it is not clear whether that is because ethnicity is an independent risk factor, or because of other factors. Our colleagues Robert Booth and Pamela Duncan have done the maths following the release of the latest ONS figures. They find that the total number of deaths involving Covid-19 throughout the UK now stands at 49,324. When deaths in care homes and other settings are taken into account for the last week, the true death toll in the UK is likely already to have exceeded 50,000, they write. This confirms Britain\u2019s status as one of the world\u2019s worst hit countries by the pandemic that has claimed around 375,000 lives globally. You can read the full story here. Prof Neil Ferguson tells the Lords committee that immunity is a key issue when studying a virus. He says people develop seasonal immunity from other coronaviruses. But we still don\u2019t know very much about Covid-19 yet, he says. The Office for National Statistics said there have been 286,759 deaths to date in England and Wales this year - 51,466 more than the five-year average. Of the deaths registered by 22 May, 43,837 mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate, which was 15.3% of all deaths. One faint silver lining was that the weekly number of deaths involving Covid-19 in England and Wales fell to a seven-week low in the week to 22 May: 2,589 death certificates mentioned Covid-19 in the week, down from 3,810 in the previous seven days. Nick Stripe, the ONS\u2019s head of health analysis, has posted an interesting thread explaining the figures: The House of Lords science and technology committee is now taking evidence from four experts on pandemic modelling. They include Prof Neil Ferguson from Imperial College London, who led the team that produced the paper (pdf) published on 16 March that prompted the government to introduce the lockdown. Ferguson subsequently resigned from Sage, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, after it emerged that his lover had visited him at his home in breach of lockdown rules. The other witnesses are: Dr Ellen Brooks-Pollock from the University of Bristol; Prof Matt Keeling from the University of Warwick and Dr Adam Kucharski from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM). Imperial, LSHTM, Bristol and Warwick have all produced modelling on the spread of coronavirus, and the likely impact of lockdown measures, for Sage. They don\u2019t always reach the same conclusions, as this paper (pdf), for example, illustrates. Lisa Nandy, the shadow foreign secretary, has described the government\u2019s plans to impose quarantine on people arriving in the UK as \u201ca total shambles\u201d. Priti Patel, the home secretary, is due to publish details of the plans today, but our colleagues Vikram Dodd and Peter Walker had key details in an overnight preview story. Even though the plans contain more exemptions and loopholes than originally expected, the quarantine concept is still deeply unpopular with Tory MPs, who fear it will damage the travel industry, and the economy generally. The Telegraph (paywall) claims today that Boris Johnson is now in favour of introducing so-called \u201cair bridges\u201d - exemptions from quarantine for particular countries. It says officials are looking at plans to introduce these from the end of June. In his London Playbook briefing this morning Jack Blanchard from Politico Europe suggests that the government may back down on its plans to abandon electronic voting in the Commons. (See 9.35am.) Blanchard writes: Could some sort of government climbdown yet be on the cards? Word is that [Jacob] Rees-Mogg got a rough ride from MPs on the Tories\u2019 backbench 1922 Committee last night, and Playbook notes that certain government officials now seem remarkably keen to, erm, socially distance themselves from this whole plan. \u201cNobody in government knew about this until it was announced,\u201d one senior government official claimed last night. An opposition staffer reckons Boris Johnson privately told SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford at a meeting of opposition leaders last week that he, too, had not been made aware of the problems with how all this would work. There have been 43,837 deaths involving the coronavirus in England and Wales up to 22 May, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Of those deaths, 12,733 (29%) were people in care homes, the ONS said. Its figures show that that 42,210 people in England had died from confirmed or suspected Covid-19 in the same period, far higher than the government tally for that period of 32,666. The government\u2019s figure includes only deaths of people who had tested positive for the coronavirus. Whereas the ONS includes all mortalities in which Covid-19 is mentioned on the death certificate, so it includes suspected cases. Scottish Liberal Democrat MP Jamie Stone has accused the UK government of \u201cforcing through\u201d plans to end remote voting and return MPs to meeting in parliament in person. Stone, who represents Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross and who cares for his disabled wife, told BBC Radio Scotland\u2019s Good Morning Scotland that MPs had proved that remote scrutiny worked and that it was too early and too risky to push through a return to business as usual. Scottish MPs are particularly concerned about the risks inherent in the length of travel time to the Commons from their constituencies. The SNP\u2019s shadow leader of the house, Tommy Sheppard, described the plans to \u201cshut down virtual participation and replace it with a conga line parliament\u201d as unacceptable and unworkable. He said: SNP MPs will continue to press for full virtual participation and urge the Tories to scrap their plans. If they do not, we will balance protecting public health and Scotland\u2019s democratic voice by sending the minimum number of MPs required to hold the UK government to account, while the majority will continue to work in their constituencies. Given that there has been no change of heart so far, the SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, and a few MPs will be present today. Good morning. I\u2019m Andrew Sparrow, joining the blog for the day. As reported already (see 8.33am), one of the main events in the Commons this afternoon will be a vote about how to vote. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, has infuriated many MPs - including Tories - by proposing to give up the system that allows MPs to vote electronically. Opposition parties want to retain electronic voting. But the vote on this issue will be resolved this afternoon by an \u201cin person\u201d vote. Social distancing rules do not allow MPs to congregate in the division lobbies, as they used to do pre-Covid, and instead they will have to form a long, socially-distanced queue. On the Today programme this morning the BBC\u2019s Norman Smith suggested Westminster could end up looking like Ikea did yesterday. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker, wrote a letter to MPs yesterday explaining what will happen today. The Conservative MP Robert Halfon, who is one of the MPs who has had to stay away from parliament because he is shielding, has written an angry article for the House magazine saying the decision to abandon electronic voting is illogical. Here\u2019s an extract. Members are told that hybrid voting (both online and in parliament) is impossible, yet given no reason why. If hybrid voting is beyond the realm of the techno-Moggs, MPs are then informed that proxy voting (letting another parliamentarian vote on their behalf), is also unmanageable, with no explanation given. It is truly extraordinary that a decision has been made in this way. MPs who are able to go in and vote will be able to show off to their constituents, like Giant Haystacks in the wrestling ring, yet those MPs who genuinely cannot come back to Westminster, will face questions from local residents why they are not voting, have to explain their personal circumstances, which may be uncomfortable for them to do, and, see their voting record trashed in the internet league tables. Not particularly helpful at election times. Housing minister Simon Clarke has said the two-week quarantine period for new entrants to the UK will be enforced from 8 June, despite some backbench opposition. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Clarke described it as a \u201ctemporary, time-limited measure\u201d but did not say for how long it might be in place. It has been reported that the government is planning to ease these measures three weeks later in time for the school summer holidays. Clarke was also asked why the government had not yet published the number of people tested or traced under its flagship programme that got under way this week. He denied the government was \u201cplaying silly games\u201d and added: These figures are independently compiled, these are not produced by government ministers. They are published by PHE and all the health service parties who are working with us. Nobody here is playing silly games with data. It\u2019s absolutely about making sure that when we do issue it, it is accurate. Sir Keir Starmer has told the government to \u201cstop the excuses\u201d and publish its review into the disproportionate number of deaths of people from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds from the coronavirus. It emerged last night that the publication of the report by Public Health England had been delayed (see 7:37am). The return of parliament from recess today will see MPs form a disorderly queue to vote on a government motion that would end the virtual voting system introduced only weeks ago. How will it work? Your guess is as good as mine, given that many MPs \u2013 like Margaret Hodge \u2013 will be unable to vote because they are shielding or self-isolating and they can no longer vote online. It is expected that hundreds of politicians will have to form a kilometre-long queue stretching all the way through parliament, dubbed \u201cthe Rees-Mogg conga\u201d after the Commons leader whose motion has prompted this spectacle. The Commons leader Lindsay Hoyle wrote to MPs last night (email here) to say they must \u201cration\u201d their time in the debating chamber as only 50 of them will be allowed in at any one time. The 90-minute debate on the new voting system begins at 1.30pm, with socially distanced voting expected to begin about 3pm.

The company, Faculty, was awarded the contract by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government last month. However, the full details of its work for the government are unknown because the published version of the contract was partly redacted. The disclosure comes amid questions from civil liberties groups as to how private companies hired by the government during the pandemic are using confidential personal data. Dominic Cummings, the chief executive of the Vote Leave campaign and now chief adviser to Boris Johnson, recruited one of Faculty\u2019s data scientists, Ben Warner, to work with him in Downing Street. In April we revealed that both Cummings and Warner had been attending meetings of Sage, the government\u2019s committee of scientific advisers. It subsequently emerged that Marc Warner, the brother of Ben and the chief executive of Faculty, has also attended. Read the full story here. The number of people with learning disabilities dying in care has more than doubled during the coronavirus pandemic, according to new figures. The Care Quality Commission (CQC), the health and social care regulator, said it had found a 134% increase in the number of these deaths compared with last year. It found that between 10 April and 15 May, 386 people with a learning disability died in care compared with 165 in the same period last year. Of the 386 people who died this year, 206 were as a result of suspected and/or confirmed Covid-19 and 180 were not related to the virus. Kate Terroni, the CQC\u2019s chief inspector of adult social care, said that while the data had limitations it showed a \u201csignificant increase\u201d in deaths of people with a learning disability as a result of Covid-19. She added: Every death in today\u2019s figures represents an individual tragedy for those who have lost a loved one. We already know that people with a learning disability are at an increased risk of respiratory illnesses, meaning that access to testing could be key to reducing infection and saving lives. These figures also show that the impact on this group of people is being felt at a younger age range than in the wider population \u2013 something that should be considered in decisions on testing of people of working age with a learning disability. Former transport minister Stephen Hammond has continued to call for the plan to quarantine all people arriving from outside the UK to be scrapped. Hammond said a \u201cblanket set of measures\u201d for a 14-day quarantine would not work. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that a more targeted set of measures was needed, such as so-called \u201cair bridges\u201d permitting travel between two countries. He said tourists could also be required to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) on flights and undergo temperature checks at each end of their journey. The release of an official report into the disproportionate number of people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds dying from coronavirus has been delayed, it emerged last night. The Public Health England review was announced in early May after early data showed that 35% of almost 2,000 patients in intensive care units were black or from another minority ethnic backgrounds, despite BAME people making up only 14% of the population, according to the last census. On Monday night, Sky News cited unnamed sources in saying that the publication of the report had been delayed because of \u201cworries\u201d about releasing it in \u201cclose proximity to the current situation in America\u201d \u2013 a reference to the huge demonstrations that have followed the killing of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis. The Department for Health and Social Care said it was \u201cnot true\u201d that the report had been delayed due to \u201cglobal events\u201d and said it would be passed to ministers for their consideration today before being published later this week. However, Marsha de Cordova, the shadow women and equalities secretary, said: It is unacceptable that this review should be delayed without a given date for its publication. BAME communities need answers. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve got coming up today: 9.30am ONS coronavirus-related deaths figures 10am Prof Neil Ferguson gives evidence to Lords science committee 10.30am Cabinet 11.30pm There will be quite the spectacle in parliament as MPs vote in person to end virtual voting. 12.30pm First minister Nicola Sturgeon is expected to host the Scottish government\u2019s daily briefing. 2.30pm Commons justice committee hears impact of Covid-19 on prisons, probation and court services 5pm daily No 10 press conference. Good morning and welcome to Tuesday\u2019s UK liveblog on the coronavirus pandemic. Leading the news today is confusion and concern about the government\u2019s plans for a 14-day quarantine period for those entering the UK from abroad. We revealed overnight that visitors would be able to go food shopping, change accommodation and use public transport under draft plans due to be laid before parliament. The rules, which are due to be published later today, have prompted cross-party concern about the potentially severe impact on the travel and aviation industry and their relatively limited impact on public health. We\u2019ll have more on that later. Also today, MPs are returning to parliament to vote on a government motion that means they have to be physically present in Westminster to debate and vote. The government wants to get back to normal proceedings as soon as possible, saying the virtual voting system has been too restrictive. But many MPs say it is unfair to force those who are shielding or self-isolating to physically return to the Commons and it could threaten the lives of staff.

This was considered an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/13/the-guardian-view-on-the-hybrid-parliament-unfinished-business\" title=\"\">imperfect</a> but makeshift arrangement necessary to observe the social distancing guidelines. These rules, instituted to save lives, have not changed.</p> <p>Yet the government has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/02/mps-back-westminster-government-parliament\" title=\"\">decided</a> to end remote voting and online interventions in debates. Ministers want only a few dozen MPs in the parliamentary chamber to ask questions, and those who wish to vote must queue up to cast their vote in person at the dispatch box. MPs who have been advised to stay home and shield can no longer take part in debates or votes and will have to rely on their whips to find opponents to pair with. It is wrong that parliament should proceed without provision for remote participation when many elected representatives cannot attend in person.</p> <p>The system was given a dry run on Tuesday \u2013 and was <a href=\"https://news.trust.org/item/20200602163908-rfo4w/\" title=\"\">hardly an advert</a> for parliamentary oversight. Instead of a digital voting system in which all MPs could be involved, we have a ludicrous queueing system in which only two-thirds of parliamentarians can participate. Online voting took 15 minutes, its replacement three times as long. That the new system is slower, more dangerous and less inclusive undermines ministers\u2019 argument that the previous one was not fast enough to deal with the volume of legislation.</p> <p>One suspects that there will now be fewer votes scheduled, which is a step back for democracy. Ministers evidently see no loss in the absent MPs unable to participate in debates on legislation. The message is very clear: we are dealing with a cabinet that is responsive at a stretch to the ruling party, but not to the Commons. Parliamentary democracy is fragile and can easily be disrupted if a powerful group of its members does not accept its rules.</p> <p>A government that controls parliament can suppress information or inquiries which are to its disadvantage, sometimes by refusing to supply information. Team Johnson appears to be both scornful and fearful of scrutiny \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/28/boris-johnson-sacrifices-top-scientific-advisers-on-altar-of-classic-dom\" title=\"\">silencing</a> scientists who might depart from the script during the damaging Dominic Cummings affair and delaying the publication of the last intelligence and security committee report on Russia. More pertinently, the coronavirus crisis requires an effective parliamentary audit of the far-reaching powers placed in the hands of the executive.</p> <p>It was a former Tory lord chancellor who <a href=\"https://www.aph.gov.au/binaries/senate/pubs/occa_lect/transcripts/280203.pdf\" title=\"\">warned</a> that \u201chuman nature being what it is, every human being and every human institution will tend to abuse its legitimate powers unless these are controlled by checks and balances, in which the holders of office are not merely encouraged but compelled to take account of interests and views which differ from their own\u201d. A system was in place that allowed MPs to vote, speak and represent their constituents. In rescinding that, the government has left many voters unrepresented. Mr Johnson betrays a view of the lower chamber as a bystander in governance. A vigilant, inquiring and effective Commons is essential to prevent the misuse of formidable powers in a pandemic. It is extremely bad news for the country that Mr Johnson does not want such a parliament.</p>",

Yet the government has decided to end remote voting and online interventions in debates. Ministers want only a few dozen MPs in the parliamentary chamber to ask questions, and those who wish to vote must queue up to cast their vote in person at the dispatch box. MPs who have been advised to stay home and shield can no longer take part in debates or votes and will have to rely on their whips to find opponents to pair with. It is wrong that parliament should proceed without provision for remote participation when many elected representatives cannot attend in person. The system was given a dry run on Tuesday \u2013 and was hardly an advert for parliamentary oversight. Instead of a digital voting system in which all MPs could be involved, we have a ludicrous queueing system in which only two-thirds of parliamentarians can participate. Online voting took 15 minutes, its replacement three times as long. That the new system is slower, more dangerous and less inclusive undermines ministers\u2019 argument that the previous one was not fast enough to deal with the volume of legislation. One suspects that there will now be fewer votes scheduled, which is a step back for democracy. Ministers evidently see no loss in the absent MPs unable to participate in debates on legislation. The message is very clear: we are dealing with a cabinet that is responsive at a stretch to the ruling party, but not to the Commons. Parliamentary democracy is fragile and can easily be disrupted if a powerful group of its members does not accept its rules. A government that controls parliament can suppress information or inquiries which are to its disadvantage, sometimes by refusing to supply information. Team Johnson appears to be both scornful and fearful of scrutiny \u2013 silencing scientists who might depart from the script during the damaging Dominic Cummings affair and delaying the publication of the last intelligence and security committee report on Russia. More pertinently, the coronavirus crisis requires an effective parliamentary audit of the far-reaching powers placed in the hands of the executive. It was a former Tory lord chancellor who warned that \u201chuman nature being what it is, every human being and every human institution will tend to abuse its legitimate powers unless these are controlled by checks and balances, in which the holders of office are not merely encouraged but compelled to take account of interests and views which differ from their own\u201d. A system was in place that allowed MPs to vote, speak and represent their constituents. In rescinding that, the government has left many voters unrepresented. Mr Johnson betrays a view of the lower chamber as a bystander in governance. A vigilant, inquiring and effective Commons is essential to prevent the misuse of formidable powers in a pandemic. It is extremely bad news for the country that Mr Johnson does not want such a parliament.",

      "bodyText": "The existential choice facing America was laid bare on Tuesday, as Donald Trump and Joe Biden set out radically contrasting visions for a nation convulsed by seven nights of protests over police brutality and racial injustice. The president visited the Saint John Paul II National Shrine in Washington, after threatening to deploy the American military against the American people and being eviscerated by church leaders for using the Bible as a political prop. Biden, the former vice-president and presumptive Democratic nominee for president in November, delivered a sombre speech at Philadelphia\u2019s city hall, suggesting the US is at one of the most important crossroads in its history. A week of demonstrations were triggered by the killing of George Floyd, an African American man who died when a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes, even after Floyd stopped moving and pleaded: \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Those words are still \u201cechoing across this nation\u201d, Biden said in his most high-profile public appearance since the coronavirus pandemic forced him to campaign from home. \u201cThey speak to a nation where too often just the colour of your skin puts your life at risk,\u201d he said. \u201cThey speak to a nation where more than 100,000 people have lost their lives to a virus and 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment \u2013 with a disproportionate number of these deaths and job losses concentrated in the black and minority communities.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a wake-up call for our nation. For all of us.\u201d Biden promised police reforms to deal with systemic racism. He also forcefully condemned Trump, who has a long history of sowing racial division. \u201cWe can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,\u201d he said, adding that Trump \u201cis part of the problem, and accelerates it\u201d. He compared the president to notoriously racist officials from the 1960s, adding: \u201cI promise you this. I won\u2019t traffic in fear and division. I won\u2019t fan the flames of hate.

The 527 MPs snaked through Westminster halls and courtyards for an hour and 23 minutes to vote on the proposal by the Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, which was carried by 261 votes to 163. It incited a furious reaction from many MPs, including those who are shielding and black and ethnic minority (BAME) politicians. In a sombre moment in the debate that preceded the vote, the shadow Commons leader, Valerie Vaz, launched a blistering attack on the government, asking what \u201crisk assessment\u201d the government had done for both BAME MPs and workers in the parliament buildings. \u201cWe are twice as likely to die,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cPlease stop peddling the myth that we only work when we are here [in the House of Commons].\u201d Since 21 April a virtual parliament has allowed MPs to vote online or using their phones instead of cramming into backrooms in the House of Commons which divide the \u201cayes\u201d from the \u201cnoes\u201d. But Tuesday\u2019s first physically-distanced voting demonstrated how the system risked being choked, despite Rees-Mogg\u2019s claim it would be better for democracy. Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow work and pensions secretary, described the queuing system as \u201cgenius level stuff\u201d while Neil Coyle, the Labour MP for Bermondsey and Old Southwark, asked if there were any \u201ccat shepherds\u201d in Westminster to move the queue through quickly. \u201cQueue two doesn\u2019t even begin in courtyard.

He also complained that some MPs were not paying heed to social distancing. In a partial climbdown, Rees-Mogg said he would put forward a second motion on Wednesday to allow the hybrid parliament to continue to allow MPs to attend debates virtually. However, while he did not rule out a virtual or proxy vote, there were no plans to allow MPs who could not attend the house on medical grounds to have a vote on legislation. He pledged there would be a \u201cpairing\u201d arrangement that would ensure each MP unable to make the vote because of shielding issues would be matched by a non-voting government MP. But he faced an immediate backlash, with MPs living hundreds of miles from Westminster branding it \u201cdemocracy for the elite\u201d. The Liberal Democrat MP for Orkney and Shetland, Alistair Carmichael, who took 18 hours to get to Westminster because of flight restrictions, said Rees-Mogg was giving a green light to a parliament for people \u201cwithin driving distance of London\u201d. The Democratic Unionist Ian Paisley said the move would \u201cobstruct\u201d the right to vote of the party\u2019s eight MPs as there were flight restrictions in place between Belfast and London, while the SNP\u2019s leader in the Commons, Ian Blackford, said it had taken him 16 hours to get to London because he had to get the sleeper train. \u201cWhat a waste of time in the middle of a national health crisis when MPs should be attending to their overflowing postbags,\u201d he said. Carmichael said it was also irresponsible.

Rees-Mogg, who lives close to Westminster, questioned the democratic value of MPs who were voting on their phones or from their home offices. \u201cVoting while taking a sunny walk or watching television does democracy an injustice,\u201d he told the 30 or so physically-distanced MPs present in the chamber. Rees-Mogg claimed it was in voters\u2019 interests to get parliament back up and running as legislation had been \u201cclogged\u201d with \u201cno detailed, line-by-line consideration of bills that will affect people\u2019s lives\u201d.",

The British Medical Association (BMA), which represents Britain\u2019s doctors, described it as \u201ca missed opportunity\u201d to instigate urgent action.</p> <p>Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, demanded a full-blown public inquiry, with ministers committed to implementing its conclusions. \u201cThis report alone is not nearly enough. We need to know now why the virus disproportionately impacts these communities and crucially, what is being done to stop it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe government needs to also review the impacts of their policies that have led to a hostile environment and measures like [migrants left with] \u2018no recourse to public funds\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA\u2019s council chair, voiced disquiet that two months after it first called for an inquiry into the high death rate among BAME healthcare workers, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/10/uk-coronavirus-deaths-bame-doctors-bma\">in a Guardian interview</a>, nothing had moved forward.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3cd5b670f55112867dcff0df4d26386ebbb69b5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cd5b670f55112867dcff0df4d26386ebbb69b5e/0_130_5381_3230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association, criticised the PHE report for a lack of practical guidance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BMA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt is a statistical analysis, which while important, gets us no closer towards taking action that avoids harm to BAME communities. The BMA and the wider community were hoping for a clear action plan to tackle the issues, not a reiteration of what we already know,\u201d said Nagpaul. He lamented the report\u2019s lack of practical guidance on how to better protect people of BAME origin.</p> <p>\u201cMore specifically, the report fails to mention the staggering higher proportion of BAME healthcare workers who have tragically died from Covid-19 \u2013 with more than 90% of doctors being from&nbsp;BAME backgrounds,\u201d Nagpaul added, and he also criticised PHE\u2019s report for not properly considering the occupations of BAME victims, exposure to the virus and availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) as risk factors.</p> <p>A Health Service Journal report published on Tuesday night claimed that the government had removed a key part of the review. It said a section was missing that appeared in a draft version circulated last week with responses from more than 1,000 organisations and individuals, many of them suggesting that discrimination and poorer life chances played a part in greater Covid-19 risk for BAME Britons. PHE and the health department both denied the story. </p> <p>The greater vulnerability of people of colour to Covid-19 has been starkly illustrated in the death toll of NHS staff. About six in ten of the more than 200 who have died during the pandemic, including the first dozen doctors, were from BAME backgrounds, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/six-in-10-uk-health-workers-killed-by-covid-19-are-bame\">according to a Guardian analysis</a>.</p> <p>At the daily Downing Street press conference on Tuesday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, used his opening remarks to highlight the PHE report and explicitly link it to the unrest in the US caused by the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, at the hands of white police.

      "bodyText": "Ministers are under pressure to hold a public inquiry after an official report confirmed that people from black, Asian and minority ethnic groups are dying disproportionately from Covid-19. Political leaders, medical groups and trade unions voiced deep frustration and anger after the government failed to set out any concrete steps to end the ongoing \u201cscandal\u201d. The government-commissioned Public Health England (PHE) investigation found that people of Bangladeshi background in England are twice as likely as white Britons to die if they contract Covid-19, and other BAME groups face an increased risk of up to 50%. However, PHE was criticised for simply restating the increased mortality highlighted by other research without explaining the reasons for the stark disparity, or making recommendations to tackle it. The British Medical Association (BMA), which represents Britain\u2019s doctors, described it as \u201ca missed opportunity\u201d to instigate urgent action. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, demanded a full-blown public inquiry, with ministers committed to implementing its conclusions. \u201cThis report alone is not nearly enough. We need to know now why the virus disproportionately impacts these communities and crucially, what is being done to stop it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government needs to also review the impacts of their policies that have led to a hostile environment and measures like [migrants left with] \u2018no recourse to public funds\u2019.\u201d Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA\u2019s council chair, voiced disquiet that two months after it first called for an inquiry into the high death rate among BAME healthcare workers, in a Guardian interview, nothing had moved forward. \u201cIt is a statistical analysis, which while important, gets us no closer towards taking action that avoids harm to BAME communities. The BMA and the wider community were hoping for a clear action plan to tackle the issues, not a reiteration of what we already know,\u201d said Nagpaul. He lamented the report\u2019s lack of practical guidance on how to better protect people of BAME origin. \u201cMore specifically, the report fails to mention the staggering higher proportion of BAME healthcare workers who have tragically died from Covid-19 \u2013 with more than 90% of doctors being from BAME backgrounds,\u201d Nagpaul added, and he also criticised PHE\u2019s report for not properly considering the occupations of BAME victims, exposure to the virus and availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) as risk factors. A Health Service Journal report published on Tuesday night claimed that the government had removed a key part of the review. It said a section was missing that appeared in a draft version circulated last week with responses from more than 1,000 organisations and individuals, many of them suggesting that discrimination and poorer life chances played a part in greater Covid-19 risk for BAME Britons. PHE and the health department both denied the story. The greater vulnerability of people of colour to Covid-19 has been starkly illustrated in the death toll of NHS staff. About six in ten of the more than 200 who have died during the pandemic, including the first dozen doctors, were from BAME backgrounds, according to a Guardian analysis. At the daily Downing Street press conference on Tuesday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, used his opening remarks to highlight the PHE report and explicitly link it to the unrest in the US caused by the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, at the hands of white police. But he offered no solutions to reduce the deaths of BAME people. \u201cThis is a particularly timely publication, because right across the world, people are angry about racial injustice,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I get that. Black lives matter. And I want to say this to everyone who works in the NHS and in social care: I value the contribution that you make, everybody equally.\u201d However, under repeated questioning, Hancock did not outline any new policies in these areas and, asked how people from BAME backgrounds could protect themselves, he advised that they \u201cstringently follow the social distancing guides\u201d. Responding to criticism about the lack of recommendations, he said the equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, had been charged with seeing \u201cwhat further could be done\u201d. Rehana Azam, the national secretary of the GMB union, backed Khan\u2019s call for a public inquiry. \u201cIt\u2019s a scandal that we\u2019ve seen so many deaths of people from a BAME background at a time when the government still haven\u2019t got a handle on the testing and PPE that are vital to keep NHS staff safe,\u201d she said. Azam urged Hancock to set out \u201ca credible plan\u201d to protect BAME workers who \u201chave made a disproportionate sacrifice during this pandemic\u201d. Operation Black Vote (OBV), which has called for a Covid-19 race equality strategy across Whitehall to address inequalities highlighted by the pandemic, said it was time for urgent action \u201cto fundamentally rebuild those areas of society that have clearly exacerbated the tragic loss of life BAME communities have faced\u201d. Lord Simon Woolley, director of OBV and chair of Downing Street\u2019s advisory board for the Race Disparity Unit, said coronavirus \u201cdoes expose and amplify areas of life that are deeply racialised such as low pay, zero hour contracts, overcrowded housing, and inequality in health\u201d. Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said that \u201conly a comprehensive race equality strategy will address these issues. Now is a once in a generation opportunity for government to deliver one.\u201d NHS trusts in England are examining ways of reducing the risk of their BAME staff becoming infected.

      "body": "<p>Hilda Churchill survived the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, not to mention two world wars, but the 108-year-old succumbed to coronavirus on 28 March, and she remains Britain\u2019s oldest victim. Less than a week later, about 200 miles south in Watford, 23-year-old John Alagos would become the youngest medic to die from Covid-19.</p> <p>And, as the death toll continued to climb over the following weeks, tributes poured in for Keith Dunnington, 54, who had worked as a nurse for more than 30 years and died at his parents\u2019 home in South Shields on 19 April.</p> <p>While his family tried to come to terms with his death they faced further tragedy: his parents, Lillian and Maurice Dunnington, who had been together for more than 60 years, passed away a day apart at South Tyneside hospital, holding each other\u2019s hands.</p> <p>These five people were living very different lives across the country. But they are now, and will always be, connected by a virus whose death toll stands at 50,000 in the UK, according to official figures. Here, behind the statistics that so often belie the human impact of Covid-19, are their stories.</p> <h2><strong>A</strong> family torn apart</h2> <p>A nurse for three decades, Keith Dunnington worked for an agency and most recently on the frontline of ward 12 at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Gateshead.</p> <p>Known for valuing the importance on his colleagues having a proper dinner each Sunday, he often arranged food for everyone. Outside of work, he volunteered at soup kitchens and spent time with his family. He had recently moved in with his parents, Lillian and Maurice, both in their 80s.</p> <p>For him, coronavirus seemed to hit hard and fast, with his condition deteriorating rapidly. When his cousin, Debbie Harvey, received a call, she expected to hear that her relative had gone into hospital; instead he had died.</p> <p>Harvey is still coming to terms with the shock: \u201cI almost passed out. It\u2019s still hard to believe.\u201d</p> <p>A few days later, Harvey would receive another phone call, this time from her aunt \u2013 Keith\u2019s mother \u2013 Lillian, 81. \u201cShe said, \u2018Your uncle has fallen and I need help.\u2019\u201d Harvey rushed over to assist 88-year-old Maurice, helping him to get upright. \u201cHe looked like he had a stroke or something. He looked terrible.\u201d</p> <p>When she saw Lillian had developed a cough, Harvey told her husband she would be staying with her aunt and uncle.&nbsp;She arranged with the GP to get some disability aids to support them both, but Lillian only got weaker. She finally asked to be taken to the hospital, and knew she would not come out. \u201cShe said at that point, \u2018I think I\u2019ve definitely got it and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to survive it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Harvey described Lillian as a beautiful soul. \u201cShe has been such an important person in my life over the past 31 years, since my mum died. She has been everything to us. We\u2019ve always been a tight-knit family.\u201d</p> <p>Maurice had stopped eating and drinking shortly after his wife was admitted to South Tyneside hospital. Though he was not showing any coronavirus symptoms, he was taken to the same hospital. Days later, Harvey received a call telling her Lillian had passed away.</p> <p>\u201cThey were holding hands when my aunty passed away.&nbsp;They were put together in the same room and the staff pushed their bed together,\u201d Harvey said. Maurice died soon after his wife.

      "bodyText": "Hilda Churchill survived the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, not to mention two world wars, but the 108-year-old succumbed to coronavirus on 28 March, and she remains Britain\u2019s oldest victim. Less than a week later, about 200 miles south in Watford, 23-year-old John Alagos would become the youngest medic to die from Covid-19. And, as the death toll continued to climb over the following weeks, tributes poured in for Keith Dunnington, 54, who had worked as a nurse for more than 30 years and died at his parents\u2019 home in South Shields on 19 April. While his family tried to come to terms with his death they faced further tragedy: his parents, Lillian and Maurice Dunnington, who had been together for more than 60 years, passed away a day apart at South Tyneside hospital, holding each other\u2019s hands. These five people were living very different lives across the country. But they are now, and will always be, connected by a virus whose death toll stands at 50,000 in the UK, according to official figures. Here, behind the statistics that so often belie the human impact of Covid-19, are their stories. A family torn apart A nurse for three decades, Keith Dunnington worked for an agency and most recently on the frontline of ward 12 at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Gateshead. Known for valuing the importance on his colleagues having a proper dinner each Sunday, he often arranged food for everyone. Outside of work, he volunteered at soup kitchens and spent time with his family. He had recently moved in with his parents, Lillian and Maurice, both in their 80s. For him, coronavirus seemed to hit hard and fast, with his condition deteriorating rapidly. When his cousin, Debbie Harvey, received a call, she expected to hear that her relative had gone into hospital; instead he had died. Harvey is still coming to terms with the shock: \u201cI almost passed out. It\u2019s still hard to believe.\u201d A few days later, Harvey would receive another phone call, this time from her aunt \u2013 Keith\u2019s mother \u2013 Lillian, 81. \u201cShe said, \u2018Your uncle has fallen and I need help.\u2019\u201d Harvey rushed over to assist 88-year-old Maurice, helping him to get upright. \u201cHe looked like he had a stroke or something. He looked terrible.\u201d When she saw Lillian had developed a cough, Harvey told her husband she would be staying with her aunt and uncle. She arranged with the GP to get some disability aids to support them both, but Lillian only got weaker. She finally asked to be taken to the hospital, and knew she would not come out. \u201cShe said at that point, \u2018I think I\u2019ve definitely got it and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to survive it.\u2019\u201d Harvey described Lillian as a beautiful soul. \u201cShe has been such an important person in my life over the past 31 years, since my mum died. She has been everything to us. We\u2019ve always been a tight-knit family.\u201d Maurice had stopped eating and drinking shortly after his wife was admitted to South Tyneside hospital. Though he was not showing any coronavirus symptoms, he was taken to the same hospital. Days later, Harvey received a call telling her Lillian had passed away. \u201cThey were holding hands when my aunty passed away. They were put together in the same room and the staff pushed their bed together,\u201d Harvey said. Maurice died soon after his wife. On the day of the family\u2019s funeral, the streets were lined with mourners. Harvey said her family were struggling with the loss of so many loved ones in such a short time. She urged people to continue to physically distance and not become complacent. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s over. I think it\u2019s still dangerous,\u201d she said.

      "body": "<p>For the last two months, Keir Starmer has been cautious about criticising the government\u2019s coronavirus response.</p> \n<p>He has preferred to be forensic rather than furious, accepting that ministers have a difficult job.</p> \n<p>But it appears that his patience has&nbsp;finally run out.</p> \n<p>The calamitous events of the past week, from th<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/29/from-evasion-to-evisceration-how-the-dominic-cummings-lockdown-story-unfolded-durham\">e Dominic Cummings affair</a> to the mixed messages over the easing of the lockdown, has changed the mood of the new Labour leader. He has a tougher message now.</p> \n<p>\u201cI am putting&nbsp;the prime minister on notice that he has got to get a grip and restore public confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the epidemic,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we see a sharp rise in the R rate, the infection rate, or a swathe of local lockdowns, responsibility for that falls squarely at the door of No 10. We all know the public have made huge sacrifices. This mismanagement of the last few weeks is the responsibility of the government.\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking to the Guardian via video link from parliament, Starmer said it was essential to \u201cput down a marker\u201d that Johnson needs to sharpen up, after a difficult week for the prime minister\u2019s administration. He stresses that Labour, along with the whole country, wants the government to \u201cget this right\u201d.</p> \n<p>But he says there has been a loss in public trust. This has been caused in part by Cummings\u2019 breach of the lockdown and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/boris-johnson-grilled-by-mps-over-dominic-cummings-lockdown-breach\">Johnson\u2019s decision to stand behind his senior aide</a> without reprimand, which Starmer says has been damaging.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Add to that the mixed messaging over the lifting of the restrictions, a slow start to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/contact-tracing-in-england-not-fully-operational-until-end-of-june\">contact tracing system</a> and problems with daily testing figures and you have what Starmer describes as \u201can exit without a strategy\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy [worry] is that after a week or more of mismanagement, I\u2019m deeply concerned the government has made a difficult situation 10 times worse ...&nbsp;There is a growing concern the government is now winging it,\u201d he said. \u201cAt precisely the time when there should have been maximum trust in the government, confidence&nbsp;has collapsed.\u201d</p> \n<p>A major survey in the last week bears out that statement, showing trust in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/01/public-trust-in-uk-government-over-coronavirus-falls-sharply\">government\u2019s handling of the crisis has dropped</a> and the gap in the polls between Labour and the Tories has narrowed \u2013 albeit four years out from another election.</p> \n<p>In terms of what has caused that shift, Starmer is clear.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Cummings factor of course, the sense of one rule for them and one rule for everyone else.

      "bodyText": "For the last two months, Keir Starmer has been cautious about criticising the government\u2019s coronavirus response. He has preferred to be forensic rather than furious, accepting that ministers have a difficult job. But it appears that his patience has finally run out. The calamitous events of the past week, from the Dominic Cummings affair to the mixed messages over the easing of the lockdown, has changed the mood of the new Labour leader. He has a tougher message now. \u201cI am putting the prime minister on notice that he has got to get a grip and restore public confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the epidemic,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we see a sharp rise in the R rate, the infection rate, or a swathe of local lockdowns, responsibility for that falls squarely at the door of No 10. We all know the public have made huge sacrifices. This mismanagement of the last few weeks is the responsibility of the government.\u201d Speaking to the Guardian via video link from parliament, Starmer said it was essential to \u201cput down a marker\u201d that Johnson needs to sharpen up, after a difficult week for the prime minister\u2019s administration. He stresses that Labour, along with the whole country, wants the government to \u201cget this right\u201d. But he says there has been a loss in public trust. This has been caused in part by Cummings\u2019 breach of the lockdown and Johnson\u2019s decision to stand behind his senior aide without reprimand, which Starmer says has been damaging. Add to that the mixed messaging over the lifting of the restrictions, a slow start to the contact tracing system and problems with daily testing figures and you have what Starmer describes as \u201can exit without a strategy\u201d. \u201cMy [worry] is that after a week or more of mismanagement, I\u2019m deeply concerned the government has made a difficult situation 10 times worse ... There is a growing concern the government is now winging it,\u201d he said. \u201cAt precisely the time when there should have been maximum trust in the government, confidence has collapsed.\u201d A major survey in the last week bears out that statement, showing trust in the government\u2019s handling of the crisis has dropped and the gap in the polls between Labour and the Tories has narrowed \u2013 albeit four years out from another election. In terms of what has caused that shift, Starmer is clear. \u201cIt\u2019s the Cummings factor of course, the sense of one rule for them and one rule for everyone else. But it is also the mismanagement of the lifting of restrictions \u2013 an example of that would be the decision on Saturday to change the position for those that were shielding without any mention of that in the press conference or without any preparation for it.\u201d The Labour leader is sceptical about the way Johnson announced his easing of the lockdown measures in the week of the Cummings crisis, when police said the aide may have breached the rules and dozens of Tory MPs agitated for his removal. \u201cThey obviously took a decision to try and deflect attention away from the Cummings affair. There are questions that the government needs to answer about the precise timing of the measures it put in place,\u201d he says. Through the Cummings controversy, Starmer has taken a measured approach, saying he would have given him the sack, but stopping just short of demanding that Johnson forces his adviser out. But given Labour clearly believes the aide broke the rules in a way that has undermined public trust in the lockdown, why not simply call for him to go? Starmer\u2019s answer is in line with his strategy of heaping responsibility on to the prime minister himself. \u201cIt\u2019s blindingly obvious to me that the prime minister is just too weak to sack him,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve laid out what I would have done as prime minister because of the impact on public trust and confidence. That\u2019s the most troubling aspect of the whole Cummings affair. \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen that loss of trust and confidence at precisely the wrong moment. If you had said which is the week the government needed maximum trust and confidence, the answer is the week in which you start easing restrictions \u2026 That\u2019s where you need maximum trust and confidence. That\u2019s the thing the government has burnt in the last few weeks.\u201d Having won his job as Labour leader just two weeks into the lockdown, Starmer made a deliberate choice that he would try to be as constructive as possible towards the government. Some within his own party have wished for a less softly, softly approach, and more tub-thumping, anti-government rhetoric. But his calculation has been that the country wants cooperation rather than criticism for its own sake during such a serious national crisis. Starmer still believes that was the right strategy all along, even if it has not elicited much cooperation from the government in return, beyond an update meeting and a few phone calls. On the issue of schools, Starmer says he wrote to the prime minister two weeks ago in \u201ca private and confidential letter offering to help try and move this forward in a way that would ensure consensus and confidence and I haven\u2019t even had a reply\u201d. A toughening of his position has been inevitable, amid growing concerns among scientists, public health experts and others about Johnson\u2019s handling of events and the surveys showing support for the government\u2019s actions is increasingly being called into question. Now he is planning to ask for more meetings in person with Johnson, Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary and Prof Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer. He still will not say, however, exactly what he would have done differently in terms of the timing of lifting the lockdown, or criticise the decisions to reopen schools and shops at this point in the epidemic. Part of the reason for this is that Labour does not have access to all the scientific advice that the government has received. \u201cThe important thing is that the government is transparent about taking the decisions it has.

Others were furious at the data breach caused by the leak. Starmer said he was determined that the independent inquiry he has ordered will report swiftly and \u201cwon\u2019t be kicked into the long grass\u201d. \u201cPeople will see it is independent and I\u2019ve no interest in anything that is not independent,\u201d he says. Speaking from a big empty boardroom in the opposition leader\u2019s parliamentary offices, with only a handful of Labour staff in the building and dozens of empty desks, Starmer has returned to vote in person in the House of Commons after weeks locked down in his north London constituency.

      "bodyText": "The Northern Ireland assembly has unexpectedly voted in favour of calling for an extension to the Brexit transition period, arguing that the UK government cannot impose complex border checks down the Irish Sea while Britain is occupied with the coronavirus crisis. In a surprise development, nationalist, green and social democratic parties held sway in Stormont, saying business cannot prepare for a no-deal Brexit in the middle of a pandemic. The motion proposed Matthew O\u2019Toole, the SDLP\u2019s Brexit spokesman, had not been expected to carry after opposition was expressed by the Democratic Unionist and the Ulster Unionist parties. O\u2019Toole, a former Downing Street adviser, said London would have to take the vote seriously as the assembly was \u201cuniquely recognised as a named party in the withdrawal agreement\u201d and Stormont had a substantial role in the implementation of the Ireland and Northern Ireland protocol. He said: \u201cThis is not about rerunning the referendum, it\u2019s about accepting that we are in the middle of the most serious public health crisis in living memory. We are also facing a significant economic recession that will put businesses and jobs at risk. This is not the moment to attempt to rupture and renegotiate our largest trading relationship.\u201d O\u2019Toole added that the Stormont vote would \u201csend a powerful message\u201d to Boris Johnson in relation to his implacable opposition to extending the transition period without consent from Northern Ireland. The special protocol on Northern Ireland was agreed in January after a deal struck by the prime minister and his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, to avoid a border on the island of Ireland. It involves checks on trade crossing the Irish Sea which will come into effect as soon as the transition period ends, whether there is a trade deal or not. Under the withdrawal agreement, these checks would hold for at least six years. Businesses have said there is simply not enough time to put IT systems for new customs arrangements, VAT and regulatory checks in place. Both the DUP and the UUP voted against the motion, having argued on Monday that it would be better to postpone such a move until the outcome of this week\u2019s Brexit talks between Brussels and London was known. Green party MLA Rachel Woods said businesses were already facing survival issues with the Bank of England foreseeing \u201cthe worst recession in 300 years\u201d. The government \u201cmust take account of the shockwaves the Covid-19 crisis has sent throughout our entire society and the fact that Northern Ireland as a whole is not ready or adequately prepared for the protocol [Brexit arrangements] coming into effect in January\u201d, she said. The EU and the UK embarked on the fourth round of talks on Tuesday but few expect any breakthrough with both sides sticking to their rpositions. Johnson has already made it plain that he will not seek an extension to the transition period by the legal 1 July deadline for such a request, raising the possibility of no deal at the end of the year.",

Now, they face an additional challenge of conducting an election that guarantees people can vote without risking their physical safety and without police intimidation as curfews clash with voting hours. </p> <p>One of the most closely watched states on Tuesday is Pennsylvania, a battleground state, where lawmakers are already seeing an unprecedented flood of requests for mail-in ballots. More than 1.8 million people have requested an absentee ballot so far; during the 2016 primary, just 84,000 people voted by mail.&nbsp;But some voters are still expected to cast a ballot in person, as well.</p> <p>Pennsylvania law requires voters to return their mail-in ballots to the polls by 8pm on election day. But on Monday evening Pennsylvania\u2019s governor, Tom Wolf, a Democrat, <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-mail-ballot-deadline-extension-executive-order-20200601.html\">extended the deadline</a> for voters in six counties in the state to return their ballots, saying they could be counted if they were received in the next week and postmarked by Tuesday.</p> <p>That came after concern that some voters in the state might be disenfranchised because officials could not get them ballots in time. In Delaware county, just outside Philadelphia, elections officials <a href=\"https://www.delcopa.gov/publicrelations/releases/2020/primaryupdate_june1.html\">said Monday</a> they were mailing 6,000 ballots, the day before the election. The county conceded there were 400 ballots that won\u2019t be mailed \u201cdue to timing and staffing constraints\u201d.</p> <p>In Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, election officials have severely limited in-person voting locations because of the coronavirus pandemic. In Philadelphia, officials are monitoring whether they will have to change any of those few locations because of the recent protests, <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/george-floyd-protests-philadelphia-pa-primary-election-20200601.html\">according to the Philadelphia Inquirer</a>. At at least one voting location in Philadelphia, there were long lines on Tuesday morning as poll workers set up voting machines.</p> <p>Voting rights groups monitoring the elections throughout the country said they were fielding calls from voters reporting problems. In many states, voters reported not receiving mail-in ballot requests in time to vote.</p> <p>By Tuesday afternoon, about 500 people in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/pennsylvania\">Pennsylvania</a> had called in to an election protection hotline run by the groups, about half of the voters were seeking information about their polling location, Suzanne Almeida, the interim executive director of Common Cause Pennsylvania, a watchdog group, told reporters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Elaijuh/status/1267785942393401351\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Lee Griffith, 35, is furious.

In Washington DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser <a href=\"https://wtop.com/dc/2020/06/sad-and-angry-after-destruction-mayhem-in-dc-during-protests/\">announced a 7p</a><a href=\"https://wtop.com/dc/2020/06/sad-and-angry-after-destruction-mayhem-in-dc-during-protests/\">m</a> curfew for Tuesday, but polls will be open until 8pm. As the curfew approached, there were still people in line who expected to wait for more than an hour. Bowser said Tuesday no one who was voting would be subject to the curfew.</p> <p>But there was confusion in the city as the day went on.</p> <p>Sherene Joseph was in line to vote at Hardy Middle School in the Georgetown neighborhood of DC just before curfew when a police car drove by twice used a loudspeaker to tell everyone they needed to go home. The announcement set off confusion, she said, and elections staff came out to talk to police and encouraged everyone to stay in line and a volunteer gave out \u201cI voted\u201d stickers for voters to show police.</p> <p>\u201cIt didn\u2019t happen again and the folks working there made it clear everyone in line that they would be able to vote,\u201d she wrote in an email.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mjs_DC/status/1267944250379055104\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here\u2019s the middle third of the line to vote in Columbia Heights. <a href=\"https://t.co/H1MSdWGvcW\">pic.twitter.com/H1MSdWGvcW</a></p>&mdash; Mark Joseph Stern (@mjs_DC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mjs_DC/status/1267944250379055104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 2, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mjs_DC/status/1267941149844615168\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So thousands of people are waiting in line to vote across DC, curfew starts in less than an hour, and poll workers are telling people they won\u2019t get arrested if they wear an \u201cI voted\u201d sticker. <br><br>That\u2019s cold comfort for many of these voters.</p>&mdash; Mark Joseph Stern (@mjs_DC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mjs_DC/status/1267941149844615168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 2, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Some voters in DC said they never received their ballots and there were still long lines across the city on Tuesday.

      "bodyText": "Eight states and Washington DC are holding primaries on Tuesday in the most widespread trial yet over whether America can safely hold an election amid the pandemic and unrest as days of protest over the police killings of African Americans continues. Election officials, who have been encouraging people to vote by mail, already faced an enormous challenge in providing access to voting while protecting public health against Covid-19. Now, they face an additional challenge of conducting an election that guarantees people can vote without risking their physical safety and without police intimidation as curfews clash with voting hours. One of the most closely watched states on Tuesday is Pennsylvania, a battleground state, where lawmakers are already seeing an unprecedented flood of requests for mail-in ballots. More than 1.8 million people have requested an absentee ballot so far; during the 2016 primary, just 84,000 people voted by mail. But some voters are still expected to cast a ballot in person, as well. Pennsylvania law requires voters to return their mail-in ballots to the polls by 8pm on election day. But on Monday evening Pennsylvania\u2019s governor, Tom Wolf, a Democrat, extended the deadline for voters in six counties in the state to return their ballots, saying they could be counted if they were received in the next week and postmarked by Tuesday. That came after concern that some voters in the state might be disenfranchised because officials could not get them ballots in time. In Delaware county, just outside Philadelphia, elections officials said Monday they were mailing 6,000 ballots, the day before the election. The county conceded there were 400 ballots that won\u2019t be mailed \u201cdue to timing and staffing constraints\u201d. In Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, election officials have severely limited in-person voting locations because of the coronavirus pandemic. In Philadelphia, officials are monitoring whether they will have to change any of those few locations because of the recent protests, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. At at least one voting location in Philadelphia, there were long lines on Tuesday morning as poll workers set up voting machines. Voting rights groups monitoring the elections throughout the country said they were fielding calls from voters reporting problems. In many states, voters reported not receiving mail-in ballot requests in time to vote. By Tuesday afternoon, about 500 people in Pennsylvania had called in to an election protection hotline run by the groups, about half of the voters were seeking information about their polling location, Suzanne Almeida, the interim executive director of Common Cause Pennsylvania, a watchdog group, told reporters. In Baltimore, which is holding a Democratic mayoral primary, some voters reported never receiving the ballots they requested, forcing them to go to the polls on election day. It is unclear how the increased police presence from the protests will mesh with established polling place hours. In Washington DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a 7pm curfew for Tuesday, but polls will be open until 8pm. As the curfew approached, there were still people in line who expected to wait for more than an hour. Bowser said Tuesday no one who was voting would be subject to the curfew. But there was confusion in the city as the day went on. Sherene Joseph was in line to vote at Hardy Middle School in the Georgetown neighborhood of DC just before curfew when a police car drove by twice used a loudspeaker to tell everyone they needed to go home. The announcement set off confusion, she said, and elections staff came out to talk to police and encouraged everyone to stay in line and a volunteer gave out \u201cI voted\u201d stickers for voters to show police. \u201cIt didn\u2019t happen again and the folks working there made it clear everyone in line that they would be able to vote,\u201d she wrote in an email. Some voters in DC said they never received their ballots and there were still long lines across the city on Tuesday. Only 10 people at a time were allowed into voting locations to allow for social distancing, according to The Washington Post. One voter told the Washington Post he had been told he sent his application to the wrong email address, even though he sent it to the one he was instructed to. Another woman said she couldn\u2019t get help requesting a ballot online so she wouldn\u2019t vote. In Philadelphia, there will be an 8.30pm curfew and polls will be open until 8pm. Larry Krasner, the Philadelphia district attorney, said on Monday no one will be arrested for going to vote in violation of the curfew. But Almeida said there hasn\u2019t been clear guidance on protections for people who were still waiting to vote and poll workers who remained at voting sites beyond the curfew time. She also noted Center City in Philadelphia had been shut down to traffic and was being heavily patrolled, which was \u201cobviously a detriment to voters\u201d trying to cast a ballot there. The Pennsylvania Convention Center, located in the area, is hosting voting for 18 districts on Tuesday. \u201cImposing a 6pm curfew on election day threatens to disenfranchise the very people marching to be heard, along with all Philadelphians,\u201d said Quentin Palfrey, chair of Voter Protection Corps, a voting advocacy group. \u201cWe applaud district attorney Krasner\u2019s clear statement that no voter will be arrested or prosecuted for going to vote, but no such assurances can overcome the suppressive impact of the curfew.\u201d She also noted that one of the voting sites in Wilkinsburg, a borough that is majority African American just outside of Pittsburgh, was in a government building that shared space with the police. It meant that voters would have to wait in line with law enforcement nearby, which could be intimidating. In addition to Washington DC and Pennsylvania, Tuesday is primary day in Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Montana, New Mexico, Rhode Island and South Dakota.",

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Emilie Gramenz bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 3 June. Top stories Joe Biden says Donald Trump is \u201cpart of the problem and accelerates it\u201d, as heated demonstrations over the police killing of African American man George Floyd continue in the US. It\u2019s emerged that attorney general William Barr personally asked for a perimeter around the White House to be extended, resulting in the forcible removal of peaceful protesters, including the tear gassing of episcopal clergy linked to St John\u2019s church where Donald Trump held a photo opportunity. Police have been criticised over their heavy-handed response and Australia\u2019s embassy has raised concern over an apparent assault on a Channel 7 news team. Millions of people have posted black squares on social media in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, though others say it\u2019s reductive. In some cities, police have marched with protestors. In Sydney, hundreds of people have marched protesting Indigenous deaths in custody and George Floyd\u2019s killing. Recordings of internal meetings of the World Health Organisation show it struggled to get needed information from China during critical early days of the coronavirus pandemic. The recordings, obtained by the Associated Press, contradict the WHO\u2019s public praise of Beijing\u2019s response to the outbreak. Germany is lifting its travel warning to Europe; and Greek authorities admit their too-good-to-be-true travel offer to Australians would breach travel restrictions anyway. Documents released under Freedom of Information reveal that despite warnings of dire bushfire risks, the federal government\u2019s follow-up was sluggish. The documents show that while some parts of the bureaucracy were aware by August that the country was facing a horror season, that urgency did not reach their political masters. Most notable was the commonwealth\u2019s ad hoc response on aerial firefighting, which was well documented during the fires. Meanwhile the royal commission into national natural disaster arrangements has been told pilots flying water-bombing aircrafts are \u201cconsistently tasked too late for fires\u201d. Australia The historian Jenny Hocking says she is \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d that the National Archives of Australia has asserted it has 90 business days to declassify palace letters as ordered by the High Court. The correspondence is between the Queen and the governor general John Kerr in the lead up to former prime minister Gough Whitlam\u2019s 1975 dismissal. A Sydney police officer is under investigation after video emerged showing him slamming a 16-year-old Indigenous boy face-first onto pavement. The constable has been placed on restricted duties. The Greens say a government promotion for the forestry industry that encourages Australians to \u201clook up at the trees, think about wood\u201d should be taken down after a recent federal court ruling on native forest logging. The videos aim to promote Australia\u2019s logging industry as environmentally sustainable. The world A government-ordered inquiry has found death rates from Covid-19 in England have been higher among people of black and Asian origin than any other ethnic group. The disease has claimed almost 50,000 lives in the UK since February. Experts say DNA has helped them piece together fragments of the Dead Sea scrolls, and determine which texts may have travelled a distance, and how widespread the writings were. Austrian authorities have unveiled a design for turning the house where Adolf Hitler was born into a police station, trying to make it unattractive as a pilgrimage site for those who glorify the Nazi dictator.

It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance.

      "bodyText": "Public health experts and officials have warned that the idea of \u201cair bridge\u201d links between the UK and overseas holiday destinations may prove impossible this summer, amid continued concern over how they could operate safely. A number of Conservative MPs are pushing for air bridges \u2013 mutual agreements with other countries to allow travellers to fly in and out without coronavirus quarantine restrictions \u2013 ahead of the imposition of the UK\u2019s 14-day quarantine system next week. The home secretary, Priti Patel, is to announce how the quarantine process will work in a statement to the Commons on Wednesday, and is coming under significant pressure from Tory MPs to signal a willingness to implement air bridges amid fears over the new measures\u2019 effect on the tourism and hospitality sectors. Writing in Wednesday\u2019s Telegraph alongside the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, Patel said: \u201cWe owe it to the victims of Covid-19 to impose quarantine,\u201d arguing it was crucial and tourism would be up and running faster if tough measures were taken. But progress has so far been slow. When the government announced the quarantine plans on 22 May, air bridges were mentioned among \u201cfurther options\u201d to be explored. There have been no updates since. A series of reports have predicted air bridges could be in place by the end of June. While this appears to be the preference of the Department for Transport, other departments are understood to be more cautious and want to establish how they would work. A Whitehall source urged caution against the idea of air bridges being introduced within weeks: \u201cObviously we want to see travel corridors introduced as soon as possible, but only when it\u2019s safe to do so.\u201d Public health experts have also noted the potential logistical difficulties of the UK having arrangements with any European countries that currently have much lower coronavirus infection levels.

The photograph went everywhere. Less than 24 hours after he publicly urged people to stay home to prevent the spread of coronavirus, he was pictured looking bewildered and dishevelled on a Birmingham street beside his damaged Range Rover, which had collided with parked cars to expose the fact that he broke lockdown to travel to a friend\u2019s house.

      "bodyText": "The challenge facing Aston Villa is to emerge from the Premier League hiatus better than they were before it. Jack Grealish accepts that applies to him more than most. Over the past couple of months he has spent time, and money, trying to prove that he does not deserve to be defined by that serious mistake he made in late March. You know the one. The photograph went everywhere. Less than 24 hours after he publicly urged people to stay home to prevent the spread of coronavirus, he was pictured looking bewildered and dishevelled on a Birmingham street beside his damaged Range Rover, which had collided with parked cars to expose the fact that he broke lockdown to travel to a friend\u2019s house. West Midlands Police\u2019s investigation continues. The day after the incident Grealish acknowledged his hypocrisy on social media. \u201cI knew straight away that I had to come out and apologise myself, which I wanted to do; I didn\u2019t want to hide behind a club statement,\u201d says the 24-year-old who, since then, has donated \u00a3150,000 to Birmingham Children\u2019s Hospital \u2013 which he has supported many times in the past \u2013 and raised more than \u00a355,000 for the NHS by raffling of one of his jerseys. \u201cI am old enough now and mature enough to know that I\u2019d done wrong. \u201cI know I am a footballer but I\u2019m still human and we all make mistakes and straight away I knew I\u2019d made a mistake. I\u2019m also a role model as well to a lot of people out there, especially young children who might look up to me. So I try to act in respectable manner but since then I have tried to keep my head down, work hard and do as much charitable work as possible.\u201d Grealish knows some people will always place the emphasis on his errors no matter what good he does. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way things are in this world that we live in. Everyone knows when you do something it\u2019s always going to be the bad stuff that gets out there. That\u2019s what I have to deal with. I respect my job, absolutely love what I do, and wouldn\u2019t change it for the world.\u201d On the pitch is where Grealish is most at home. Villa\u2019s manager, Dean Smith, describes him as a \u201cfootball nut\u201d and the player admits he \u201cmissed football a silly amount\u201d during the league\u2019s suspension. So he was delighted to return to training last week. That joy, however, was overshadowed by the news that Smith\u2019s father, Ron, died last week as a result of coronavirus after a long time with dementia. Grealish says everyone at Villa was devastated and has been trying to help the manager deal with his grief as best they can. \u201cI always used to ask him every day how his dad was getting on,\u201d says Grealish. \u201cThen when the news came it was devastating for him and his family.

After 10 race cancellations, the sport has settled on its plan for eight meetings, all behind closed doors.

The British Grand Prix will be held on 2 August and Silverstone\u2019s second race, designated the 70th Anniversary GP, will be on 9 August. The race is named to mark the first round of the opening championship held in 1950 at Silverstone.</p> <p>Barcelona will then stage the Spanish Grand Prix on 16 August. Only the British GP will be shown on free\u2011to\u2011air TV in the UK, on Channel 4. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/01/f1-drivers-respond-to-lewis-hamiltons-call-to-condemn-racism-george-floyd\">F1 drivers respond to Lewis Hamilton's call to condemn racism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is understood F1 has been assured the UK government will allow the sport an exemption to its current quarantine entry rules in order for the races to take place at Silverstone.</p> <p>Stuart Pringle, the managing director of Silverstone, acknowledged the efforts of F1 and the government. \u201cHuge credit to F1, it\u2019s been an incredibly difficult task to try and work out where they can go on a timescale that is realistic,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso credit to the government, who have been hugely supportive in getting sport back under way. It has been fully appreciated [as is] its importance to business and industry, because it\u2019s not just about a glossy race, it\u2019s about an industry with 40,000 jobs that sit behind it.\u201d</p> <p>The second race in Austria will be called the Steiermark Grand Prix, after the region where it will be held. This will be first time F1 has had two races staged at the same circuit in the same season and the first time it has held races behind closed doors.

      "bodyText": "Formula One has confirmed its rescheduled calendar for the European leg of the 2020 season, with racing to begin in Austria in July. After 10 race cancellations, the sport has settled on its plan for eight meetings, all behind closed doors. The British Grand Prix at Silverstone is included for August but its confirmation remains subject to UK government coronavirus restrictions. The season will open with two races at the Red Bull Ring in Austria, on 5 and 12 July, before the teams head directly to Hungary for a third meeting on 19 July. The British Grand Prix will be held on 2 August and Silverstone\u2019s second race, designated the 70th Anniversary GP, will be on 9 August. The race is named to mark the first round of the opening championship held in 1950 at Silverstone. Barcelona will then stage the Spanish Grand Prix on 16 August. Only the British GP will be shown on free\u2011to\u2011air TV in the UK, on Channel 4. It is understood F1 has been assured the UK government will allow the sport an exemption to its current quarantine entry rules in order for the races to take place at Silverstone. Stuart Pringle, the managing director of Silverstone, acknowledged the efforts of F1 and the government. \u201cHuge credit to F1, it\u2019s been an incredibly difficult task to try and work out where they can go on a timescale that is realistic,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso credit to the government, who have been hugely supportive in getting sport back under way. It has been fully appreciated [as is] its importance to business and industry, because it\u2019s not just about a glossy race, it\u2019s about an industry with 40,000 jobs that sit behind it.\u201d The second race in Austria will be called the Steiermark Grand Prix, after the region where it will be held. This will be first time F1 has had two races staged at the same circuit in the same season and the first time it has held races behind closed doors. Austria has never hosted the opening round of a season. Spa and Monza will conclude the European meetings with races scheduled for 30 August and 6 September, the dates they originally held in the calendar. \u201cDue to the fluidity of the Covid-19 situation internationally, we will be finalising the details of the wider calendar and hope to publish that in the coming weeks, with an expectation of having a total of 15-18 races before we complete our season in December,\u201d F1 said. \u201cWe currently expect the opening races to be closed events but hope fans will be able to join our events again when it is safe to do so. The opening calendar will include holding two consecutive events at the same circuit one week apart as well as a number of back-to-back events.\u201d Chase Carey, F1\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWhile we currently expect the season to commence without fans at our races, we hope that over the coming months the situation will allow us to welcome them back once it is safe to do so.

Many have questioned the reliability of the count. Independence leader Benny Wenda decried the death of a West Papuan man on 25 May after he was struck down by a water cannon, allegedly for <a href=\"https://www.ulmwp.org/black-melanesian-lives-matter-in-west-papua-despite-indonesias-genocidal-covid-response\">failing to comply with social distancing directives</a>.

Prime minister James Marape denied these claims, but has yet to provide an accounting, says a TIPNG statement, which includes a detailed funding timeline derived from public sources.</p></li> <li><p><strong>French Pacific Territories</strong>: Two new cases have been reported in New Caledonia bringing the total in that territory to 20, with no deaths. The number of confirmed cases in French Polynesia remains unchanged at 60. France is looking at loosening quarantine restrictions and creating travel corridors to provide options for people from France to visit during the upcoming summer holidays.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Fiji</strong>: There are no new cases reported, leaving the total of recorded infections for Fiji at 18 with no deaths.

      "bodyText": "Here is the latest news about the Covid-19 outbreak across the Pacific, from Dan McGarry and Tess Newton Cain on Wednesday 3 June. The total number of cases of Covid-19 infection across the region stands at 294, an increase of two since last week, both in Guam. As the global and regional situation stabilises and the direct threat of Covid-19 recedes, Pacific countries are beginning to ramp up repatriation efforts. Thousands of agricultural and cruise ship workers, diplomats and officials, as well as people simply caught at the wrong place at the wrong time, are finally being afforded the chance to return. Some people in virus-free countries, such as Palau, remain ultra-cautious about any potential for infection by these new arrivals. The 2020 Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting \u2013 the most significant regional diplomatic meeting \u2013 has been postponed due to the uncertainty and economic impacts facing the country due to Covid-19 and Tropical Cyclone Harold, which recently devastated parts of the country. Vanuatu will offer to host the 2021 meeting instead. Surveys of businesses conducted by the International Finance Corporation in Fiji and Solomon Islands have revealed the serious economic impact of Covid-19. Nearly 80% of surveyed businesses in Solomon Islands experienced a reduction in turnover or cash flow and 56% said they may need to downsize in the next year due to impacts of Covid-19. Employers also feared that Covid-19 led to increases of sexual and domestic violence, with two-thirds of companies in Fiji who were surveyed by IFC saying they believed the pandemic has increased employees\u2019 experiences of domestic and sexual violence. What has happened this week? West Papua: The latest official figures reported by The Jakarta Post show that there are 168 confirmed cases, with two deaths. Many have questioned the reliability of the count. Independence leader Benny Wenda decried the death of a West Papuan man on 25 May after he was struck down by a water cannon, allegedly for failing to comply with social distancing directives. Wenda also accused Indonesian authorities of failing to provide proper medical care to Bazoka Logo, who heads the political bureau of the United Liberation Movement for West Papua. Logo allegedly contracted the virus in prison. Guam: Citing the Government\u2019s Joint Information Centre, the USA Today Guam reported two new cases over the weekend, raising the total to 171 cases, but as of 31 May, the World Health Organisation still showed only 166 confirmed cases. Papua New Guinea: The number of confirmed cases remains at eight. Transparency International PNG is not letting go of accusations concerning the alleged misspending of 23 million Kina in Covid-19 funds, which the government stands accused of wasting on cars and media flacks. Prime minister James Marape denied these claims, but has yet to provide an accounting, says a TIPNG statement, which includes a detailed funding timeline derived from public sources. French Pacific Territories: Two new cases have been reported in New Caledonia bringing the total in that territory to 20, with no deaths. The number of confirmed cases in French Polynesia remains unchanged at 60. France is looking at loosening quarantine restrictions and creating travel corridors to provide options for people from France to visit during the upcoming summer holidays. Fiji: There are no new cases reported, leaving the total of recorded infections for Fiji at 18 with no deaths. The health minister advises that 2,400 people have been tested in the country so far. CNMI: There are no new cases reported. The total number of infections stands at 22 with two deaths. Solomon Islands: The country remains virus-free. Repatriation of citizens has begun, starting with a reciprocal flight returning Vanuatu and Solomon Islands residents to their respective countries. Samoa: There are no reported cases of Covid-19 in Samoa. Repatriation flights have commenced from Auckland are expected to occur fortnightly to allow Samoans who are stranded in New Zealand to return home. Tonga: The country remains virus-free. Some restrictions have eased but a nightly curfew remains in place. Vanuatu: The director of the Vanuatu Tourism Office has said that they are working to reopen the borders by 1 September and would look to have tourists from the key markets of Australia and New Zealand early next year. Stakeholders are using this time to look at how tourism can be done differently. This includes taking a step back from participation in cruise tourism for the time being. Marshall Islands: The Marshall Islands Journal reports that the US army has negotiated an arrangement with local authorities on Kwajalein to allow military personnel to be deployed to the base on the island. Six members of the US military considered \u2018critical\u2019 will be allowed onto the island subject to a 14-day quarantine period and being tested three times. What are Pacific governments doing? Papua New Guinea: The state of emergency comes to an end on 2 June. The government has issued an accelerated funding request to Unicef for nearly US$10m. The request is being coordinated jointly by Unicef and the Australian High Commission in Port Moresby. The money will be used to mitigate the impact of school closures on PNG children. New Caledonia: The French Senate has chosen to ignore concerns raised in New Caledonia about its plan to reignite interest in tourism by relaxing travel requirements. Political resistance has been rising against any relaxation of the rules, and has become a rallying point for independence politicians. Bougainville: Buka now has its own isolation facility. The project was funded jointly by the governments of Australia and New Zealand and was opened on 27 May. Fiji: Police have charged one man \u2013 \u201cpatient number nine\u201d, with breaching his quarantine order. The 57-year-old man was diagnosed with Covid-19 after returning from India. He is alleged to have slipped quarantine and traveled to visit family. He appears to have infected five of them. He has been granted bail on strict conditions. Vanuatu: Repatriation efforts are finally getting underway. Following a dry run designed to quell fears about the return of residents from overseas, prime minister Bob Loughman confirmed that Vanuatu would be bringing 289 people home in the first phase of the operation from New Caledonia, Fiji, New Zealand, Australia, and Solomon Islands. The process should take about a month, he said. The first return flight carried seven people from Solomon Islands, which is also virus-free. Samoa: A new emergency order comes into effect on 3 June. It provides for ongoing restrictions on opening hours for public commercial gatherings (such as markets, shops, and casinos), and reminds people to observe physical distancing guidelines. People aged over 60 are encouraged to remain at home. French Polynesia: Government officials in Tahiti have admitted that many homeless people have left the state-funded shelters provided for them at the outset of the crisis in schools and sports halls. Only 80 out of 205 remain, they said. CNMI: The Marianas governor has acted to allay fears of infection within its correctional facilities, issuing a statement that \u201call employees, officers, and inmates\u201d have been tested and found to be virus-free. Cook Islands: The government hopes another infusion of cash will be enough to tide the country through the massive economic downturn caused by the disruption to its tourism industry. It\u2019s been estimated that economic activity could drop by as much as 60% due to the pandemic. Australia and New Zealand The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Australia has crept up to 7,202 and there have been 103 deaths. As of 1 June, New Zealand has recorded 10 days with no new cases reported and is down to one active case remaining. There have been a total of 1,504 confirmed and probable cases, with 22 deaths. The government of Australia has announced that it will \u201cpivot\u201d its aid programme to focus on supporting partners to deal with the health and economic challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. The support is targeted at the Pacific, Timor-Leste and Indonesia. It does not include any new budgetary allocations. The move is valued at AU$100m and will be funded by savings elsewhere in the aid programme, including on scholarships and the costs associated with deploying advisers and consultants. In New Zealand there has been some talk of opening a travel bubble with Covid-free Pacific Island countries in preference to Australia. Level 2 restrictions will be eased from Friday. And as early as next week, the government will consider lifting all internal Covid-19 restrictions \u2013 border controls will remain \u2013 after prime minister Jacinda Ardern said the country was on track to eliminate the virus \u201cahead of schedule\u201d.

After the director of public health told the Daily Post that he\u2019d not even been consulted, the Council of Ministers finally stepped in and quashed what officials insisted were \u201crumours\u201d with an announcement that schools and travel would be unaffected. What did they say? It\u2019s going be hard to sustain economies to the level they were in 2019. \u2013 Dame Meg Taylor, secretary general of the Pacific Islands Forum on the economic impact of Covid-19 in the Pacific.

      "bodyText": "EasyJet and cruise operator Carnival are set to lose their place in the FTSE 100 index of the UK\u2019s biggest companies following the collapse in their share prices due to the coronavirus pandemic\u2019s impact on the travel industry. The budget airline has lost half of its market value since the start of the pandemic as almost all flights have been cancelled, and the aviation industry warns it will take years to convince people to take to the skies in the same numbers they did before the virus struck. EasyJet last week announced plans to cut 4,500 jobs, although it plans to restart flights on the majority of its routes this summer. Carnival, the world\u2019s largest cruise operator, has seen its shares drop by 70% since the start of the year. The cruise industry has been among the worst-affected sectors as several ships were hit by outbreaks of infection, and some cruises have been cancelled until at least October. EasyJet and Carnival are expected to be joined in relegation by Centrica, the UK\u2019s largest energy supplier, and engineering company Meggitt. They will be replaced by companies in the \u2018second division\u2019 FTSE 250 which have seen their market values leapfrog those at the bottom of the bluechip FTSE 100 index. Those jostling for promotion are GVC, the gambling company that owns Ladbrokes and Bwin; cybersecurity firm Avast; Kingfisher, the group that owns B&amp;Q and Screwfix; home repairs company Homeserve; and medical equipment supplier ConvaTec. Under the FTSE 100 index\u2019s rules, a company is automatically relegated if it falls below 111th place among qualifying companies on the London Stock Exchange at the end of each quarter. Promotion is given to FTSE 250 companies that rise to 90th position or above. The latest quarterly calculations are based on the closing share prices on Tuesday 2 June, and announced officially by FTSE Russell, the company that runs the index, on Wednesday. The broadcaster ITV and hotel and restaurant company Whitbread are also suggested to be close to the relegation zone. Russ Mould, investment director at investing platform AJ Bell, said he expects four companies to be relegated and promoted, but if more companies change it would be the biggest shakeup in decades: \u201cSix promotions and relegations, for a total of 12 changes, have not been seen in one single quarterly reshuffle since September 1992 and even four pairs changing places is relatively rare, with the last instance of this being March 2016.\u201d Nicholas Hyett, an equity analyst at investment group Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u201cThe world has changed since the last FTSE review at the beginning of March.\u201d Inclusion in the FTSE 100 index is important both for companies\u2019 reputations and because some investment funds only buy shares in the UK top 100 companies \u2013 and may therefore be forced to sell their stakes in easyJet and Carnival.",

      "body": "<p>All four of the UK\u2019s chief medical officers rejected suggestions from No 10 that the coronavirus threat level could be reduced because it contradicted evidence that showed the virus was still widespread, the Guardian has been told.</p> \n<p>A senior source in one devolved government said the chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland discussed and refused Boris Johnson\u2019s proposal.</p> \n<p>It comes after Downing Street confirmed that the decision&nbsp;for England\u2019s coronavirus alert level to remain at four \u2013 despite this week\u2019s easing of some lockdown restrictions \u2013 was made by England\u2019s CMO, Prof Chris Whitty, indicating he vetoed the UK government\u2019s wish for it to be lowered.</p> \n<p>The senior source also said that despite the CMOs rejecting lowering the threat level, Johnson floated the idea in a teleconference later the same day with the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p> \n<p>The first ministers also resisted the move, telling the prime minister that it went against the CMOs\u2019 advice.

      "bodyText": "All four of the UK\u2019s chief medical officers rejected suggestions from No 10 that the coronavirus threat level could be reduced because it contradicted evidence that showed the virus was still widespread, the Guardian has been told. A senior source in one devolved government said the chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland discussed and refused Boris Johnson\u2019s proposal. It comes after Downing Street confirmed that the decision for England\u2019s coronavirus alert level to remain at four \u2013 despite this week\u2019s easing of some lockdown restrictions \u2013 was made by England\u2019s CMO, Prof Chris Whitty, indicating he vetoed the UK government\u2019s wish for it to be lowered. The senior source also said that despite the CMOs rejecting lowering the threat level, Johnson floated the idea in a teleconference later the same day with the first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The first ministers also resisted the move, telling the prime minister that it went against the CMOs\u2019 advice. A source in another devolved government said the CMOs had been in consistent \u201clock step\u201d on what should be done throughout the crisis. A source said: \u201cMy understanding is that the sequence of events is there was a CMO call on the same day there was an FMs [first ministers] call with the prime minister, which was arranged at short notice.

The news came as Downing Street announced it was winding down its programme of coronavirus press conferences from every day to five a week, with those on Saturday and Sunday scrapped. \u201cIn terms of the weekends, it is just a fact that the numbers who are viewing at weekends do tend to be significantly lower,\u201d Johnson\u2019s spokesman said.

However, the EEF fears that progress made since 2011 will now be lost.</p> <p>The EEF analysis, published on Wednesday, said its median estimate was that the attainment gap could widen by 36% but that \u201cplausible estimates\u201d indicated it could widen by between 11% and 75%.</p> <p>The findings mirror thinking among senior figures in the Department for Education. In May, Vicki Stewart, the deputy director of the DfE\u2019s pupil premium and school food division, said the pandemic would <strong>&nbsp;</strong>\u201calmost certainly\u201d have \u201ca very significant impact\u201d on the attainment gap, pointing to predictions of it widening by 75%.</p> <p>The EEF said urgent and sustained support would be needed to help disadvantaged pupils catch up but that the damage would already have been done \u201ceven if the strongest possible mitigatory steps are put in place\u201d.</p> <p>Schools across the UK were ordered to close on 20 March \u2013 more than 10 weeks ago \u2013 to all but vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers. Some primary schools in England reopened on Monday to further reception, year one and year six pupils but others have said it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/01/drop-plan-to-reopen-english-primary-schools-to-all-pupils-heads-urge\">remains unsafe</a> to open to additional students.</p> <p>Hobby said the government must pump more resources and funding towards the schools and pupils \u201cwho have suffered the most\u201d to rectify the harm done.</p> <p>The EEF analysis said it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that a single or short-term catch-up strategy would be sufficient to compensate for lost learning. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus-key-workers\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus-key-workers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The EEF chief executive, Prof Becky Francis, said: \u201cThe evidence is clear that children learn less when they are not in school.

      "bodyText": "Nearly 10 years of progress in narrowing the attainment gap in England between disadvantaged pupils and their classmates has probably been \u201cwiped in a few months\u201d due to the coronavirus pandemic, a study has found. Analysis by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) charity said the closure of schools to most pupils 10 weeks ago was likely to reverse all progress made to close the gap since 2011. Responding to the findings, Russell Hobby, the chief executive of Teach First, a charity that aims to address educational disadvantage in England and Wales, said urgent action was needed to tackle the problem. \u201cIt\u2019s devastating that children from poorer backgrounds risk having their education interrupted by this pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cNearly 10 years of progress in narrowing the gap wiped in a few months is tragic.\u201d Over the past decade the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and their classmates at the end of primary school in England is estimated to have narrowed from 11.5 months in 2009 to 9.2 months in 2019, according to the Education Policy Institute. However, the EEF fears that progress made since 2011 will now be lost. The EEF analysis, published on Wednesday, said its median estimate was that the attainment gap could widen by 36% but that \u201cplausible estimates\u201d indicated it could widen by between 11% and 75%. The findings mirror thinking among senior figures in the Department for Education. In May, Vicki Stewart, the deputy director of the DfE\u2019s pupil premium and school food division, said the pandemic would \u201calmost certainly\u201d have \u201ca very significant impact\u201d on the attainment gap, pointing to predictions of it widening by 75%. The EEF said urgent and sustained support would be needed to help disadvantaged pupils catch up but that the damage would already have been done \u201ceven if the strongest possible mitigatory steps are put in place\u201d. Schools across the UK were ordered to close on 20 March \u2013 more than 10 weeks ago \u2013 to all but vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers. Some primary schools in England reopened on Monday to further reception, year one and year six pupils but others have said it remains unsafe to open to additional students. Hobby said the government must pump more resources and funding towards the schools and pupils \u201cwho have suffered the most\u201d to rectify the harm done. The EEF analysis said it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that a single or short-term catch-up strategy would be sufficient to compensate for lost learning. The EEF chief executive, Prof Becky Francis, said: \u201cThe evidence is clear that children learn less when they are not in school. Our analysis today highlights that this particularly impacts those from disadvantaged backgrounds and widens the attainment gap.\u201d The EEF, Sutton Trust, Impetus and Nesta have been in talks with the government over plans for a national tutoring pilot. The charities said on Wednesday they would offer high-quality tuition to up to 1,600 pupils in disadvantaged communities over coming weeks, supporting schools as they opened for more pupils.",

At the end of March, the National Statistics Institute (INE), which calculates figures in a different way, gave Spain\u2019s jobless figure as 3.31 million. </p> \n  <p>These figures do not count those who have been furloughed. Between mid-March and the end of May, a total of 3.7 million people were furloughed under a plan rolled out by the labour ministry. But when the furlough scheme draws to a close as planned at the end of June, unemployment figures could rise again.</p> \n  <p>The government has urged employers not to cut jobs in the six months following the furlough period but layoffs are expected.</p> \n  <p>In May, as the lockdown was eased, the number of new jobseekers in the construction sector fell by almost 7% compared with April. In industry and agriculture, the figure remained stable but it grew by 1.5% in the service sector which has borne the brunt of the crisis, particularly due to the loss of significant numbers of temporary jobs in tourism.</p> \n  <p>In the first quarter, Spain\u2019s unemployment rate jumped to 14.4%, INE figures showed.

He is the sixth doctor from Wuhan Central Hospital to have died from the virus, which emerged in the central Chinese city late last year.</p> \n  <p>Cases have dwindled dramatically from the peak in mid-February as the country appears to have brought the outbreak largely under control. The official death toll in the country of 1.4 billion people stands at 4,634, well below the number of fatalities in less populous nations.</p> \n  <p>Wuhan Central Hospital has yet to give a formal statement on Hu\u2019s death. In early February it said some 68 staff members had contracted coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>Hu\u2019s condition became a national concern after Chinese media showed images of him with his skin turned black due to liver damage. Fellow doctor Yi Fan showed similar symptoms, but recovered and has since been discharged from hospital.</p> \n  <p>The death of their colleague Li Wenliang in February triggered a national outpouring of grief and rage against the government as he documented his final days on social media. The 34-year-old ophthalmologist was reprimanded by authorities after he warned colleagues about the virus in late December. Beijing has since named him a national martyr, but suppressed much of the dissent and criticism sparked by his death.</p> \n  <p>Other medical whistleblowers at Wuhan Central Hospital - including emergency unit director Ai Fen - have told Chinese media they were punished by authorities for speaking out.</p> \n  <p>China has not released a complete figure of the number of medical worker deaths from Covid-19, but at least 34 medics have been awarded posthumous honours by health authorities. In February the National Health Commission said some 3,387 health workers had been infected.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f5b5dead4a920e3dc280a8a494aa25f831c64cc\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f5b5dead4a920e3dc280a8a494aa25f831c64cc/0_0_3472_2314/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A child is tested for coronavirus in Wuhan, China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A child reacts while undergoing nucleic acid testing in Wuhan, the Chinese city hit hardest by the coronavirus disease outbreak, on 16 May.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aly Song/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>City-wide testing that began in mid-May found <strong>no new cases of Covid-19 in Wuhan</strong>, and 300 asymptomatic cases.

Some of <strong>Brazil</strong>\u2019s hardest hit cities, including the jungle metropolis Manaus and coastal Rio de Janeiro, are starting to allow more activity. <strong>Bolivia</strong>\u2019s government has authorised reopening most of the country and the government of <strong>Venezuela</strong>\u2019s Nicolas Maduro unwound restrictions, while <strong>Ecuador</strong>\u2019s airports were resuming flights. Here is a report filed last night by AP:</p> \n  <p>The executive director of the World Health Organization\u2019s emergencies program, Mike Ryan, expressed concern over South America\u2019s climbing contagion, telling reporters Monday that the region had become an \u201cintense zone of transmission for this virus,\u201d which had not yet reached its peak. \u201cClearly the situation in many South American countries is far from stable. There is a rapid increase in cases and those systems are coming under increasing pressure,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Data from the WHO\u2019s Pan American Health Organization shows the region\u2019s seven-day rolling average of new cases continues rising, due in large part to Brazil, which accounts for more than half the total.</p> \n  <p>Manaus, the Amazon rainforest\u2019s largest city, was the first Brazilian metropolis whose health care system collapsed. For weeks, overwhelmed intensive-care units were unable to admit patients, deaths at home surged and a city cemetery buried bodies in mass graves.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"209234d84f5f4863dcb05b63640e2cd2335d037f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/209234d84f5f4863dcb05b63640e2cd2335d037f/0_229_5383_3230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Parque Tarum\u00e3 cemetery in Manaus, Brazil\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An open mass grave at the Parque Tarum\u00e3 cemetery in Manaus, Brazil.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andre Coelho/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Such burials continue, yet the capital of Amazonas state on Monday began loosening its clamp on non-essential businesses. Amazonas registered 818 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, bringing the total number of cases above 40,000. There are more than 500,000 confirmed cases in Brazil, the second most in the world, and experts believe the true toll to be much higher due to insufficient testing. Rio de Janeiro, the Brazilian city with the second-most cases after Sao Paulo, on Monday announced it would begin gradually relaxing restrictions the following day. Already a city in its metropolitan region, Sao Joao de Meriti, started allowing salons, auto mechanics, and hotels to operate on Monday.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBrazil tends to look at Europe, and the problem is that there they did one or two months of strict quarantine and are now reopening,\u201d said Renato Mendes Coutinho, a specialist in mathematical biology at Covid-19 BR Observatory, an independent group of more than 50 Brazilian researchers. \u201cThe difference is that the lockdown they implemented and the restriction measures were much more efficient and thorough.\u201d</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a64d2f78aef5c46e9a146211b6106bc52ba4726\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a64d2f78aef5c46e9a146211b6106bc52ba4726/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mariscal Sucre Airport in Quito, Ecuador\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Medical tests are carried out on a would-be passenger at Mariscal Sucre Airport in Quito, Ecuador on Monday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franklin Jacome/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p><strong>Ecuador </strong>was one of the first South American nations hit, with grim scenes of people leaving corpses outside their doorsteps in Guayaquil through March and April. The nation\u2019s caseload continues to surge, yet its airport will resume international flights on 3 June, according to Nicolas Romero, the airport\u2019s spokesperson, though he said arriving passengers must spend 15 days in quarantine, without specifying how such quarantine will be enforced. The airport in the country\u2019s capital, Quito, recorded its first flight in 80 days on Monday, and flights to Miami and Houston will take off on 4 June. \u201cIt has just been one flight so far, but the important thing is the message it gives, of flying safely,\u201d Luis Galarraga, the airport\u2019s spokesperson, told The Associated Press.</p> \n  <p>Marcos Espinal, director of PAHO\u2019s communicable diseases department, said by phone that reopening too soon could cause harm in certain places that aren\u2019t yet ready. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the middle of the epicenter, we don\u2019t recommend to open,\u201d Espinal said from Washington. \u201cPeople\u2019s lives are precious, and there shouldn\u2019t be any negotiations of that.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Venezuela </strong>on Monday allowed barbershops, beauty salons, auto shops, construction sites and banks to begin operations, along with other sectors. The nation is dialing down restrictions because it has reported relatively low Covid-19 impact: 1,510 cases and 14 deaths. Experts have roundly criticised Venezuela\u2019s data as suspicious.</p> \n  <p><strong>Bolivia </strong>on Monday instituted a so-called \u201cdynamic quarantine\u201d in most of the country, keeping parks and shows shuttered while resuming work, commerce and public transport, even as contagion continues rising.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d968bab60d2c38103443d4b619f6e543bf42606\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d968bab60d2c38103443d4b619f6e543bf42606/0_0_3500_2388/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Plaza San Francisco in La Paz, Bolivia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"682\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People walk at the Plaza San Francisco in La Paz, Bolivia, on Monday, the first day of eased restrictions.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Mercado/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The government\u2019s public works minister, Ivan Arias, suggested Monday that men shave their beards and moustaches to prevent infection.

after multiple government labs had fully decoded it, not sharing details key to designing tests, drugs and vaccines.</p> \n  <p>AP reports that strict controls on information and competition within the Chinese public health system were largely to blame.

Even then, China stalled for at least two weeks more on giving WHO the details it needed, according to recordings of multiple internal meetings held by the UN health agency in January all at a time when the outbreak arguably might have been dramatically slowed.</em></p> \n  <p><em>Although the World Health Organization continued to publicly commend China, the recordings obtained by the AP show they were concerned China was not sharing enough information to assess the risk posed by the new virus, costing the world valuable time. </em></p> \n  <p><em>\u201cWe\u2019re currently at the stage where yes, they\u2019re giving it to us 15 minutes before it appears on CCTV,\u201d said WHOs top official in China, Dr Gauden Galea, referring to the state-owned China Central Television, in one meeting.</em></p> \n  <p><em>The story behind the early response to the pandemic comes at a time when the UN health agency is under siege. President Trump cut ties with WHO on Friday, after blasting the agency for allegedly colluding with China to hide the extent of the epidemic. Chinese President Xi Jinping said China has always provided information to WHO and the world in a most timely fashion.</em></p> \n  <p><em>The new information does not support the narrative of either the US or China, but portrays an agency now stuck in the middle that was urgently trying to solicit more data.

The US has more than 1.8 million confirmed cases, and over 105,000 deaths. </p> \n  <p>Here are the latest developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Known deaths worldwide near 375,000</strong>, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. They say at least 6,246,042 people are known to have been infected and at least 374,452 are known to have died since the outbreak began.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>New analysis from the US has found that masks and social distancing can help control the coronavirus</strong> but hand washing and other measures are still needed. Researchers concluded single-layer cloth masks are less effective than surgical masks, while tight-fitting N95 masks provide the best protection. A distance of one meter (more than three feet) between people lowers the danger of catching the virus, while two meters (about 6 1/2 feet) is even better. None of the strategies work perfectly and more rigorous studies are needed, according to the analysis published Monday.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Trump deploys military in Washington DC.</strong> In an address at the White House shortly after George Floyd\u2019s death was ruled a homicide, the president Trump said he was deploying \u201cthousands of heavily-armed soldiers, military personnel, and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults, and the wanton destruction of property\u201d in the US capital. In his brief remarks, Trump mentioned the virus only once, saying the protests mean, \u201cBrave nurses who have battled the virus are afraid to leave their homes.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>Fauci says he and Trump no longer in regular contact. </strong>Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top public health expert and Covid-19 task force member, said he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-protests-donald-trump-white-house-washington-police-brutality-minneapolis-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5ed577748f084df971c8dd86#block-5ed577748f084df971c8dd86\">no longer in frequent contact with the president</a>.

      "bodyText": "We\u2019ve launched a new blog at the link below: A record 1,262 Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in Brazil today - taking the country\u2019s total death toll to 31,199 - but the president continues to downplay the pandemic. The figures were announced on Tuesday evening by Brazil\u2019s health ministry, which also said the number of coronavirus cases had risen to 555,383, second only to the United States. The South American country is now on the verge of overtaking Italy, where 33,530 deaths have been recorded, as the country with the third highest number of deaths. But Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has dismissed Covid-19 as a \u201clittle flu\u201d, again brushed off the tragedy on Tuesday. \u201cI regret each of the deaths - but that\u2019s everyone\u2019s destiny,\u201d Bolsonaro told supporters outside his palace in the capitalBras\u00edlia. Brazil\u2019s most populous state, S\u00e3o Paulo, registered a record number of deaths on Tuesday taking the total number of fatalities there to nearly 8,000. Rio de Janeiro has Brazil\u2019s second highest death toll with 5,686 deaths, followed by the northeastern state of Cear\u00e1 where 3,421 people have died. For all Bolsonaro\u2019s dismissiveness, scientists and medical experts believe the situation is dire and likely to get worse. \u201cNot even in our most dreadful nightmare could we have imagined the situation we are now in,\u201d Drauzio Varella, a doctor and broadcaster, wrote in one of Brazil\u2019s top newspapers last week. Yemen remains on the brink of \u201ca macabre tragedy\u201d, the UN has warned after a humanitarian fundraising summit raised only $1.35bn (\u00a31.05bn) for this year, around $1bn short of the target and only half the sum raised at the equivalent pledging conference last year. The UN\u2019s humanitarian chief, Mark Lowcock, said unless more money was raised Yemen \u201cwill face a horrific outcome at the end of the year\u201d. Despite the shortfall \u201cthe UN will not abandon the people of Yemen\u201d, he said, adding that pledging would continue because some of last year\u2019s large donors had not yet contributed. Dr Abdullah al-Rabiah, the head of the King Salman Centre for Relief and Humanitarian Aid in Saudi Arabia, which co-hosted the virtual summit, put the overall shortfall down to the impact of coronavirus on national budgets and concerns about the restrictions on aid flows imposed by the parties to Yemen\u2019s five-year civil war. \u201cWe want to be sure that the money will go to those in need,\u201d he said. The UK\u2019s EasyJet and cruise operator Carnival are set to lose their place in the FTSE 100 index of the UK\u2019s biggest companies following the collapse in their share prices due to the coronavirus pandemic\u2019s impact on the travel industry. The budget airline has lost half of its market value since the start of the pandemic as almost all flights have been cancelled, and the aviation industry warns it will take years to convince people to take to the skies in the same numbers they did before the virus struck. EasyJet last week announced plans to cut 4,500 jobs, although it plans to restart flights on the majority of its routes this summer. Hi, I\u2019m Helen Sullivan and I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest news in the coronavirus pandemic for the next few hours.

In the UK, the home secretary is threatening foreign travellers who disobey forthcoming quarantine rules with deportation, according to new restrictions laid out by ministers. The rules, due to be set out by Priti Patel on Wednesday, have caused unease in the Tory ranks and been condemned by businesses. The plans, coming into force on 8 June, will see people arriving in the UK told to isolate for 14 days to prevent cases being introduced from overseas. The Home Office said removal from the country would be considered \u201cas a last resort\u201d for foreign nationals who refuse to comply with the order to stay at a single residence. George Morgan-Grenville, the chief executive of tour operator Red Savannah, said: By pursuing its quarantine plans without due regard for the economic consequences, the Government is choosing to ignore the devastation it will cause to companies, to employment and to the lives of all those whose jobs will be lost. The quarantine measures are a blunt weapon which will bring only economic disaster. For the last two months, Keir Starmer has been cautious about criticising the UK government\u2019s coronavirus response. The opposition leader has preferred to be forensic rather than furious, accepting that ministers have a difficult job. But it appears that his patience has finally run out. The calamitous events of the past week, from the Dominic Cummings affair to the mixed messages over the easing of the lockdown, has changed the mood of the new Labour leader. He has a tougher message now. I am putting the prime minister on notice that he has got to get a grip and restore public confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the epidemic. If we see a sharp rise in the R rate, the infection rate, or a swath of local lockdowns, responsibility for that falls squarely at the door of No 10. We all know the public have made huge sacrifices. This mismanagement of the last few weeks is the responsibility of the government. Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: The number of officially confirmed cases of coronavirus around the world has passed 6.3 million. According to researchers from Johns Hopkins University, 6,309,107 people are known to have been infected, while 376,445 are known to have died since the outbreak began. Hopes were raised of the possible availability of a vaccine. A senior US army researcher said it was reasonable to expect that some sort of vaccine could be available to some parts of the US population by the end of the year. France\u2019s death toll rose by more than a 100 in a 24-hour period for the first time in 13 days. It came as the country enacts a new easing of lockdown measures. Iran confirmed its second highest number of new cases in a 24-hour period since its outbreak began, with the health ministry saying 3,117 people tested positive. The number of new daily infections in Iran has now returned to levels previously seen at the peak of its outbreak in late March. Germany\u2019s travel warning for Europe will be lifted on Wednesday, its foreign minister, Heiko Maas, announced. The worldwide travel warning still applies. But, for the countries of the EU and associated states, the warning will be replaced by travel advice that will give travellers detailed information about the situation in each state. The pandemic is exposing \u201cendemic inequalities\u201d that must be addressed, according to the UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, who highlighted the protests triggered by the killing of George Floyd and data showing the crisis has had a worse impact on ethnic minority groups. The UK\u2019s official death toll passed 50,000, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics. The total differs from the government\u2019s daily counts, which only include deaths in hospitals and care homes where the person had tested positive. The UK statistics watchdog criticised the government\u2019s testing data. Whitehall\u2019s use of testing data appears to be aimed more at making it look like a lot is being done than actually painting a clear picture, the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority warned the health secretary, Matt Hancock. A Wuhan doctor who worked with the whistleblower Li Wenliang died of the virus last week, Chinese state media reported. Hu Weifeng, a urologist at Wuhan central hospital, reportedly became China\u2019s first Covid-19 fatality in weeks when he died on Friday after being treated for more than four months. Meanwhile, Chinese officials sat on releasing the genetic map of the coronavirus for more than a week after multiple government labs had fully decoded it, according to an Associated Press report. The rise in unemployment slowed in Spain. The number of new jobseekers was close to 27,000 in May, about 10 times lower than in March and April during the country\u2019s lockdown, the labour ministry said. The USA has confirmed 14,790 more cases and 761 more deaths in the past 24 hours, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That takes the cumulative totals to 1,802,470 and 105,157, respectively. In the UK, fewer than 2,000 people were contacted in the first four days of the NHS test and trace scheme, according to leaked data. The government has yet to publish figures but Channel 4 News has seen the data from Thursday \u2013 the day the system was launched \u2013 up to Sunday, and it shows that 4,456 confirmed cases reported to the test and trace programme. Of those, 1,831 self-registered on the website or have been called and completed the form providing information about their contacts. The number of contacts they provided was 4,634, of whom just 1,749 have been contacted, Channel 4 News reported. That comes the day after Parisian cafes and restaurants reopen for the first time in 11 weeks. The ministry said the number of people in hospital fell by more than 260, or 1.8%, to 14,028, and the number of people in intensive care fell by 49, or 3.8%, to 1,253. Both numbers have been on a downward trend since mid-April. France\u2019s death toll has risen by more than a 100 in a 24-hour period for the first time in 13 days, as the country enacts a new easing of lockdown measures. The French health ministry said that the number of fatalities has risen by 107, or 0.4%, to 28,940, the fifth-highest tally in the world. The US and Brazilian presidents, Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro, are pushing for a joint research effort on using a drug to treat Covid-19 that has been linked to increased deaths in virus patients. Trump has repeatedly touted use of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, even admitting to taking it himself as a preventative measure. US health bosses have cautioned against its use outside of a hospital setting because of a risk of heart problems. The White House said Trump and Bolsonaro \u201cexpressed their mutual appreciation for the longstanding collaboration on health issues between the two countries\u201d, discussing the US delivery of 2m doses of the controversial drug to Brazil and a \u201cjoint research effort to help further evaluate the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for both prophylaxis and the early treatment of the coronavirus\u201d. Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include: The number of officially confirmed cases of coronavirus around the world has passed 6.3 million. According to researchers from Johns Hopkins University, 6,309,107 people are known to have been infected, while 376,445 are known to have died since the outbreak began.

Thats it from me, Damien Gayle, for another day. See you tomorrow. Reuters has posted this interesting video report on the potential for the spread of coronavirus during the demonstrations against the police killing of George Floyd in the US. In particular, one expert warns, the collapse of trust in the authorities is likely to have an impact on contact tracing. After all, when someone from the government calls you up to ask you who you went to the demo with, are you going to tell them? There have now been more than 6.3 million confirmed cases of coronavirus across the world since the outbreak was first detected in China at the end of 2019, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. The US-based university said that countries had reported a total of 6,318,040 cases of the virus on Tuesday, of which 376,885 had led to deaths. The US continues to lead the world in confirmed cases, reporting 1,817,785, more than twice as many as the second-place country, Brazil, which has reported 526,447. Russia is the third worst-affected country, with 423,186 confirmed cases. The UK is fourth, with 277,738. However, testing for the virus is not widespread even in many of the world\u2019s richest countries, meaning that the true extent of the outbreak is likely to be much larger. A senior US army vaccine researcher said on Tuesday it was reasonable to expect that some sort of coronavirus vaccine could be available to some parts of the US population by the end of the year, Reuters reports. The defence secretary, Mark Esper, vowed on 15 May that the US government would collaborate with the private sector to produce a vaccine to treat US citizens and partners abroad by the year-end. Col Wendy Sammons-Jackson, director of the military infectious disease research programme, told a Pentagon news briefing it was \u201creasonable to expect that there will be some form of a vaccine that could be available at some level, to a certain population by the end of the year\u201d. The World Health Organization\u2019s representative in Equatorial Guinea has been ordered to leave the country, after officials accused her of falsifying coronavirus case numbers. In a document seen by AFP on Tuesday, the foreign ministry asked the UN health agency\u2019s regional office in Africa \u201cto end the duties\u201d of its representative in Equatorial Guinea, Triphonie Nkurunziza, \u201cand immediately oversee her departure from Malabo.\u201d The prime minister, Pascual Obama Asue, appearing at the Senate last Friday, accused Nkurunziza of \u201cfalsifying the data of people contaminated\u201d by the coronavirus. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a problem with the WHO, we have a problem with the WHO\u2019s representative in Malabo,\u201d he said in remarks broadcast on state television. A source at the UN office in Malabo, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the government\u2019s request but declined to go into details. \u201cThe government has asked her to go, we have received a document - she is accused of falsifying Covid-19 figures,\u201d the source said. However, Nkurunziza is still in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea\u2019s island capital, as there are no flights enabling her to leave, the source said. Officials say that as of Monday there were 1,306 recorded cases of coronavirus, 12 of them fatalities, in a population of 1.3 million. The official tally used to be updated daily, but this practice stopped on 28 April, and the update is now being published only from time to time. Figures put forward by the WHO have sometimes been somewhat higher than the national tally, although both tolls are the same right now. On Tuesday, Spain\u2019s health ministry reported no new Covid-19 deaths for a second consecutive day, writes Sam Jones, the Guardian\u2019s Madrid correspondent. However, the ministry also said there had been 34 deaths across the country over the past week, leading to some confusion. Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies, said the death figures were \u201cyielding some problems\u201d but added that the numbers were provided by Spain\u2019s regional governments. To date, the country has registered 27,127 deaths and 239,932 cases. The World Health Organization struggled to get needed information from China during critical early days of the coronavirus pandemic, according to recordings of internal meetings that contradict the organisation\u2019s public praise of Beijing\u2019s response to the outbreak, writes Lily Kuo, the Guardian\u2019s Beijing bureau chief. The recordings, obtained by the Associated Press (AP), show officials complaining in meetings during the week of 6 January that Beijing was not sharing data needed to evaluate the risk of the virus to the rest of the world. It was not until 20 January that China confirmed coronavirus was contagious and 30 January that the WHO declared a global emergency. \u201cWe\u2019re going on very minimal information,\u201d said Maria Van Kerkhove, an epidemiologist and the WHO technical lead for Covid-19, according to the AP. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly not enough for you to do proper planning.\u201d The WHO\u2019s top official in China, Gauden Galea, said in one of the recordings: \u201cWe\u2019re currently at the stage where yes, they\u2019re giving it to us 15 minutes before it appears on CCTV [Chinese state TV].\u201d The report comes amid growing international scrutiny of China\u2019s handling of the outbreak and moves to establish an independent investigation into the origins of the virus, which has infected more than 6 million and killed more than 375,000 people around the world. The UK reached another grim milestone in its battle with coronavirus today as the official death toll surpassed 50,000, writes Pamela Duncan. This morning, the ONS released figures showing that 44,401 Covid deaths had occurred in England and Wales by 22 May (these figures differ from the daily figures put out by the government, which include only deaths that have occurred in hospitals and care homes where the person has had a positive Covid-19 test prior to their death). This follows last week\u2019s release from National Records of Scotland, which showed that 3,779 deaths had been registered there up to 24 March. A further 716 deaths had occurred in Northern Ireland by 22 May, NISRA figures show. However, figures from NHS England show there were 931 deaths since then, a number that includes hospital deaths but not those occurring in care homes and other settings. Scottish government figures released today show there have been 105 deaths newly registered after 24 May. A further 78 deaths have occurred in Wales since 23 May, while there were 22 deaths reported in Northern Ireland in the same period. The prime minister of Russia has announced a 5tn rouble (\u00a358bn) package to shore up the economy after coronavirus containment measures triggered the deepest contraction since 2009, Reuters reports. Despite the number of confirmed Covid-19 infections nearing 424,000, the world\u2019s third highest, Russia began to reopen this week with short walks permitted in Moscow and other, less hard-hit regions, cancelling pass systems and reopening cafes. In April, the first full month of a nationwide lockdown, joblessness jumped to 5.8%, retail sales dipped by 23.4% and gross domestic product contracted by 12% \u2013 its deepest fall since May 2009. Overall, GDP is forecast down by 5-8% this year. \u201cBy the end of the recovery period we should achieve stable, prolonged economic growth above pre-crisis levels,\u201d Mikhail Mishustin, the PM, said, without giving details or figures. Before the coronavirus crisis, Russian GDP was forecast to grow by 3.1-3.2% in 2021-22. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, described the plan as a foundation for repairing the economy and for \u201clong-term structural change\u201d. \u201cIt is a matter of crucial importance for us to solve today\u2019s acute problems, as well as ensure confident movement forward in the long-term,\u201d the French news agency AFP quoted him as saying. Putin said the epidemic had \u201cseriously impacted all spheres of life\u201d and added that he expected to launch the recovery plan next month. Shopping malls in Dubai will fully reopen for business on Wednesday, in the latest easing of coronavirus restrictions, the emirate\u2019s media office has announced, AFP reports. The step makes the city-state the first in the Middle East to drop nearly all restrictions to combat the spread of the virus. Dubai, one of the seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates, had already shortened a nighttime curfew to seven hours starting from 11pm. Businesses in the private sector had been allowed since last week to work at 50% capacity, but the authorities now say they can \u201cfully operate\u201d. Dubai\u2019s shopping centres include the Mall of the Emirates, which has its own indoor ski slope, and Dubai Mall, adjacent to Burj Khalifa, the world\u2019s tallest structure. \u201cThe move aims to ensure the private sector is able to resume normal activity without compromising on preventive steps to protect people\u2019s health and safety,\u201d a media office statement said. Preventative measures include wearing face masks, maintaining a minimum distance of 2 metres between individuals, and the regular use of hand-sanitiser, the statement added. Confirmed cases of coronavirus in South Africa have passed 35,000, the health minister reported on Tuesday. In a tweet posted earlier in the afternoon, Zweli Mkhize reported that the cumulative number of cases in the country was now 35,812, an increase of 1,455 since Monday. South Africa has the most confirmed virus cases of any nation in Africa. Despite that, authorities in the country took another step in easing lockdown restrictions on Monday with alcohol sales allowed again. Authorities have warned that the rate of new cases is expected to quicken. South Africa has seen cases double roughly every 12 days while cases in the Western Cape, which by itself accounts for more than 23,000 infections, have been doubling every nine days. A coronavirus alert has been issued in Tokyo, as fears grow of a resurgence of infections just a week after the state of emergency in Japan\u2019s capital was ended. The regional governor, Yuriko Koike, issued the alert Tuesday after 34 new cases were confirmed in the city, where confirmed infections had slowed to a few per day in late May. \u201cThe alert is to precisely inform the people of the status of infections and to advise caution,\u201d Koike was quoted as saying by the Associated Press. Lighting on Tokyo\u2019s Rainbow Bridge will be changed from rainbow-coloured to red as a sign of alert. However, the alert does not mean restrictions will be reimposed immediately. Experts say the rise in new cases reflects the increased movement of people since mid-May and could increase further. Koike said: \u201cI want to remind everyone once again that we are fighting against an unknown virus as we still don\u2019t have any vaccines or treatment for it.\u201d Hundreds of residents of one of the poorest neighbourhoods in Nairobi, Kenya, lit fires in the streets last night as they protested over the killing by police of a homeless man during the dusk-to-dawn curfew. Nineteen Kenyans have been killed by police enforcing coronavirus lockdowns, according to Boniface Mwangi, a civil rights activist. All came from low-income neighbourhoods, he said. On Monday night, hundreds of people in Mathare, a slum in the east of the Kenyan capital, left their homes and burned tires in the streets in the latest outrage over police brutality. Dominic Njagi told the Associated Press he couldn\u2019t understand why police shot his brother, 51-year-old James Mureithi. He said Mureithi was a university-educated automotive engineer who suffered a mental breakdown after divorcing his wife 10 years ago. \u201cThe pathologist I talked to said my brother was shot twice; one on the legs and the other on the chest,\u201d Njagi said. \u201cThe pathologist said the chest wound was at close range.\u201d A local elder, Stephen Wesonga, said Mureithi was well-known in the slum as he used to walk around collecting recyclables to sell. Several gatherings of extended families in the city of G\u00f6ttingen, north-west Germany, two weekends ago have resulted in a local spike of the coronavirus, which authorities say has highlighted the need to stick to physical distancing rules, writes Kate Connolly, the Guardian\u2019s Berlin correspondent. As Germany slowly emerges from its lockdown restrictions, the outbreaks in G\u00f6ttingen serve to illustrate the challenge of keeping the virus contained, despite the relatively efficient tracking and tracing system in place in the country. Sixty-eight people of 166 tested had been found to have the virus by Monday, following the parties that took place on 23-24 May. Fifty-nine were from the city and nine from the wider area. One of the people infected has been hospitalised. The results of further tests are outstanding. While the number may appear relatively low, the ramifications are considerable. Three hundred contact people have so far been identified \u2013 that is, those who were in close proximity to those who have been tested positive \u2013 and have been ordered to quarantine for 14 days. \u201cThey may not leave their flats, not even to go shopping,\u201d Cordula Dankert, a spokeswoman for the city, said. Sixty of the contact people live in a high-rise block of flats that is home to 700 residents. Authorities have said while it might be desirable from an epidemiological viewpoint to put the whole block under quarantine, it is not realistic to do so. Sweden has recorded a further 775 confirmed cases of coronavirus, and 65 more deaths from Covid-19, according to the latest figures from its public health authority. As of Tuesday, the total number of confirmed cases of cases in the country stood at 38,589, of whom 4,468 have died. The latest figures came as the numbers of tests carried out reached a new high, but fell well short of the 100,000 a week promised by officials. Almost 36,500 coronavirus tests were analysed in Sweden last week, the public health agency said. State media say Zimbabwe has confirmed its first coronavirus cases in prisons, with four inmates and two guards testing positive, US news agency the Associated Press reports. The Herald newspaper says authorities declared the prisons in Plumtree, which borders Botswana, and in Beitbridge, which borders South Africa, as \u201cno-go areas.\u201d Authorities also have suspended movement out of prisons countrywide, resulting in some prisoners failing to attend court hearings. Zimbabwe\u2019s cases more than doubled in the past week to over 200, with most new infections at centres where people crossing the border are quarantined. Most are returning from Botswana and South Africa, which host millions of Zimbabweans who fled economic turmoil in recent years. South Africa has more than 34,000 virus cases, the most in Africa. Zimbabwe\u2019s health ministry says the returnees pose the biggest virus threat. Those arrested for illegal border crossings are put into the prisons in Plumtree and Beitbridge. Zimbabwe earlier released more than 4,000 prisoners to ease overcrowding in facilities where health systems are weak. About 18,000 people are still behind bars.

The Covid-19 pandemic is exposing \u201cendemic inequalities\u201d that must be addressed, according to the United Nations\u2019 human rights chief, who highlighted the protests triggered by George Floyd\u2019s death. Michelle Bachelet, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, referenced the situation in the United States and a series of other countries, saying data shows the coronavirus crisis has had a worse impact on racial and ethnic minorities. \u201cThis virus is exposing endemic inequalities that have too long been ignored,\u201d she said in a statement, according to AFP. Similar inequalities were also fuelling the widespread protests in hundreds of US cities over the police killing in Minneapolis last week of Floyd, an unarmed black man, Bachelet said. \u201cIn the United States, protests triggered by the killing of George Floyd are highlighting not only police violence against people of colour, but also inequalities in health, education, employment and endemic racial discrimination,\u201d she explained. She noted the virus death rate for African Americans is reportedly more than double that of other racial groups in the United States. Her statement also highlighted the situation in the UK, where an official study has found that black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people are up to 50% more likely to die after being infected with Covid-19. And she pointed to Brazil, where people of colour in Sao Paulo are 62% more likely to die from the virus than white people, and in France\u2019s heavily minority-inhabited Seine Saint-Denis suburb of Paris, which has reported higher excess mortality than other areas. \u201cThe appalling impact of COVID-19 on racial and ethnic minorities is much discussed, but what is less clear is how much is being done to address it,\u201d Bachelet said. Urgent steps need to be taken by states, such as prioritising health monitoring and testing, increasing access to healthcare, and providing targeted information for these communities.\u201d \u201cPeople from racial and ethnic minorities are also found in higher numbers in some jobs that carry increased risk, including in the transport, health and cleaning sectors,\u201d the statement said. She added: Collection, disaggregation and analysis of data by ethnicity or race, as well as gender, are essential to identify and address inequalities and structural discrimination that contribute to poor health outcomes, including for Covid-19. \u201cThe fight against this pandemic cannot be won if governments refuse to acknowledge the blatant inequalities that the virus is bringing to the fore,\u201d Bachelet warned. It is a country famed for its cuisine but during lockdown diners in France have been prevented from enjoying the country\u2019s plethora of restaurants. But now the country has taken a step closer to returning to some sense of normality, as cafes and restaurants opened their doors today for the first time since the Covid-19 control measures were imposed. Although restrictions remain in the Paris region, where only outdoor seating and takeout is allowed at restaurants with dining rooms remaining closed, customers still flocked to seize the chance to bask on sunny terraces after 10 weeks of closures to fight the outbreak. \u201cI\u2019ve missed this so much... we\u2019re social animals, after all,\u201d Rachida, 70, told AFP while sipping an espresso as her grandson enjoyed a lemonade at her local cafe in Romainville, a Paris suburb. There were similar scenes elsewhere. \u201cI\u2019m almost overwhelmed,\u201d Martine Depagniat, wearing a beige face mask and sunglasses, said at the Cafe de la Comedie in Paris, just across the street from the Louvre Museum where she works. \u201cI think people really need a return to normal, even though there\u2019s still a bit of nervousness,\u201d she said. But it\u2019s not quite business as normal in the country \u2013 which has suffered more than 28,000 Covid-19 deaths \u2013 with many servers and customers wearing face masks and tables kept at least one metre apart new under government regulations. In the rest of the country, where cafes and restaurants are fully open, some even welcomed customers at the stroke of midnight to celebrate their newfound freedom under a further relaxation of lockdown rules. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving our confinement, to rediscover the pleasures and good times spent together,\u201d said Frederic de Boulois, president of a regional hotel association in Nantes, western France, speaking from the Prison du Bouffay, a restaurant that sits atop a former mediaeval dungeon. At the Cafe de Flore, a Left Bank institution in the French capital, waiter Philippe Da Cruz wore a surgical mask over his black vest and impeccably knotted tie as he chatted with clients. \u201cThey\u2019re incredibly happy to be back, doing everyday things,\u201d he said. \u201cThe real deconfinement is now beginning.\u201d In England, an official study has found that black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people are up to 50% more likely to die after being infected with Covid-19. The report, published today by Public Health England (PHE), reveals that people of Bangladeshi ethnicity had around twice the risk of death than people of white British ethnicity. Meanwhile, people of Chinese, Indian, Pakistani, other Asian, Caribbean and black ethnicity had between 10% and 50% higher risk of death. The report examines disparities in how the disease affected people, showed there was a significant disproportionate effect on ethnic minorities, while confirming death tolls among the elderly were far higher. It comes as a United Nations human rights official highlighted the \u201cdevastating impact\u201d of the disease on those communities in Britain and other countries. \u201cDeath rates from COVID-19 were higher for Black and Asian ethnic groups when compared to White ethnic groups,\u201d the PHE report said. Here\u2019s some more detail on the study from my colleague, Haroon Siddique. It\u2019s Simon Murphy here covering the global live blog while my colleague, Damien Gayle, takes a break. Nursery schools in Belgium began reopening on Tuesday, two and a half months after they were closed down as part of measures to contain the spread of coronavirus. The reopening is the latest step in the gradual easing of lockdown measures in Belgium, which has recorded the worst per capita death rate from the coronavirus outbreak of any country in Europe. Most nursery classes are due to reopen on Wednesday and Thursday, Chinese news agency Xinhua reports. From next week, primary schools are also due to reopen. Belgium\u2019s national security council will meet on Wednesday to decide on the third phase of lockdown easing, which will include the reopening of cafes and restaurants, and the resumption of domestic holidays and religious services, timetabled for 8 June. A decision is also due to be taken on reopening the borders, which is expected on 15 June, in line with the schedules of Germany and France, Belgium\u2019s biggest neighbours. On Tuesday, the Sciensano public health institute reported 19 new deaths from Covid-19, bringing the total death toll in Belgium to 9,505. A further 98 people tested positive for coronavirus. So far, Belgium has recorded a total of 58,615 infections. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Africa has passed 150,000, after 5,343 more cases were reported in the past 24 hours, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control. The latest update from the African Union health agency showed that there had been 152,442 cases of the virus, which causes the Covid-19 respiratory disease, reported by its 54 member states. Of those, 63,661 people had recovered and 4,344 had died. According to the Africa CDC\u2019s coronavirus dashboard, the worst affected area, by both deaths and infections, was north Africa. Keeping at least 1-metre apart and wearing face masks and eye protection are the best ways to cut the risk of coronavirus infection, according to the largest review to date of studies on coronavirus disease transmission, Reuters reports. In a review that pooled evidence from 172 studies in 16 countries, researchers found frequent handwashing and good hygiene are also critical \u2013 though even all those measures combined can not give full protection. The findings, published in the Lancet journal on Monday, will help guide governments and health agencies, some of whom have given conflicting advice on measures, largely because of limited information about Covid-19. \u201cOur findings are the first to synthesise all direct information on Covid-19, Sars, and Mers, and provide the currently best available evidence on the optimum use of these common and simple interventions to help \u2018flatten the curve\u2019\u201d, said Holger Sch\u00fcnemann, from McMaster University in Canada, who co-led the research. Current evidence suggests the coronavirus is most commonly spread by droplets, especially when people cough, and infects by entering through the eyes, nose and mouth, either directly or via contaminated surfaces. Derek Chu, an assistant professor at McMaster University, who co-led the work, said people should understand that \u201cwearing a mask is not an alternative to physical distancing, eye protection or basic measures such as hand hygiene.\u201d Hundreds of far-right supporters led by opposition leaders Matteo Salvini and Giorgia Meloni are breaching social distancing restrictions as they protest in Rome against Italy\u2019s government, writes Lorenzo Tondo, the Guardian\u2019s southern Italy correspondent. The demonstrators, who took to the streets to celebrate Italy\u2019s Republic Day, have been chanting against prime minister Giuseppe Conte and the lockdown measures, which, according to the protesters, have \u201climited our freedom\u201d. Many supporters are not wearing masks as the police struggle to restore order and physical distancing measures. Even Salvini, who yesterday exhorted his followers to march on the streets of Rome, flaunted the regulations by removing his mask. \u2018\u2019Experts are saying the virus is dying\u2019\u2019, said Salvini when asked by journalists why he was not wearing the mask. Thousands of people attacked Salvini on social media for his choice to protest publicly in such a delicate moment for the country. Many even pointed out that until recently Salvini detested Republic Day. As one of the most outspoken supporters of northern secessionism, on Republic Day in 2013 Salvini tweeted: \u201cGood night, friends. There\u2019s not a fucking thing to celebrate today.\u201d Germany\u2019s travel warning for Europe will be lifted from tomorrow, the foreign minister, Heiko Maas, has just said. \u201cWe are preparing the cabinet to pass a decree tomorrow,\u201d he said at a press briefing, writes Kate Connolly, the Guardian\u2019s Berlin correspondent. The worldwide travel warning still applies, but for the countries of the EU and associated states, the warning will be replaced by travel advice. This will give travellers detailed information about the situation in each individual state, which should help them to decide where they can plan to go on holiday and which regions they would be advised to avoid, Maas said. He said the government will make a decision on countries beyond Europe at a later date. French flight crew have accused Ryanair of blackmailing them into taking pay cuts or losing their jobs, amid a slowdown in air travel due to the coronavirus pandemic, writes Kim Willsher, the Guardian\u2019s Paris correspondent. The Irish airline, which has warned it may cut up to 3,000 jobs in Europe, told staff in France it was imposing 20% salary cuts for flight crew and 10% for attendants. Those who are already on legal minimum wages will have their hours reduced. Staff unions have accused the company of \u201credundancy blackmail\u201d and acting like cowboys. \u201cFrance isn\u2019t the wild west,\u201d Damien Mourgues, a cabin crew union representative, told AFP. According to confidential documents seen by French media, Ryanair wrote to staff proposing wage cuts take effect from 1 July 2020. The lower wages would be progressively increased over the five years so flight crew would be paid their full current salaries by July 2025. The loss of salary works out at an average 12% over five years for the pilots. Ryanair also proposed to pay new pilots and co-pilots the lower wages. People in Berlin will today taste a little more freedom as fitness studios, casinos and dance schools are allowed to reopen their doors for the first time since Germany\u2019s coronavirus lockdown began on 27 March, writes Kate Connolly, in the German capital. Sport with a maximum of 12 participants is also allowed to take place indoors for the first time and bars will also be allowed to reopen. The strict conditions which have to be adhered to include 3-metre physical distancing in fitness studios (the norm in Germany is 1.5 metres), and in bars people have to sit at tables, not at the counter. In almost all scenarios, from gyms to pubs, customers will have to give their name and phone number to the proprietor so that they can be contacted in case of an infection outbreak. Meanwhile the organisers of a rave protest in Berlin on Monday had to apologise after a larger than expected number of demonstrators turned up. Hundreds of ravers, taking advantage of bank holiday weekend sunshine, took rubber dinghies to the Landwehr canal in Berlin to bring attention to the plight of Berlin nightclubs that have been forced to close by coronavirus restrictions. Organisers of the Rebellion of Dreamers (Rebellion der Tr\u00e4umer) protest were also chided for the decision to bring the protest to an ebullient close, with music, dancing and speeches, outside the Vivantes hospital, which sits on the Urban Ufer \u2013 a bank of the canal. However, they said the protest was justified because it highlighted the many artists and cultural creators in Berlin whose existence is threatened by the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cWe demonstrated for our legitimate interests and deliberately chose to do it in the form of a water demonstration in order to minimise the risk of infection,\u201d the groups said in a statement. The organisers had not expected 400 boats to turn up, they said. \u201cWe repeatedly made clear that people should keep the distancing rules and wear masks. But our communication didn\u2019t reach all the participants\u201d. The International Rescue Committee has warned that Afghanistan faces a humanitarian disaster as coronavirus spreads undetected and confirmed cases rose 684% in May, Akhtar Mohammad Makoii reports from Herat. IRC said in a statement that Afghan the health ministry has the capacity to test 2,000 suspected patients each day, but are receiving between five and 10 times as many samples. \u201cThat means between 80 and 90% of potential cases are not being tested. Afghanistan has one of the highest test positivity rates (40%) of all the countries where the IRC works, suggesting a high level of undetected population infection\u201d IRC said. The organisation urgently called on the international community to work with Afghanistan to improve their testing capacity, and to increase direct support for frontline responders like the IRC. \u201cFour decades of war has devastated the health care system in Afghanistan and left more than five million Afghans, especially women and children, living in fear of abuse, neglect, conflict, exploitation and violence,\u201d said Vicki Aken, Afghanistan Country Director at the IRC. \u201cThe Covid-19 outbreak is making the already terrible situation much worse. Many health clinics do not have the proper protective gear to treat or refer Covid-19 patients and are turning away those showing signs and symptoms\u201d. Aken added. \u201cOur teams on the ground are seeing an increase in violence against women and children, and women are likely to face increased economic hardship\u201d. According to IRC the outbreak has left almost 11 million people facing severe food insecurity, unsure of where their next meal will come from. The humanitarian organisation said it is \u201cextremely concerned\u201d not only for the severe health impacts the virus will have on Afghans, but also for the way this disease is already exacerbating the dire humanitarian situation in the country. On Tuesday, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases passed 16,000 in the war-torn country, as the health ministry reported 759 new transmissions and five more deaths from Covid-19. The total number of infections in the country is now 16,509 and the death toll is 270. There have been 1,450 recoveries. Most of the new infections were recorded in the capital, Kabul, and the western province of Herat, which have been the hotspots of the outbreak in Afghanistan. Kabul recorded 266 new cases and Herat 212. Kabul is the nation\u2019s worst affected area with 6,478 confirmed cases. Three of the latest deaths recorded in the northern province of Balkh. Problems with testing continue in Kandahar, with no suspected patient tested in the southern province in around three weeks. A group of current and former world leaders on Tuesday called on the G20 to convene an urgent summit to provide a \u201cstrongly coordinated global response\u201d to the coronavirus pandemic, AFP reports. The collective of more than 230 former world leaders, and top global health experts and economists said the G20 must unite around a multi-trillion dollar plan to face what they said was an \u201cunprecedented global crisis\u201d. Noting poorer countries are most at risk, they demanded the developed world release 76 nations from debt payments, double the World Bank\u2019s emergency aid fund and honour billions of dollars committed to COVID-19 vaccine efforts. \u201cThe time is right for G20 leaders to hold a second meeting to... agree to a more strongly coordinated global response to the health, economic and social emergencies we face,\u201d they said in an open letter to world leaders. \u201cThe consequences of not acting now would be felt for the rest of the decade,\u201d added the signatories, including UK former prime minsters Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, Helen Clark, of New Zealand, and the ex-UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon. \u201cWithout action from the G20, the recession caused by the pandemic will only deepen, hurting all economies and the world\u2019s most marginalised and poorest peoples and nations the most.\u201d Schools in Senegal are to remain closed after a last minute decision to postpone the resumption of classes for pupils in the last three years of secondary education. They had been due to return on Tuesday morning, two and a half months after schools were closed down as part of measures to contain the spread of coronavirus. But in the middle of the night, the education ministry announced the much-awaited move was being delayed \u201cuntil a later date\u201d, after a cluster of infections was detected among teachers in Casamance, a region in Senegal\u2019s far south, AFP reports. By Tuesday, Senegal had counted 3,836 cases of coronavirus, and 43 deaths. As with other African countries, the pandemic has been relatively contained, but the weak state of Senegal\u2019s health system has stirred many doubts about its ability to withstand major spread. Iran has recorded its second highest number of new coronavirus cases since its outbreak began, with 3,117 people in the country testing positive for the virus in the past 24 hours, according to the latest health ministry report. The number of new daily infections in Iran has now returned to levels previously seen at the peak of its outbreak in late March. Iran\u2019s highest number of new cases in a single day was reached on 31 March, when 3,186 positive tests were reported. Death tolls remain well below levels seen then, however. In his latest update, Kianoush Jahanpour, the health ministry spokesman, said 64 Iranians had died from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours. So far, 157,562 people in Iran have tested positive for coronavirus, of whom 123,077 have recovered and 7,942 have died. At least 20 journalists have died from Covid-19 in Peru as reporters, photographers and camera operators raced to cover the pandemic\u2019s spread through the country, often without protective equipment, writes Dan Collyns in Lima. The number throws into sharp relief the risks and precarious work conditions which face journalists covering the global pandemic in the Andean country, which, after Brazil is Latin America\u2019s worst-hit with more than 164,000 Covid-19 cases and 4,500 deaths. Peru is not the only country in the region to report the death of journalists from Covid-19. At least 12 journalists have reportedly died from the virus in Ecuador\u2019s hard-hit city of Guayaquil, about eight in Brazil, and at least one in Nicaragua, among deaths in other countries. Around the world, at least 117 journalists have died as a result of the coronavirus pandemic in 31 countries, according to one estimate by the Swiss NGO the Press Emblem Club. \u201cThis pandemic has stripped bare the labour conditions for journalists in Peru,\u201d said Zuliana Lainez, secretary general of Peru\u2019s National Journalists Association, known as the ANP. At least six journalists died in Peru\u2019s hard-hit Amazon city of Iquitos, four in the capital Lima, and others on the country\u2019s northern coast, a coronavirus hotspot, according to the ANP. Dozens more journalists are reportedly recovering from the virus. About half of the victims were working when they became infected, Lainez reported, and most were freelancers while just four worked for national media outlets. Over 5,000 more people across Africa have tested positive for coronavirus, according to the latest update from the World Health Organization\u2019s regional office for the continent. According to the UN health agency, there had been more than 150,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus reported between the 54 countries in Africa on Tuesday morning, of which 63,000 patients had recovered and 4,200 had died. South Africa was the worst affected country by number of cases, while Egypt, on the other end of the continent, had recorded the most deaths.

The number of new jobseekers in Spain was close to 27,000 in May, around 10 times lower than in March and April during the coronavirus lockdown, the labour ministry said today. Spain imposed a nationwide lockdown on 14 March to slow the spread of the virus, and that month it counted more than 302,000 new jobseekers, followed by another 280,000 in April. But in May, as the lockdown was gradually eased, the government counted a total of 26,573 new jobseekers in the eurozone\u2019s fourth-largest economy, where the total number of unemployed stands at 3.8 million. At the end of March, the National Statistics Institute (INE), which calculates figures in a different way, gave Spain\u2019s jobless figure as 3.31 million. These figures do not count those who have been furloughed. Between mid-March and the end of May, a total of 3.7 million people were furloughed under a plan rolled out by the labour ministry. But when the furlough scheme draws to a close as planned at the end of June, unemployment figures could rise again. The government has urged employers not to cut jobs in the six months following the furlough period but layoffs are expected. In May, as the lockdown was eased, the number of new jobseekers in the construction sector fell by almost 7% compared with April. In industry and agriculture, the figure remained stable but it grew by 1.5% in the service sector which has borne the brunt of the crisis, particularly due to the loss of significant numbers of temporary jobs in tourism. In the first quarter, Spain\u2019s unemployment rate jumped to 14.4%, INE figures showed. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates unemployment in Spain could soar to 20.8% in 2020, while the government expects a figure of 19%. Concerts have been allowed to restart in Portugal, with the country\u2019s prime minister, Antonio Costa, attending a show performed by Bruno Nogueira and Manuela Azevedo in Lisbon last night: Britain\u2019s statistics watchdog has again warned the health secretary, Matt Hancock, that figures on coronavirus tests remain \u201cfar from complete and comprehensible\u201d. In a strongly-worded letter, Sir David Norgrove, chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, said the way the Government presented the figures appeared to be aimed at showing \u201cthe largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding\u201d. The government has faced repeated criticism for its daily testing figures, in which it counts in its headline figure the number of tests posted out to people as well as the number of those completed. It is also not clear from the government data how many of the tests carried out are repeat tests on the same person. Norgrove said the government\u2019s current statistics figures were misleading people during the daily No 10 briefing as they often do not explain how the headline figure on the number of tests has been calculated. He said the way the tests were presented at the televised press conference gives \u201can artificially low impression of the proportion of tests returning a positive diagnosis\u201d. Norgrove said it was also \u201chard to believe the statistics work to support the testing programme itself,\u201d adding that they \u201cstill fall well short\u201d of the statistics code of practice which Hancock has said he supported. He added: It is not surprising that given their inadequacy data on testing are so widely criticised and often mistrusted. You can read the letter in full below: Across Europe, those who have coped with coronavirus are aware the world has changed dramatically. Here we ask some of them about life after lockdown: What will restaurants look like when they reopen? We asked three experts: Antibody testing in Israel suggest that around 200,000 people, and potentially as many as 270,000 in the country, have had coronavirus, amounting to around 2.5% of the population. \u201cThe data arising from the survey is generally similar to the information and surveys we\u2019ve seen in other places,\u201d professor Daniel Cohen of Tel Aviv University\u2019s School of Public Health, who organised the testing, told Haaretz. \u201cFor example, we see that there\u2019s a higher rate of exposure among men than among women. Among women the rate of infection is 1.2%, compared to 2.6% among men.\u201d The survey showed that 3.6% of people aged between 40 and 59 had had the infection, but only 0.8% of those aged 0 to 19. A Wuhan doctor who worked with the coronavirus whistleblower Li Wenliang died of the virus last week, state media reported today, becoming China\u2019s first Covid-19 fatality in weeks. Hu Weifeng, a urologist at Wuhan Central Hospital, died on Friday after being treated for Covid-19 and allied issues for more than four months, state broadcaster CCTV said. He is the sixth doctor from Wuhan Central Hospital to have died from the virus, which emerged in the central Chinese city late last year. Cases have dwindled dramatically from the peak in mid-February as the country appears to have brought the outbreak largely under control. The official death toll in the country of 1.4 billion people stands at 4,634, well below the number of fatalities in less populous nations. Wuhan Central Hospital has yet to give a formal statement on Hu\u2019s death. In early February it said some 68 staff members had contracted coronavirus. Hu\u2019s condition became a national concern after Chinese media showed images of him with his skin turned black due to liver damage. Fellow doctor Yi Fan showed similar symptoms, but recovered and has since been discharged from hospital. The death of their colleague Li Wenliang in February triggered a national outpouring of grief and rage against the government as he documented his final days on social media. The 34-year-old ophthalmologist was reprimanded by authorities after he warned colleagues about the virus in late December. Beijing has since named him a national martyr, but suppressed much of the dissent and criticism sparked by his death. Other medical whistleblowers at Wuhan Central Hospital - including emergency unit director Ai Fen - have told Chinese media they were punished by authorities for speaking out. China has not released a complete figure of the number of medical worker deaths from Covid-19, but at least 34 medics have been awarded posthumous honours by health authorities. In February the National Health Commission said some 3,387 health workers had been infected. City-wide testing that began in mid-May found no new cases of Covid-19 in Wuhan, and 300 asymptomatic cases. A total of 9.9 million people were tested between 14 May and 1 June. China does not count asymptomatic cases, meaning people who are infected with the virus but do not exhibit symptoms of the disease, as confirmed cases. Following news today of the first Rohingya refugee to die of Covid-19 in Bangladesh, the country has reported 2,911 new cases, the most they have reported in a single day, from 12,704 samples tested. This takes the total number of confirmed infections in the country over 50,000, to 52,445. There were 37 deaths, 33 men and four women, taking the country\u2019s total to 709. Malaysian health authorities today reported 20 new coronavirus cases, bringing the cumulative total to 7,877 cases. The health ministry also reported no new deaths, keeping total fatalities at 115. Indonesia has reported 609 new confirmed infections, taking their total to 27,549, and 22 deaths. 1,663 people have now been confirmed as having died of Covid-19 in the country. The French coronavirus tracking app, StopCovid, is due to be rolled out at midday today, local time. It will allow anyone who is diagnosed with Covid-19 to warn those with whom they have been in contact in the previous two weeks so they can be tested if they develop symptoms. C\u00e9dric O, France\u2019s secretary of state for the economy responsible for digital technology, said the government wanted to encourage people to download the app, particularly those living in cities where contacts, especially on public transport, are of concern. Announcing a further easing of lockdown restrictions last week, the prime minister \u00c9douard Philippe said the government \u201cguaranteed\u201d the app would not infringe people\u2019s privacy or be used to collect data on geolocalisation. France\u2019s highest authority for the protection of privacy and data has approved StopCovid and the parliament approved its use last week. \u201cIt is an instrument for fighting the virus, not a weapon,\u201d Philippe said. Apple and Google launched the first contact tracing application API late last month but France, keen not to rely on the US technology firms and wishing to retain \u201cnational sovereignty\u201d over the process, developed StopCovid as an independent project. Apple and Google reportedly offered to work with the French government, which turned down the offer considering the companies posed data protection risks. Apple then refused to help with a means of allowing the Bluetooth to work on its phones while the StopCovid app is closed (on iPhones, Bluetooth works only when the app is open). Cedric O accused the US companies of not cooperating. \u201cApple could have helped us make it work even better on the iPhone. They didn\u2019t want to do that, for a reason that I can\u2019t quite understand,\u201d he said. \u201cThat a large company that has never done so well in economic terms does not help a government fight the crisis, we will have to remember that when the time comes.\u201d StopCovid will alert anyone who has had \u201cprolonged contact\u201d - meaning more than 15 minutes at less than 1-metre distance \u2013 with a person with Covid-19. Today is the Festa della Repubblica, Italy\u2019s national day, and the Frecce Tricolori have been doing their thing over Rome: We have updated our world map with the latest statistics from around the world: My colleague Bethan McKernan, the Guardian\u2019s Middle East correspondent, reports on the migrants passing through war-torn Yemen: Yellow and purple headscarves and patterned dresses made a jarring contrast with the camouflage uniforms worn by soldiers milling around a bullet-ridden checkpoint in the southern Yemeni city of Aden. It was 8am, and the sun was already hot. The family of six \u2013 four women and two men from Ethiopia, across the Red Sea \u2013 had already walked eight miles (13km) so far that morning. They stopped to ask the soldiers for water before continuing on their journey. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know about the fighting in Yemen before we came on the boat last night,\u201d said one of the group, Abdul Saleh Tayeb. \u201cBut we are looking for money. We have to go to Saudi Arabia.\u201d They still had around 1,000 miles (1,400km) through disputed territories, mountain passes and scorching desert to go. More here: Russia has reported 8,863 new coronavirus cases and 182 deaths in the past 24 hours. The figures are similar to those reported on Monday (9,035 cases and 162 deaths) and bring the nation\u2019s tally to 423,741 confirmed cases, and 5,037 deaths. A 71-year-old man has become the first Rohingya living in vast refugee camps in Bangladesh to die from coronavirus, an official said today. Health experts have long warned that the deadly virus could race through the vast network of settlements housing almost a million refugees in the country\u2019s southeast. \u201cHe died on 31 May. But last night we got the confirmation that he died of Covid-19,\u201d said Toha Bhuiyan, a senior health official in the Cox\u2019s Bazar district. The fatality was in Kutupalong, the largest of the camps, which is home to roughly 600,000 people. The man was among at least 29 Rohingya to have tested positive for the virus in the camps. Bhuiyan said the victim died in an isolation centre run by the medical charity Doctors Without Borders and was buried in the camp the same day. \u201cWe are going to speak to administrators in the camp and alert people about the death,\u201d Bhuiyan said, adding they were trying to find people the deceased had been in contact with. Mahbubur Rahman, head of the health department in Cox\u2019s Bazar district, told AFP officials were waiting for a full report on the death. A UN spokesperson said they would comment later. Last week about 15,000 refugees were placed in quarantine as the number of cases increased, while Bangladesh and UN authorities have prepared seven isolation centres with the capacity to treat more than 700 patients inside the camps. Aid workers say many of the refugees know very little about the virus. They blame this partly on local authorities cutting off access to the internet in September to combat what they said were drug traffickers and other criminals. A couple of days ago Abu Dhabi announced that they would be closing their borders for a week, starting today. This was the queue to get in this morning: Indonesia has cancelled the haj pilgrimage this year for people in the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority nation due to concerns over the coronavirus, the religious affairs minister said on Tuesday. Each year, hundreds of thousands of Indonesians go on the haj to Saudi Arabia, with places allocated according to a quota system. The quota for this year was 221,000, with more than 90% of places already allocated. The average wait for a place on the pilgrimage is 20 years. Dewi, an employee of a telecommunications company in Jakarta and registered to perform the pilgrimage this year, told Reuters that while she had waited six years, she had made peace with the news. \u201cIf that is the decision, I will accept it,\u201d said Dewi, who did not want to give her full name. \u201cAfter all, I believe that everything happens with God\u2019s permission.\u201d Medellin\u2019s phased reopening is being mirrored across South America. Some of Brazil\u2019s hardest hit cities, including the jungle metropolis Manaus and coastal Rio de Janeiro, are starting to allow more activity. Bolivia\u2019s government has authorised reopening most of the country and the government of Venezuela\u2019s Nicolas Maduro unwound restrictions, while Ecuador\u2019s airports were resuming flights. Here is a report filed last night by AP: The executive director of the World Health Organization\u2019s emergencies program, Mike Ryan, expressed concern over South America\u2019s climbing contagion, telling reporters Monday that the region had become an \u201cintense zone of transmission for this virus,\u201d which had not yet reached its peak. \u201cClearly the situation in many South American countries is far from stable. There is a rapid increase in cases and those systems are coming under increasing pressure,\u201d he said. Data from the WHO\u2019s Pan American Health Organization shows the region\u2019s seven-day rolling average of new cases continues rising, due in large part to Brazil, which accounts for more than half the total. Manaus, the Amazon rainforest\u2019s largest city, was the first Brazilian metropolis whose health care system collapsed. For weeks, overwhelmed intensive-care units were unable to admit patients, deaths at home surged and a city cemetery buried bodies in mass graves. Such burials continue, yet the capital of Amazonas state on Monday began loosening its clamp on non-essential businesses. Amazonas registered 818 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, bringing the total number of cases above 40,000. There are more than 500,000 confirmed cases in Brazil, the second most in the world, and experts believe the true toll to be much higher due to insufficient testing. Rio de Janeiro, the Brazilian city with the second-most cases after Sao Paulo, on Monday announced it would begin gradually relaxing restrictions the following day. Already a city in its metropolitan region, Sao Joao de Meriti, started allowing salons, auto mechanics, and hotels to operate on Monday. \u201cBrazil tends to look at Europe, and the problem is that there they did one or two months of strict quarantine and are now reopening,\u201d said Renato Mendes Coutinho, a specialist in mathematical biology at Covid-19 BR Observatory, an independent group of more than 50 Brazilian researchers. \u201cThe difference is that the lockdown they implemented and the restriction measures were much more efficient and thorough.\u201d Ecuador was one of the first South American nations hit, with grim scenes of people leaving corpses outside their doorsteps in Guayaquil through March and April. The nation\u2019s caseload continues to surge, yet its airport will resume international flights on 3 June, according to Nicolas Romero, the airport\u2019s spokesperson, though he said arriving passengers must spend 15 days in quarantine, without specifying how such quarantine will be enforced. The airport in the country\u2019s capital, Quito, recorded its first flight in 80 days on Monday, and flights to Miami and Houston will take off on 4 June. \u201cIt has just been one flight so far, but the important thing is the message it gives, of flying safely,\u201d Luis Galarraga, the airport\u2019s spokesperson, told The Associated Press. Marcos Espinal, director of PAHO\u2019s communicable diseases department, said by phone that reopening too soon could cause harm in certain places that aren\u2019t yet ready. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the middle of the epicenter, we don\u2019t recommend to open,\u201d Espinal said from Washington. \u201cPeople\u2019s lives are precious, and there shouldn\u2019t be any negotiations of that.\u201d Venezuela on Monday allowed barbershops, beauty salons, auto shops, construction sites and banks to begin operations, along with other sectors. The nation is dialing down restrictions because it has reported relatively low Covid-19 impact: 1,510 cases and 14 deaths. Experts have roundly criticised Venezuela\u2019s data as suspicious. Bolivia on Monday instituted a so-called \u201cdynamic quarantine\u201d in most of the country, keeping parks and shows shuttered while resuming work, commerce and public transport, even as contagion continues rising. The government\u2019s public works minister, Ivan Arias, suggested Monday that men shave their beards and moustaches to prevent infection. The Health Ministry\u2019s epidemiological director, Virgilio Prieto, offered less optimism about recalibrating the nation\u2019s quarantine, admitting it \u201ccould bring about an explosion of the new coronavirus.\u201d Having seen first-hand the worst of the virus\u2019 damage in Europe, Jesus Gomez-Gardenes, an associate professor in physics and computational epidemiology at the University of Zaragoza, in Spain, looks on South America\u2019s rush to reopen with concern. \u201cOpening their doors when we have recent growth in the number of daily cases is something that could be, or is, a catastrophe,\u201d he said. Shopping malls in Medellin, Colombia reopened yesterday, with temperature checks for all customers, as the city\u2019s mayor, Daniel Quintero, pointed out that it had registered no Covid-19 deaths in the prior 30 days. But in the Santa Cruz neighbourhood, which is suffering from a particularly serious outbreak, a new, stricter lockdown has been imposed. One resident told semana.com: \u201cFrom the start people here did not take precautions seriously, and were interacting normally, without masks. When the first case was identified, the rest of the family ignored it and on Mother\u2019s Day they had a party and sold vegetables in front of their houses without taking any precautions.\u201d With the borders of the area heavily policed, nobody is now allowed out except for medical purposes, or people from certain key professions who have signed up to the Medellin Me Cuida online portal. Morning/evening/whatever-it-is-where-you-are everyone. This is Simon Burnton taking on the live blog for the next few hours. If you have seen any stories that deserve our attention, or if you have any tips, comments or suggestions for our coverage then please let me know by sending me a message either to @Simon_Burnton on Twitter or via email. Thanks! Let\u2019s have a quick look at some of the UK front pages. The Guardian has the story I mentioned a couple of posts ago: \u201cCritics round on No 10 over \u2018ridiculous\u2019 quarantine\u201d. The Times splashes with a large picture of the US protests but its main headline is: \u201cSafe return of all primary pupils \u2018will be impossible\u2019\u201d. The Telegraph has \u201cQuarantine plan under review as MPs revolt\u201d. The Daily Mail has \u201cOne metre is enough!\u201d. And the Mirror has \u201cSmall steps into a new normal\u201d as children return to classrooms. The Associated Press is carrying a report that says Chinese officials sat on releasing the genetic map, or genome, of the coronavirus for over a week after multiple government labs had fully decoded it, not sharing details key to designing tests, drugs and vaccines. AP reports that strict controls on information and competition within the Chinese public health system were largely to blame. The news agency says its report is based on internal documents, emails and dozens of interviews. The AP report reads: Health officials only released the genome after a Chinese lab published it ahead of authorities on a virology website on 11 January. Even then, China stalled for at least two weeks more on giving WHO the details it needed, according to recordings of multiple internal meetings held by the UN health agency in January all at a time when the outbreak arguably might have been dramatically slowed. Although the World Health Organization continued to publicly commend China, the recordings obtained by the AP show they were concerned China was not sharing enough information to assess the risk posed by the new virus, costing the world valuable time. \u201cWe\u2019re currently at the stage where yes, they\u2019re giving it to us 15 minutes before it appears on CCTV,\u201d said WHOs top official in China, Dr Gauden Galea, referring to the state-owned China Central Television, in one meeting. The story behind the early response to the pandemic comes at a time when the UN health agency is under siege. President Trump cut ties with WHO on Friday, after blasting the agency for allegedly colluding with China to hide the extent of the epidemic. Chinese President Xi Jinping said China has always provided information to WHO and the world in a most timely fashion. The new information does not support the narrative of either the US or China, but portrays an agency now stuck in the middle that was urgently trying to solicit more data. Although international law obliges countries to report information to WHO that could have an impact on public health, the UN agency has no enforcement powers. Instead, it must rely on the cooperation of member states. The AP has found rather than colluding with China, WHO was itself largely kept in the dark, as China gave it only the minimal information required. But the agency did attempt to portray China in the best light, most likely to coax the country into providing more outbreak details. WHO officials worried about how to press China for more information without angering authorities or jeopardising Chinese scientists, whom they praised for decoding the genome with astonishing speed. Dr Michael Ryan, WHO\u2019s emergencies chief, said the best way to protect China was for WHO to do its own independent analysis, because otherwise the spread of the virus between people would be in question and other countries will take action accordingly. From the time the virus was first decoded on 2 January to when WHO declared a global emergency on 30 January, the outbreak grew by a factor of 100 to 200 times, according to retrospective Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention data. WHO and officials named in this story declined to answer questions asked by the AP without audio or written transcripts of the recorded meetings, which the AP was unable to supply to protect its sources. \u201cOur leadership and staff have worked night and day.to support and share information with all Member States equally, and engage in frank and forthright conversations with governments at all levels,\u201d a WHO statement said. China\u2019s National Health Commission and Ministry of Foreign Affairs had no comment. In the UK critics have taken aim at the government\u2019s 14-day quarantine rules, calling them \u201cridiculous\u201d. Tens of thousands of new arrivals to the UK will be able to go food shopping, change accommodation and use public transport from airports during a 14-day quarantine imposed to prevent a second wave of coronavirus, under draft plans to be laid before parliament. The rules, still being finalised and due to be published on Tuesday before coming into effect next week, have prompted cross-party concerns about the potentially limited impact on public health amid warnings of the severe damage that could be caused to the travel and aviation industry. \u201cNot only is there no basis in science for this ridiculous policy, but it will unnecessarily cost thousands and thousands of jobs. The sooner the government scraps it, the better,\u201d said the Labour MP, Ben Bradshaw. Priti Patel, the home secretary, announced on 22 May that nearly all international arrivals at UK ports, including airports, ferry ports and international rail terminals, must quarantine for 14 days from Monday 8 June. There are exemptions for health workers, scientists, lorry drivers and others. Around 20% of arrivals will receive a check call to make sure they are where they should be. However, according to draft rules, the police in England will not have power of entry. In theory, if they call on someone suspected of breaching the regulations, the person does not have to open the door. Fines of \u00a31,000 can be issued in England, although while the quarantine plan is UK-wide, enforcement is devolved. One source said: \u201cTo get caught, you will either have to be unlucky or stupid.\u201d You can read our full story below: More on Singapore and the government there is racing to create additional housing for about 60,000 migrant workers by the end of this year, as it seeks to reduce the density in dormitories which have seen mass outbreaks of the coronavirus infection, Reuters reports. The nation of 5.7 million people has more than 35,000 cases, one of the largest numbers in Asia, largely due to infections in cramped, bunk-bed accommodation that house more than 300,000 mostly South Asian workers. Singapore will create additional space through temporary structures that can be put together quickly in a modular form. It will also temporarily fit out unused state properties, such as former schools and vacant factories, the ministries of manpower and national development said on Monday. The government said dormitories were a practical approach to housing migrant workers in land-scarce Singapore, but it was looking to improve accommodation standards. It is testing new standards, including increased living space per resident, decreasing bed numbers in each room and reducing how many people would share a toilet and bathroom. Over the longer term, it is planning to build new permanent dormitories to house up to 100,000 workers, which would take several years to complete. About 11 such dormitories will be ready over the next one to two years. The government is also studying the possibility of building and leasing out these dormitories. Presently, commercial operators build and operate them. Around 40,000 migrant labourers, many of whom have been moved out of dormitories into alternative accomodation, have been cleared to resume work. Around half of those had been infected and recovered from the disease. North Korea will reopen the remainder of its schools this month, according to state media. North Korean schools usually begin their spring term on 1 April, but it was postponed as the government took various steps to ward off the virus, including sealing its borders. State media has said high schools and universities started classes on April 20. All other schools, kindergartens, day-care centres and nursing homes will reopen early this month, state radio said late on Monday. School children in Singapore have returned to their classrooms for the first time in nearly two months. Singapore has said it will ease restrictions gradually, with the registry of marriages and some businesses, including pet salons, also reopening on Tuesday. Students are required to wear face masks and temperatures are checked and recorded by teachers. Singapore has recorded more than 35,000 coronavirus cases and 24 deaths. Most cases have been among migrant workers living in dormitories. Global infections from Covid-19 stand at 6,266,193 with deaths at 375,554, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. South Korea will begin trialling QR codes as part of its track and trace efforts to contain the virus. From 10 June, visitors to nightclubs, bars, karaoke clubs, daytime discos, indoor gyms that hold group exercises and indoor standing concert halls will be required to use an app that generates a one-time personalised QR code that can be scanned at the door. It follows difficulties tracing potential infections from last month\u2019s Seoul nightclubs cluster of 270 cases, after people gave false or incomplete information. Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, has defended his decision to lift almost all lockdown measures because of economic losses, as cases rise. In a televised address, Khan said his government could not afford to continue giving cash handouts to the poor on such a large scale. He urged people to act responsibly but said more infections and deaths were inevitable. \u201cThis virus will spread more. I have to say it with regret that there will be more deaths,\u201d Khan warned. \u201cIf people do take care they can live with the virus.\u201d New Zealand\u2019s PM, Jacinda Ardern, has said restrictions may be eased again sooner than planned as the country was \u201cahead of schedule\u201d in tackling Covid-19. Cabinet will decide next Monday whether to move to level-1 restrictions \u2013 the most lenient \u2013 two weeks ahead of when the government had planned to make that decision. New Zealand has had no Covid-19 cases for 11 straight days. Level-1 is thought to only involve border restrictions. The World Health Organization has warned that the increased use of antibiotics to combat the pandemic will strengthen bacterial resistance and ultimately lead to more deaths during the crisis and beyond. WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on Monday a \u201cworrying number\u201d of bacterial infections were becoming increasingly resistant to the medicines traditionally used to treat them. The risk of Covid-19 infection could double if the 2-metre rule is reduced in UK, a study part-funded by the WHO and published in the Lancet has found. Last week, Boris Johnson said he hoped to \u201cbe able to reduce that [2-metre] distance\u201d, to make it easier to travel on public transport and boost the hospitality industry. Deaths in Mexico passed 10,000 as the WHO warned that Central and South America had become \u201cintense zones for transmission of this virus\u201d and had not reached their peak in cases. Brazil registered 11,598 additional cases of coronavirus and 623 new deaths on Monday, taking its confirmed cases to 526,447 and deaths to 29,937. The Armenian prime minister, Nikol Pashinyan, has tested positive to Covid-19. Armenia, which has a population of 3 million, had registered 9,492 confirmed coronavirus cases and 139 deaths as of Monday. China reported five new imported cases and no deaths on Tuesday. As of Monday, there were 73 active cases in the country, according to the national health commission. In case you missed it, the World Health Organization has warned that that Central and South America had become \u201cintense zones for transmission of this virus\u201d and had not reached their peak in cases. It came as Mexico passed 10,000 deaths from the virus, with more than 93,000 infections. On Monday, Brazil registered 11,598 additional cases of coronavirus and 623 new deaths on Monday, taking its confirmed cases to 526,447 and deaths to 29,937. The US remains way out in front and is approaching 2 million infections (1,811,357) with more than 105,000 deaths. There are grave concerns over the spread of the virus as a result of the mass street protests taking place, including scenes like the one tweeted below, which show police and protesters shaking hands. Hello, this is Alison Rourke stepping in to the blog for the next couple of hours. If you want to get in touch, you can reach me at alison.rourke@theguardian.com The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levin reports from Los Angeles, with Joanna Walters in New York: The full story on Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top public health expert and a member of the national coronavirus taskforce, saying on Monday that he is no longer in frequent contact with Donald Trump \u2013 comments likely to spark fresh fears that he is being frozen out of the White House. The pandemic continues to ravage communities across the United States, where the death toll on Monday had reached 105,000, and last month Fauci warned the US Congress during a hearing that the virus was not yet under control. Asked on Monday whether the president talked to him often about Covid-19 vaccine work, he told a reporter with Stat News, \u201cNo ... As you probably noticed, the taskforce meetings have not occurred as often lately. And certainly my meetings with the president have been dramatically decreased.\u201d Fauci noted that they used to have taskforce meetings daily, including on the weekend, and said that frequently, the two would talk after the meetings, estimating that a month ago, they met four times a week. The director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases also told a CNN reporter that he had not spoken or met with Trump in two weeks and that their last interaction was on 18 May, during a teleconference with governors. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 213 to 182,028, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Tuesday. The reported death toll rose by 11 to 8,522, the tally showed. South Korea\u2019s economic contraction will worsen in the current quarter, the central bank forecast Tuesday, as the coronavirus outbreak hits consumer demand and economic activity even harder, AFP reports. The Bank of Korea predicted the world\u2019s 12th-biggest economy will shrink at least 2.0 percent in the April-June period over the previous three months. It already declined 1.3% quarter-on-quarter in the first three months, it said \u2013 a slight improvement from its first announcement in April of a 1.4% contraction, but still the biggest drop in gross domestic product since the 2008 global financial crisis. South Korea endured one of the worst early outbreaks of the coronavirus outside mainland China, and while it never imposed a compulsory lockdown, strict social distancing was widely observed from March until it started loosening restrictions last month. Private consumption decreased 6.5% in January-March from the previous quarter \u201cas expenditures on goods and services both decreased\u201d, the BOK said. The country appears to have brought its epidemic under control thanks to an extensive \u201ctrace, test and treat\u201d programme and life is beginning to return to normal. But the BOK forecast last week that the economy will shrink 0.2% in 2020, a dramatic downgrade from its February forecast of 2.1% growth, and cut interest rates to a record low. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has estimated the world economy will contract three percent this year, saying it is expected to \u201cexperience its worst recession since the Great Depression\u201d over the pandemic. The IMF has predicted the South Korean economy will shrink 1.2% this year. Podcast: England is easing out of lockdown \u2013 is it safe? Health officials and even government scientists have warned against the easing of the coronavirus lockdown in England, saying it could lead to a surge in infections. David Hunter, professor of epidemiology and medicine at the University of Oxford, looks at the risks: South Korea is testing a new quick response (QR) code system this week to log visitors at high-risk entertainment facilities, restaurants and churches in a bid to track coronavirus cases and prevent further spread of the disease, Reuters reports. The decision to mandate QR codes to register visitors\u2019 identities came after authorities struggled to trace people who had visited a number of nightclubs and bars at the centre of a virus outbreak last month after much of the information on handwritten visitor logs was found to be false or incomplete. Starting 10 June , visitors to nightclubs, bars, karaoke clubs, daytime discos, indoor gyms that hold group exercises, and indoor standing concert halls, will be required to use any of a number of commercially available apps to generate a one-time, personalised QR code that can be scanned at the door. Local governments may also designate other high-risk facilities such as libraries, hospitals, restaurants or churches. The person\u2019s information will be logged in a database kept by the Social Security Information Service for four weeks, before it is automatically deleted, according to South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Health and Welfare.

Amid a pandemic and a brewing tropical storm, Mexico President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador kicked off Mexico\u2019s return to a new normal Monday with his first road trip in two months as the nation began to gradually ease some virus-inspired restrictions, AP reports. L\u00f3pez Obrador said he\u2019s taking all necessary precautions he drove the 1,000 miles from Mexico City over the weekend rather than flying on a trip to promote construction of one of his signature infrastructure projects the Mayan Train. While the federal governments nationwide social distancing rule formally ended Monday, it is urging people in so-called red zones to maintain most of those measures and so many people are falling ill and dying each day that those zones cover nearly the whole country. Mexico is nearing 100,000 confirmed infections and has topped 10,000 deaths, but those official tallies are considered to be undercounts. Mexican officials said last week that more than 5,000 companies had implemented protocols that would allow them to reopen this week. The federal government had cleared businesses in the mining, construction and auto manufacturing sectors to resume operations. Reducing physical distancing advice from 2 metres to 1 metre could double the risk of coronavirus infection, according to the most comprehensive study to date. The research, part-funded by the World Health Organization (WHO) and published in the Lancet, will add to the debate in the UK about whether the 2-metre rule should be reduced. Last week, Boris Johnson said he hoped to \u201cbe able to reduce that [2-metre] distance\u201d, to make it easier to travel on public transport and boost the hospitality industry. This would allow extra people inside workplaces, restaurants, pubs and shops, and reduce the length of queues. The prime minister has instructed the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to look into the possibility. The UK guidance is out of line with advice in most other countries and with recommendations from the WHO, which says people should stay 1 metre apart. This is followed by France, while countries such as Germany and Australia have a 1.5-metre rule. Covid-free island prepares to bring home stranded citizens Bernadette Carreon reports for the Guardian from Koror: For 143 Palau citizens trapped overseas by coronavirus travel restrictions, the journey home, always long, will be especially tortuous. To reach their Pacific island home they face six long weeks of quarantine \u2013 two in Guam, two in a hotel in Palau, and then another two weeks of self-isolation at home. They will also face at least five Covid-19 tests. But some Palauans fear that even these measures will not be enough. Palau, in the north Pacific, is one of a handful of countries globally with zero cases of coronavirus. Having closed its borders on 22 March, the country has grappled with how to bring home its citizens, trapped abroad, particularly in the US, without importing the virus. The topic has proven hugely divisive as the government has sought to balance the rights of citizens to return with the need to keep its small population safe. In other New Zealand news, the international crew of Avatar 2 have been given special permission to enter New Zealand to begin filming the blockbuster sequel \u2013 despite the country\u2019s border being closed to all foreign nationals. The country\u2019s tourism industry, heavily reliant on overseas visitors, has taken a massive hit, and many families and couples have been separated for months by the measures. Many businesses have also struggled to bring workers stuck overseas home. So news that Avatar director James Cameron and 55 members of his crew had arrived in the country on a privately chartered plane over the weekend angered many: Charlotte Graham-McLay reports for the Guardian: Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, says her government will consider sooner than planned a move to the lowest level of Covid-19 restrictions after she said the country\u2019s quashing of the virus had progressed \u201cahead of schedule.\u201d Ardern\u2019s Cabinet had been due to consider by 22 June whether to move to the loosest, so-called level 1 alert, but she told reporters on Tuesday that it would instead make its decision next Monday 8 June, providing there were \u201cno unexpected cases\u201d of the virus before then. New Zealand\u2019s health officials just announced an 11th straight day of no new cases of Covid-19, with only one person still recovering from the virus. They are not in hospital. 22 people have died of the coronavirus in New Zealand, with no additional deaths announced on Tuesday. While the proposed level 1 restrictions have not been detailed by the government yet, it is believed they will entail little in the way of rules beyond a continuation of New Zealand\u2019s strict border lockdown. Ardern said on Tuesday that a possible spike in Covid-19 cases had not happened as restrictions on New Zealanders had gradually relaxed, and she was now more optimistic that such a resurgence would not occur. \u201cOur strategy of going hard and early has paid off,\u201d she said, referring to the strict national shutdown she imposed in late March, when just over 200 people had been diagnosed with the virus. There have been fewer than 1,500 confirmed cases to date. The ongoing coronavirus pandemic will haunt the US economy for a decade, wiping close to $8tn off economic growth, according to new projections released by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) on Monday. In a letter to lawmakers CBO director Phillip Swagel projected the virus will reduce US economic output by 3% through 2030, a loss of $7.9tn. \u201cBusiness closures and social distancing measures are expected to curtail consumer spending, while the recent drop in energy prices is projected to severely reduce US investment in the energy sector,\u201d Swagel wrote in response to an inquiry from Senator Chuck Schumer. \u201cRecent legislation will, in CBO\u2019s assessment, partially mitigate the deterioration in economic conditions.\u201d Since the pandemic hit the US trillions of dollars have been poured into the economy via government stimulus programs and actions by the Federal Reserve. But the moves have not stopped unemployment soaring to levels unseen since the 1930s Great Depression. So far some 40 million Americans have lost their jobs and on Friday the Labor Department is expected to announce the unemployment rate reached 20% in May, up from 14.7% in April and just 4.4% in March. The World Health Organization stressed Monday that the new coronavirus has not suddenly become less pathogenic, following claims by a leading Italian doctor that Covid-19 had lost some of its potency. \u201cThat is not the case at all,\u201d WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan told a virtual press briefing. The claims by Alberto Zangrillo sparked a furore on Monday, with the Italian government urging caution. \u201cIn reality, the virus clinically no longer exists in Italy,\u201d said Zangrillo, head of the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, the capital of the northern Lombardy region, which has been the worst-hit by the pandemic. \u201cThe swabs performed over the past 10 days have showed a viral load that is absolutely infinitesimal in quantitative terms compared to those carried out a month or two months ago,\u201d he told RAI television on Sunday. That prompted cries of disbelief from other experts, who said Zangrillo may have mistaken a higher detection rate of asymptomatic cases for diminished potency of the virus. Charlotte Graham-McLay reports for the Guardian: New Zealand has recorded an 11th consecutive day of no new cases of Covid-19, with only one case in the country still considered active. 22 people have died of the virus in New Zealand; there were no additional deaths to report on Tuesday. No one is being treated in hospital; the one remaining sufferer is recovering at home. New Zealand is on track to eliminate the virus after locking down the country in late March, when just over 200 cases and no deaths had been recorded. There have been fewer than 1,500 confirmed cases. Ashley Bloomfield, New Zealand\u2019s director-general of health, also addressed the large protests that happened in the country\u2019s largest cities on Monday over \u201cthe tragic death of George Floyd in the USA.\u201d \u201cAnyone who attended these gatherings or who is planning to be at other upcoming events and feels they may be at risk by coming into close contact with people they don\u2019t know, should take a cautious approach and seek advice,\u201d Bloomfield said in a statement, adding that those concerned should visit a doctor. He did not recommend those protesting quarantine themselves. Increased antibiotics use in combating the Covid-19 pandemic will strengthen bacterial resistance and ultimately lead to more deaths during the crisis and beyond, the World Health Organization said Monday. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said a \u201cworrying number\u201d of bacterial infections were becoming increasingly resistant to the medicines traditionally used to treat them. The UN health agency said it was concerned that the inappropriate use of antibiotics during the coronavirus crisis would further fuel the trend. The WHO said only a small proportion of Covid-19 patients needed antibiotics to treat subsequent bacterial infections. The organisation has issued guidance to medics not to provide antibiotic therapy or prophylaxis to patients with mild Covid-19, or to patients with moderate illness without a clinical suspicion of bacterial infection. Tedros said the guidelines said should help tackle antimicrobial resistance while saving lives. He called the threat of antimicrobial resistance \u201cone of the most urgent challenges of our time\u201d. Highlighting inappropriate usage, he said there was an \u201coveruse\u201d of antibiotics in some countries, while in low-income states, such life-saving medicines were unavailable, \u201cleading to needless suffering and death\u201d. There have been at least 375,208 known deaths worldwide in the coronavirus pandemic so far, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. There are at least 6,259,887 cases globally. Both figures are likely to be higher due to delays in reporting, differing testing rates and definitions, and suspected underreporting. These are the ten worst-affected countries in terms of infections. US: 1,809,109 (Deaths: 105,099) Brazil: 526,447 (Deaths: 29,937) Russia: 414,328 (Deaths: 4,849) United Kingdom: 277,727 (Deaths: 39,127) Spain: 239,638 (Deaths: 27,127) Italy: 233,197 (Deaths: 33,475) India: 198,370 (Deaths: 5,608) France: 189,348 (Deaths: 28,836) Germany: 183,594 (Deaths: 8,555) Peru: 170,039 (Deaths: 4,634) In case you missed it earlier: Pakistanis are being urged to \u201clive with the virus\u201d as the country\u2019s prime minister Imran Khan pushes ahead with a plan to lift lockdown restrictions despite rising infections and deaths, citing the economic losses being suffered. Pakistan has rolled back almost all measures, primarily to avert an economic meltdown. The country will open to tourism but cinemas, theatres and schools remain closed.The nation of 220 million has reported 72,160 cases and 1,543 deaths, which jumped lately to as high as 80 a day. The country cannot afford to match the losses incurred as many other countries have done, Khan said. He cited 50 million people who live below the poverty line and 25 million daily wagers. He said his government has given cash handouts to the poor, which wasn\u2019t possible to continue on such a large scale, adding around 130 million to 150 million people were adversely affected by the shutdowns. Our conditions don\u2019t allow that we keep feeding money to them, how long we can give them money. He urged people to act responsibly but more infections and deaths were inevitable. This virus will spread more. I have to say it with regret that there will be more deaths. If people do take care they can live with the virus. Here is more on those comments from Dr. Anthony Fauci earlier: Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top public health expert and Covid-19 task force member, said he was no longer in frequent contact with the president. Asked whether the president talks to him often about Covid vaccine work, he told a reporter with Stat News, \u201cNo ... As you probably noticed, that the task force meetings have not occurred as often lately. And certainly my meetings with the president have been dramatically decreased.\u201d Fauci noted that they used to have task force meetings daily, including on the weekend, and said that frequently, the two would talk after the meeting, estimating that a month ago, they met four times a week. Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also told a CNN reporter that he has not spoken or met with Trump in two weeks and that their last interaction was 18 May, during a teleconference with the nation\u2019s governors. The comments from Fauci come as states across the US have continued to reopen and end lockdowns, even as reports of new Covid-19 cases and deaths continue. Last week, the US recorded In his STAT interview, Fauci said he understood the desire to reopen states as quickly as possible: \u201cI certainly have sensitivity for the need of the public to start getting to some form of normalization.\u201d But he said he was still concerned about the pace of the reopening: When I see a situation where there is a region, a state, a city, a county where there\u2019s a considerable amount of viral activity there, and you see people crowding around bars \u2014 and there were several pictures of that, that was quite striking over the last couple of days \u2014 or on boardwalks, where they\u2019re very, very close to each other, I do get concerned. He said he was not concerned about the 12-18 month vaccine timetable, but added, \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee that it\u2019s going to be effective. In May during Senate testimony, Fauci also expressed concerns about the potential for ongoing outbreaks: \u201cThere is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you might not be able to control. Not only leading to some suffering and death, but it could even set you back on the road to get economic recovery.\u201d Hi, Helen Sullivan with you now. I\u2019ll be bringing you the latest in the coronavirus pandemic from around the world for the next few hours. As always, we welcome your questions, comments, feedback, news and tips. You can get in touch with me on Twitter @helenrsullivan or via email: helen.sullivan[at]theguardian.com Anthony Fauci, the US government\u2019s top public health expert and Covid-19 task force member, has said he and President Donald Trump are no longer in regular contact, telling a reporter at Stat News: \u201cMy meetings with the president have been dramatically decreased.\u201d Fauci also told CNN that he and the president have not spoken or met since 18 May. Fauci\u2019s comments come as protests sweep the US, sparking fears of new infections. The US has more than 1.8 million confirmed cases, and over 105,000 deaths. Here are the latest developments from the last few hours: Known deaths worldwide near 375,000, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. They say at least 6,246,042 people are known to have been infected and at least 374,452 are known to have died since the outbreak began. New analysis from the US has found that masks and social distancing can help control the coronavirus but hand washing and other measures are still needed. Researchers concluded single-layer cloth masks are less effective than surgical masks, while tight-fitting N95 masks provide the best protection. A distance of one meter (more than three feet) between people lowers the danger of catching the virus, while two meters (about 6 1/2 feet) is even better. None of the strategies work perfectly and more rigorous studies are needed, according to the analysis published Monday. Trump deploys military in Washington DC. In an address at the White House shortly after George Floyd\u2019s death was ruled a homicide, the president Trump said he was deploying \u201cthousands of heavily-armed soldiers, military personnel, and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults, and the wanton destruction of property\u201d in the US capital. In his brief remarks, Trump mentioned the virus only once, saying the protests mean, \u201cBrave nurses who have battled the virus are afraid to leave their homes.\u201d Fauci says he and Trump no longer in regular contact. Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top public health expert and Covid-19 task force member, said he was no longer in frequent contact with the president. Asked whether the president talks to him often about Covid vaccine work, he told a reporter with Stat News, \u201cNo ...

Fauci also told a CNN reporter that he has not spoken or met with Trump in two weeks and that their last interaction was 18 May. Pakistanis urged to \u201clive with the virus\u201d. Pakistanis are being urged to \u201clive with the virus\u201d as the country\u2019s prime minister, Imran Khan, pushes ahead with a plan to lift lockdown restrictions despite rising infections and deaths, citing the economic losses being suffered. Pakistan has rolled back almost all measures, primarily to avert an economic meltdown. Khan urged people to act responsibly but more infections and deaths were inevitable: \u201cThis virus will spread more. I have to say it with regret that there will be more deaths. If people do take care they can live with the virus.\u201d UK government criticised over \u201cridiculous\u201d rules for 14-day quarantine. Tens of thousands of new arrivals to the UK will be able to go food shopping, change accommodation and use public transport from airports during a 14-day quarantine imposed to prevent a second wave of coronavirus, under draft plans to be laid before parliament. Public trust in the UK government as a source of accurate information about the epidemic has collapsed, suggesting ministers may struggle to maintain lockdown restrictions in the aftermath of the Dominic Cummings affair. Spain reported no new deaths for the first time since March. The emergency health response chief, Fernando Sim\u00f3n, called the development very encouraging. There were only 71 new infections over the past 24 hours, he said. There were fears of resurgence in Germany, after the country\u2019s disease control body confirmed 333 new infections and 11 new deaths. The reproduction rate rose to 1.04 on Sunday, staying above the critical threshold of 1 for a second day. Malaysia\u2019s health ministry says 10 days have passed since a coronavirus-related death. On Monday, the country reported 38 new cases, bringing the cumulative total to 7,857 cases. The death toll stands at 115. Bars and restaurants reopened in the Netherlands for the first time in three months. Along with museums, cinemas and theatres, they were allowed to open their doors as long as they followed strict social distancing rules. Long queues stretched outside railway stations in major Indian cities as authorities eased a nationwide lockdown despite a record daily rise in cases. Rail services, apart from the movement of some essential cargo, were halted in late March ahead of efforts to contain the virus that froze almost all economic activity. The family of a Covid-19 victim have called for an inquiry into the Champions League match between Liverpool v Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in March. Richard Mawson, 70, was \u201cfit and healthy\u201d before the match on 11 March, his wife Mary said.",
