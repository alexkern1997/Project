He was completely motivated in all he did in the law by politics.\u201d</p> \n   <p>That work ethic comes up repeatedly in interviews with those who know Starmer well. Georgia Gould, Labour leader of Camden council where Starmer is now the local MP, told BuzzFeed News: \u201cI say to him, \u2018It\u2019s alright. I can do this one. You can have a day off.\u2019 I don\u2019t know when he sleeps. He hates being late \u2014 he\u2019ll say to me, \u2018Georgia, we\u2019re gonna be late.

(His team points out that his complicated, detail-heavy Brexit brief has made it difficult for him to show much personality.) He gets mixed reviews from Tory MPs.</p> \n   <p>One cabinet minister told us: \u201cHe is by miles the best candidate. A Trot, yes, but a professional, and he\u2019ll be good in parliament.\u201d Another minister described him as the \u201cMichael Howard of the Labour party \u2013 a good stopgap\u201d.

Equivalence is not a permanent subscription, but a revocable privilege. What already applies to all countries outside the single market will also apply to Britain. If the United Kingdom deviates from the European rules, it must expect to lose access to the European financial market.</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong><br></strong></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e440fe88f0811db2faf64f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-12T14:48:27.007Z\">2.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rebecca-long-bailey\">Rebecca Long-Bailey</a>, Angela Rayner </strong>and<strong> Dawn Butler</strong> have backed a new trans rights charter that calls on Labour to expel \u201ctransphobic\u201d members and describes campaigns including Woman\u2019s Place UK as \u201ctrans-exclusionist hate groups\u201d, my colleague<strong> Rowena Mason</strong> reports.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/12/labour-leadership-row-over-support-for-trans-rights-charter\">Labour leadership: row over support for trans rights charter</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e4409bc8f086a28115aa628\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-12T14:20:59.817Z\">2.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>From HuffPost\u2019s <strong>Paul Waugh</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/paulwaugh/status/1227585126378414081\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">New: interview with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RLong_Bailey?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RLong_Bailey</a> in which she commits firmly to Labour's manifesto pledges on<br>- higher tax rates on the rich<br>- ending the gender pay gap by 2030<br>- net zero emissions by 2030<br>- immediate suspension of arms sales to Saudi/Israel<a href=\"https://t.co/gN53h6GLPd\">https://t.co/gN53h6GLPd</a></p>\u2014 Paul Waugh (@paulwaugh) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulwaugh/status/1227585126378414081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 12, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e44008f8f08e13324741ea0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-12T14:07:44.104Z\">2.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tory chair of Commons culture committee says BBC 'didn't quite understand' reasons behind Brexit</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Julian Knight,</strong> the Conservative MP recently elected as chair of the Commons culture committee, told the World at One that he thought the BBC\u2019s coverage of Brexit had been flawed.

As my colleague Heather Stewart reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/inside-labours-campaign-behind\">in an article</a> about Labour\u2019s general election campaign, when Corbyn was asked if he had managed to land a blow on Boris Johnson, he appeared horrified by the very notion. \u201cI\u2019m not a boxer!\u201d he replied.</p> \n  <p>Well, today Corbyn did go low \u2013 and it worked. In a question about the deportation of foreign offenders to Jamaica this week, including some who first came to the UK when they were children, he referred to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/apr/04/boris.london08\">Johnson\u2019s admission that he had taken cocaine in his youth</a>, as well as the fact that when Johnson was a journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/14/journalist-stuart-collier-boris-johnson-phone-call-darius-guppy-demands-apology\">he also agreed to provide information to a friend that would help him to arrange to have a reporter beaten up</a>. (The conversation was recorded, and subsequently broadcast, although Johnson says he never did supply the information requested, and the planned assault never happened.) Corbyn asked Johnson:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If there was a case of a young white boy with blond hair who later dabbled in class A drugs and conspired with a friend to beat up a journalist, would he deport that boy, or is it one rule for young black boys from the Caribbean and another for white boys from the United States?</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>(Johnson was born in the United States, and he had joint citizenship until only a few years ago, when he gave it up reportedly so that he was no longer liable for US tax.)</p> \n  <p>It would be wrong to say that the Corbyn question felled Johnson in one go. He responded by accusing Corbyn of demeaning himself, and going on to defend the deportations. But Johnson did appear embarrassed and discomforted; in PMQs terms, he took a hit. </p> \n  <p>Are there any wider lessons in this? Voters dislike gratuitous personal attacks on politicians, they appear to have close to zero interest in Johnson\u2019s unconventional love life, and during the election repeated Lib Dem claims that Johnson was a \u201cliar\u201d bounced off without doing any harm. But Corbyn\u2019s jibe today wasn\u2019t gratuitous (he was making a reasonable point about double standards). Generally Corbyn, and other opposition MPs, have found it all-but-impossible to puncture Johnson\u2019s iron-clad bonhomie, but perhaps this is how it can be done.</p> \n  <p>Otherwise the highlights from PMQs were probably Johnson\u2019s surprise decision to agree with Corbyn\u2019s point about the US extradition treaty being lopsided (at least, it seemed to come as a surprise to Corbyn - Tory libertarians have been going on about this for some years) and Johnson\u2019s attack on the pay rise for peers.

Yesterday Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s chief adviser, reportedly told colleagues that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/feb/11/hs2-boris-johnson-buses-brexit-eu-chief-gently-mocks-johnsons-backing-for-possible-australian-trade-model-live-news?page=with:block-5e4296a78f0811db2faf5787#block-5e4296a78f0811db2faf5787\">the decision was \u201ca perfect symbol of the British state\u2019s dysfunction\u201d</a> and the Times says Johnson himself was also \u201cfurious\u201d with the ruling. But Cox, who is expected to be sacked in tomorrow\u2019s reshuffle, urged his judicial colleagues to ignore some of the more provocative briefing coming out of No 10. He confirmed that the commission would consider the extent to which judges were now taking decisions that should more properly be taken by politicians. But it would proceed carefully, he said. He explained:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think that will require careful examination, measured, calibrated examination. There will be no rush, headlong, into impetuous reform. It will have to be examined quite carefully to see what are the proper contours and the proper balance between those who are elected decision makers and those who are not.</p> \n   <p>So colourful comments reported from those inside the government, whether they are accurate or not, I don\u2019t think are going to affect the calm and deliberative way that this government will embark on the process of this review ...</p> \n   <p>There is going to be no headlong rush to curtail either the independence of the judiciary, or the legitimate function of the judiciary in making certain that the rule of law is upheld by the government. The question of reform here will be one that we will need to go into with great care.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He floated that idea of letting a parliamentary committee interview candidates for the supreme court. </strong>The government was not in favour of having politically appointed judges, he said, describing that proposal as \u201ccompletely off the table\u201d. But he said the proposed constitution commission might need to look at a system that operates in Canada, where a parliamentary committee interviews candidates for the supreme court. In the UK a joint committee of the Commons and the Lords could perform that same role, he suggested. He said there would have to be rules about what questions might be asked. He stressed that he was not personally advocating this system, but he said the commission might have to consider it, and he said the chief justice of Canada had recently described the system as indispensable to public confidence. He explained:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are not going to be talking about a party-politically appointed set out judges.</p> \n   <p>However, I think there is a case for looking at how supreme court judges are appointed ... I would oppose US-style hearings. But I have to say that one of the things that is worth looking at in my view is how it\u2019s done in Canada. In Canada now, for appointments to the supreme court, there is a committee of the Canadian parliament that will carry out interviews. In our country it could be a joint committee of the House of Lords and the House of Commons under clear guidance. There would be rules as to the questions that could be asked. </p> \n   <p>But what it would lend, potentially, is transparency to a position which, people have seen, has enormous power.</p> \n   <p>Now I\u2019m not saying that that is something that I would support. But it\u2019s something, I think, that the commission may need to look at ...

The <strong>Resolution Foundation</strong>, a thinktank specialising in policy affecting living standards and inequality, has today published a study of what is now the \u201cblue wall\u201d - the 50 seats that the Conservatives won from Labour in the North East and West, Yorkshire and the Humber, the East and West Midlands, and Wales.</p> \n  <p>And there is at least one finding that ought to cause some concern in No 10. According to the Resolution Foundation, people in those constituencies that \u201clent\u201d Johnson their vote are likely to lose out disproportionately from the switch to universal credit. The report says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Alongside other parts of the North, Midlands and Wales, the blue wall is more exposed to changes in welfare policy. Working-age benefit spending in the blue wall, at \u00a32,300 per working-age person, is much higher than in other Conservative areas (\u00a31,600) and only slightly lower than in Labour seats (\u00a32,500). This is driven by disability spending and in-work benefit spending, which are similar to levels in Labour areas. As a result, the blue wall will have been more exposed to the impact of reduced working-age welfare generosity in recent years, compared to other Conservative areas. </p> \n   <p>Universal credit (UC) \u2013 the government\u2019s flagship welfare reform \u2013 will also have different impacts on those living in different regions of the country. Across the North of England, the Midlands, and Wales, 48 per cent of eventual UC claimants will be made worse off by the switch from legacy benefits to UC. This compares to 41 per cent of claimants being made worse off across the East, the South East and London, and reflects factors including UC\u2019s (well-intentioned) relative generosity towards working families with high rents having less impact in areas where rents are low.</p> \n   <p>Some specific examples of families based on rents and earnings levels in different political geographies bring this point home. An illustrative young single parent in the blue wall working 18 hours per week is likely to be \u00a3280 per year worse off under UC compared to legacy benefits, compared to \u00a3170 worse off in other Conservative areas and \u00a3180 worse off in Labour seats. A dual earning, working couple with children is likely to be \u00a3530 better off under UC in the Blue Wall, whereas a similar family is set to be \u00a32,760 better off in other Conservative seats. </p> \n   <p>Overall, the blue wall\u2019s relatively high exposure to benefit cuts, and higher likelihood of losing out from the switch to UC, mean it represents a very different welfare environment to that in other Conservative areas. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>You can read the report in full <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/app/uploads/2020/02/Painting-the-town-blue.pdf\">here (pdf) </a>and the Resolution Foundation\u2019s summary <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/publications/painting-the-towns-blue/\">here. </a>And here is a write-up from my colleague <strong>Richard Partington.</strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/12/labour-red-wall-seats-hit-hardest-by-wage-stagnation-report-finds\">Labour 'red wall' seats hit hardest by wage stagnation, report finds</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> \n  <p><em>9am:</em> Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, speaks at an event at the Institute for Government.</p> \n  <p><em>Morning: </em>Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, publishes a written statement on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/11/ofcom-to-be-given-role-of-policing-online-platforms\">the government\u2019s plans to give Ofcom a role in policing online platforms.</a></p> \n  <p><em>12pm: </em>Boris Johnson faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs.</p> \n  <p><em>After 12.30pm:</em> MPs begin debating the emergency terror bill, the terrorist offenders (restriction of early release) bill.</p> \n  <p>As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

Here\u2019s a wrap-up of tonight\u2019s hustings from my colleague, Heather Stewart: And here\u2019s a comprehensive summary of the day\u2019s earlier events. Here\u2019s a little reaction from Labour figures to this evening\u2019s hustings: Closing, Thornberry says the fight is going to be long and the next Labour leader needs to be campaigner with stamina. And she says the party needs to offer hope if it\u2019s going to form the next government Long Bailey says she was devastated by the defeat because she knew what it would do to Labour communities and says the party should focus on the green new deal and its industrial strategy in order to help those communities. Starmer says he came into politics to change lives and that it\u2019s impossible to do so in opposition. He says he will bring the party together because if it continues to direct its fire inward, it will enver win. Nandy says the election result was a long time coming and that Labour must stop facing \u201cboth ways on the biggest issues of the day\u201d, adding: \u201cNo more promises we know we can\u2019t keep.\u201d On the issue of transphobia, Long Bailey says she is a firm believer in self-identification. But she steadfastly refuses to say whether or not someone who was unwilling to say a person can identify their own gender. Thornberry believes that hate needs to be removed from the debate and that trans men are men and trans women are women. Nandy says people who go out of their way to abuse other people should not be in the Labour party and cites the example of one of her own constituents she says she wants to protect. Starmer adds that trans rights are human rights, saying they should be protected. Starmer and Nandy agree that the in-out Brexit debate is over and Labour\u2019s best chance is to work on the basis that the UK will remain outside the European Union, but cooperate closely with the bloc. It seems Lisa Nandy\u2019s performance is going down well. Or badly, depending on your point of view. On immigration, each of the candidates commits to welcoming inward immigration, saying the country benefits as a whole. It\u2019s suggested to the candidates that Boris Johnson has taken their territory with infrastructure investment promises. Which of his policies would Nandy steal? She says she\u2019s glad to see the investment but believes he\u2019s making the decisions in Westminster, whereas she would allow people to make decisions for their own areas. Is Johnson not doing a good job? Starmer says the prime minister cannot be trusted because he has regularly broken promises in the past. Long Bailey says there are major regional inequalities within the UK and she would focus on the country\u2019s industrial policy to address the problems they cause. Thornberry says the promises sound good but that they will prove to be \u201chot air\u201d, which is when Labour will need to make their case. All four contenders indicated they remained committed to scrapping university tuition fees and renationalising the water and electricity industries \u2013 pledges that were in the 2019 Labour manifesto. But they jointly rowed back on scrapping private schools and introducing a four day week, two other controversial policies put forward during Corbyn\u2019s leadership. Thornberry has claimed Long Bailey failed to push for tougher action on antisemitism in the Labour party. During a tense moment in a Labour leadership debate, Thonrberry said she and Starmer had called for the shadow cabinet to be more involved in tackling the party\u2019s antisemitism problem. But Thornberry claimed she did not remember Long-Bailey doing the same. Thornberry said: I think it would be right to say that the record shows that I have regularly called out antisemitism in my party. It also should be said that Keir and I were both in the shadow cabinet and would regularly, the two of us, call for regular reports to the shadow cabinet. Asked whether she was saying Long Bailey didn\u2019t demand such a role for leader Corbyn\u2019s top team, Thornberry added: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think Rebecca did, but Keir and I did.\u201d In a terse exchange, Long-Bailey responded: \u201cI did, I think you\u2019ll find.\u201d But Thorberry added: \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t remember.\u201d Long Bailey said she would sign up to the 10 pledges on tackling antisemitism that had been set by the Board of Deputies of British Jews if she becomes leader. As leader I will be signing up to the 10 pledges. I would expect my shadow cabinet and all those within it, all our members and MPs within Parliament to follow my lead on that. Starmer added: If you\u2019re not prepared to fight anti-Semitism, you shouldn\u2019t be in the shadow cabinet. Nandy, the only backbencher left in the race, said there should be \u201cno one in the Labour Party that doesn\u2019t defend the right of Israel to exist\u201d. Thornberry says she believes those members of the UK\u2019s Jewish community who felt they would be unsafe under a Labour government were wrong but says the fact they did feel that way was an indictment of everyone in the party. Nandy says the party made promises the public did not believe it would keep at the last election, saying voters are more savvy than Labour has given them credit for. One of the things we did in the last election was we made promises we simply couldn\u2019t keep. We cannot go round as a party making promises to nationalise everything, to slash or get rid of tuition fees but we hadn\u2019t got a clue how we would do it and how we would pay for it. People are smarter than that. We have to be honest with them. Starmer says the party leadership came up on doorsteps prior to the election, as did the issue of Labour antisemitism. He says there were numerous causes and Jeremy Corbyn cannot be held responsible for four consecutive election defeats. Long Bailey acknowledges Labour has not tackled antisemitism adequately and cannot stop apologising for it. She also blames Brexit for causing trust issues and says other problems, such as infighting, contributed. Kicking off the debate, the presenter asks which of the contenders saw the election defeat coming. Emily Thornberry and Lisa Nandy say they did. The former says she warned the outgoing leader, Jeremy Corbyn, the Tories had a carefully crafted plan and would win. Rebecca Long Bailey says voters were preoccupied by Brexit and Labour was not listening to those who thought the party was betraying the Brexit referendum. Keir Starmer says no one saw the scale of the defeat coming. Lisa Nandy claims MPs people in seats such as hers saw their base crumbling in successive elections and that the party\u2019s response has been to narrow its debate to issues such as how to go into or not go into hypothetical wars in future, rather than on matters that have more direct day-to-day effects on people in the UK. We\u2019ll be covering the Labour leadership hustings when they start in about five minutes. Keir Starmer, Lisa Nandy, Rebecca Long Bailey and Emily Thornberry debate each other on BBC Newsnight at 10.30pm. Jeremy Corbyn launched a scathing personal attack on Boris Johnson over the way black and white children connected to class A drugs are treated by the government in the wake of the deportation of ex-offenders to Jamaica. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, has floated the idea of letting a parliamentary committee interview candidates for the supreme court. (See 11am.) The European parliament has called on Michel Barnier to keep Britain permanently tied to its employment, environment and competition laws as the price for maintaining free trade with the EU. As Daniel Boffey reports, in a resolution adopted by 543 votes to 39, with 69 abstentions, MEPs said there needed to be \u201cdynamic alignment\u201d with EU standards across a range of issues. As MEPs gave their seal of approval for the maximalist position, the European commission for the first time wielded its powers under the withdrawal agreement to order the British government to change its domestic law, despite the country having left the EU two weeks ago. Under the terms of the transition period, during which the UK stays in the single market and customs union but none of Brussels\u2019s decision-making institutions, EU law continues to be superior to UK national law. The government was given two months by the commission to amend a levy on heavy trucks on which UK-registered drivers can get a discount. The EU\u2019s executive branch said the levy discriminated against those based in member states. MPs have given the terrorist offenders (restriction of early release bill) an unopposed second reading. They are debating its committee stage now, and it is due to clear the Commons by the end of the day. The emergency bill, drawn up after the Streatham attack, stops the automatic early release of terrorist offenders. Opening the debate, Robert Buckland, the justice secretary, dismissed a suggestion that it would lead to a court challenge at the European court of human rights because article 7 of the European convention on human rights forbids \u201ca heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed\u201d. Buckland said: I\u2019m not going to anticipate litigation in domestic courts or indeed in Strasbourg. But I will say this now and I will repeat it for the benefit of the record that it is my firm view that this bill does not engage the provisions of article 7 of the European convention because it relates to the way in which the sentence is administered not a change in the nature of penalty itself. Ofcom will be put in charge of regulating the internet, the government has announced, with executives at internet firms potentially facing substantial fines or even prison sentences if they fail to protect users from \u201charmful and illegal content\u201d online. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has accused Boris Johnson of \u201cputting the existence of the United Kingdom under threat\u201d. Speaking ahead of a seminar in Westminster tonight on the topic of democratising society, he said: The antipathy in Scotland to Boris Johnson\u2019s regime, alongside the Irish election results are putting the existence of the United Kingdom under threat. Brexit also illustrated the depth of feeling many have at the lack of control over their lives. Radical constitutional reform is needed to redistribute power in our country. HS2 could run slower north of Birmingham in order to cut costs, Grant Shapps has said as he criticised the project\u2019s \u201cobsession\u201d with cutting journey times. The government could ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars in 2032, three years earlier than previously suggested, the transport secretary has said. The government has earmarked \u00a31bn for safe cycling and walking routes in the next five years \u2013 not \u00a3350m, as Boris Johnson mistakenly told parliament in what one expert called \u201ca car crash of an announcement\u201d, the Guardian has learned. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Here is the Guardian\u2019s latest Politics Weekly podcast. Heather Stewart is joined by Anand Menon, Ailbhe Rea and Paul Harrison to discuss what to expect from tomorrow\u2019s cabinet reshuffle. Plus, Rory Carroll tells us what\u2019s next for Irish politics after Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s shock domination, and Gwyn Topham gives us the latest on HS2. This morning Jim Pickard at the Financial Times reported that the government was keeping open the option of holding the COP 26 climate change conference at the ExCel centre in London, instead of in Glasgow as planned. As Pickard\u2019s FT colleague Sebastian Payne reports, at the afternoon Downing Street briefing the prime minister\u2019s spokesman did not deny the story. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, has reacted angrily, saying the Scottish government is fully committed to the summit and accusing Boris Johnson of \u201cplaying politics\u201d over the venue. There are two long articles out today about the favourites in the Labour leadership contest. Both are worth reading. Rebecca Long-Bailey tells HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh, among other things in a wide-ranging interview, how she came to join the Labour party. Although she was political in her youth, Long-Bailey didn\u2019t join Labour until 2010 when she was in her 30s. Labour\u2019s defeat prompted her to join, as it is prompting many following the 2019 defeat. But she reveals that the real spur was more close to home. \u201cMy mum had retired, and she was driving my dad around the bend at home because she didn\u2019t have any hobbies and because she\u2019s only ever been into politics and watching the news, she didn\u2019t do like knitting or like crafts and things like that. \u201cSo I said to her, \u2018We\u2019ve got to get you a hobby. Why don\u2019t we both join the Labour party and I\u2019ll come to some meetings with you?\u2019 I was living near my mum and dad at the time. And I said, \u2018I\u2019ll go and then when you\u2019ve made friends I\u2019ll leave you to it.\u2019 \u201cAnd we went to that first meeting, and I remember there was one member there, who said how he thought it was a really good idea to means-test hospital meals. And a few other people in the meeting went, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s really good, if you can afford to pay you should afford to pay.\u2019 And I could feel the anger building up inside [me]. \u201cThis is how far we\u2019ve come in five years you see. I remember driving back from the meeting and saying to my mum, \u2018I know I said I was gonna leave you to it, but unless I get involved and sort this out then we\u2019re all doomed.\u2019\u201d Emily Ashton has profiled Sir Keir Starmer in a long and detail-rich article for BuzzFeed that features contributions from people who have known him for years. One theme that emerges is his work ethic. Ashton says: [Charlie] Falconer, then a commercial barrister, said Starmer was a \u201cvery intense, committed, slightly isolated figure\u201d when they first met. \u201cHe\u2019s not a particularly clubbable figure; he is a man alone,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is the real deal \u2014 every time you would speak to Keir, he would be engaged in a particular cause. He was completely motivated in all he did in the law by politics.\u201d That work ethic comes up repeatedly in interviews with those who know Starmer well. Georgia Gould, Labour leader of Camden council where Starmer is now the local MP, told BuzzFeed News: \u201cI say to him, \u2018It\u2019s alright. I can do this one. You can have a day off.\u2019 I don\u2019t know when he sleeps. He hates being late \u2014 he\u2019ll say to me, \u2018Georgia, we\u2019re gonna be late. We can\u2019t be late.\u2019\u201d Some MPs think Starmer\u2019s dedication to his work will make him a dangerous opponent for laidback Johnson, while others dismiss him as lacking in personality and charm. (His team points out that his complicated, detail-heavy Brexit brief has made it difficult for him to show much personality.) He gets mixed reviews from Tory MPs. One cabinet minister told us: \u201cHe is by miles the best candidate. A Trot, yes, but a professional, and he\u2019ll be good in parliament.\u201d Another minister described him as the \u201cMichael Howard of the Labour party \u2013 a good stopgap\u201d. A new Tory MP in northern England said Starmer wouldn\u2019t connect with his constituents: \u201cHe\u2019s almost embarrassed of everything he has achieved \u2013 own it, man!\u201d Another Tory MP said bluntly: \u201cEd Miliband with a knighthood.\u201d The vote today in the European parliament for its resolution on the UK-EU trade talks (see 11.47am) means there will be no special treatment for the City of London, an MEP has claimed. In a statement after the vote Sven Giegold, economic policy spokesman for the Greens/European Free Alliance group in the parliament, said: The time for special treatment of the UK is over. The British government\u2019s attempt to give its London financial centre permanent and comprehensive access to the European financial system for decades is audacious. The EU will not let the decision as to which British financial market rules are compatible with European rules be taken out of its hands. Equivalence is not a permanent subscription, but a revocable privilege. What already applies to all countries outside the single market will also apply to Britain. If the United Kingdom deviates from the European rules, it must expect to lose access to the European financial market. Rebecca Long-Bailey, Angela Rayner and Dawn Butler have backed a new trans rights charter that calls on Labour to expel \u201ctransphobic\u201d members and describes campaigns including Woman\u2019s Place UK as \u201ctrans-exclusionist hate groups\u201d, my colleague Rowena Mason reports. From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh Julian Knight, the Conservative MP recently elected as chair of the Commons culture committee, told the World at One that he thought the BBC\u2019s coverage of Brexit had been flawed. There had been \u201cquite widespread disquiet over certain parts of the BBC\u2019s coverage, for example over the Brexit referendum\u201d, he said. Asked if he thought it was biased against Brexit, Knight said: Well, I think that many people would say that they felt that the BBC maybe perhaps lost sight of the argument for those who wanted to leave. I speak as someone who campaigned for remain. But there are many people probably who felt that the BBC in its coverage didn\u2019t quite understand the cross-currents that were going on in society. Asked if he was a supporter of the continuation of the licence fee as a means of funding the BBC, Knight would only say that he was a supporter of public service broadcasting. He said that he wanted the culture committee to help to map out the future for public sector broadcasting. But he also expressed reservations about turning the BBC into a subscription service, saying he was concerned about this leading to viewers being excluded. And this is what Boris Johnson said at PMQs about the extradition treaty with the US being unfair. He was responding to Jeremy Corbyn, who said: \u201cThis lopsided treaty means the US can request extradition in circumstances that Britain cannot.\u201d Johnson replied: To be frank, I think [Corbyn] has a point in his characterisation of our extradition arrangements with the United States and I do think there are elements of that relationship that are imbalanced. I certainly think it is worth looking at. In the Commons on Monday the Labour MP Janet Daby also suggested that it was hypocritical for the government to be deporting people to Jamaica for drug offences when \u201cwe have a prime minister who has said that he took cocaine, which is a class A drug\u201d. She went on: \u201cIs it one rule for some and another for others?\u201d Kevin Foster, the Home Office minister who was responding to an urgent question on the deportations, said: It is safe to say that possession would not meet the threshold for deportation set in 2007. Here are the key exchanges between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson in which Corbyn suggested Johnson\u2019s own drug-using made the deportation to the Caribbean hypocritical. In his first question Corbyn asked: Does the prime minister think that someone who came to this country at the age of five and was the victim of county lines grooming and compelled to carry drugs released five years ago and never re-offended deserves to be deported? Johnson replied: I think the whole country would agree that, while I cannot comment on individual cases, it is entirely right that foreign national offenders should be deported from this country in accordance with the law. Then Corbyn went on: The government has learned absolutely nothing from the Windrush scandal. This cruel and callous government is trying to mislead the British people into thinking its solely deporting foreign nationals who are guilty of murder, rape and other very serious offences. This is clearly not the case. Take the case of a young black boy who came to the country aged five and is now being deported after serving time for a drugs offence. If there was a case of a young white boy with blond hair who later dabbled in class A drugs and conspired with a friend to beat up a journalist, would he deport that boy, or is it one rule for young black boys from the Caribbean and another for white boys from the United States? And Johnson replied: I think quite frankly that Mr Corbyn demeans himself and by the way he besmirches the reputation of the Windrush generation who came to this country to work in our public services, to teach our children in this country, to make lives better for people in this country. He has no right to conflate them with those foreign national offenders that we are deporting today. Many politicians are fond of quoting the Michelle Obama slogan: \u201cWhen they go low, we go high\u201d, and it could have been tailor-made for Jeremy Corbyn, who throughout his leadership of the Labour party has mostly stuck to his principle of never engaging in personal attacks. As my colleague Heather Stewart reported in an article about Labour\u2019s general election campaign, when Corbyn was asked if he had managed to land a blow on Boris Johnson, he appeared horrified by the very notion. \u201cI\u2019m not a boxer!\u201d he replied. Well, today Corbyn did go low \u2013 and it worked. In a question about the deportation of foreign offenders to Jamaica this week, including some who first came to the UK when they were children, he referred to Johnson\u2019s admission that he had taken cocaine in his youth, as well as the fact that when Johnson was a journalist he also agreed to provide information to a friend that would help him to arrange to have a reporter beaten up. (The conversation was recorded, and subsequently broadcast, although Johnson says he never did supply the information requested, and the planned assault never happened.) Corbyn asked Johnson: If there was a case of a young white boy with blond hair who later dabbled in class A drugs and conspired with a friend to beat up a journalist, would he deport that boy, or is it one rule for young black boys from the Caribbean and another for white boys from the United States? (Johnson was born in the United States, and he had joint citizenship until only a few years ago, when he gave it up reportedly so that he was no longer liable for US tax.) It would be wrong to say that the Corbyn question felled Johnson in one go. He responded by accusing Corbyn of demeaning himself, and going on to defend the deportations. But Johnson did appear embarrassed and discomforted; in PMQs terms, he took a hit. Are there any wider lessons in this? Voters dislike gratuitous personal attacks on politicians, they appear to have close to zero interest in Johnson\u2019s unconventional love life, and during the election repeated Lib Dem claims that Johnson was a \u201cliar\u201d bounced off without doing any harm. But Corbyn\u2019s jibe today wasn\u2019t gratuitous (he was making a reasonable point about double standards). Generally Corbyn, and other opposition MPs, have found it all-but-impossible to puncture Johnson\u2019s iron-clad bonhomie, but perhaps this is how it can be done. Otherwise the highlights from PMQs were probably Johnson\u2019s surprise decision to agree with Corbyn\u2019s point about the US extradition treaty being lopsided (at least, it seemed to come as a surprise to Corbyn - Tory libertarians have been going on about this for some years) and Johnson\u2019s attack on the pay rise for peers. (See 12.22pm.) Surprisingly, though, Johnson faced almost no questions about Brexit \u2013 even though only two days ago Michael Gove confirmed that there will be border checks on imports from the EU, contradicting repeated claims to the contrary made by Johnson and Gove when they were running Vote Leave. At just the point when Brexiters need to be held to account, MPs seem to be losing interest. The DUP\u2019s Ian Paisley asks the PM to end the witch hunt against police officers in Northern Ireland. Johnson says he is well aware of this point. He says the government wants to end unjustified prosecutions. Lee Anderson, a Conservative, asks if the PM agrees that Labour\u2019s PFI schemes, like the ones that build a hospital in Ashfied, were a scandal. Johnson does agree. He says these show how badly Labour runs the economy. Seema Malhotra, the Labour MP, asks if the PM regrets cuts to Sure Start. Johnson says record sums are now going into early years education. Under this government there is \u201crobust, strong dynamic economy\u201d that can fund these measures. Martin Vickers, a Conservative, says HS2 will not help Cleethorpes. Will Johnson act to ensure Cleethorpes get a direct service to Kings Cross. Johnson says the voice of Cleethorpes has been heard. Jacob Young, a Conservative, asks about knife crime in Redcar. Johnson says the government is putting police more on the streets to address this. Sir Ed Davey, the Lib Dem acting leader, asks about bereavement support, and children who lost out because their parents were not married. The courts have ruled against this. When will the government respond, so that bereaved children do not lose out. Johnson says Davey is right to draw attention to this injustice and \u201cwe will remedy it.\u201d Robert Courts, a Conservative, asks Johnson to pay tribute to the professionalism of Public Health England in dealing with coronavirus. Johnson agrees. He says the NHS has done an outstanding job. Asked about the Heathrow third runway, Johnson says he waits to see whether the various legal cases under way allow the promoters of the scheme to show that they can meet their obligations on air quality and noise pollution. The SNP\u2019s Richard Thomson asks about the intelligence and security committee report into Russia. Johnson says it will be published when the ISC is reconvened. But those of a suspicious frame of mind will be disappointed, he says. The SNP\u2019s Kirsten Oswald says the daily allowance for peers is due to rise to \u00a3323. Is that the levelling up that the PM talks about? Johnson says he hates to agree with the SNP, but he does find this decision \u201codd\u201d. But it is a decision for the House of Lords, he says. Johnson criticises House of Lords over increased daily allowance for peers. Asked about the flooding in the Calder Valley, Johnson pays tribute to the work of the emergency services and he agrees to visit the constituency. Labour\u2019s Gareth Thomas says his local hospital has not met its four-hour A&amp;E target since 2014. Johnson says the highest number of people ever attended A&amp;E last month, 2 million. The demand is exceptional. The government is responding with a record investment, he says. The SNP\u2019s Deidre Block says a minister said last week that substandard food would be allowed into the UK from the US. Johnson says the UK has and will continue to have the highest standards for food. Labour\u2019s Alex Norris asks about violence against shopworkers. Johnson says he will agree to meet victims. We should not tolerate violence, he says. And so it is \u201cparadoxical\u201d that Corbyn opposes the deportation of serious offenders, he claims. Ian Levy, a Conservative, asks if the PM will visit Blyth to see how suitable it would be for a freeport. Johnson says Levy has made his point, but the allocation of freeports will be made in a fair way. Labour\u2019s Sharon Hodgson asks about plans to build a gasification plant in Sunderland. As a frequent visitor to Sunderland, Johnson must share her concerns, she jokes. Johnson says he will look into this. Labour\u2019s Vicky Foxcroft says the youth violent commission will shortly publish a report saying short-term solutions do not work. Will the PM attend the launch? Johnson says you need to do both (ie, address short-term and long-term solutions). He says he is putting 20.000 more police on the streets. Labour opposes giving the police extra powers, he says. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says in Syria refugee children are literally freezing to death. Johnson says the UK leads the world in supporting humanitarian relief efforts in Syria. It has spent \u00a33.2bn on this. Blackford says he asked about children. He says the government has accepted President Assad\u2019s rule in Syria. Is Johnson saying the UK government is washing its hands of the Syrian people. Johnson says Blackford should consult his memory. The British government has continually called for Assad to stand down. Paul Howell, a Conservative, asks about the government\u2019s plans to put Ofcom in charge of regulating the internet. Johnson says he wants to make the UK the safest place to be online. Corbyn says the extradition relationship with the US is not balanced. Will Johnson make it so? Johnson says Corbyn has a point. That is worth looking at. But he says this is not relevant to the Anne Sacoolas case. Corbyn says the extradition treaty is relevant. He turns to Julian Assange, and says he is facing deportation to the US for exposing war crimes. Should this deportation be opposed? Johnson says he won\u2019t comment on any individual case. But he does support upholding the rights of journalists and whisteblowers. Corbyn asks if Anne Sacoolas is being protected because she worked for the CIA. Johnson says the government wants Sacoolas to return to the UK. Corbyn asks if Johnson will sack the foreign secretary for protecting her. Johnson says the government was not notified about Sacooolas\u2019 role. Jeremy Corbyn also expresses his sympathy for flood victims. And he expresses sympathy for coronavirus vicitims. He says Chinese people are suffering appalling levels of racism. Does the PM think someone who came to the UK at the age of five, who was made to carry drugs, and who was released five years ago deserves to be deported. Johnson says he will not comment on individual cases, but foreign offenders should be removed, he says. Corbyn says Johnson has leant nothing from Windrush. He quotes a case of a black boy who came to this country at five and got involved in drugs. What would happen if it were a white boy, with blond hair, who later took drugs and conspired to have a journalist beaten up, would he feel the same way? Johnson says Corbyn demeans himself. He says Corbyn has no right to compared those being deported to the Windrush victims. Julian Lewis, a Conservative, says the last combined security and defence review was bound by fiscal neutrality. That meant every extra pound for cyber security took money from conventional defence. Will the PM ensure that does not happen again? Johnson says the integrated review he is holding will be the deepest since the war. Defence and security will be amply provided for, he says. Boris Johnson starts by expressing sympathy for those affected by the weekend flooding. PMQs is about to start. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. Shami Chakrabarti, the shadow attorney general, has criticised the idea floated by Geoffrey Cox for MPs and peers to interview candidates for the supreme court, the Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom reports. A public inquiry is being launched into the death of Jermaine Baker, who was shot by a police marksman during an attempt to free a prisoner, the home secretary, Priti Patel, has announced in a written statement. As the Press Association reports, Baker, 28, from Tottenham, north London, died from a single gunshot wound as the Metropolitan Police foiled a break-out attempt near Wood Green Crown Court on December 11 2015. Here is my colleague Alex Hern\u2019s story about the government\u2019s plan to put Ofcom in charge of regulating the internet. Yesterday the European parliament debated a lengthy resolution about the UK-EU trade talks saying that, if the UK wants a free trade deal, it should sign up to robust level playing field commitments. Although the debate was yesterday, the vote took place this morning. As the BBC\u2019s Adam Fleming reports, it passed. The resolution, which runs to 103 paragraphs, is here. My colleague Jennifer Rankin summarised it in a story last week. Here is an extract from what the resolution says: For an FTA to truly promote the EU\u2019s interests, the following objectives should be included in the negotiating directives: (i) a level playing field is to be guaranteed through robust commitments and enforceable provisions on competition and state aid, relevant tax matters (including the fight against tax evasion, avoidance and money laundering), full respect of the social and labour standards (including equivalent levels of protection and safeguards against social dumping), environmental protection and climate change related standards, promotion of the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals, a high-level protection of consumers and sustainable development; the provisions should ensure that standards are not lowered, while empowering both parties to modify commitments over time to lay down higher standards or include additional areas; commitments and provisions should be enforceable by autonomous interim measures, a solid dispute settlement mechanism and remedies, with a view to dynamic alignment. And here Fleming\u2019s summary of the resolution. Here are the main points from the Geoffrey Cox interview and Q&amp;A at the Institute for Government this morning. Cox, the attorney general, sought to quash fears that No 10 is planning \u201cimpetuous\u201d moves to curtail the judiciary. The Conservative election manifesto committed the government to setting up a constitution commission to consider, among other things, limiting the scope of judicial review and today\u2019s Times (paywall) claims the government wants to move quickly in the light of the way judicial review halted the deportation of 25 offenders to Jamaica yesterday. Yesterday Dominic Cummings, the PM\u2019s chief adviser, reportedly told colleagues that the decision was \u201ca perfect symbol of the British state\u2019s dysfunction\u201d and the Times says Johnson himself was also \u201cfurious\u201d with the ruling. But Cox, who is expected to be sacked in tomorrow\u2019s reshuffle, urged his judicial colleagues to ignore some of the more provocative briefing coming out of No 10. He confirmed that the commission would consider the extent to which judges were now taking decisions that should more properly be taken by politicians. But it would proceed carefully, he said. He explained: I think that will require careful examination, measured, calibrated examination. There will be no rush, headlong, into impetuous reform. It will have to be examined quite carefully to see what are the proper contours and the proper balance between those who are elected decision makers and those who are not. So colourful comments reported from those inside the government, whether they are accurate or not, I don\u2019t think are going to affect the calm and deliberative way that this government will embark on the process of this review ... There is going to be no headlong rush to curtail either the independence of the judiciary, or the legitimate function of the judiciary in making certain that the rule of law is upheld by the government. The question of reform here will be one that we will need to go into with great care. He floated that idea of letting a parliamentary committee interview candidates for the supreme court. The government was not in favour of having politically appointed judges, he said, describing that proposal as \u201ccompletely off the table\u201d. But he said the proposed constitution commission might need to look at a system that operates in Canada, where a parliamentary committee interviews candidates for the supreme court. In the UK a joint committee of the Commons and the Lords could perform that same role, he suggested. He said there would have to be rules about what questions might be asked. He stressed that he was not personally advocating this system, but he said the commission might have to consider it, and he said the chief justice of Canada had recently described the system as indispensable to public confidence. He explained: We are not going to be talking about a party-politically appointed set out judges. However, I think there is a case for looking at how supreme court judges are appointed ... I would oppose US-style hearings. But I have to say that one of the things that is worth looking at in my view is how it\u2019s done in Canada. In Canada now, for appointments to the supreme court, there is a committee of the Canadian parliament that will carry out interviews. In our country it could be a joint committee of the House of Lords and the House of Commons under clear guidance. There would be rules as to the questions that could be asked. But what it would lend, potentially, is transparency to a position which, people have seen, has enormous power. Now I\u2019m not saying that that is something that I would support. But it\u2019s something, I think, that the commission may need to look at ... The chief justice of Canada has recently commented that he now thinks that it is indispensable to public confidence in the supreme court of Canada. He indicated that he would be interested in chairing the proposed commission. But he also said he would like to stay in post as attorney general. (See 9.36am.) He said cuts to the criminal justice system now needed to stop. (See 9.49am.) He said he was personally in favour of a British bill of rights. He would not say whether or not the constitution commission would consider the case for one, but he said he supported the idea because he felt the public did not feel it had ownership of the European convention on human rights, which forms the basis of the Human Rights Act. He defended the terrorist offenders (restriction of early release) bill being debated by MP today, saying there was \u201cno illegality\u201d in its provisions. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has confirmed that it is minded to put Ofcom in charge of policing online platforms. Here is the news release it has just issued, and here is the full document (a response to the consultation on the online harms white paper). And here is my colleague Kevin Rawlinson\u2019s overnight preview story. Cox says the government has no intention of subjecting judges to US-style confirmation hearings, or making them political appointments. Last week Boris Johnson said that the government\u2019s proposed ban on the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars would be brought forward from 2040 to 2035. But this morning Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said the ban could be imposed from 2032 - just 12 years away. In an interview with Radio 5 Live he said a consultation on the plan - part of the government\u2019s drive to tackle the climate crisis - would include 2032 as a possible cut-off date. Referring to the proposed ban on the sale of cars with internal combustion engines, he said: The prime minister last week has said we would like to do that by 2035 at the latest. We have said 2035 or even 2032. Shapps, who drives an electric car, said the government was investing around \u00a31.5bn infrastructure for the shift away from petrol and diesel. We have domestic car producers and we want to help them to transition so we are doing a lot of work - in fact tomorrow I\u2019m meeting with the car manufacturers on this very subject. As the Press Association reports, Shapps said there were \u201cnow more public charging locations than petrol stations in this country\u201d and \u201celectric cars are coming and we want to help the country transition\u201d. Q: Do you think you should have opposition figures on the proposed constitutional commission? Cox says the last time something similar happened was when Tony Blair was PM. He does not remember much consultation on those changes. But he says he does favour public consultation. The commission will be looking at specific changes, he says. It will not range broadly. The government has a mandate, he says. But he says it should consult. Q: Are you worried that the terrorist offenders (restriction of early release) bill being debated today sets a worrying precedent, because it will retrospectively alter the way sentences apply? Cox says he fully supports the bill. He says it is legal. He says it does not violate the Human Rights Act. There is a \u201cplain public interest\u201d in this change being made, he says. Q: Have cuts to the justice system gone to far? Cox says he does not think he can say this. He says cuts to the justice system were part of an overall economic policy that he thought was necessary. But he says the time has come now where the cuts have got to stop. He thinks that is happening. The largest ever settlement given to the Crown Prosecution Service was given to it last year. Q: Would it concern you if you lost your job because of your refusal to do party politics? Cox says it is up to the PM to choose his team. But if he were to lose his job, he does not think that that would be the reason. Q: The Conservative manifesto says you want to curtail judicial review. But if someone wins a judicial review case, does that not show that it is justified? Cox says there will be \u201cno headlong rush\u201d to curtail judicial review. But there is a concern that courts are increasingly taking decisions that should be taken by politicians. He says Lord Sumption, the former supreme court justice, has recently made this argument. He says it will be difficult getting this balance right. That is what the constitutional commission being set up by the government will look at. Cox is now taking questions. Q: Your speech sounded valedictory. Are you on your way out? (There has been a lot of speculation about Cox facing the sack in tomorrow\u2019s reshuffle.) Cox says ever since he took the attorney general\u2019s job he has expected to be out soon. For much of the time the government was in a minority. But if asked if he had had enough of the job that answer is \u201cabsolutely not\u201d, he says. Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, is speaking at an Institute for Government event. There is a live feed here. Catherine Haddon from the IfG has some highlights from what he has said so far. At the general election Boris Johnson dozens of so-called \u201cred wall\u201d seats that had previously been Labour for decades and he has made it clear that he believes that, as a result, the Conservative party he leads has been transformed. The Resolution Foundation, a thinktank specialising in policy affecting living standards and inequality, has today published a study of what is now the \u201cblue wall\u201d - the 50 seats that the Conservatives won from Labour in the North East and West, Yorkshire and the Humber, the East and West Midlands, and Wales. And there is at least one finding that ought to cause some concern in No 10. According to the Resolution Foundation, people in those constituencies that \u201clent\u201d Johnson their vote are likely to lose out disproportionately from the switch to universal credit. The report says: Alongside other parts of the North, Midlands and Wales, the blue wall is more exposed to changes in welfare policy. Working-age benefit spending in the blue wall, at \u00a32,300 per working-age person, is much higher than in other Conservative areas (\u00a31,600) and only slightly lower than in Labour seats (\u00a32,500). This is driven by disability spending and in-work benefit spending, which are similar to levels in Labour areas. As a result, the blue wall will have been more exposed to the impact of reduced working-age welfare generosity in recent years, compared to other Conservative areas. Universal credit (UC) \u2013 the government\u2019s flagship welfare reform \u2013 will also have different impacts on those living in different regions of the country. Across the North of England, the Midlands, and Wales, 48 per cent of eventual UC claimants will be made worse off by the switch from legacy benefits to UC. This compares to 41 per cent of claimants being made worse off across the East, the South East and London, and reflects factors including UC\u2019s (well-intentioned) relative generosity towards working families with high rents having less impact in areas where rents are low. Some specific examples of families based on rents and earnings levels in different political geographies bring this point home. An illustrative young single parent in the blue wall working 18 hours per week is likely to be \u00a3280 per year worse off under UC compared to legacy benefits, compared to \u00a3170 worse off in other Conservative areas and \u00a3180 worse off in Labour seats. A dual earning, working couple with children is likely to be \u00a3530 better off under UC in the Blue Wall, whereas a similar family is set to be \u00a32,760 better off in other Conservative seats. Overall, the blue wall\u2019s relatively high exposure to benefit cuts, and higher likelihood of losing out from the switch to UC, mean it represents a very different welfare environment to that in other Conservative areas. You can read the report in full here (pdf) and the Resolution Foundation\u2019s summary here. And here is a write-up from my colleague Richard Partington. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, speaks at an event at the Institute for Government. Morning: Nicky Morgan, the culture secretary, publishes a written statement on the government\u2019s plans to give Ofcom a role in policing online platforms. 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. After 12.30pm: MPs begin debating the emergency terror bill, the terrorist offenders (restriction of early release) bill. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Currently more than 100,000 Chinese students, who already have Australian student visas and were planning on commencing their studies this month, are stranded outside of Australia as a result of the government\u2019s 14-day travel ban from mainland China. On Wednesday, Australia\u2019s Global Reputation Taskforce \u2013 an emergency council of universities and education providers \u2013 met with education minister Dan Tehan and trade minister Simon Birmingham to discuss how they could limit the potential $8bn hit to the economy. Phil Honeywood, the chair of the taskforce, told Guardian Australia the ministers had secured new pathways for online courses \u2013 which would let isolated students keep their Australian enrolments. But he warned that a visa approval freeze means Australia could \u201cabsolutely lose out\u201d to competitors as Chinese students could easily \u201cgo down the road\u201d and obtain student visas for the US, the UK or Canada instead. The government has not yet announced if the travel ban will be extended by another fortnight, but education providers are \u201cnot optimistic\u201d and preparing for the worst. Honeywood, who is also the head of the International Education Association of Australia, said internet restrictions would be lifted for students, so they could reach university portals for lecture recordings and slides, among other sites. \u201cThere have been challenges over many years with online learning into China but the Chinese government has acknowledged that a more effectual arrangement is appropriate because of the isolation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to make good progress on online learning options into China.

[But] it is definitely a better situation than we were facing a couple of weeks ago.\u201d But the universities are concerned that new visa delays, combined with the travel ban, mean Australia could lose out to other countries. New student visa approvals have been frozen by the department of home affairs since 1 February, even for students who have already been accepted by Australian universities. Acting immigration minister Alan Tudge confirmed to the Australian that the department was \u201cnot finalising applications for individuals currently in mainland China\u201d due to \u201cenhanced border measures\u201d. International students contributed $34bn to the Australian economy last year.

Meanwhile, individual universities are also offering alternate course schedules for affected students. Melbourne\u2019s Monash University has already pushed back the start date of its semester by a week, while the ANU in Canberra has announced a semester during the traditional winter break to allow Chinese students to catch up on courses. Other universities, such as the University of New South Wales, have recently changed to a trimester system, and are encouraging students to defer their enrolment to the next trimester, which starts around the beginning of June. Honeywood said the universities \u201chave to abide by the chief medical officer\u2019s determination\u201d on the length of the travel ban, but that Australia\u2019s higher education sector was uniquely vulnerable to the delay. \u201cMore than other study destination country, we are caught by geographic location and the fact that our academic year starts at the start of the calendar year,\u201d he said. \u201cWhereas our main competitors, like Canada, the US and UK, their academic year doesn\u2019t start until later, in September.

There is a human right to return to your home country and countries cannot deprive you of this right in a way that is arbitrary. That is a principle enshrined in UN human rights, and is a basic international human right as observed through human instruments and the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),\u201d said Contesse.</p> <p>Samoa is a party to the ICCPR and acceded in 2008.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a fundamental right.

      "bodyText": "Samoa\u2019s decision to refuse entry into the country of eight of its citizens over coronavirus fears has been criticised as a violation of international law by a legal expert. Eight people were denied entry into Samoa over the weekend as they returned home from India, travelling through Singapore. The day before their flight, Singapore was added to a list of countries from which the Samoan government said it would not accept travellers until they had been quarantined for 14 days. The group included five patients who had been in India for medical treatment. They were returned to Nadi, Fiji, their last port of departure, along with 11 others and are now being quarantined at the Grand Melanesian hotel in Nadi. \u201cOn their way home, the Samoans had transited through Singapore, one of the six countries listed as a high risk from the coronavirus in the government\u2019s latest updated travel advisory issued over the weekend. As a result, they were denied entry and returned to Fiji last night,\u201d the Samoan government said in a statement on the weekend. Jorge Contesse, the director of the Center for Transnational Law at Rutgers Law School in the US, said the incident was potentially a violation of international law. \u201cIt is a violation of human rights international law for a country to deny the right of return of their own national. There is a human right to return to your home country and countries cannot deprive you of this right in a way that is arbitrary. That is a principle enshrined in UN human rights, and is a basic international human right as observed through human instruments and the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),\u201d said Contesse. Samoa is a party to the ICCPR and acceded in 2008. \u201cIt is a fundamental right. On the understanding that your country is the place you feel safe in, therefore it is unlawful for your own country to deny re-entry,\u201d said Contesse. In an editorial on Wednesday, the Fiji Sun newspaper condemned the decision, saying it was \u201cmorally wrong for Samoa to refuse entry to eight of its citizens\u201d, calling it \u201cunacceptable and tantamount to dereliction of duty by a sovereign state\u201d. The Samoan government has introduced stringent quarantine measures for the coronavirus \u2013 now called Covid-19 \u2013 as it is dealing with intense criticism of its handling the measles epidemic that killed more than 80 people in 2019. The government has also been criticised for its initial response to the coronavirus, with the Samoan government initially saying Samoan students would not be evacuated from Wuhan, though four were later evacuated on the Air New Zealand flight and are being quarantined in New Zealand. A parent of a Samoan student in Wuhan wrote on social media: \u201cWe must be the only country turning away our own citizens to be quarantined elsewhere. What is the difference of being quarantined in Fiji and not Faleolo hospital as been advertised? This is most bizarre.\u201d According to Contesse the violation is determined by the arbitrary nature of the decision to deny reentry. \u201cSamoa needs to show that the decision is not arbitrary \u2026 Were there any other alternatives, because under international law, if the country has an alternative \u2026 then the country must enact that measure first.\u201d \u201cBased on this case, the eight citizens could have been quarantined in Samoa, their own country or provided alternative measures that did not infringe on their rights of reentry. If there were any other ways for the Samoan government to protect its population they should have chosen that as a measure,\u201d said Contesse.",

The patient brings the total number in the UK to nine. She <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/12/britain-must-brace-itself-for-more-coronavirus-cases\">flew back to the capital from China</a> last weekend and officials are tracing relatives, friends and others she may have been in contact with including passengers on her flight.</p> \n<p>In China, the national total has risen to more than 1,300 deaths and nearly 60,000 cases, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/13/coronavirus-latest-updates-deaths-in-china-pass-1300-with-jump-in-cases-live-news\">Alison Rourke reports at our live blog</a>. The spike in deaths and cases was followed by a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/13/coronavirus-china-purges-regional-leaders-hours-after-spike-in-deaths-and-new-cases\">purge of regional leaders in Hubei province and Hong Kong</a>.</p> \n<p>Health bosses speculate the virus will continue to spread in the UK until it peaks in the summer \u2013 later than the previous assumption that it would peter out in the late spring. \u201cWe are planning that we are into this for the next few months,\u201d said a source. Further afield, the cruise ship refused port by four countries, the MV Westerdam, is being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/12/westerdam-cruise-ship-with-2000-onboard-refused-port-by-four-countries-amid-coronavirus-fears\">allowed to dock in Cambodia</a> \u2013 there are no known cases on board but it did make a recent stopover in Hong Kong.

Samoa has gone as far as to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/13/samoa-turns-away-eight-of-its-own-citizens-over-coronavirus-fears\">turn away eight of its own citizens</a> for fear they might be infected.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Stone scandal \u2013 </strong>Congress has summoned Donald Trump\u2019s attorney general, William Barr, amid fury over the justice department\u2019s interference in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/12/roger-stone-case-chuck-schumer-william-barr\">sentencing of the president\u2019s ally Roger Stone</a>. All four prosecutors resigned from the case as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/13/roger-stone-trump-william-barr-us-justice-system\">result of the intervention</a>. The Democrats are calling it an unprecedented threat to the US justice system. Ed Pilkington writes that a barrage of former justice department figures have also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/13/roger-stone-trump-william-barr-us-justice-system\">sounded the alarm</a>: in the wake of the Watergate scandal, rules have been in place since 1978 to severely restrict communication between the president, his team and justice officials. \u201cTrump has torn down that wall,\u201d said Chiraag Bains, a former justice department prosecutor. \u201cHe treats the justice department\u2019s prosecution powers as an arm of his political apparatus, to threaten perceived enemies and reward friends.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Big Ben bill balloons \u2013 </strong>The repair bill for parliament\u2019s Elizabeth Tower, which houses Big Ben, has increased by \u00a318.8m to nearly \u00a380m following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/13/asbestos-and-damage-discovery-inflates-big-ben-repair-bill-to-80m\">discovery of asbestos, bomb damage and the effects of pollution</a>. The 96-metre tower, a national symbol since 1856, has been mostly hidden from view since its restoration began in 2017. Painstaking examination of the tower uncovered decay and damage to hundreds of intricate carvings, asbestos in the belfry, extensive use of toxic lead paint, broken glass in the clock dials and the need to employ a specialist clock expert. The conservation effort is slated for completion in late 2021 \u2013 peers and MPs are scheduled to move out in four years to allow work to begin across the rest of the building under a \u00a33.8bn programme.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>McKee murder charge \u2013 </strong>A 52-year-old man has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/12/lyra-mckee-man-52-charged-with-of-journalist\">charged with the murder of Lyra McKee</a>, who was shot dead during rioting in Derry. He is due to appear in a Derry court today. McKee, 29, one of Northern Ireland\u2019s most promising young journalists, had been observing unrest in the Creggan area of Derry on 18 April 2019. The accused man, one of four arrested on Tuesday, is also charged with possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life and professing to be a member of a proscribed organisation. Police have said \u201cthe quest for the evidence to bring the gunman to justice remains active and ongoing\u201d. Despite the revulsion at McKee\u2019s murder, the New IRA and other dissident republican groups have persisted with sporadic attacks and intimidation, including a spate of recent incidents apparently part of a campaign against Police Service of Northern Ireland efforts to recruit more Catholics to the force.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Labour TV debate \u2013 </strong>Lisa Nandy has accused her rivals for the Labour leadership of failing to grapple with the scale of the challenge facing the party, as the candidates clashed over antisemitism, Brexit and economic policy in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/labour-leadership-hopefuls-clash-over-key-issues-and-policies\">contest\u2019s first televised debate</a>. Some of the liveliest exchanges came as the candidates discussed the party\u2019s record on antisemitism \u2013 which all four said they would apologise for \u2013 as Emily Thornberry sparred with Rebecca Long-Bailey over the latter\u2019s record on addressing the problem. With all four candidates adopting sections of the 2019 manifesto, policy differences have been relatively modest in the contest thus far. Starmer earlier published 10 \u201cpledges\u201d to Labour members including retaining Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s policies of scrapping student tuition fees and nationalising rail, mail, energy and water.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Evidence of Homo we-don\u2019t-know \u2013 </strong>A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/12/scientists-find-evidence-of-ghost-population-of-ancient-humans\">\u201cghost population\u201d of ancient humans</a> lived in Africa about half a million years ago and many of their genes still exist in people today, scientists now think.

They were too late arriving on the scene, though, to hunt, ride around on or live inside the shells of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/12/giant-turtle-fossil-south-america-stupendemys-geographicus\">giant turtle that roamed South America</a> until about seven million years ago.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Purge of Chinese officials over crisis Hello, I\u2019m Warren Murray with news you can peruse. Britain must prepare itself for more cases of the coronavirus through the summer, health officials have warned, after they confirmed the first patient diagnosed in London. The patient brings the total number in the UK to nine. She flew back to the capital from China last weekend and officials are tracing relatives, friends and others she may have been in contact with including passengers on her flight. In China, the national total has risen to more than 1,300 deaths and nearly 60,000 cases, Alison Rourke reports at our live blog. The spike in deaths and cases was followed by a purge of regional leaders in Hubei province and Hong Kong. Health bosses speculate the virus will continue to spread in the UK until it peaks in the summer \u2013 later than the previous assumption that it would peter out in the late spring. \u201cWe are planning that we are into this for the next few months,\u201d said a source. Further afield, the cruise ship refused port by four countries, the MV Westerdam, is being allowed to dock in Cambodia \u2013 there are no known cases on board but it did make a recent stopover in Hong Kong. The world\u2019s largest mobile phone trade fair, Mobile World Congress, has been cancelled \u2013 it was due to be held in Barcelona on 24 February \u2013 and the China Formula One race on 19 April has been scrapped, with the Vietnam round two weeks earlier also at risk. Samoa has gone as far as to turn away eight of its own citizens for fear they might be infected. * * * Stone scandal \u2013 Congress has summoned Donald Trump\u2019s attorney general, William Barr, amid fury over the justice department\u2019s interference in the sentencing of the president\u2019s ally Roger Stone. All four prosecutors resigned from the case as a result of the intervention. The Democrats are calling it an unprecedented threat to the US justice system. Ed Pilkington writes that a barrage of former justice department figures have also sounded the alarm: in the wake of the Watergate scandal, rules have been in place since 1978 to severely restrict communication between the president, his team and justice officials. \u201cTrump has torn down that wall,\u201d said Chiraag Bains, a former justice department prosecutor. \u201cHe treats the justice department\u2019s prosecution powers as an arm of his political apparatus, to threaten perceived enemies and reward friends.\u201d * * * Big Ben bill balloons \u2013 The repair bill for parliament\u2019s Elizabeth Tower, which houses Big Ben, has increased by \u00a318.8m to nearly \u00a380m following the discovery of asbestos, bomb damage and the effects of pollution. The 96-metre tower, a national symbol since 1856, has been mostly hidden from view since its restoration began in 2017. Painstaking examination of the tower uncovered decay and damage to hundreds of intricate carvings, asbestos in the belfry, extensive use of toxic lead paint, broken glass in the clock dials and the need to employ a specialist clock expert. The conservation effort is slated for completion in late 2021 \u2013 peers and MPs are scheduled to move out in four years to allow work to begin across the rest of the building under a \u00a33.8bn programme. * * * McKee murder charge \u2013 A 52-year-old man has been charged with the murder of Lyra McKee, who was shot dead during rioting in Derry. He is due to appear in a Derry court today. McKee, 29, one of Northern Ireland\u2019s most promising young journalists, had been observing unrest in the Creggan area of Derry on 18 April 2019. The accused man, one of four arrested on Tuesday, is also charged with possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life and professing to be a member of a proscribed organisation. Police have said \u201cthe quest for the evidence to bring the gunman to justice remains active and ongoing\u201d. Despite the revulsion at McKee\u2019s murder, the New IRA and other dissident republican groups have persisted with sporadic attacks and intimidation, including a spate of recent incidents apparently part of a campaign against Police Service of Northern Ireland efforts to recruit more Catholics to the force. * * * Labour TV debate \u2013 Lisa Nandy has accused her rivals for the Labour leadership of failing to grapple with the scale of the challenge facing the party, as the candidates clashed over antisemitism, Brexit and economic policy in the contest\u2019s first televised debate. Some of the liveliest exchanges came as the candidates discussed the party\u2019s record on antisemitism \u2013 which all four said they would apologise for \u2013 as Emily Thornberry sparred with Rebecca Long-Bailey over the latter\u2019s record on addressing the problem. With all four candidates adopting sections of the 2019 manifesto, policy differences have been relatively modest in the contest thus far. Starmer earlier published 10 \u201cpledges\u201d to Labour members including retaining Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s policies of scrapping student tuition fees and nationalising rail, mail, energy and water. * * * Evidence of Homo we-don\u2019t-know \u2013 A \u201cghost population\u201d of ancient humans lived in Africa about half a million years ago and many of their genes still exist in people today, scientists now think. By comparing modern genomes with those of ancient Neanderthals and Denisovans, researchers concluded some of the DNA came from an as-yet undiscovered group of archaic humans. They were too late arriving on the scene, though, to hunt, ride around on or live inside the shells of a giant turtle that roamed South America until about seven million years ago. It has an impressive science-name: Stupendemys geographicus. Today in Focus podcast: Coming out later in life Nicholas McInerny, a writer, came out as gay aged 45 and after nearly 20 years of marriage. It took a huge toll on his family and it all came flooding back last week when the TV presenter Phillip Schofield went public with his story.

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of Pakistani students trapped in the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak have said they are going through \u201cmental torture\u201d and pleaded with their government to help get them out. Rehan Rasheed, who has been studying medicine in Wuhan since 2015, criticised the Pakistan government and prime minister Imran Khan for refusing to bring back the more than 800 students who have been trapped in the city since it was locked down by the Chinese authorities in an attempt to contain the outbreak. He also said five Pakistani student studying at Wuhan\u2019s university of science and technology had contracted the virus. \u201cWe are not being evacuated and we are not being supported,\u201d said Rasheed, speaking on the phone from China. \u201cWe are all very scared, this is a terrible situation. We have been imprisoned in a hostel room for more than 20 days. For the past three days we have not been allowed to leave at all, even for food, and are surrounded by fear.\u201d The students have witnessed their counterparts from India, Nepal, Bangladesh, the US, UK and other countries board evacuation flights provided by their governments. Officials in the Pakistan government urged the group to \u201cremain calm\u201d. Pakistan has close ties to China and government figures have repeatedly congratulated the Chinese government for their handling of the outbreak. The refusal to evacuate the students back to Pakistan is also thought to be due to fears that the country does not have the medical facilities or capabilities to safely quarantine the returnees or handle a coronavirus outbreak on Pakistani soil. Pakistan has a poor record of handling disease outbreaks and is one of only two countries in the world which has failed to eliminate polio. Imran Khan said in a tweet: \u201cI have issued instructions to our Foreign Office and Overseas Ministry to do everything possible for our students who are stuck in Wuhan city.\u201d By Thursday, the number of people in China who had died from coronavirus had risen to 1,368 and the number infected is 59,805. Rasheen added: \u201cIt is clear that our government don\u2019t want to take us out from this situation.

Beijing fears there will be both short- and long-term damage from the outbreak.

Earlier this month, the US treasury announced <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/finance/478177-treasury-issues-new-rules-blocking-foreign-investments-in-us-firms\" title=\"\">curbs on foreign investment</a> to protect critical technology, data and infrastructure from foreign sabotage. Donald Trump\u2019s plans for a wall along the US border with Mexico are emblematic of a toughening up of controls on migration. An era of open markets and open borders \u2013 where trade and transnational capital flows rose rapidly as a share of global output \u2013 has run its course. The instruments of deglobalisation are being weaponised.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Companies are realising that lengthy global supply chains have costs as well as benefits. Coronavirus has brought that home with a vengeance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Today, governments are less interested in breaking down barriers and more concerned about safeguarding jobs, preventing intellectual property theft and the risk of cybercrime. Companies are realising that lengthy global supply chains designed to take advantage of low wages in the developing world have costs as well as benefits. Coronavirus has brought that home with a vengeance, and is likely to further encourage the repatriation of production that was offshored in the 1990s and 2000s.</p> <p>Deglobalisation has happened before, notably between 1914 and 1945. It is happening now as a result of geopolitics, economic torpor, rising inequality, the failure to develop new political structures to manage globalisation, and the response to new threats.</p> <p>Every wave of globalisation has required a champion, a hegemonic power confident enough to spread the gospel of free trade and open markets. That role fell to Britain in the late 19th century and the US in the second half of the 20th century.</p> <p>But America\u2019s self-confidence has been punctured by the rise of China as a strategic threat, and the power struggle between the world\u2019s two biggest economies is heating up. Stock markets were jubilant when Washington and Beijing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/15/us-china-trade-deal-donald-trump\" title=\"\">signed a trade deal</a> but \u2013 rather like the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of August 1939 \u2013 it is merely a truce of convenience. If Trump wins re-election in November, hostilities will resume.</p> <p>Countries also get defensive when times are tough, as they have been ever since the financial crisis of 2008. The most recent wave of openness occurred in the decade after the collapse of communism, culminating in China becoming a member of the WTO in 2001. This was a time when growth was strong, partly due to a globalisation feedback loop in which cheaper imports pushed down inflation rates and allowed central banks in the west to keep interest rates low and asset prices high.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27fe1e2888812f38c192b3e5b33e71bfd6ff5514\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27fe1e2888812f38c192b3e5b33e71bfd6ff5514/0_165_4839_2904/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders campaigns during the New Hampshire primary\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Taking back control is proving to be a compelling rallying cry for the populists of the right such as Trump and the populists of the left such as Bernie Sanders.\u2019 Sanders campaigns during the New Hampshire primary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Timothy A Clary/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the financial crisis exposed the weaknesses of a system that was able to operate globally without adequate controls and effective supervision. The resulting slump was deep and the recovery has been long, painful and incomplete. Inevitably, countries have become more cautious.</p> <p>That trend has been amplified because globalisation\u2019s fruits have been enjoyed primarily \u2013 though not exclusively \u2013 by owners of capital and the better off. Consumers have gained from lower prices, but inequality has risen in every part of the world. In democracies, there is a limit to how long people will put up with the rich getting richer while their living standards are stagnating or barely growing.</p> <p>The hope \u2013 always somewhat sketchy \u2013 was that an international polity would be developed to match the internationalisation of economics. If capital could organise on a global level, the argument went, then democratic mechanisms could and would be developed too. This simply has not happened.</p> <p>The one multilateral institution created in the past three decades to manage globalisation \u2013 the WTO \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/08/wto-faces-crisis-over-settlement-disputes-unless-trump-backs-off\" title=\"\">is in a parlous state</a>. The WTO has two main functions: as a forum where comprehensive trade deals are negotiated, and to provide a court where trade disputes between countries can be settled. It is currently doing neither.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/11/trump-economy-poor-americans-vulnerability\">Trump's greatest vulnerability is the economy \u2013 just ask poor Americans | Reverend William Barber</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The failure to develop a transnational political response to globalisation has meant voters have demanded a response at a level where they have a voice: the nation state. Taking back control is proving to be a compelling rallying cry for the populists of the right such as Trump and the populists of the left such as Bernie Sanders. Neither man has much time for the WTO.</p> <p>Global heating looks certain to add to the deglobalisation pressure. The existential threat posed by the climate emergency is forcing governments, businesses and consumers to ask some questions about the way the global economy works. Is it sensible to ship car parts backwards and forwards across national borders or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/12/revealed-big-oil-profits-since-1990-total-nearly-2tn-bp-shell-chevron-exxon\" title=\"\">invest in fossil fuel companies</a>? Is it sustainable to fly in fruit and veg from the other side of the world rather than grow it locally? Most fundamentally of all, are there more important things than economic growth?</p> <p>Globalisation was sold as a way of boosting prosperity for all by making markets bigger and more efficient. For a while the model worked, but when it blew up and caused extensive collateral damage, a backlash was inevitable. Deglobalisation is the result.</p> <p>\u2022 Larry Elliott is the Guardian\u2019s economics editor</p>",

An era of open markets and open borders \u2013 where trade and transnational capital flows rose rapidly as a share of global output \u2013 has run its course. The instruments of deglobalisation are being weaponised. Today, governments are less interested in breaking down barriers and more concerned about safeguarding jobs, preventing intellectual property theft and the risk of cybercrime. Companies are realising that lengthy global supply chains designed to take advantage of low wages in the developing world have costs as well as benefits. Coronavirus has brought that home with a vengeance, and is likely to further encourage the repatriation of production that was offshored in the 1990s and 2000s. Deglobalisation has happened before, notably between 1914 and 1945. It is happening now as a result of geopolitics, economic torpor, rising inequality, the failure to develop new political structures to manage globalisation, and the response to new threats. Every wave of globalisation has required a champion, a hegemonic power confident enough to spread the gospel of free trade and open markets. That role fell to Britain in the late 19th century and the US in the second half of the 20th century. But America\u2019s self-confidence has been punctured by the rise of China as a strategic threat, and the power struggle between the world\u2019s two biggest economies is heating up. Stock markets were jubilant when Washington and Beijing signed a trade deal but \u2013 rather like the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of August 1939 \u2013 it is merely a truce of convenience. If Trump wins re-election in November, hostilities will resume. Countries also get defensive when times are tough, as they have been ever since the financial crisis of 2008. The most recent wave of openness occurred in the decade after the collapse of communism, culminating in China becoming a member of the WTO in 2001. This was a time when growth was strong, partly due to a globalisation feedback loop in which cheaper imports pushed down inflation rates and allowed central banks in the west to keep interest rates low and asset prices high. But the financial crisis exposed the weaknesses of a system that was able to operate globally without adequate controls and effective supervision. The resulting slump was deep and the recovery has been long, painful and incomplete. Inevitably, countries have become more cautious. That trend has been amplified because globalisation\u2019s fruits have been enjoyed primarily \u2013 though not exclusively \u2013 by owners of capital and the better off. Consumers have gained from lower prices, but inequality has risen in every part of the world. In democracies, there is a limit to how long people will put up with the rich getting richer while their living standards are stagnating or barely growing. The hope \u2013 always somewhat sketchy \u2013 was that an international polity would be developed to match the internationalisation of economics. If capital could organise on a global level, the argument went, then democratic mechanisms could and would be developed too. This simply has not happened. The one multilateral institution created in the past three decades to manage globalisation \u2013 the WTO \u2013 is in a parlous state. The WTO has two main functions: as a forum where comprehensive trade deals are negotiated, and to provide a court where trade disputes between countries can be settled. It is currently doing neither. The failure to develop a transnational political response to globalisation has meant voters have demanded a response at a level where they have a voice: the nation state. Taking back control is proving to be a compelling rallying cry for the populists of the right such as Trump and the populists of the left such as Bernie Sanders. Neither man has much time for the WTO. Global heating looks certain to add to the deglobalisation pressure. The existential threat posed by the climate emergency is forcing governments, businesses and consumers to ask some questions about the way the global economy works. Is it sensible to ship car parts backwards and forwards across national borders or invest in fossil fuel companies? Is it sustainable to fly in fruit and veg from the other side of the world rather than grow it locally? Most fundamentally of all, are there more important things than economic growth? Globalisation was sold as a way of boosting prosperity for all by making markets bigger and more efficient. For a while the model worked, but when it blew up and caused extensive collateral damage, a backlash was inevitable. Deglobalisation is the result. \u2022 Larry Elliott is the Guardian\u2019s economics editor",

      "bodyText": "Some 43% of projects funded under the controversial $100m sports grant program overseen by Bridget McKenzie \u2013 290 in total \u2013 were ineligible when agreements were signed, according to officials from the Australian National Audit Office. The evidence from the ANAO to the Senate inquiry on Thursday contradicts with the defence of the program employed by Scott Morrison and the former sports minister, who had claimed that \u201cno ineligible projects\u201d were funded under the scheme. ANAO officials also revealed the prime minister\u2019s office made \u201cdirect\u201d representations about which projects to fund, and the Liberal National Party of Queensland submitted a wish-list of projects in a key marginal seat. In a scathing report the ANAO found the $100m community sport infrastructure fund was targeted at marginal or Coalition target electorates, after McKenzie departed from Sport Australia\u2019s assessment to select projects from spreadsheets colour-coded by electorate. Before McKenzie resigned on 2 February over a conflict of interest in one grant, she and Morrison had said no ineligible projects were funded. But on Thursday, Brian Boyd, the ANAO performance audit services group executive director, told the Senate inquiry \u201cthat\u2019s not what we found\u201d. Morrison and McKenzie had cited the ANAO\u2019s report, which said \u201cno applications assessed as ineligible were awarded grant funding\u201d. But Boyd explained this meant that no projects that had been assessed as ineligible by Sport Australia were granted funding. But ineligible projects were funded due to McKenzie accepting late applications and because circumstances changed between the assessment and the time that funding agreements were concluded, he said. The 290 ineligible projects that were funded included: 272 projects that had started work by the time agreements were signed; eight that had completed work before the agreement was signed; five late applications that were accepted; and four applications that were amended after they were assessed. \u201cThe guidelines\u2019 eligibility requirements don\u2019t end just when you\u2019ve lodged the application \u2013 this is common across many grants programs,\u201d Boyd said. At a media conference to discuss the extension of the coronavirus travel ban, Morrison was caught by surprise by the revelation. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen that evidence, I haven\u2019t seen that statement, I will review that,\u201d he told reporters in Canberra. Boyd also revealed the Queensland LNP sent the minister a list of projects it was \u201cfighting for\u201d in the Labor-held seat of Longman, one of several seats picked up by the Coalition to secure re-election in May 2019. Morrison has so far insisted that his office\u2019s role in the program had been limited to passing on representations from MPs. But ANAO officials said representations from the prime minister\u2019s office were both indirect \u2013 made on behalf of others \u2013 and direct. Asked about media reports that the prime minister\u2019s office had contacted McKenzie to advise that some projects had been funded through other programs and asking for \u201ca slight adjustment\u201d, Boyd said that was \u201cnot particularly unusual\u201d and an example of the \u201cdirect\u201d representations made by the prime minister\u2019s office. Consultation with the prime minister\u2019s office included the controversial colour-coded spreadsheets, which went through at least 28 iterations as decisions about projects to be funded changed. But the auditor general, Grant Hehir, said that not all representations changed the outcome of funding decisions and the ANAO did not find sufficient correlation between representations and an outcome to make it a focus of the audit. \u201cThe evidence before us was that the minister was the decision-maker,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we had have identified someone else as the decision-maker, we would have gone down that path.\u201d Hehir concluded that the community sport infrastructure grant program was \u201cnot informed by appropriate assessment process and sound advice\u201d. He reiterated the ANAO\u2019s conclusion that it was \u201cnot evident\u201d what McKenzie\u2019s legal authority was to make grants, and noted that Sport Australia had also expressed its concerns. \u201cIt is poor practice for entities to be instructed what their advice should recommend rather than providing their own recommendations that are developed through an evidence-based approach,\u201d Hehir said. \u201cPotential applicants and other stakeholders have a right to expect program funding decisions will be made in a manner and on a basis consistent with published program guidelines.\u201d In the hearing, the National party senator Matt Canavan defended McKenzie for considering projects by electorate and by the party which held them, suggesting she needed to do so to avoid adverse findings that Coalition seats had benefited disproportionately. He cited a 2010 ANAO report finding that Labor electorates benefited disproportionately from stimulus projects. Canavan noted applicants were aware the minister retained a discretion to disagree with Sport Australia. Boyd countered that applicants were entitled to assume this did not extend to criteria they had not been told about. The ANAO did not interview anyone in the prime minister\u2019s office, but had dozens of emails exchanged between that office and McKenzie\u2019s, and interviewed current and former staff from McKenzie\u2019s office under oath. Hehir told the inquiry he had not seen the report by the head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Phil Gaetjens, which found McKenzie had breached ministerial standards only with respect to one $36,000 grant to the Wangaratta Clay Target Club, of which she was a member. Labor has pursued the Gaetjens report in the Senate but the government has blocked its release, claiming it reveals cabinet deliberations. A government spokesman reiterated that the ANAO report had said \u201cno applications assessed as ineligible were awarded grant funding\u201d.",

Sport Australia removed from its list those assessed as ineligible \u2013 that\u2019s what that finding is. Subsequent to that there were the five new applications, the four amended applications. </p> <p>And then because things took longer \u2013 because you are now running two rounds, rather than three, and funding agreements are in place \u2013 you had eight projects where, according to the details provided by the proponent, the project had been completed before the funding grant was signed. They\u2019re ineligible under the program.</p> <p>And there were 270-something where the project had started before the funding agreement was signed, which is also ineligible under the program. </p> <p><strong>So we get to around 43% of those which were awarded funding, by the time the funding agreement signed, were ineligible.</strong></p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-13T07:39:09.749Z\">at 7.39am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e44f9ca8f08e133247426a2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-13T07:26:20.702Z\">7.26am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Eric Abetz </strong>says he is glad the terrible \u201cpoliticisation\u201d of this process is now on the record.</p> <p>I\u2019d die of irony, if <strong>Barnaby Joyce </strong>hadn\u2019t already earlier killed me. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/murpharoo/status/1227856084062179328\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Matt Canavan is now complaining about the division of time for questions on the committee.

I will ask the minister go into those details.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Stuart Robert:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yeah, thanks PM. Let me also reinforce the work over Dr Freelander\u2019s long history of service.</p> <p>When it comes to health diagnosis, we understand that is the responsibility of state, we can say it is unacceptable in terms of the length, it is the responsibility of state health authorities. </p> <p>Having said that, a diagnosis is not required for access into the early childhood intervention stream of the NDIS, that is clear in law and practice. </p> <p>In terms of access, the data showed people turning up with children seeking early intervention through the early intervention pathways are getting an access decision in three days. You don\u2019t need a diagnosis to enter the NDIS, that is down over 50 days. In terms of people accessing a plan, it has dropped from 54 days.</p> <p>Anticipating a range of issues the commonwealth learned on the second phase of functional assessment trial, which will conclude this month, all going well with results, and so far they are very positive, the commonwealth will go to market for a functional assessment partner, and will introduce functional assessments from one July this year. To quantify access to the scheme.</p> <p>Recognising the member\u2019s key point, it is important to understand, and for parents and the nation to understand, you don\u2019t need a diagnosis to provide an early child intervention partner. </p> <p>The act does not require a diagnosis, but I tell parents to get hold of the NDIS, speak to an early childhood early intervention partner, get that intervention as quickly as possible. The system is designed for it, access is currently three days.</p> </blockquote> <p>As <strong>Stephanie Dalzell,</strong> the ABC reporter who broke the story on the diagnosis rates, has repeatedly said today, diagnoses are important for a range of issues \u2013 not just the NDIS \u2013 and where you live, in terms of postcode, can really impact how long you are waiting for that important answer. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-13T04:26:00.930Z\">at 4.26am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e44cb608f086a28115aacee\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-13T04:07:10.654Z\">4.07am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/mpbowers/status/1227805043966918658\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dutton smiles, Fletcher feels a disturbance in the force\u201das if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmyRemeikis?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AmyRemeikis</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianAus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GuardianAus</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/PoliticsLive?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#PoliticsLive</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/uhZzKn5uNE\">pic.twitter.com/uhZzKn5uNE</a></p>&mdash; Mikearoo (@mpbowers) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mpbowers/status/1227805043966918658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 13, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e44cad98f08e133247425b3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-13T04:05:25.252Z\">4.05am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Richard Marles</strong> to <strong>Melissa Price</strong>:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When hundreds of defence industry workers at Osborne and Adelaide have lost their jobs, and there\u2019s reports of another 34 job losses announced today, why on earth is the government sending hull fabrication jobs to France, instead of keeping them here in Australia on the future submarines?</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Price:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mr Speaker, there\u2019s currently 4,000 jobs in shipbuilding at this point in time.

Younger people who go into aged care would be going in because they have a very serious condition, whether it\u2019s an acquired brain injury, whether it\u2019s some form of ... degenerative condition, or some other form of accident or illness. </p> <p>Having said that, the person who wrote into the terms of the royal commission the involvement and engagement and treatment of younger people in residential aged care was this person, the prime minister. </p> <p>I had the privilege of sitting with him when we drafted those terms. That was his personal passion. That was the focus and the humanity and the concern. What we have also seen is we have accepted the royal commission\u2019s embrace of those terms of reference. </p> <p>And in particular, there are three targets which the royal commission included in its interim findings, precisely to address the care and concern and cause of any harm relating to young people in aged care. </p> <p>Firstly, that people under the age of \u2013 that no people under the age of 45 should enter residential care by 2022. We have accepted and embraced that.</p> <p>No people under the age of 45 should be living in aged care by 2022. So living in, let alone entering.</p> <p>And thirdly, that no people under the age of 65 should be living in residential aged care by 2025.</p> <p>These are standards which have never been set before. These are goals which have never been set, and these are targets which have never been set and which we will achieve. So it\u2019s a deep and powerful commitment. </p> <p>So I would make this point \u2013 that under the former government, the number of younger people living in residential aged care moved from 6,577 to 6,478 in 2010. </p> <p>Now it\u2019s down to 5,606, and we\u2019re decreasing still further. </p> <p>It\u2019s become one of the priorities for the prime minister, and the relevant minister, and what we have seen is that the number of younger people entering residential, so this is entering residential aged care, has already decreased by 536 to 416 in March to June of 2019. A 22% decline, before the royal commission\u2019s interim findings.</p> <p>So the reason that these standards have been set is because the commission found the importance and need for them. But the reason the commission had that power was because this person, the member for Cook, the prime minister of Australia, personally drafted them.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-13T03:41:55.759Z\">at 3.41am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e44c28c8f0811db2faf6b62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-13T03:31:06.222Z\">3.31am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Josh Frydenberg </strong>gets his next chance to display his impressive lack of microphone skills with another dixer.</p> <p>Has he learnt that a microphone is designed to amplify your voice yet?</p> <p>No. Sadly, he has not.</p> <p>He does get in an Otis mention though.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-13T03:34:35.596Z\">at 3.34am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e44c1da8f086a28115aacc2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-13T03:28:31.187Z\">3.28am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The bowl of microwaved rice wearing a House of Reps pin, <strong>Michael McCormack, </strong>delivers the first mention of the \u2018Otis group\u2019 \u2013 that came in at 26 minutes.</p> <p>I guess some people have to try to find personality wherever they can.</p> <p>He talks about the menu having \u2018ravioli and egg yolk\u2019 at the restaurant the Labor right faction met at \u2013 but he neglects to mention that even egg yolk has more substance and colour than him.</p> <p>He ignores the calls from Labor about when he is getting an invite on the <strong>Matt Canavan</strong>-hosted Weatherboard and Iron podcast. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-13T03:30:54.530Z\">at 3.30am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e44c05b8f0811db2faf6b59\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-13T03:26:13.430Z\">3.26am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Ged Kearney</strong> gets the next question, either because someone from the Coalition forgot to jump, or <strong>Tony Smith</strong> went to the wrong side of the chamber.</p> <p>She asks <strong>Greg Hunt</strong>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The aged care royal commission drew attention to inadequate prevention and management of wounds [including residents and patients sometimes being left to sit in their own urine], sometimes leading to septicaemia and death ...

There\u2019s two parts to your question. </p> <p>The first bit \u2013 the point that Anthony is making, rightly, is that new coal-fired plants are not a smart investment. </p> <p>They don\u2019t make economic sense when there\u2019s cheaper and cleaner renewable technology available, and investors have made that clear for some time now. So that\u2019s part of your question. </p> <p>The other part about Queensland is really important. </p> <p>There is no prouder Queenslander than me. </p> <p>I don\u2019t like how Queensland gets caricatured on these issues by this simplified belief there is one homogenous view in Queensland and that Matt Canavan is somehow the arbiter of that view. </p> <p>There are a range of views in Queensland. There\u2019s also a recognition that we can find a way to do something about climate change without abandoning some of our traditional strengths and while being cognisant of the impact on some of the communities, particularly in central and north Queensland. </p> <p>That is not beyond us, Fran. Queenslanders do want us to do something about climate change. They want us to be cognisant of those other issues. They want us to be sensible about it and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-13T00:02:37.481Z\">at 12.02am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e448c878f08e13324742453\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-12T23:41:21.248Z\">11.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And then there was this on 6 February, from <strong>Scott Morrison\u2019s</strong> interview with <strong>Alan Jones:</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Alan Jones:</strong> Are you concerned in any way about the objectivity of the advice coming from the World Health Organisation? These are the people who are saying, in spite of other countries cancelling their flights, keep the borders open, keep the borders open, yet they have, of course, declared it an international emergency. </p> <p>The head of the World Health Organisation is this bloke Adhanom, and I made this point twice yesterday. He\u2019s the member of the Ethiopian Marxist Leninist party in Ethiopia, are renegotiating billions of dollars in loans from Beijing and for a railway line that links the capital to Djibouti. </p> <p>So why wouldn\u2019t he be congratulating China on their work in containing the virus? Do you think that people believe that China has been really transparent in all of this? </p> <p>The World Health Organisation says you can have confidence in China\u2019s capacity to control the outbreak, but it was only in December that eight doctors were arrested and forced to confess to spreading false rumours, which weren\u2019t, in fact, false. Are you concerned about the objectivity of this advice? </p> <p><strong>Morrison:</strong> Let me answer it this way. When we started taking our action, we were one of the first countries to do so, we were doing that completely independent, frankly, of what the declarations were of the WHO. </p> <p>We moved \u2013 I mean, our chief medical officer, Dr <strong>Brendan Murphy</strong>, was calling for the WHO to declare this a week before they did. So we were working on the basis of Brendan Murphy\u2019s advice. </p> <p>You know, we were accessing information from the WHO, and in crises like this you have to be, you have to ensure that you\u2019re acting on your own information. You draw it from a range of different sources and you make the calls in Australia\u2019s interests. I mean, the WHO has never supported travel bans. </p> <p>That\u2019s a policy position they\u2019ve had for a long time. Now we\u2019ve had one, we were one of the first countries, ours actually activated before the United States\u2019 one did. </p> <p>So we have, we\u2019ve been very proactive on this and we\u2019ve noted all the things the WHO and others said. But frankly, we\u2019re making the calls based on what we think is best for Australia. </p> <p><strong>And you\u2019ve got to always in this environment, I think, be careful about the information you\u2019re using. </strong>You\u2019ve got to interrogate it. But we\u2019re relying on our health advisers. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-12T23:44:19.449Z\">at 11.44pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e448b928f08e1332474244e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-12T23:38:40.854Z\">11.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Scott Morrison</strong> spoke this morning about the virus formerly known as coronavirus \u2013 now called Covid-19 by the World Health Organisation.</p> <p>He said the virus was being contained in Australia, thanks to the advice of the chief medical officer, and the whole of government response.</p> <p>He then went into one of the issues facing the response, which was misinformation about the virus (the chief medical officer also spoke on this earlier this week, warning that xenophobia was creeping into people\u2019s response to the virus).</p> <p>Here is what Morrison said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Now one of the things you always have to address is misinformation. </p> <p>I mean, this is true in in any area of natural disaster. </p> <p>I mean, one of the things that used to frustrate me so much, when I visited so many incident control centres, is we would have dedicated resources to people just correcting misinformation on social media. </p> <p>And I gotta say mainstream media as well, reports that were just simply wrong. </p> <p>I think the media on these issues also do a tremendous job. </p> <p>But correcting misinformation is something I\u2019d hope the media would be a great partner in doing.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-12T23:41:12.568Z\">at 11.41pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e44856d8f0811db2faf69ee\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-12T23:11:12.392Z\">11.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Jim Chalmers</strong> was speaking to <strong>Fran Kelly</strong> this morning, as we have mentioned.

It remains to be seen how big an impact those things will have on the budget. The budget surplus is really a test that the government has set for itself. We won\u2019t know for a little while yet whether they have met that test.</p> </blockquote> <p>And on whether Labor would prefer the government to spend, rather than save for a surplus:<br></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019ve been very constructive about that. If the government falls short of this test that they set for themselves it won\u2019t only be because of the fires, coronavirus or drought. It will be a combination of things, including a long period of economic mismanagement which has seen them fall well short of their forecasts for growth, wages and other things in the economy. We\u2019ll look at the numbers when they come out. We\u2019ve been constructive about it. This is a government that promised a surplus in its first year and every year after that but they haven\u2019t delivered a surplus yet and that\u2019s why they\u2019ve more than doubled government debt.</p> </blockquote> <p>I know that <strong>John Howard </strong>and <strong>Peter Costello </strong>really, really loved saying that the budget was like a household budget and that the surplus was saving money in the bank while paying down credit cards, but it\u2019s really not like that.

And indeed that \u2013 as I outlined in the Jobs and the Future work vision statement, in Perth, a statement that was unanimously agreed to by the caucus \u2013 good action on climate change means more jobs, lower emissions and lower energy prices. That\u2019s Labor\u2019s objective. </p> <p>The division in this House is on the other side. The Coalition of chaos.

There is a one week break after this, and the mood in the building could best be described as \u2018GETOUTOFMYWAYIHAVETOGETOUTOFHERE\u2019, which, honestly, is a mood most of them have put on themselves.</p> <p>The Nationals are still trying to convince everyone that they have moved on. Party president <strong>Larry Anthony </strong>had a chat to <strong>Laura Jayes</strong> on Sky News this morning, where he said that the party wasn\u2019t at its \u201cfinest\u201d when it was talking about itself. Which might explain the last two years.</p> <p>That follows <strong>Michael McCormack\u2019s</strong> interview with the Nine Network\u2019s<strong> Chris Uhlmann </strong>yesterday, where he said that people hadn\u2019t seen what a fighter he was yet. (Insert eyeroll emoji)</p> <p>On that front though, it is worth pointing out that the <strong>Barnaby Joyce </strong>camp didn\u2019t have the numbers when they challenged \u2013 which we know because they lost \u2013 and they have since lost a number, with <strong>Llew O\u2019Brien </strong>no longer sitting as a National (he is a sitting as a LNP MP now, and only joins the joint party room) so you would think that McCormack is safe, at least for now. But the nufty keeps talking about it, so he is keeping it in the public eye, because there is nothing the Nationals like more than relevance.</p> <p>A dose of reality would be great.</p> <p>Meanwhile, it does pay to turn attention back to the promised surplus, with the economic conditions making it increasingly likely <strong>Josh Frydenberg</strong> is about to join the <strong>Wayne Swan</strong> club \u2013 promising a surplus without delivering one. The bushfires, the drought, the world economy and now Covid-19 (formerly known as coronavirus) is having a massive impact on a surplus which was already downgraded at the mid year update.</p> <p><strong>Jim Chalmers</strong> is keen to keep it in the public view, telling the ABC this morning that the government is about to fail a test it set itself.</p> <p>And then there is this mastery of doublespeak from the prime minister during the election campaign:<br></p> <p>\u201cWe have brought our budget back to surplus,\u201d Morrison said during a leaders\u2019 debate.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re the party and government that has done that. And I think Australians can trust us to keep it in surplus\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not in surplus now,\u201d <strong>Sabra Lane,</strong> the moderator, said.</p> <p>\u201cI said next year,\u201d <strong>Scott Morrison </strong>answered (he had not, but you should be used to that by now).</p> <p>\u201c<strong>I said we brought the budget back to surplus next year</strong>\u201d.</p> <p>I mean I get it. I have reached my ideal weight next year too. </p> <p>We\u2019ll have all of that, and everything else that happens as we cover the death throes of the first sitting week. You have <strong>Mike Bowers,</strong> <strong>Sarah Martin</strong>, <strong>Paul Karp</strong> and <strong>Katharine Murphy</strong>, and I have had half a coffee, so we are all winners.</p> <p>Ready?</p> <p>Let\u2019s get into it.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-12T23:41:37.071Z\">at 11.41pm GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s where we are going to end the blog today. It\u2019s been a DAY. Parliament will rest for a week before returning for another fortnight on 24 February. We also have estimates in that sitting fortnight as well, so brace yourself for that. I\u2019ll be back on general political news duties next week, as will the rest of the bureau, so make sure you check back to see what Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp have for you, along with Mike Bowers. A very big thank you to them, and the rest of the Guardian brains trust for all their work today. Yes, I know there were a few more typos than usual, but it has been a very long two weeks and I type thousands of words a day, so by Thursday they are going to slip in. Apolgiess (that\u2019s a joke!) Have a wonderful weekend. Thanks for joining us and remember \u2013 take care of you. The committee ends the sports grants hearing for the night. The main takeaways: 43% of the funded projects were ineligible. There were 28 versions of the electorate spreadsheet. Projects could go from eligible to ineligible and vice versa within hours. There were no reasons given for the changes, or for why one project was approved or not. The prime minister\u2019s office was consulted multiple times. As Katharine Murphy wrote a short time ago, Bridget McKenzie\u2019s resignation was not the end of the #sportsrorts affair. This is along the same lines of defence as \u201creverse pork barrelling\u201d: For context, Canavan was referring to an auditor general report from 2010-11, under a different auditor general and a Labor government, which was criticised for giving too many grants to Labor electorates. Which Canavan says means Bridget McKenzie had no choice but to consider the electorates these grants were going to. The statement continues: The continuation of the travel restrictions means that for a further week, foreign nationals \u2013 excluding permanent residents \u2013 who have been in mainland China will not be allowed to enter Australia for 14 days from the time they left. As before, Australian citizens and permanent residents will still be able to enter, as will their immediate family members (spouses, legal guardians and dependants only). We continue to require Australian citizens, permanent residents and their families who have been in mainland China from 1 February 2020, and who return Australia, to self-isolate for 14 days from the time they left mainland China. Australia is one of 58 countries that has introduced some form of travel restrictions on passengers who have been in mainland China. The AHPPC has advised that the situation with Coronavirus in mainland China has not improved in the past two weeks. There is continuing and concerning growth of cases and mortality in Hubei province and further, though slower, growth in other regions of mainland China. On the advice of the AHPPC, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will maintain its travel advice for mainland China at \u201cDo not travel\u201d until there is a material change in the global situation. Border measures to screen passengers on flights and vessels from mainland China and for people who have been in, or transited through, mainland China in the past 14 days will also continue. The official statement on the extension on the travel ban has been released: The National Security Committee of Cabinet has today agreed to extend the entry restrictions on foreign nationals who have recently been in mainland China for a further week from 15 February 2020 to protect Australians from the risk of coronavirus. As always, our priority is to keep Australians safe. This decision is underpinned by medical advice and recommendations from the Commonwealth\u2019s Chief Medical Officer and chief medical officers from each state and territory, on the steps necessary to contain the spread of coronavirus. The Chief Medical Officer confirmed that our arrangements to protect Australians from coronavirus are working - there are no confirmed cases among Australian citizens and residents who have returned to Australia since the introduction of the border measures on 1 February 2020. The restrictions will be reviewed by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) in one week. We are announcing this decision now to give certainty to travellers, businesses and organisations. The spreadsheets of proposed funding proposals would go out, and emails would come back from the prime minister\u2019s office, making arguments for various projects, the committee has been told. Brian Boyd says he won\u2019t speculate on what was in the PM&amp;C report that found the process was fine, because he hasn\u2019t seen it and speculation is \u201cnot what auditors do\u201d. Here is how the Liberal senator Eric Abetz managed to confirm that almost half of the funded projects were ineligible. That is a very big deal, because the government\u2019s biggest defence of this process is that no rules were broken, and all the funded projects were eligible: Abetz: ... Next issue I seek to clarify: You did find that no ineligible project or application was funded? Brian Boyd: No Senator, that\u2019s not what we found. So if you go to the start of chapter three, which is the chapter on assessment, the finding there was \u201cineligible applications were identified and no applications assessed as ineligible were awarded grant funding\u201d. So that\u2019s the Sport Australia eligibility assessment process. What then happened subsequently was there\u2019s applications, late applications were taken on board, which were ineligible under the guidelines. Amendments were made for existing applications ,which were ineligible under the guidelines, and they were funded. But at the time \u2013 this relates to the Sport Australia assessment process. Sport Australia removed from its list those assessed as ineligible \u2013 that\u2019s what that finding is. Subsequent to that there were the five new applications, the four amended applications. And then because things took longer \u2013 because you are now running two rounds, rather than three, and funding agreements are in place \u2013 you had eight projects where, according to the details provided by the proponent, the project had been completed before the funding grant was signed. They\u2019re ineligible under the program. And there were 270-something where the project had started before the funding agreement was signed, which is also ineligible under the program. So we get to around 43% of those which were awarded funding, by the time the funding agreement signed, were ineligible. Eric Abetz says he is glad the terrible \u201cpoliticisation\u201d of this process is now on the record. I\u2019d die of irony, if Barnaby Joyce hadn\u2019t already earlier killed me. The auditor general has also not seen the PM&amp;C report that Scott Morrison has relied upon to say there is no problem in terms of the legal authority Bridget McKenzie held to make the decisions she did, so he can\u2019t say whether or not it is contradictory to his own findings (that is it\u2019s unclear what legal authority she had to make the decisions). The original advice from Sport Australia was broad \u2013 it was the minister\u2019s office which added in the seat information. A little earlier in the hearing, the auditor general (who was appointed by Tony Abbott in 2015), Grant Hehir, said the report had a couple of lessons for those moving forward: It is poor practice for entities to be instructed what their advice should recommend rather than providing their own recommendations that are developed through an evidence-based approach. ... Potential applicants and other stakeholders have a right to expect program funding decisions will be made in a manner and on a basis consistent with published program guidelines. The man of the hour: When asked about the audit office\u2019s evidence this evening that 43% of the projects that received funding were ineligible, Scott Morrison said that he \u201cwas quoting the auditor general\u201d, in defending the program on those grounds. I haven\u2019t seen that evidence, I haven\u2019t seen that statement, I will review that. Eric Abetz\u2019s face here is worth the 10-second watch: A reminder that the government has told the states to wait until April to discuss the economic impacts of coronavirus: When asked if the government had considered financial assistance for affected sectors, particularly the university sector, Scott Morrison said that the government was looking at \u201csensible options\u201d to mitigate the impact of the travel ban. \u201cThe challenge in managing this is you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know, and there is still a lot that we don\u2019t know,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cWe are taking a cautious approach, but a very mindful approach, mindful that these bans do have an impact.\u201d Eric Abetz was doing his best Poirot at the end of the auditor general session there, trying to discover the qualification of the assessors, as well as WhAt dId LaBOr gEt, but it was mostly just filibustering. Linda Reynolds is going MUCH harder than Melissa Price on this. Much, much harder. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has announced the travel ban on foreign nationals arriving from China will be in place for another week. It will then be reviewed. The decision was made by the National Security Committee today based on advice from the chief medical officer and state officers. \u201cAustralia\u2019s arrangements to protect Australia from coronavirus are working ... they are doing the job,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cWe did not take this decision lightly. \u201cWe are doing everything we can to keep Australians safe at this time and to ensure we are mitigating everything that is possible to address any of the threats.\u201d The prime minister said the government was aware of the disruption being caused by the virus and the economic disruption, but the ban was needed to keep people safe. The health minister, Greg Hunt, said the measures the government had taken were working. He said there were no cases of coronavirus that had been identified in either Christmas Island or at Howard Springs where Australians are quarantined. \u201cThis remains good news and it means the advice of the medical officers is keeping Australians safe,\u201d Hunt said. Brian Boyd from the audit office has contradicted the prime minister and Bridget McKenzie\u2019s claim that no ineligible projects were funded. In fact, some 43% of applications were ineligible: 270 projects had started work when they signed agreements \u2013 ineligible; 8 had finished work when they signed agreements \u2013 ineligible; 5 late applications were accepted \u2013 ineligible; and there were amendments to four applications \u2013 ineligible. Basically, the projects were assessed as eligible at the point that Sport Australia looked at them, but circumstances changed. So the quote that Scott Morrison has relied on to defend the program is shot. The Australian government has officially extended the travel ban for foreign nationals from China for another week amid the coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak. Around 43% of projects \u2013 or 290 \u2013 were ineligible for funding by the time the grants were awarded, because the process took so long, we\u2019ve just been told. Paul Karp will have more for you on that in a moment. \u201cAt the end of the day, the evidence before us was the minister made all the decisions,\u201d says Grant Hehir on the process. Brian Boyd said the officer asked about the changes \u2013 why projects went from approved to not approved, or not approved to approved \u2013 and were told by those involved they either did not know or could not recall. Just to repeat \u2013 there was no reason recorded at the time. Asked why some projects that had scored close to 100 by Sport Australia went from approved to not approved, the auditor general\u2019s office was told \u201ccould not recall\u201d. Brian Boyd from the auditor-general\u2019s office says there were at least 28 versions of the sports grant spreadsheets made \u2013 with some assessments for projects changed \u201cwithin hours\u201d \u2013 and there was no obvious reason as to why the assessment had changed (from either approved to not approved or vice versa). There was no record made about why one application was funded and another was not. Back in the committee hearing, and the auditor general has confirmed there were \u201ccomfortably dozens\u201d of emails between the prime minister\u2019s office and Bridget McKenzie\u2019s office during the sports grants process. There were also quite a few versions of the spreadsheet (\u201cdozens\u201d) before the final version was decided on. The only evidence the auditor general saw of the spreadsheet being shared was between the prime minister\u2019s office and McKenzie\u2019s office. Parliament has been adjourned. Scott Morrison will give an update on coronavirus (Covid-19) at 5.30pm. He is expected to extend the quarantine for foreign nationals for another fortnight \u2013 the national security committee has been meeting on that today. Meanwhile, this is what Melissa Price was avoiding during question time today: What did the auditor general want to provide an opportunity to respond to? This. They did not get a response Those interested in following along can do so here. The report was provided on 14 November 2019 to the adviser in the prime minister\u2019s office. Hehir says no documents were provided to the auditor general in response. The audit period took 10 months. We move from Don Farrell to Katy Gallagher, who asks why an adviser to the prime minister received extracts from the auditor general\u2019s proposed report before it was tabled. Grant Hehir says it was \u201cpretty standard practice\u201d to give \u201cnatural justice\u201d to those mentioned in the report. Grant Hehir repeats that the audit office is not sure what the legal authority was that allowed Bridget McKenzie to make the decisions she did. Grant Hehir is delivering his opening statement to the Senate committee looking at the government\u2019s sports grant program From Mike Bowers\u2019 lens to your eyeballs: Michael McCormack gestures to all his friends. Scott Morrison also looks for Michael McCormack\u2019s friends He finally learned to smile. Labor\u2019s Tony Burke is talking to Patricia Karvelas about last night\u2019s factional dinner: Sorry if I sound not especially engaged with the excitement of the fact a group of members for parliament were all invited to dinner on an email chain, and they were encouraged to talk about a particular policy issue if they came along. This happens in Canberra across a range of different opinions, different parties every night of the week. That\u2019s what has always happened. All that has happened is a journalist got hold of some emails which say no more than what members for parliament have said publicly. The auditor general will appear at the Senate inquiry into the sports grant affair in about 30 minutes. Asked if he voted for Llew O\u2019Brien in the deputy speaker ballot, Barnaby Joyce says it was a secret ballot and \u201cthe reason ballots are secret is that you don\u2019t tell people how you vote. Otherwise don\u2019t bother having them.\u201d Which leads to this exchange: Joyce: Who did you vote for at the last election? Ben Fordham: Who did I vote for? Which election? It\u2019s none of your business. Joyce: A-ha! You want to keep half your listeners, don\u2019t you Cyclone. Fordham: Ha, ha, ha, no, no, no, well you got me there. It\u2019s a bit like saying to someone what do you earn, it is one of those questions, you are right, you are right. Joyce: It is a secret ballot. Fordham: I am not going to ask you who you voted for in the last federal election, I know you voted for yourself. Joyce: When is the last time you had a nookie? See these are the sort of questions you just don\u2019t answer. Fordham: When was the last time I what? When was the last time you had a WHAT? Joyce: NOOKIE \u2013 you! Fordham: You are watching too much Married at First Sight. Joyce: Mate, I know they are all out of my league, mate, that crowd. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the former deputy prime minister of Australia \u2013 who is currently chasing his former job. Barnaby Joyce was live in the studio for that interview, which means he is not in Canberra, for parliament. Barnaby Joyce is \u201cnot going to bullshit people\u201d and say that he and Michael McCormack are friends, but he does joke out that he respects the job he is doing. There are members of the government \u2013 and the frontbench at that \u2013 who walked out of this apology. That also needs to be remembered. The Labor senator Tony Sheldon is delivering a speech in the chamber wearing no tie and what looks like a sports jacket and I think the dress standards may be slightly different in the Senate compared to the House. Barnaby Joyce is speaking to Sydney radio 2GB about the podcast he is making with Matt Canavan. He\u2019s always there to help. Question time has ended. And for those who missed Stuart Robert\u2019s answer on how the government can\u2019t tell you how many people are owed money from robodebt, because finding it is a \u201cmanual\u201d process, here you go: Scott Morrison somehow turns a question from Bob Katter on market gardens into an attack on the Labor right faction dinner: The member for Kennedy, like the many members that represent north Queensland \u2013 and I have got to say, there are so many members on this side of the House who represent north Queensland \u2013 they know what is important on the ground in those communities, Mr Speaker, and what I find disappointing is that 20 members of the Labor party have to gather together in a restaurant somewhere to try and get this leader of the Labor party to understand what is going on in regional Australia. He doesn\u2019t get it, they know he doesn\u2019t get it, Mr Speaker. I have concluded my answer and I would ask that further questions be placed on the notice board. Tony Smith had attempted to sit the prime minister down, because Anthony Albanese had got to his feet to ask about relevance, which is why Morrison continued all of that as one answer there. Richard Marles to Melissa Price on the submarine job issue: This failure is costing Australian jobs, so why didn\u2019t they provide a guarantee in the local jobs contract? Price: I think it is worth reminding what I have said earlier, which is that there are currently 137 Australian companies who are already in the project. We on this side, and I am sure all of those on the other side, are very committed to ensuring that we\u2019ve similar Australian industry content with respect to our $200bn investment. But Mr Speaker, getting this lecture from Labor, it is quite extraordinary. We do know in six years Labor did not commission the building of one naval vessel in an Australian yard. Not one naval vessel in an Australian yard. By contrast, we currently have 4,000 shipbuilding jobs in this country and we need 15,000. Price is reminded that was not the question. Again. And again, Tony Smith reminds her she can take it on notice. A suggestion she ignores for a second or third time: We are currently in the design phase and it has been very clear from the documentation that once the design, which is a very unique design, highly technical design, of these 12 submarines, once that process is finished, we will then negotiate an Australian industry content. In the meantime, the prime minister, myself, we on this side and I am sure those on that side, we are backing small and medium-sized Australian businesses to ensure we get the maximum Australian industry content and we are backing Australian businesses all the way. Meanwhile, the Coalition has passed 19 pieces of \u2018national security\u2019 legislation since 2013. The ghost of community theatre failure that possesses the Liberal MP Vince Connolly has once again forced the member of Stirling to his feet, where he delivers his dixer to Christian Porter like he has come from Rigel VII and is desperately attempting to convince the humans he is one of them. Mike Freelander to Scott Morrison: I dedicated my working life to the health of children. Children with developmental delay and other disabilities including autism requiring developmental diagnosis to qualify for the NDIS, children in disadvantaged areas, are waiting ... Why? Morrison: I will ask the minister for the NDIS to add to my answer. Can I commend you on the work you have been doing in that area over a lifetime, I know that area well and the high regard you are held in terms of the support you give to families and paediatric support in your community. I understand the reason for the question today and your deep concern about these matters. I share that concern and that\u2019s why we are providing support to the NDIS to make sure they can adjust the issues you raise in this place today. I will ask the minister go into those details. Stuart Robert: Yeah, thanks PM. Let me also reinforce the work over Dr Freelander\u2019s long history of service. When it comes to health diagnosis, we understand that is the responsibility of state, we can say it is unacceptable in terms of the length, it is the responsibility of state health authorities. Having said that, a diagnosis is not required for access into the early childhood intervention stream of the NDIS, that is clear in law and practice. In terms of access, the data showed people turning up with children seeking early intervention through the early intervention pathways are getting an access decision in three days. You don\u2019t need a diagnosis to enter the NDIS, that is down over 50 days. In terms of people accessing a plan, it has dropped from 54 days. Anticipating a range of issues the commonwealth learned on the second phase of functional assessment trial, which will conclude this month, all going well with results, and so far they are very positive, the commonwealth will go to market for a functional assessment partner, and will introduce functional assessments from one July this year. To quantify access to the scheme. Recognising the member\u2019s key point, it is important to understand, and for parents and the nation to understand, you don\u2019t need a diagnosis to provide an early child intervention partner. The act does not require a diagnosis, but I tell parents to get hold of the NDIS, speak to an early childhood early intervention partner, get that intervention as quickly as possible. The system is designed for it, access is currently three days. As Stephanie Dalzell, the ABC reporter who broke the story on the diagnosis rates, has repeatedly said today, diagnoses are important for a range of issues \u2013 not just the NDIS \u2013 and where you live, in terms of postcode, can really impact how long you are waiting for that important answer. Richard Marles to Melissa Price: When hundreds of defence industry workers at Osborne and Adelaide have lost their jobs, and there\u2019s reports of another 34 job losses announced today, why on earth is the government sending hull fabrication jobs to France, instead of keeping them here in Australia on the future submarines? Price: Mr Speaker, there\u2019s currently 4,000 jobs in shipbuilding at this point in time. We need 15,000 shipbuilding jobs. But once again, we\u2019ll not be lectured by those opposite. 4,000 jobs now, 15,000 jobs now, and we\u2019re working very hard to ensure we have the skill set in this country to ensure that we have the sovereign capability. We\u2019ll build those 12 submarines in Australia. We will build the workforce that we need. Richard Marles to Melissa Price: The contract for Australia\u2019s Collins-class submarines included a requirement for 70% local content, that was ultimately exceeded. This government asserted that 90% would be local content. Why on earth is there no binding percentage requirement for local content in the government\u2019s contract for the future submarines? Price: We are delivering a sovereign defence capability and, as I said in my last answer, mandating a minimum portion of Australian industry, particularly at this time ... during the design phase, would be counterproductive. ... We won\u2019t be lectured by those opposite. I would like to know how many submarines those opposite were considering to build. I think it\u2019s zero. Just a reminder that even the design process is delayed: Peter Dutton is now giving the worst description of the Muriel\u2019s Wedding Deidre Chambers gag I have ever heard. Michael McCormack finds it uproariously hilarious. That\u2019s how bad it is. It\u2019s time for JUST HOW SAFE ARE YOU with Peter Dutton. Shockingly \u2013 the answer is the same as it always is. IMAGINE IF LABOR WAS IN CHARGE. DUM.......DUM.......DUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMMMM Richard Marles to Melissa Price: What binding commitment to a percentage of local content did the government write into its contract for the future submarines? Price starts by talking about the Morrison government investment in the submarine program, but Tony Smith stops her to say it was a tight question, her time for preamble is over, and if she wants she can take it on notice. She does not take the hint. Price: We do know in term of the contract, sovereign control is critically important to us, as well as maximising Australian industry. We\u2019re currently in the design phrase for the submarines. There\u2019s over 130 Australian companies and organisations subcontracted. The actual proportion of Australian content on the submarines, Mr Speaker, will be determined as the design of the submarines is completed. ... Aussie, Australian small companies are vital to the construction of our submarines. And I\u2019m committed, the prime minister is committed, we are all committed here to building 12 submarines in this country, using Australian industry content. We have faith in our Australian industry. We are backing Australian industry. We are building 12 submarines in our country because we are going to create more shipbuilding jobs. Three things to take from that: Stuart Robert is still calling a court finding that the use of income averaging to calculate robodebts is illegal and its subsequent suspension based on that finding \u201ca refinement\u201d. The government still can\u2019t say whether it will repay the estimated $1.5bn it recouped from the scheme or even how many people are owed money. Because it is a MANUAL process (whereas robodebt, which the government defended for years, was automatic) No-voice Stuart Robert is among the best Stuart Roberts. Bill Shorten to Stuart Robert: Minister, how many Australians received debt notices issued under the government\u2019s illegal robodebt scheme, how much money are they owed, and when will they be repaid? Robert: As I responded to the leader of the opposition last week, the government announced that it has made a further refinement to the income compliance program, which is part of our ongoing commitment to continually strengthen and improve the scheme. It\u2019s undergone a number of improvements since its inception under Labor in 2011. In response to feedback, it will make the program more robust when receiving more information. We\u2019ve been carefully and methodically working to identify those customers whose debts may have been calculated using apportioned ATO PAYG... Tony Smith: I\u2019ve given the minister ample time for a preamble. The question itself didn\u2019t have a preamble. It asked for figures, essentially. And whilst the minister can\u2019t be expected to have those answers with him, he needs to be relevant to the question, or take it on notice. Robert: The process is highly manual in terms of finding the data and [it is] complex...as I informed the house. ... It\u2019s not appropriate to pre-empt that process and as I advised the House last week. I say the same thing now ... He then decides he has concluded his answer. Scott Morrison was just asked a dixer that basically was, can you deliver all the lines you have about the Labor right faction meeting in three minutes? The prime minister is thrilled to comply: Mr Speaker, I wish there was an alternative, that the Labor party might speak of, but there isn\u2019t one, at present, Mr Speaker. They have no alternative policy when it comes to this issue. So, Mr Speaker, when 20 members of the Labor party gather at the Otis restaurant, what I\u2019m more mystified by, they can find a consistent position of the leader of the opposition that they can actually oppose, Mr Speaker. I\u2019m staggered they can find any consistency in the opposition leader\u2019s policy on emissions or electricity or coal, because he has it each way every day. My advice to those meeting down at the Otis regularly, just wait till tomorrow, you\u2019ll have another policy. He\u2019s going to go odds and evens on climate policy. It will be \u2013 Joel, the member for Hunter, will agree with it on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday, but, and the member for Sydney can have her day on Tuesday and Thursday and Saturday, and as we go around the chamber, they will all get their go, because he\u2019ll agree with every single one of you on every single position you have. What that says about the leader of the opposition is his each way, every way, every day approach to policy is the reason why this leader of the Labor party can\u2019t be trusted any more than the last one. The last one liked to do dodgy deals around lazy Susans, this one is just the same, Mr Speaker. This place is filled with grown-up babies at the best of times, but today they are proving they are well overdue for a timeout and a nap. As a sidenote, I was never sent to my room for a timeout, because that is where my toys and books were. I was sent to the bathroom instead. Jokes on my parents though, because I used to hide books and toys in the towel cupboard. And that\u2019s why I am the well-adjusted blogger you see before you today. Julie Collins to Greg Hunt: Why is the government privatising the Aged Care Assessment Team, the only part of the system that everyone accepts is working well, including the New South Wales minister, Brad Hazzard, who describes this as a plan that lacks logic? Hunt: I reject the proposition in that question. I do that for a number of reasons. Firstly, because under the current scheme, under the current scheme, there are non-government contracts. And that is a very important thing to note. The second thing, though, and I want to challenge the fundamental assumption that things need, say, stay exactly as they are. They couldn\u2019t be better. All of this questioning is about how things can be better. They can be better in terms of the assessment system and the way that the experience of families occurs. How do I know this? In the Tune review, precisely the question that was raised by the member has been addressed. The answer goes on, but that is the crux of it. Angus Taylor gets the next dixer, and continues to prove that maybe, just maybe, vision boards and The Secret really do work. Anthony Albanese to Greg Hunt: Why do over one quarter of younger people who go into aged care die within a single year of entry? Hunt: In terms of individual cases, very much dependent on the circumstances. Younger people who go into aged care would be going in because they have a very serious condition, whether it\u2019s an acquired brain injury, whether it\u2019s some form of ... degenerative condition, or some other form of accident or illness. Having said that, the person who wrote into the terms of the royal commission the involvement and engagement and treatment of younger people in residential aged care was this person, the prime minister. I had the privilege of sitting with him when we drafted those terms. That was his personal passion. That was the focus and the humanity and the concern. What we have also seen is we have accepted the royal commission\u2019s embrace of those terms of reference. And in particular, there are three targets which the royal commission included in its interim findings, precisely to address the care and concern and cause of any harm relating to young people in aged care. Firstly, that people under the age of \u2013 that no people under the age of 45 should enter residential care by 2022. We have accepted and embraced that. No people under the age of 45 should be living in aged care by 2022. So living in, let alone entering. And thirdly, that no people under the age of 65 should be living in residential aged care by 2025. These are standards which have never been set before. These are goals which have never been set, and these are targets which have never been set and which we will achieve. So it\u2019s a deep and powerful commitment. So I would make this point \u2013 that under the former government, the number of younger people living in residential aged care moved from 6,577 to 6,478 in 2010. Now it\u2019s down to 5,606, and we\u2019re decreasing still further. It\u2019s become one of the priorities for the prime minister, and the relevant minister, and what we have seen is that the number of younger people entering residential, so this is entering residential aged care, has already decreased by 536 to 416 in March to June of 2019. A 22% decline, before the royal commission\u2019s interim findings. So the reason that these standards have been set is because the commission found the importance and need for them. But the reason the commission had that power was because this person, the member for Cook, the prime minister of Australia, personally drafted them. Josh Frydenberg gets his next chance to display his impressive lack of microphone skills with another dixer. Has he learnt that a microphone is designed to amplify your voice yet? No. Sadly, he has not. He does get in an Otis mention though. The bowl of microwaved rice wearing a House of Reps pin, Michael McCormack, delivers the first mention of the \u2018Otis group\u2019 \u2013 that came in at 26 minutes. I guess some people have to try to find personality wherever they can. He talks about the menu having \u2018ravioli and egg yolk\u2019 at the restaurant the Labor right faction met at \u2013 but he neglects to mention that even egg yolk has more substance and colour than him. He ignores the calls from Labor about when he is getting an invite on the Matt Canavan-hosted Weatherboard and Iron podcast. Ged Kearney gets the next question, either because someone from the Coalition forgot to jump, or Tony Smith went to the wrong side of the chamber. She asks Greg Hunt: The aged care royal commission drew attention to inadequate prevention and management of wounds [including residents and patients sometimes being left to sit in their own urine], sometimes leading to septicaemia and death ... [why is the government not addressing this neglect]? Hunt begins by talking about what Labor had promised, which is basically a repeat of the last two answers on this topic. Anthony Albanese gets up: The point of order is on relevance. It wasn\u2019t about the opposition, we can\u2019t fund things from opposition, only the government can. Tony Smith rules that is not a point of order, so Hunt continues: And in terms of those recommendations, not only have we adopted all of the findings of the interim report, but it stands in stark contrast to the utter hypocrisy and failure of the opposition. Given a chance, given a chance only a few months ago, they could have provided one, how many home care places did they provide? Zero. Now, in terms of the other items within the royal commission, it\u2019s an uncomfortable truth for the opposition, they had a chance and their provision was zero. But in terms ... Albanese points out there was no reference to alternative approaches in the question, and it was not about politics (which causes the government side of the chamber to laugh). Smith agrees with him and tells Hunt to get on with it. Hunt repeats his previous answers. Helen Haines asks about the delay in the government\u2019s federal integrity commission legislation and Christian Porter tells her it is coming, but needs consultation, yadda yadda yaddda, and everything is fine and the #sportsrorts affair is not proof that there needs to be one. Julie Collins to Greg Hunt: The minister just boasted about 10,000 more home care packages, only half of which are currently available. 28,000 older Australians died while waiting for their home care packages. Australians who have contributed all of their lives deserve better. Will the minister admit now that 5,000 packages in response to a waiting list of over 112,000 amounts to neglect? Hunt: I want to respond to the member with a very clear position. What we have done, we have done based on advice as to what is both the safest way to implement, to respond rapidly, and to respond to the royal commission. It was a royal commission which the prime minister called. It was a royal commission which he called as one of his first actions precisely to bring to light, precisely to bring to light all of the potential issues. And the commission\u2019s done a fantastic job. In responding and accepting all of the commission\u2019s interim findings, we made two points in relation to home care. One, 10,000 places. Secondly, in addition to that, that\u2019s part of a 44,000-place increase in the last two years, or an increase from 60,000 to 150,000, a 150% increase whilst we\u2019ve been in government. But two, we also accept their proposal for a broader strategic restructure. We are working in preparing for that, but of course, we\u2019ll have to see what the commission themselves recommends as their final recommendation. But we got on with it immediately. We got on with it immediately. I would remind the House at the same time as we have increased by 150% home care places, at a dramatically faster rate than the rate of older Australians has grown, which means we have a far higher per capita rate of home care places for older Australians than ever existed under Labor when they were in government, Labor had a chance during the course of the royal commission to match what we were doing, and they failed. Zero places. Not one, not a dollar, zero places on something they now seem to believe matters after the royal commission had been called. I would call what they did at the last election neglect. The purpose of this dixer seems to be, \u201cprime minister, why were we elected?\u201d, so Scott Morrison can remind his party they won government. Julie Collins to Greg Hunt: The median waiting time for the highest level of approved home care packages is almost three years. And the aged care royal commission found people who waited more than six months for a home care package had a 20% higher risk of death. Why on earth are older Australians facing a three-year delay when the minister knows it increases the risk of death? Hunt: The royal commission did make findings and we responded. We responded rapidly. That included 10,000 additional home care places, which has been part of a 44,000-place increase in the last year and a half and a tiny bit more. We have taken the number of home care places from 60,000 when we came to office to 150,000 now. That is a 150% increase. That is a dramatic increase in the number of home care places and at the last election, I note the opposition had a chance to contribute to the number of home care places and they provided zero. Zero home care places. So at a time when we have added 44,000, at a time ... in the last two years, at a time when we have increased by 150% the number of home care places, they added zero. At the very moment they had the chance to take a stand, to invest a dollar, at the time they were raising $387bn in taxes, and they provided zero. Not one extra home care place. So we have invested and increased by 150% the number of home care places, they had a chance, only a few months ago, to do this. At a time, at a time when we had called a royal commission ... Tony Burke stands up on relevance, but Hunt has decided he has concluded his answer. Anthony Albanese to Greg Hunt: Why are up to half of all older Australians in residential aged care malnourished? Hunt talks about the royal commission into aged care and the government\u2019s response so far: So let us be absolutely clear \u2013 we thank the royal commission for their findings. We embrace what they have found. We called that out and any other findings, we also embraced. That\u2019s why we established not just a royal commission, but a commissioner, a permanent standing commissioner, responsible for health and safety in aged care. And these are the actions that we\u2019ve taken, as I say, increasing not just in residential care, but also in home care, the support, the encouragement, and the protections, and we\u2019ll continue to do that without fear or favour. How long will it take for the first \u2018Otis\u2019 mention? Time will tell. Has someone told Peter Dutton? Or is he still hunting down the arsonists who caused the rain? The ABC\u2019s Stephanie Dalzell, who had a very important story today about delays in diagnosis for children with developmental delays (which has massive implications under the NDIS) has just spoken to the minister responsible, Stuart Robert: SD: You\u2019re encouraging them to have a discussion but the AMA\u2019s encouraging you to have a discussion with the NDIS in that you are potentially out of touch with what is happening on the ground. Is that a possibility? SR: No, I\u2019m pretty clear on how the NDIA runs. I run the organisation. It knows its response built is under the act and it knows it needs to get children in quickly and it is doing that. The quarterly data came out yesterday and it shows access decisions for children into early intervention is three days. SD: We\u2019re not talking about access decisions here. We\u2019re talking about a diagnosis. Why are families telling us they are not able to access NDIS money without the diagnosis? SR: I\u2019m telling you that is incorrect. You can access funding under the ... SD: [You are saying] the families are lying to us. SR: I\u2019m saying that through the pathway there is now, they can go through early childhood, to their early childhood partner to get access to the children and if they\u2019re having trouble with that, contact NDIS or the local MP because the law is very clear. My agency is very clear, the pathways are very clear, we are absolutely committed to taking care of children in the early childhood pathway and access right now. Six months ago it was 43 days and today it is three days from committing, speaking to an early childhood partner to accessing the NDIS. Robert blamed the states for any delays. David Gillespie: \u201cAt the moment, and going forward, I am supporting our leader.\u201d It\u2019s the downhill run to question time. I feel a serious case of ennui coming on. If you needed any more proof that Pauline Hanson is desperate, absolutely desperate, for your attention, she has just retweeted the ABC Insiders account, which referenced her speech yesterday. The man who helped kick off all the Nationals leadership issues by refusing to give him his support publicly, when asked on Sky News last week during his ill-fated deputy leader tilt, now says people aren\u2019t concerned with the \u201crats and mice\u201d issues that happen \u201cin the bubble\u201d. David Gillespie wants everyone to get over it. Sure. As SOON AS YOU STOP TALKING ABOUT AN ISSUE YOUR OWN PARTY CREATED AND CONTINUES TO STOKE. On the question of whether or not Barnaby Joyce would have another crack at the Nationals leadership, David Gillespie, who went for deputy leader and lost, tells Sky News that is \u201ccrystal ball stuff\u201d. \u201cThe focus of earlier in the week is now in the rear-view mirror and we are focusing on what people put us here to do.\u201d He says that \u201cwe all have varying levels\u201d of relationships and support \u201cin the building\u201d but at the moment, he is supporting Michael McCormack as leader. An emergency alarm has gone off somewhere in the building, causing a few of the automatic doors to close. And it\u2019s not because DPS has decided to quarantine the Australian public from its representatives, apparently. And another tweet from Pauline Hanson, who isn\u2019t in this for publicity as well. Culture wars aren\u2019t going to start themselves \u2013 it takes time, a retweet button, and plenty of stupidity. If Peter Dutton thinks 4-3 in the high court is \u201ca fairly split decision\u201d goodness knows what he thinks of the 51.57% \u2013 48.43% two party preferred vote which won the Coalition the election. Labor has responded to attorney general Christian Porter\u2019s suggestion the government could use other powers to deport Indigenous non-citizens, after the high court held it cannot use the \u201caliens\u201d power. The shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, told Guardian Australia: \u201cLabor rightly respects the decision of the high court; we expect the same from Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton.\u201d It will be interesting to see what Labor makes of any attempt to use the immigration power or race power to re-legalise deportation of Indigenous non-citizens, if the Coalition brings such a proposal to parliament. Matt Canavan made a joke on Sky News about wanting to join the \u201cOtis group\u201d. He then held a doorstop interview to talk about the same things he has been talking about all week \u2013 coal is good, need to do more on coal, doing what he can for his constituents yadda, yadda, yadda \u2013 before leaving because he had things to do. But then he remembered he hadn\u2019t repeated his Otis group \u201cjoke\u201d and, presumably recognising he\u2019d have a better chance of making some other news packages tonight by commenting on the Labor right faction dinner, returned to the cameras to make his \u201cjoke\u201d again. Mike Bowers was there for when he turned back \u2013 and once again proved why politicians love advancers. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has done his regular 2GB spot and unsurprisingly he agrees with attorney general Christian Porter that something should be done to regain the federal government\u2019s powers to deport Indigenous non-citizens. Dutton said: I\u2019m with the chief justice. This is a decision of the high court \u2013 as people will know it was four [justices] to three, a fairly split decision. The chief justice has made some very good points. The attorney general and our general counsel are having a look at it at the moment. There are significant repercussions. It essentially creates another class of people, which I think is a very bad thing. Obviously we have to adhere to the law, they\u2019ve interpreted the constitution. But for us it makes it harder: there may be other areas, particularly around citizenship or claims that people will now make, and no doubt lawyers will seek to exploit that. We\u2019ll wait for legal advice about our options to legislate where we can and try to restrict the damage. Dutton said the high court had \u201ccreated another class of people\u201d \u2013 in reference to the new category of Indigenous non-citizen non-aliens termed \u201cbelongers by the majority \u2013 and the aliens power in the constitution \u201cdoesn\u2019t apply to them\u201d. He said while the government could not legislate to overturn that restriction, the government would \u201csee what we can do to rectify it\u201d. In his minority judgment, justice Stephen Gageler laid out a blueprint for the government to follow to reinstate its deportation laws \u2013 suggesting the immigration power or the race power could be used to reinstate the ability to deport Aboriginal non-citizen non-aliens. Pauline Hanson is still tweeting about her speech yesterday. Someone really, really, really wants attention today. That Lowe is Philip Lowe, the RBA governor: Lols Because Matt Canavan hasn\u2019t had enough media attention of late, having only appeared in front of a camera every day this week, he has launched his own podcast. Weatherboard and Iron \u2013 coming to a not listened list near you. As a Queenslander, I get it. In terms of what Queensland is doing on emissions reduction, it is ahead of the federal position. And yes, Adani was approved, and that\u2019s a whole other cluster, but a lot of Queenslanders \u2013 the 50% which live in the south-east \u2013 are not in the thrall of coal. Queensland is the largest decentralised state in Australia. Half the population lives outside the cities. That is what makes it a moody bish, and that is why it\u2019s politics are always all over the shop. But it also means that one person does not, and cannot, speak for what the whole state wants. Hence Chalmers\u2019s frustrations. Also on RN this morning, Jim Chalmers got a bit shirty about Queensland\u2019s views on climate being represented federally by Matt Canavan. Fran Kelly: Anthony Albanese on this program this week also said that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t think there\u2019s a place for a new coal fired power plant in Australia\u201d. You\u2019re a Queenslander. Will this make it harder for Labor to win back those coal seats up north? Chalmers: I don\u2019t think so, Fran. There\u2019s two parts to your question. The first bit \u2013 the point that Anthony is making, rightly, is that new coal-fired plants are not a smart investment. They don\u2019t make economic sense when there\u2019s cheaper and cleaner renewable technology available, and investors have made that clear for some time now. So that\u2019s part of your question. The other part about Queensland is really important. There is no prouder Queenslander than me. I don\u2019t like how Queensland gets caricatured on these issues by this simplified belief there is one homogenous view in Queensland and that Matt Canavan is somehow the arbiter of that view. There are a range of views in Queensland. There\u2019s also a recognition that we can find a way to do something about climate change without abandoning some of our traditional strengths and while being cognisant of the impact on some of the communities, particularly in central and north Queensland. That is not beyond us, Fran. Queenslanders do want us to do something about climate change. They want us to be cognisant of those other issues. They want us to be sensible about it and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be. And then there was this on 6 February, from Scott Morrison\u2019s interview with Alan Jones: Alan Jones: Are you concerned in any way about the objectivity of the advice coming from the World Health Organisation? These are the people who are saying, in spite of other countries cancelling their flights, keep the borders open, keep the borders open, yet they have, of course, declared it an international emergency. The head of the World Health Organisation is this bloke Adhanom, and I made this point twice yesterday. He\u2019s the member of the Ethiopian Marxist Leninist party in Ethiopia, are renegotiating billions of dollars in loans from Beijing and for a railway line that links the capital to Djibouti. So why wouldn\u2019t he be congratulating China on their work in containing the virus? Do you think that people believe that China has been really transparent in all of this? The World Health Organisation says you can have confidence in China\u2019s capacity to control the outbreak, but it was only in December that eight doctors were arrested and forced to confess to spreading false rumours, which weren\u2019t, in fact, false. Are you concerned about the objectivity of this advice? Morrison: Let me answer it this way. When we started taking our action, we were one of the first countries to do so, we were doing that completely independent, frankly, of what the declarations were of the WHO. We moved \u2013 I mean, our chief medical officer, Dr Brendan Murphy, was calling for the WHO to declare this a week before they did. So we were working on the basis of Brendan Murphy\u2019s advice. You know, we were accessing information from the WHO, and in crises like this you have to be, you have to ensure that you\u2019re acting on your own information. You draw it from a range of different sources and you make the calls in Australia\u2019s interests. I mean, the WHO has never supported travel bans. That\u2019s a policy position they\u2019ve had for a long time. Now we\u2019ve had one, we were one of the first countries, ours actually activated before the United States\u2019 one did. So we have, we\u2019ve been very proactive on this and we\u2019ve noted all the things the WHO and others said. But frankly, we\u2019re making the calls based on what we think is best for Australia. And you\u2019ve got to always in this environment, I think, be careful about the information you\u2019re using. You\u2019ve got to interrogate it. But we\u2019re relying on our health advisers. Scott Morrison spoke this morning about the virus formerly known as coronavirus \u2013 now called Covid-19 by the World Health Organisation. He said the virus was being contained in Australia, thanks to the advice of the chief medical officer, and the whole of government response. He then went into one of the issues facing the response, which was misinformation about the virus (the chief medical officer also spoke on this earlier this week, warning that xenophobia was creeping into people\u2019s response to the virus). Here is what Morrison said: Now one of the things you always have to address is misinformation. I mean, this is true in in any area of natural disaster. I mean, one of the things that used to frustrate me so much, when I visited so many incident control centres, is we would have dedicated resources to people just correcting misinformation on social media. And I gotta say mainstream media as well, reports that were just simply wrong. I think the media on these issues also do a tremendous job. But correcting misinformation is something I\u2019d hope the media would be a great partner in doing. Jim Chalmers was speaking to Fran Kelly this morning, as we have mentioned. Here is what he had to say about the promised surplus: We\u2019ve said all along that the priority should be supporting communities affected by the fires and some of these other challenges as well. It remains to be seen how big an impact those things will have on the budget. The budget surplus is really a test that the government has set for itself. We won\u2019t know for a little while yet whether they have met that test. And on whether Labor would prefer the government to spend, rather than save for a surplus: We\u2019ve been very constructive about that. If the government falls short of this test that they set for themselves it won\u2019t only be because of the fires, coronavirus or drought. It will be a combination of things, including a long period of economic mismanagement which has seen them fall well short of their forecasts for growth, wages and other things in the economy. We\u2019ll look at the numbers when they come out. We\u2019ve been constructive about it. This is a government that promised a surplus in its first year and every year after that but they haven\u2019t delivered a surplus yet and that\u2019s why they\u2019ve more than doubled government debt. I know that John Howard and Peter Costello really, really loved saying that the budget was like a household budget and that the surplus was saving money in the bank while paying down credit cards, but it\u2019s really not like that. Money the government cuts is money it is cutting from you. The Senate looks fairly boring today, but there is the first sports grant Senate inquiry hearing scheduled later today. The auditor general, Grant Hehir, is appearing at that inquiry from 4pm. Continued from previous post: Labor has also been rumbling post-election with a succession of rightwingers having views about how to do a redux on climate policy and the shadow minister, Mark Butler, gritting his teeth and saying we are not going to shrink from doing what needs to be done. We know that Fitzgibbon and some others in the right of Labor think the ALP has to do more to appeal to their traditional constituency rather than being seen to sign up, exclusively, to progressive values in the city. We know that Fitzgibbon has positioned himself as the key person to carry this message post-election. Commonsense tells you he\u2019d be assembling a caucus of opportunity to better express this view internally. But the crux of this story remains in development. If there is to be a fight, the fight doesn\u2019t happen in a Kingston restaurant, when factional folks meet for dinner. There are factional dinners every week parliament sits. The argument happens in the shadow cabinet and the caucus. The rubber is going to hit the road when Labor fleshes out its climate policy. The party (as Anthony Albanese told Radio National this week) has already started trying to put that picture together \u2013 but there\u2019s a way to go. Morning all. \u201cThe only breakaway I\u2019m aware of is the Otis breakaway,\u201d chortled Scott Morrison to the reporters stopping him after a Women\u2019s Day breakfast in the parliament. The prime minister is referring to a story broadcast on Ten last night concerning a group of Labor rightwingers dining together at a Kingston restaurant, presumably called Otis. At one level, this story is nothing at all \u2013 \u201cLabor rightwingers in Labor rightwingers eat dinner shock\u201d. At another level the anecdote tells you something of what\u2019s going on inside Labor at the opening of the new political year. Let\u2019s work through this. The Otis group is largely comprised of conservative rightwingers in the small states. The NSW rightwinger Joel Fitzgibbon was also in attendance at this week\u2019s dinner. We know that both the government and Labor are having difficulties trying to land positions on climate change that are sympathetic to sensibilities in coal communities and in the cities. Both sides are having difficulties because this is a really difficult task. Liberals and Nationals have been in open disagreement during the past fortnight. Darren Chester is back in the chamber. The Gippsland MP collapsed yesterday, which he says the doctors have put down to fatigue. He is back on deck today and says he is fine. Anthony Albanese also spoke about the right faction meeting at a press conference this morning: Q: Can I start first with the Otis group. Apparently, you didn\u2019t know about this group. What discussions have you had with members of that group? AA: I suspect that people went out to dinner last night too and they had dinner in a few restaurants. I did. That\u2019s what happens in Canberra. People go out and people chat about ideas. There is nothing unusual about this. Q: Is there tension, though, within the party about coalminers versus climate change? AA: The Labor party is united in our position that climate change is real, that we need to act on lowering our emissions. And indeed that \u2013 as I outlined in the Jobs and the Future work vision statement, in Perth, a statement that was unanimously agreed to by the caucus \u2013 good action on climate change means more jobs, lower emissions and lower energy prices. That\u2019s Labor\u2019s objective. The division in this House is on the other side. The Coalition of chaos. We see Michael McCormack last night on TV say that we\u2019ll just wait and see whether there\u2019s another challenge to his leadership. We\u2019ve seen the Coalition that has an absolute majority on the floor in the House of Representatives actually lose a vote on the floor this week. Not just lose, but get slaughtered, 75 to 67. The fact is they are in chaos. That is why we have no plan for anything except marketing and spin from this government. No plan for the economy. No plan for climate change. No plan for energy. No plan for wages. If you needed any more proof that Pauline Hanson really, really, really wants to stir the outrage pot, she has tweeted out her speech on Closing the Gap multiple times today already. Scott Morrison was also asked this morning if he was worried about a potential \u201cbreakaway\u201d group within the Coalition \u2013 that would be the LNP MPs who are once again agitating to set themselves up as their own party room, because it is a day ending with Y and some of the Queenslanders are upset. The only breakaway I am aware of is the Otis breakaway. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s Milo and Otis or it\u2019s just Otis or how many others there are involved in this. But more than 20 Labor MPs getting together ... I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lazy Susan at the Otis, but that tends to be the way things are done in the Labor party. They go off to lunches, they make deals, and it seems the leader of the opposition has a few things to explain when it comes to his last trip around the lazy Susan. Thursday is always the worst day of the week. Also \u2013 Milo and Otis jokes are cancelled. It was a movie that came out a million years ago and I think kittens died. So no. And the bells are ringing for the start of parliament. Huzzah. Jacqui Lambie was just on Sky News. She told Annelise Nielsen and Tom Connell that she will not speak to the government about its \u201censuring integrity\u2019 bill (the union-busting one that failed after Pauline Hanson pulled her support from it late last year) until the government releases Gaetjen\u2019s sports affairs report. The government doesn\u2019t have a timetable on that bill as yet, so it might not be the pressure point some people hope it will be. Plus, if Hanson supports it, it will pass. On the pressure Michael McCormack has been under as Nationals leader, Scott Morrison says: He has the full support of his colleagues, he has my full support as prime minister, and we have a lot of work to do, with dams to build, with roads to build, with the economy \u2026 to continue to build in rural and regional Australia which is going to bounce back. Rural and regional Australia is going to bounce back strongly under the policies that we\u2019re putting in place as a government. [They] have been rolling out for many, many years and rural and regional Australia, particularly through the drought, is doing it tough. People in rural and regional Australia can see those opportunities ahead. They can see the hope and we\u2019re going to continue to get behind them to realise the hopes they have for the future. Pauline Hanson is being Pauline Hanson, as she attempts to get as much attention as possible during Queensland\u2019s election year. Her latest attempt to stir outrage was her speech on Closing the Gap. She has blamed Indigenous people for not doing enough to improve their lives, while completely ignoring more than 200 years of systemic disadvantage and attempts by white governments to wipe Indigenous people, and their culture, from the map. Here is some of what she had to say: Closing the Gap is complete rubbish, and my thoughts are echoed by many Aboriginals who take the time to meet with me. As far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s a joke. The call for recognition is just a feel-good smokescreen that hides the true problems. The biggest problem facing Aboriginal Australians today is their own lack of commitment and responsibility to helping themselves. Closing the Gap is the marketing term used by politicians and bureaucrats so they can feel good about themselves and get in front of TV cameras and pretend they\u2019re doing something to lift remote First Nations people out of their self-perpetuating hell holes. Most Australians know that tens of billions of dollars are spent each year to help alter the standard of living between those in remote Aboriginal communities and even those living in our developed parts of Australia. When you spend billions of dollars a year on any group of people you expect outcomes. Sadly, those billions have gone to the non-productive, unrepentant Aboriginal industry, not to where it should go, the grassroots Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is an industry that has achieved no notable benefits in pulling our First Nations people out of squalor, domestic violence and poverty. When I speak here today I represent the quiet Australians, those Australians who have had a gutful of the billion dollar handouts with very little to show for them. Oh, and some within the LNP (the Queensland Liberal-National party, which is one formal party instead of a coalition) are talking about breaking away and sitting as their own party. They are *always* talking about breaking away. It\u2019s their thing. It\u2019s what they do. It happens every single parliamentary year. And yet ... here they are. Probably because reason prevails and they remember they will have absolute zero power if they remove themselves from the party rooms that are actually in government/have larger numbers. It\u2019s as ridiculous as getting excited over a Labor faction meeting. Parliament is hosting the UN Women\u2019s International Womens\u2019 Day breakfast this morning (the actual day, 8 March, is on a Sunday this year, and falls after parliament sits). Before anyone whaddabouts me, International Men\u2019s Day is 19 November and you are more than free to hold your own morning tea. Welcome to the last sitting day of this week. There is a one week break after this, and the mood in the building could best be described as \u2018GETOUTOFMYWAYIHAVETOGETOUTOFHERE\u2019, which, honestly, is a mood most of them have put on themselves. The Nationals are still trying to convince everyone that they have moved on. Party president Larry Anthony had a chat to Laura Jayes on Sky News this morning, where he said that the party wasn\u2019t at its \u201cfinest\u201d when it was talking about itself. Which might explain the last two years. That follows Michael McCormack\u2019s interview with the Nine Network\u2019s Chris Uhlmann yesterday, where he said that people hadn\u2019t seen what a fighter he was yet. (Insert eyeroll emoji) On that front though, it is worth pointing out that the Barnaby Joyce camp didn\u2019t have the numbers when they challenged \u2013 which we know because they lost \u2013 and they have since lost a number, with Llew O\u2019Brien no longer sitting as a National (he is a sitting as a LNP MP now, and only joins the joint party room) so you would think that McCormack is safe, at least for now. But the nufty keeps talking about it, so he is keeping it in the public eye, because there is nothing the Nationals like more than relevance. A dose of reality would be great. Meanwhile, it does pay to turn attention back to the promised surplus, with the economic conditions making it increasingly likely Josh Frydenberg is about to join the Wayne Swan club \u2013 promising a surplus without delivering one. The bushfires, the drought, the world economy and now Covid-19 (formerly known as coronavirus) is having a massive impact on a surplus which was already downgraded at the mid year update. Jim Chalmers is keen to keep it in the public view, telling the ABC this morning that the government is about to fail a test it set itself. And then there is this mastery of doublespeak from the prime minister during the election campaign: \u201cWe have brought our budget back to surplus,\u201d Morrison said during a leaders\u2019 debate. \u201cWe\u2019re the party and government that has done that. And I think Australians can trust us to keep it in surplus\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s not in surplus now,\u201d Sabra Lane, the moderator, said. \u201cI said next year,\u201d Scott Morrison answered (he had not, but you should be used to that by now). \u201cI said we brought the budget back to surplus next year\u201d. I mean I get it. I have reached my ideal weight next year too. We\u2019ll have all of that, and everything else that happens as we cover the death throes of the first sitting week. You have Mike Bowers, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp and Katharine Murphy, and I have had half a coffee, so we are all winners. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it.",

Ranked 16th in the world, China contested the 1999 Women\u2019s World Cup final - they\u2019re no slouches in the women\u2019s game, and thanks to a recent directive from the premier, football is once again on the rise. The outbreak of the coronavirus may have denied China the rights to host these preliminary qualifiers, and then disrupted the team\u2019s travel and training plans significantly. But coming off 6-1 and 5-0 wins respectively, they\u2019ve already shown themselves to be in fine fettle. On the line is top spot in Group B - a draw or a win will see Australia book a home-and-away double date with Group A runners up Vietnam next month. A loss and the Matildas will face the more fancied South Korea, as Asia decides its final two spots to take on the world in Japan.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-02-13T07:45:45.731Z\">at 7.45am GMT</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Australian fans knew it would be tough - but few perhaps would have expected as dominant a performance as that from the visitors China. Defensively, they were disciplined and resolute - well-marshalled by the skipper Wu Haiyan; offensively they were sharp in transition with Tang Jiali\u2019s sharp finish for the go-ahead-goal as good as any you\u2019d see in world football. But having hurried and harried the Matildas for 90+ minutes, with scarcely a minute to go they were undone by some clever hold-up play from substitute Kyah Simon and a superb finish from the in-form Emily van Egmond. A draw in the end enough for Australia to finish top of Group B and to book a two-legged playoff against Group A runners up Vietnam, with China to face South Korea. The home leg of that will take place Friday 6 March in Newcastle with kickoff at 8pm. Some concerns and question marks over the Matildas\u2019 lack of fluency and disjointed play. At times they mislaid simple passes and turned over possession cheaply. Still, the scoreboard sometimes is enough - and in this instance, it secures the desired result. Thanks for your company - we hope those of you supporting Australia still have fingernails. Some interesting body language from the skipper Kerr and her teammate Foord post-game, shifting uneasily on their feet during media interviews. Perhaps still reflecting on a disappointing personal performance. Ante Milicic speaks to the broadcasters post-match. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t an easy task to play through them, and we didn\u2019t have all the solutions. We did have phases where we played through them, and shift them around.\u201d \u201cTonight as a team we were down. But Emily\u2019s been in great form and we\u2019re delighted for her. But all the girls worked very hard.\u201d Wowee. What a relief for Australian fans. The Matildas know they were in a real battle there. We saw China push top nations like Germany at the World Cup - and they were more than a handful, despite a terrible lead in to the tournament due to the coronavirus\u2019 effect on their preparations. Phil Withall\u2019s msged in with his two pence. Have to agree entirely, Phil. Great tenacity from the Matildas. And all credit to the Matildas. My oh my. How was the ending to this one! There\u2019s the whistle, and that\u2019s all she wrote. A pulsating finish - and Australia remain top of the group, and book a final playoff against Vietnam. What a tournament van Egmond has had - she\u2019s saved the Matildas once again. There have been question marks over the execution tonight, but you cannot fault the heart and the determination to draw level. Even after that late goal from Tang. Hard luck on China - they must have thought they\u2019d won it. They\u2019d done everything and then some to do so, but the Matildas emerge with top spot. 90 + 3 min: No! Can you believe this?! Australia pump the ball into the mix and it\u2019s great strength from Simon to hold the ball. It\u2019s laid off to Emily van Egmond on the edge of the box and thwack! She puts the boot through that and it flies into the back of the net! A terrific strike, and pure emotion from the women in gold. They\u2019re back level. Right at the death! 90 + 2 min: It\u2019s a long ball lumped forward.. and it falls at the feet of Kerr.. but she can\u2019t get it out of her gait! If ever there was a chance, was that it? 90 min: That\u2019s the end of regulation time, but we\u2019ll have four minutes added by the officials. Simon comes together with a Chinese defender inside the box, at the expense of a corner. What can Australia muster? Peng comes and claims. She\u2019s been very good tonight, the Chinese shot-stopper. 88 min: So, a big five minutes if Australia are to finish top of Group B. They throw bodies into the box as a cluster of bodies compete for a Matildas free kick. But it\u2019s cleared by China. 86 min: Oh my. We thought it might take something special, but that was an effort from the very top draw from Tang Jiali. A smart pass inside from Ma, and the striker puts her left boot right through that; and it rockets past Williams! What a strike, and what a moment for China. You can\u2019t say they haven\u2019t deserved this. 83 min: A freekick from long range, but it sails harmlessly over the bar. A cross into the mix might have been the better option for China there, but still - can\u2019t fault the self-belief. At the other end it\u2019s Simon bearing down on goal, and she fashions a shot from an acute angle, but it\u2019s off target. 81 min: The substitute Song Duan spins Carpenter with aplomb, before firing a fierce effort at Williams. Again though, it\u2019s a narrow angle. That\u2019s five shots to two on target for the visitors. Remember, they did catch the corner of post and crossbar just before half-time. 79 min: What a finish to this one, we have in store! As so often happens as bodies tire, this one is opening up, and the chances are beginning to present themselves with increasing regularity. The question is - who will take advantage of this better? 76 min: A dangerous ball into the box from China, but the faintest of touches from Kennedy at full stretch prevents it from reaching the striker. Tang Jiali then hits a terrific shot from the edge of the box after a clever spin, and now the Chinese fans in the stadium have found their voice once again. Wu rises highest for the header from the corner, but can\u2019t send it goalwards. 73 min: second substitute, as Kellond-Knight makes way for Yallop. She slaps the hand of the assistant coach - perhaps with a little frustration there? It\u2019s not been the experienced midfielder\u2019s night either. Foord with a sharp curling effort that just evades the far post. She hasn\u2019t given up - perhaps haunted by the three times she struck the woodwork last time out. 71 min: Best chance of the match for the Matildas! It\u2019s clever work from Simon down the right who finds a teammate centrally. Foord\u2019s shot rebounds and falls, of all people, to Sam Kerr! But the \u2018keeper Peng dives at the feet, at the expense of a corner. For just a second you thought that was it, for the home side. 68 min: And there is that first change - it\u2019s Raso who gives way for Simon. Meanwhile, China are through one-on-one - it\u2019s Wang with the chance, but it\u2019s Polkinghorne with a remarkable last-ditch tackle! That\u2019s better from the veteran, but Wang really did dwell too long on that. Another warning shot across the bow for Australia. 65 min: \u201cIt\u2019s just unusual to see Kerr like this, and the Matildas [as well]\u201d. That\u2019s the word from commentary from a woman who would know - 61-cap former Matildas, Michelle Heyman. She has been starved of decent supply, the skipper. But perhaps still adjusting to an injury-affected slow start to life in the UK. 62 min: Foord with a clever jink inside as she looks to tee up a far-post cross for Kerr, but it sails just a touch too high. The skipper applauds the effort. That\u2019s the hour mark - is it Kyah Simon time? Could she be X-factor off the bench? 59 min: With China defending in a 4-4-2 block there\u2019s nominally an extra player for the Matildas in midfield, with Kellond-Knight, van Egmond and Logarzo squaring up against Ma and Yao. A lovely combination as Foord releases Raso down the right, and the winger uses the decoy run of Kerr to remove a defender and cut inside - but her shot is well blocked. 55 min: A nice bit of orchestrated clapping from the home fans as they try to lift their team. For all the concerns that China are shading this contest, it remains 0-0 and the shooting opportunities have been reasonably limited for both sides. 52 min: A nice charge from Ellie Carpenter from right back. She looks up and sees the shooting chance - and it\u2019s a decent connection, that just flashes past Peng\u2019s right-hand post. 50 min: I\u2019m hard-pressed to remember a less fluid performance from the Matildas in recent years. China are hurrying and harrying, and the passes - from experienced players with 50+ caps - are going astray. A close up of Ante Milicic on the sideline, who cuts a pensive figure at this stage. 48 min: It\u2019s China out of the blocks, as Tang Jiali pinches the ball of Polkinghorne once again, before fashioning a shot from an acute angle. Williams saves well. Second half! 45 min: Ooph. I\u2019ve hardly had time for my HT ablutions and herbal tea.. but we\u2019re back! No changes to my knowledge from either side. Here\u2019s a man who knows a thing or two about playing international football in Asia, and he\u2019s not exactly overwhelmed by the display from the home side thus far. So. Your thoughts on that opening stanza? Are the Matildas fortunate to still boast a share of the lead, or is the draw the fair reflection? Remember, as it stands - should it finish equal Australia will finish top of the group. This fact could force China to play a little more proactively in the second half. And there is the whistle! A dramatic end to the half. You\u2019d have to say that neither side deserves to be behind, but had China taken a sneak lead late on you could hardly begrudge them for the willing work and effort across that first forty-five. 45 min + 1: There\u2019s two minutes added and in the shadow of half time we have the closest we\u2019ve come to a goal! Wang Shanshan lines up with a long-range effort as she looks to loop over a backpedalling Lydia Williams - but it catches the vertex of the post and crossbar! 44 min: China with an attacking freekick from a wide area, but it\u2019s driven hard and flat into the mixer, and the Matildas\u2019 centre back pairing scrabble it clear. 41 min: Raso looks to break onto a swift counter, but her pass can\u2019t pick out Kerr centrally. It\u2019s been far from fluid from the Matildas so far - but credit the lift in opposition from the opening two games for some of that. 38 min: Again the flag is up, and this time it\u2019s the fullback Zhai caught offside. These have all been marginal calls, to the obvious chagrin of China\u2019s head coach, Xiuquan Jia. Australia will have to be wary - they only have to get it wrong once to be punished. 35 min: And another big let off, as the Chinese striker Wang bursts through on goal one-on-one, only to be flagged for offside. Replays suggest that was perhaps not the case though. A touch of fortune for the home side. 33 min: China earn a corner down their right-hand side, and a fair contingent of fans inside the stadium raise their voices. It\u2019s a scrabble inside the box as the Matildas fail to clear on two or three occasions, before a fierce ricochet fires past Williams post! That was a real scare for the Matildas - that could have just as easily bustled in the net. 30 min: A bit of niggle between Logarzo and Tang Jiali. She\u2019s a \u201cspirited\u201d competitor, Chloe, and apparently not enjoying the close attention from her Chinese counterpart. A better contribution from Logarzo, who joins the play late from midfield and gets on the end of a cross - but her headed effort flies wide! 27 min: Headed effort from Kerr! But it arcs just wide of Peng\u2019s right-hand post. A nice ball in from Carpenter - both she and Catley will look instinctively for the skipper in the box. Meanwhile an email from Don: How times have changed. At my age of 64, who thought I would know more names of the Matildas players than the Socceroos. Ha. Cheers Don - in terms of top-end talent you have to say the Matildas do boast some internationally regarded names. None less than Sam Kerr who, as you\u2019ll recall, was voted the world\u2019s best female player last year in the Guardian\u2019s top 100 poll. 26 min: Some nice interplay down Australia\u2019s right as Carpenter, Kellond-Knight and Raso link passes. A little patch of sustained pressure and some positive play from the Matildas. 24 min: Freekick to the Matildas, again in a useful central area, about 25m out. This time Kellond-Knight lines it up - and she goes top left corner, but Peng moves well to execute the save! Best chance of the match so far - fine football from both. 21 min: Australia enjoying a lot of the early possession, but mostly at the back. As expected it\u2019s a disciplined and organised Chinese team without the ball. Kellond-Knight and Van Egmond failing to see much of the action in central positions. A rare chance as Carpenter whips in a cross, but it evades Foord at the far post. 18 min: Nervy moments at the back as Polkinghorne has her pocket picked by one of China\u2019s strikers. It\u2019s a concern we\u2019ve seen before at the World Cup - the new approach is comfort on the ball, but for some of the Matildas it\u2019s not always an adaptation that can happen overnight. 15 min: Another whistle as Raso is caught late Zhai Qingwei. Watch that space - and early booking and the fullback could be in trouble over the next 75 minutes. 13 min: A break in play as we stop for a blood bin with Hayley Raso copping a trailing arm from the Chinese left back. Just me or has this been a rugged start from the Steel Roses? It\u2019s a terrific name, by the by - capturing the grace and the bite of this Chinese side. We\u2019ve seen a bit more of the steel so far though, you\u2019d warrant. 10 min: The Matildas with very little time on the ball - it\u2019s a noticeably more high-octane first ten minutes than we\u2019ve seen over the opening two clashes from Campbelltown, but as we know you can\u2019t press for 90 minutes. 7 min: It is Kennedy who takes it, but it\u2019s gathered well by Peng, despite scooping up the effort on the bounce. She might be disappointed with that, the central defender - she does fancy herself as a threat from set piece. 5 min: The whistle blows against Wang who catches Williams in goal with a trailing leg as she looked to run down an overhit pass. Logarzo now goes down after a heavy contact with China\u2019s skipper, Wu. Kennedy stands over a free kick from a useful area, around 25m out. 3 min: Huge cheers as Sam Kerr gets her first touch - it\u2019s a lovely ball from Catley down the left, but the skipper is adjudged to have been offside. A tight one, replays suggest. It\u2019s a great combination between the vice-captain and captain, look for that play to feature prominently tonight. A frenetic few moments as play breaks both ways, before Caitlin Foord peels off the first shot of the evening but it drifts harmlessly wide. Kick off! 1 min: And we\u2019re away! No rapid attack from Australia this time, as the Matildas enjoy possession in the back and middle thirds. China press and look lively without the ball. Our players are out on the field - where there\u2019s a nice moment as dignitaries from Australia and China exchange presents and confirm a mutual friendship between the two nations. The anthems are observed, and there\u2019s some decent noise from the crowd inside Parramatta Stadium. What a stadium for football. Just lovely. You may recall China made it to the final 16 (the same stage that Australia exited the competition) at last year\u2019s World Cup in France, going down to Italy - a team that also shocked Australia. Some of their leading stars from that tournament won\u2019t be here, notably, Paris St Germain\u2019s Wang Shuang, but there\u2019s still plenty of experience out there for the Steel Roses. Wang Shanshan boasts 130+ caps, with skipper Wu Haiyan approaching 120. And here\u2019s the starting XI for China: Peng Shimeng (GK), Lin Yuping, Wu Haiyan, Luo Guiping, Zhai Qingwei; Zhang Xin, Ma Jun, Li Ying, Yao Lingwei; Wang Shanshan, Tang Jiali. Li Ying, Tang Jiali and Wang Shanshan all boast three goals already across the past two matches, so those three will be the immediate dangers. It\u2019s a strong, well-organised XI that\u2019s been preparing for some years for these Olympics - so they\u2019ll be definitely more than competitive. An early goal - or at least not conceding - could be key for the Matildas. So, first to team news - specifically Australia\u2019s XI to start, where it\u2019s a return to what you\u2019d have to say is Ante Milicic\u2019s strongest eleven. He\u2019s rotated and chopped and changed across the tournament - wise given the context of three games in quick succession and given most of his outfielders the chance to impress. But it\u2019s seven changes from the XI that took on Thailand, spearheaded by none other than Captain Fantastic, Sam Kerr. I\u2019m still chasing details on China\u2019s XI, but we\u2019ll have those details through as soon as they emerge. Hi all! A best of greetings to you wherever around the world of WoSo you\u2019re following our coverage tonight. Are you a Matildas fan stuck in a far flung corner of the globe? Or are you hotel-bound in Wuhan, climbing the walls for a lack of outdoor adventure? No doubt there will plenty of interested parties watching this one around the world - not just the scouts from Korea or Vietnam. We\u2019d love to hear from you whatever your circumstances might be - fire us an email or tweet to join the conversation. First topic: predictions! After two emphatic results against Chinese Taipei and Thailand the Matildas\u2019 journey towards the Tokyo Olympics faces a final group stage test tonight - the might of the globe\u2019s most populous nation. Ranked 16th in the world, China contested the 1999 Women\u2019s World Cup final - they\u2019re no slouches in the women\u2019s game, and thanks to a recent directive from the premier, football is once again on the rise. The outbreak of the coronavirus may have denied China the rights to host these preliminary qualifiers, and then disrupted the team\u2019s travel and training plans significantly. But coming off 6-1 and 5-0 wins respectively, they\u2019ve already shown themselves to be in fine fettle. On the line is top spot in Group B - a draw or a win will see Australia book a home-and-away double date with Group A runners up Vietnam next month. A loss and the Matildas will face the more fancied South Korea, as Asia decides its final two spots to take on the world in Japan.",

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But he added that the country should not rely on the change of the seasons coming to the rescue \u201cin any way\u201d, adding that a four-point tactical plan was in place for the UK.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt this point in time \u2026 we have a strategy that relies on four tactical aims. The first is to contain, the second is to delay, the third is to do the science and the research, and the fourth is to mitigate so that we can actually brace the NHS,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>He said that the future prevalence of coronavirus was heavily dependent on what happened in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a> and that currently the situation could go \u201cone of two ways.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThe first way is that China gets on top of the epidemic \u2026 and that there are spillover cases all over the world but those are contained and we will have cases in the UK \u2013 that is highly likely, we may even get a bit of onward transmission in the UK \u2013 and then the epidemic goes away,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe alternative is this is not possible to contain in China and then this starts to spread, probably initially quite slowly around the world and at that point unless the seasons come to our rescue then it is going to come to a situation where we have it in the EU, and in the UK.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked about the new case in London, Whitty said that officials were not in touch with everyone who had been on the same plane as the person who is now confirmed to have the virus, just those who had been in close proximity. Further infection of people who were outside that vicinity was unlikely, he added.</p> \n<p>Whitty added that finding a vaccine in the short term was unlikely and impractical, suggesting that work on exploring the use of anti-viral drugs was a better focus. \u201cPeople talk about vaccines, it will in my view be a long while until we have a vaccine that is ready to deploy but we need to get on with that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to look at existing drugs, like existing HIV drugs \u2013 and the Chinese are starting to do this \u2013 and test if the existing drugs work against this virus. Some may, some may not.\u201d</p> \n<p>But he added that work had to be focused on containing the virus and delaying its spread as any drugs were only likely to be useful for a minority of people, as most who caught the virus would have few or no symptoms.</p> \n<p>Whitty said that people in the UK should not be changing their behaviour but taking sensible precautions to avoid getting any virus, such as covering their mouths with a handkerchief or tissue when sneezing or coughing and throwing used tissues away safely.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/03/how-to-protect-yourself-from-coronavirus\">How to protect yourself from coronavirus</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On the Today programme on Wednesday, Prof Neil Ferguson, an infectious disease expert from Imperial College London, said he thought new cases of the virus could still arise and the world was in the \u201cearly phases of a global pandemic\u201d.

The change in China to include what are known as \u201cprobable cases\u201d appeared aimed at heading off complaints about the availability of tests and treatment for residents, as well as questions about whether officials have been underreporting cases.

In Cambodia, passengers on a cruise ship that spent two weeks at sea after being turned away by five countries over fears that someone aboard might have the coronavirus cheered and clapped as the vessel finally arrived at port. The MS Westerdam, carrying 1,455 passengers and 802 crew, docked in Sihanoukville in the evening after anchoring offshore early in the morning to allow Cambodian officials to board the vessel and collect samples from passengers with any signs of ill health or flu-like symptoms. Disembarkation is due to take place on Friday. As UK health officials prepared for more cases of the virus after the first confirmed sufferer in London, US officials said a second case had been confirmed in San Diego. The person was an evacuee from Wuhan and was among 232 people placed under quarantine at the Marine Corps Air Station in Miramar after being airlifted from Wuhan.

Today, it is central to global supply chains and there has been an enormous increase in travel to and from the country, thus heightening the risk of the virus spreading. In 2003, China\u2019s oil demand was 5.7 mb/d and by 2019 it had more than doubled to 13.7 mb/d (14% of the global total).

      "bodyText": "Finally, European stock markets have closed for the day, and it\u2019s a rather mixed picture. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 ended 82 points lower, or over 1%. Stocks were hit by the stronger pound, as traders anticipate a splurge of growth-friendly measures in next month\u2019s budget. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets, says: The cruse of the coronavirus in China is clobbering the FTSE 100 as some of the biggest fallers on the index are connected to the country in question. China\u2019s the world\u2019s largest importer of oil so the renewed fears about the health crisis have hit stocks like BP and Royal Dutch Shell. Mining stocks such as BHP, Rio Tinto as well as Anglo American are lower too. It has been a double whammy for the FTSE 100 as the drive higher in sterling has dented internationally focused stocks like GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, plus Unilever. Firms that derive a large portion of their total revenue in a collection of foreign currencies often get hit when the pound jumps. Other markets did better, though, with France only slightly lower, Germany flat, and Italy up slightly. But it\u2019s been another day dogged by coronavirus worries again, as companies count the cost of the ongoing disruption in China. Fears that the eurozone could be dragged into recession have dragged the euro to its lowest level since May 2017. The EC\u2019s latest economic forecasts added to the gloom, with coronavirus labelled a major downside threat to the already-weak recovery. The IEA send a shiver through the markets too, by predicting the biggest drop in oil demand since the financial crisis. E-commerce giant Alibaba revealed that the disruption in China is hurting its business. With shops and factories closed, many deliveries simply aren\u2019t happening. American fashion Ralph Lauren warned its profits will be hit, as it has closed many of it stores in China for weeks. And in the UK, JCB is cutting production levels as it can\u2019t get enough parts from China. JCB, the UK maker of yellow diggers, is cutting production and working hours at its UK factories as it faces component shortages from China. JCB is planning to cut working hours for around 4,000 employees from 39 hours to just 34 from next Monday. Overtime has also been suspended. Staff won\u2019t take a pay cut, though - they\u2019ll have to work the hours back later this year. The problem is that a quarter of JCB\u2019s suppliers in China are still closed, due to virus-related restrictions, so they can\u2019t ship enough components to Britain. I think this makes JCB the first major UK manufacturer to cut output because of Covid-19 -- airlines such as British Airways have already cut flights to China. JCB chief operating officer Mark Turner explains: \u201cThe disruption to the component supply chain in the UK comes at a time when demand for JCB products is very strong, so while this course of action is very unfortunate, it is absolutely necessary to protect the business and our skill base. \u201cProduction in the UK has so far been unaffected by the situation in China. However, more than 25% of JCB\u2019s suppliers in China remain closed and those that have reopened are working at reduced capacity and are struggling to make shipments. \u201cIt is therefore clear that the inbound supply of certain components from Chinese partners will be disrupted in the coming weeks as they seek to replenish their stocks. \u201cThis inevitably means we will not have the required amount of parts needed to build our forecast number of machines in the short-term. \u201cThese measures will ensure that, while we will produce machines in lower than anticipated numbers, we will do so with the same number of employees, whose skills we will need to fulfil customers\u2019 orders when the situation returns to normal.\u201d The New York stock market has opened in the red, as traders respond to today\u2019s jump in coronavirus cases and deaths. Dow: Down 133 points or 0.45% at 29,417 S&amp;P 500: Down 11 points or 0.33% at 3,368 Nasdaq: down 47 points or 0.5% at 9,678 Economists at HSBC have cut their forecasts for China\u2019s economic growth in the current quarter - for many of the reasons cited by Alibaba today. Reuters has the details: HSBC said on Thursday it had lowered its first-quarter forecast for mainland China\u2019s economic growth to 4.1% year-on-year from 5.8% due to the fallout from coronavirus. The bank also cut its China full-year growth forecast to 5.3% from 5.8%, adding the impact was already starting to be felt in tourism, trade, supply chains and elsewhere. HSBC lowered its full-year estimate for global growth to 2.3% from 2.5%, adding it expected the brunt of the impact in the first quarter, with some improvement as the year progresses. CEO Daniel Zhang also revealed that Alibaba has been procuring medical supplies from around the world, and donated more than 40 million units to Wuhan and other affected cities (that\u2019s via Yahoo! Finance) Zhang adds that Alibaba are \u201cmonitoring the challenge and identifying opportunity as the situation evolves.\u201d Freshippo, its supermarket chain, has seen a big jump in online orders as customers try to get fresh goods, groceries, and daily necessities delivered to their homes. But the company is struggling to satisfy all these orders due to delivery constraints. Newsflash: The coronavirus outbreak is a \u201cBlack Swan event\u2019 which is having a \u2018significant impact\u2019 on China\u2019s economy, according to its biggest company. Daniel Zhang, CEO of e-commerce giant Alibaba, has warned that the outbreak poses near-term challenges to its business. Speaking on a conference call to discuss Alibaba\u2019s latest results, Zhang is explaining how operations have been hurt by the virus, which has forced factories and offices to stay closed for longer after the Lunar New Year. He says: Chinese merchants and logistic companies have been prevented from resuming work after the Lunar New Year. A \u201csignificant number of packages\u201d have not been delivered on time over the last two weeks. Orders to restaurants, food delivery firms and other local services have \u201cdeclined noticeably\u201d Zhang adds that it is too soon to quantify the full impact of the outbreak on Alibaba, and that the company is \u201cclosely monitoring the challenge\u201d. This is a useful insight into the impact on the Chinese economy, and helps explain why the IEA has slashed its oil demand forecasts today. Newsflash: US fashion group Ralph Lauren has warned that its profits will be hurt by the coronavirus crisis. It says that approximately two thirds of the Company\u2019s stores in the Chinese mainland have been temporarily closed over the past week, and is bracing for further lost sales as travel is restricted in Asia and parts of China. This will knock up to $70m off its sales in the current quarter, and up to $45m of operating profits from Asia. Supply chain disruptions in China could also hit orders globally, it warns. Executive chairman Ralph Lauren, which founded the firm, says: \u201cOur hearts are with the many impacted by this virus. Our number one priority is keeping our teams, partners and consumers safe.\u201d The City has responded to Sajid Javid\u2019s shock resignation by driving sterling to a two month high. The pound has hit \u20ac1.20 against the euro for the first time since December\u2019s election. Why? Because Boris Johnson\u2019s team may now have a tighter grip on the Treasury, letting them drive through infrastructure spending projects, slash taxes and raise borrowing. That could result in higher growth -- good for the pound, and making interest rate cuts less likely. Paul Dales of Capital Economics says: We already thought that the Budget on 11th March would involve an extra loosening in fiscal policy worth 0.5% of GDP, which coming on top of the extra government spending announced in September 2019 would mean a fiscal boost of 1.0% is in the pipeline. It\u2019s now possible that the Budget will provide a bigger bang. Back in the City, investors are digesting the shock news that Sajid Javid has resigned as Britain\u2019s finance minister. Javid has quit, it seems, after refusing to sack his officials and work with a team from number 10. It means a sudden promotion to chancellor for Rishi Sunak (previously chief secretary to the Treasury), with less than a month until the budget! Sunak has previously worked for Goldman Sachs, and the Children\u2019s Investment Fund (a hedge fund). The move has pushed government bond yields up, as the City anticipates that the Number 10 may push through more infrastructure spending by overriding Treasury concerns about borrowing. Andy Sparrow\u2019s Politics Live blog has all the action on a dramatic reshuffle day in Westminster. Today\u2019s coronavirus gloom is going to hit Wall Street, and push stocks down from this week\u2019s record highs: Financial data firm MSCI has warned that coronavirus could have a much bigger impact on the global economy, and the markets, than SARS back in 2013. In a new report, they point out that China\u2019s share of the world economy is much more significant, so companies across the globe will feel a knock-on impact. They write: The number of people infected and affected by the coronavirus continues to grow globally. Governments, as well as agencies such as the World Health Organization, are working tirelessly to contain, and ultimately defeat the virus. In China, local governments have locked down cities and businesses and restricted travel. And the general public has adopted voluntary home quarantine. The human toll has been steep. As with many crises, the repercussions of the coronavirus can also be felt in the global economy and the financial markets. Many observers compare the coronavirus to the 2003 SARS epidemic. While this can provide useful insight, there are differences between the two periods to consider. China is a much bigger part of the global economy and markets than it was 17 years ago. China\u2019s share of global trade rose to 11% in 2018 from 5% in 2003, based on World Bank statistics. Meanwhile, its share of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index has risen to 34.3% from 7.86% in 2003. The chart above also shows that the Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia and Korean stock markets are all most linked to China. The stock market selloff is accelerating, with European markets down 1% and the UK\u2019s FTSE 100 down 1.5%. The IEA\u2019s oil market forecasts, and the EC\u2019s gloomy comments on coronavirus, are both a factor. But traders are also alarmed by a big jump in cases overnight --including an extra 254 deaths in Hubei province and 15,000 extra confirmed cases. This increase follows a change in methodology used by China\u2019s authorities -- so investors want to see whether cases keep rising sharply, or tail off. Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, explains: If the change in methodology does result in a rise in the growth rate of reported cases, market sentiment will inevitably deteriorate, reversing the more upbeat tone of recent days as markets had become increasingly reassured that the virus will soon plateau. Markets will be very closely watching the number of new reported cases over the coming days. Overhanging the latest report is also the suspicion that authorities have been supressing news of the true severity of the infection, potentially re-inflaming the spread of fear via social media once again. As long as investors are questioning the credibility of \u201cofficial\u201d virus-related news flow, they will struggle to regain confidence in any potential growth rebound. Markets are extremely vulnerable to negative news flow around the coronavirus. Risk assets will continue to be volatile and susceptible to sharp moves as long as sentiment rules the day. Cailin Birch, global economist at The Economist Intelligence Unit, predicts that oil prices will remain at current low levels until the summer -- and longer if the coronavirus crisis worsens. Here\u2019s her take on the IEA oil demand forecasts: The outbreak of the coronavirus in mid-January has significantly dented the outlook for global oil demand in 2020, and therefore oil prices. The oil market remains highly sensitive to news reports on the Chinese authorities\u2019 attempts to contain the virus; the average daily price of Brent crude lost nearly 20% of its value between January 20th and the start of February, as the seriousness of the outbreak became clear. Since then, daily prices have risen and fallen in line with the assessment of the infection rate. The announcement on February 13th of more than 14,840 new presumed infections in Hubei province, which was partially due to a shift in diagnostic criteria, will send prices down slightly in the near-term. Assuming that the virus is contained by end-March, which scientific literature from China suggests is a strong possibility, The Economist Intelligence Unit expects Chinese GDP growth to rebound in the second half of 2020, after a very weak first half. We expect the price of Brent crude to stay below US$60/b for the first half of the year, before making a modest recovery to US$65/b in the third quarter. Nonetheless, risks to this forecast are primarily to the downside, and we are not out of the woods yet. Here\u2019s some reaction to the IEA\u2019s prediction that oil demand will fall sharply this quarter: Germany, France and Italy -- the EU\u2019s three biggest countries -- are expected to grow the slowest this year, the EC adds. NEWSFLASH: The EU has warned that the coronavirus crisis is a \u201ckey downside risk\u201d to the European economy. In its new Winter Forecast, the EU warns that the Covid-19 outbreak could hurt growth this year. The outbreak and spread of the \u20182019-nCoV\u2019 coronavirus and its impact on public health, human lives and economic activity has been a source of mounting concern. It has spurred uncertainty about the short-term prospects of the Chinese economy and about the degree of disruption across borders at a moment in which global manufacturing activity remains at a cyclical low. The baseline assumption is that the outbreak peaks in the first quarter, with relatively limited global spillovers. The duration of the outbreak, and of the containment measures enacted, are a key downside risk. The longer it lasts, the higher the likelihood of knock-on effects on economic sentiment and global financing conditions. The EU adds that economic sentiment and global financing conditions could suffer from a prolonged outbreak. This would hurt the supply side of the economy, if workers are kept at home, and the demand side, as travel bans and shop closures will hurt spending. Despite this risk, the EU is still forecasting growth of 1.2% in 2020 and 2021, as in 2019. European stock markets are falling deeper into the red. The FTSE 100 is now down by 1.5%, or 113 points, following the IEA\u2019s gloomy predictions of falling oil demand. Royal Dutch Shell and BP are both down over 3%. Holiday firm TUI has lost 5%, and cruise operator Carnival has shed 3%. Crude oil prices are down 1% today, as the IEA\u2019s warning adds to coronavirus gloom. The IEA points out in today\u2019s report that prices have already fallen sharply: The impact of Covid-19 for oil prices have been sharp: Brent values fell by about $10/bbl, or 20%, to below $55/bbl. Before Covid-19 came along, the market was already nervous in anticipation of a supply overhang of 1 mb/d in the first half of 2020 due to continued expansion in the US, Brazil, Canada, and Norway. The IEA also warns that retailers may not pass these savings on: The effect of the Covid-19 crisis on the wider economy means that it will be difficult for consumers to feel the benefit of lower oil prices. NEWSFLASH: Global oil demand will fall this quarter for the first time in a decade due to the coronavirus, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). The IEA has just slashed its forecasts for oil demand, which it says has already been \u201chit hard\u201d by Covid-19 and the \u201cwidespread shutdown of China\u2019s economy\u201d. Demand is now expected to fall by 435,000 barrels per day year-on-year in the first quarter, the first quarterly contraction in more than 10 years. Global oil demand was around 100.7 million barrels per day at the end of 2019, for comparison. The IEA has also cut its forecast for oil demand growth during 2020 by 365,000 barrels per day to 825,000,. That would be the lowest annual increase since 2011. In its latest oil market report, the IEA says: The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) is a major global public health emergency that has brought tragedy to many lives. Its impact is still unfolding globally. There is already a major slowdown in oil consumption and the wider economy in China. While the SARS epidemic of 2003 is widely used as a reference point for analysis of Covid-19, China has changed enormously since then. Today, it is central to global supply chains and there has been an enormous increase in travel to and from the country, thus heightening the risk of the virus spreading. In 2003, China\u2019s oil demand was 5.7 mb/d and by 2019 it had more than doubled to 13.7 mb/d (14% of the global total). Moreover, last year China accounted for more than three-quarters of global oil demand growth. The consequences of Covid-19 for global oil demand will be significant. Demand is now expected to contract by 435 kb/d in 1Q20, the first quarterly decrease in more than a decade. For 2020 as a whole, we have reduced our global growth forecast by 365 kb/d to 825 kb/d, the lowest since 2011. Growth in 2019 has been trimmed by 80 kb/d to 885 kb/d on lower-than-expected consumption in the OECD. The report is online here. Barclays has posted better-than-expected revenues and profits today, but this has been totally overshadowed by fresh questions over CEO Jes Staley. Staley, the bank revealed this morning, is by investigated by UK financial watchdogs over whether he was sufficiently transparent about his links to the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. Those links date back to Staley\u2019s previous role at JP Morgan, when he reportedly visited Epstein in prison during his 2008-09 sentence. My colleague Kalyeena Makortoff explains: The American banking boss, who joined Barclays in 2015, says he developed a relationship with Epstein in 2000 when he was running the private bank at JP Morgan. Epstein died in prison last year while awaiting trial on charges of sex-trafficking underage girls. Staley told journalists that the relationship started to \u201ctaper off\u201d as he left JP Morgan in 2013 and that contact became \u201cmuch less frequent\u201d before it ended at the end of 2015. He claims the final visit took place around \u201cmiddle to late 2015,\u201d when Staley took his yacht, the Bequia, to visit Epstein\u2019s private Caribbean island. As the investigation was revealed on Thursday, Barclays said it had conducted an internal review and had no concerns over the way its chief executive had characterised his dealings with the convicted sex offender. A spokesman said the bank was aware of the relationship with Epstein ahead of Staley\u2019s appointment in October 2015. More here: Renewed worries about the coronavirus are hitting European markets this morning. The Stoxx 600 index of EU-listed companies has lost 0.5%, dropping back from Wednesday\u2019s record high. London\u2019s FTSE 100 has been particularly badly hit, shedding 70 points or almost 1%, to 7463. The energy sector is the biggest faller, with Royal Dutch Shell and BP losing 2.5%. Mining companies are also among the fallers, reflecting concerns that global growth is going to take a hit this year. Cruise operator Carnival are down 3.5% -- yesterday it warned that the virus will have a material impact on its earnings this year. French spirits group Pernod Ricard has cut its profit forecasts, due to the coronavirus outbreak. The maker of Martell cognac, Glenlivet whiskey, Absolut vodka and Perrier-Jou\u00ebt champagne now expects operating profits to only grow by 2% to 4%, down from 5-7% previously. China is a growing market for Pernod Ricard, so the clampdown on movement is going to hurt demand for drinks in the weeks ahead. Pernod Ricard warned shareholders that \u201cthe environment remains particularly uncertain from a geopolitical standpoint, with the additional pressure related to the Covid-19 outbreak.\u201d Neil Wilson of Markets.com also blames yesterday\u2019s grim eurozone industrial output figures, and the coronavirus crisis, for causing the euro\u2019s latest weakness. The euro is weaker for several reasons but the deterioration in industrial production numbers yesterday was important. Output declined by 2.1% in the final month of the year. For the whole of 2019, industrial production was down 4.1%. The disruption to supply chains from the coronavirus could hardly come at a worse time. The ECB\u2019s big bazooka last September - Mario Draghi\u2019s parting shot \u2013 looks more like a pea shooter. But that won\u2019t stop the ECB from trying to do more. It\u2019s time realise this approach to monetary policy is dead \u2013 the EZ and Germany in particular must come around to fiscal stimulus. The euro was already on a weakening path, before coronavirus worries shunted it back below $1.10 this month. Jessica Hinds, economist at Capital Economics, says the Covid-19 outbreak threatens to extend the slump in manufacturing. \u201cEuropean car manufacturers in particular are already warning of potential shortages of components due to factory shutdowns in China. \u201cSo even if the virus is soon brought under control, eurozone industry is likely to remain in recession in at least the early part of this year.\u201d The euro has fallen for seven out of the last eight days as \u201cconcerns over the European economy linger\u201d, says Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The euro is under pressure. Fears of a eurozone recession this year have driven the single currency down to its lowest level since May 2017. With factories already hit by trade war tensions, the disruption caused by the coronavirus crisis is threatening to wipe out growth altogether. European airlines have already been hit by the Covid-19, and supply chains around the world are already feeling the strain. The cancellation last night of Mobile World Congress, the huge business conference in Barcelona, has shown that business leaders are more jittery. This has pushed the euro down to just $1.086 against the US dollar, as traders rush into safe haven assets. Steve Englander, head of global G10 FX research and North America macro strategy at Standard Chartered, says the markets are concerned about the European economy. The eurozone economy almost stalled in the last quarter, with GDP rising by just 0.1% in October-December. Hopes of a pick-up in Q1 2020 are fading... ...especially after data yesterday showed eurozone industrial production slumped 4.1% in December, its weakest performance since the 2012 sovereign debt crisis. Englander says (via the FT) that: \u201cThe main impact of coronavirus for Europe is growth. \u201cThe euro area started the year with low growth and an ECB largely out of policy options. The hope was that . . . fiscal expansion would begin. However, the negative growth shock has reduced this hope.\u201d Deutsche Bank warned earlier this week that the coronavirus crisis could drive Germany into recession this year, as its manufacturing sector will be hurt by slowing demand from China. It\u2019s a headache for the European Central Bank, where new chief Christine Lagarde is reviewing the bank\u2019s strategy. European stock markets have shrugged off these concerns, hitting record highs yesterday. But they\u2019re going to drop back today, after a sharp jump in coronavirus cases and deaths. Later today the European Commission will publish its new winter forecasts, which may show that Brussels policymakers are getting gloomier. The agenda 10am GMT: European Commission presents its winter forecasts 1.30pm GMT: US inflation for January; expected to rise to 2.5% year on year, from 2.3% 1.30pm GMT: US weekly jobless numbers; expected to show a rise of 210k, up from 202k",

Two staff from Lewisham hospital in south London are now in isolation at home after coming into contact with the woman, a Chinese national who had recently arrived in the city from China. Lewisham hospital on Thursday confirmed the unnamed patient had not followed public health officials\u2019 advice and had simply \u201cself-presented\u201d at its A&amp;E unit on Sunday afternoon. She did not arrive by ambulance or her own private vehicle and went straight to the A&amp;E reception desk to report her symptoms \u2013 both clear breaches of guidance aimed at stopping the spread of the virus. No other patients were exposed to the risk of infection by the manner of her arrival, the hospital said. The woman was then sent home pending the results of her tests. On Wednesday she was taken to another London hospital, St Thomas\u2019, for treatment. In a message to staff, Ben Travis, the chief executive of the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS trust, said: \u201cWe wanted to let you know that we have had a confirmed case of coronavirus from a patient who self-presented at the A&amp;E department of University hospital Lewisham (UHL) last Sunday (9 February). \u201cThe test result was confirmed as positive yesterday (Wednesday 12 February) and we have been in touch with all staff who came into contact with the patient.

As soon as the patient did this, the patient was given a mask and then escorted to be tested in the dedicated area we have assigned for coronavirus testing outside the A&amp;E building \u2013 while awaiting the installation of a purpose-built \u2018pod\u2019. \u201cAs further assessment was required, the patient was then taken to a dedicated isolation room in the emergency department. In line with our protocols, throughout their care the patient was escorted and did not come into contact with other patients. The patient was later discharged and taken home by London ambulance service.\u201d Some staff were exposed to a risk of infection as a result of her walking straight into the A&amp;E, rather than going to the ambulance bay to be met by trained doctors and nurses in hazmat suits, which is what happens with most other possible coronavirus cases. Travis added: \u201cAll staff who had direct contact with the patient have been contacted, including two members of staff who are undergoing active surveillance at home for a 14-day period as a precautionary measure \u2013 following the advice of Public Health England.\u201d Contrary to previous media reports the woman did not ring the NHS 111 advice service before she went to the hospital. \u201cIf she had done that, things would have happened very differently when she got here. She wouldn\u2019t have walked into A&amp;E for a start and correct protocols would have been followed,\u201d said a member of staff. Hospital personnel were concerned when they became aware that a coronavirus carrier had been on the premises. However, Travis emphasised that members of the public were not put at risk because she was taken to be tested by a route that avoided patients. The Uber driver has little chance of contracting the infection because he was not with the woman long enough, Public Health England said. \u201cAs the journey was less than 15 minutes the driver did not have close sustained contact with the individual and is not considered high risk,\u201d said Dr Rachel Thorn Heathcock, a PHE consultant. Someone has to have had \u201cclose and sustained contact\u201d with a carrier \u2013 defined as within two metres of them for at least 15 minutes \u2013 to be at risk, PHE added. Dave Smith, the chair of the Royal College of Nursing\u2019s Emergency Care Association, said: \u201cIt\u2019s worrying to hear that the public aren\u2019t following Public Health England advice about phoning NHS 111 to seek advice, and therefore putting other members of the public and NHS staff at risk of contracting coronavirus.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Japan has announced its first death from the coronavirus outbreak, hours after confirming 44 more cases on a cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo, as fears of the spreading disease mount in the country.</p> <p>The health minister, Katsunobu Kato, said the first fatality was a woman in her 80s who had been in hospital since 1 February, when she was diagnosed with pneumonia.</p> <p>Her confirmed diagnosis came after her death, he said. The woman, a resident of Kanagawa prefecture near Tokyo, was the mother-in-law of a taxi driver who also became a newly confirmed case, Japanese media reported. Health ministry officials declined to officially confirm a relationship at the request of the family.</p> <p>Authorities also confirmed two more cases: a doctor in his 50s who works at a hospital in western Japan and a man in his 20s who lives in Chiba, near Tokyo. None had a record of travelling abroad in recent weeks or contacts with Chinese nationals \u2013 a possible sign that the virus is spreading inside the country.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, Kato said there were 44 more cases on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/05/coronavirus-cruise-ship-carrying-3700-quarantined-in-japan-after-10-test-positive\">Diamond Princess</a>, which is still carrying nearly 3,500 passengers and crew members. The cruise ship now has 218 people infected with the virus aboard out of 713 tested since it entered the port of Yokohama on 3 February, the largest cluster of infections outside China.</p> <p>There was better news, however, for passengers aboard the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/12/westerdam-cruise-ship-with-2000-onboard-refused-port-by-four-countries-amid-coronavirus-fears\">Westerdam</a>, a cruise ship carrying 2,200 passengers and crew that docked in Sihanoukville, Cambodia, on Thursday after being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/12/westerdam-cruise-ship-with-2000-onboard-refused-port-by-four-countries-amid-coronavirus-fears\">turned away</a> by several other ports in Asia because of fear of the virus.</p> <p>Cambodian authorities were carrying out health checks before allowing passengers to leave the ship.

      "bodyText": "Japan has announced its first death from the coronavirus outbreak, hours after confirming 44 more cases on a cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo, as fears of the spreading disease mount in the country. The health minister, Katsunobu Kato, said the first fatality was a woman in her 80s who had been in hospital since 1 February, when she was diagnosed with pneumonia. Her confirmed diagnosis came after her death, he said. The woman, a resident of Kanagawa prefecture near Tokyo, was the mother-in-law of a taxi driver who also became a newly confirmed case, Japanese media reported. Health ministry officials declined to officially confirm a relationship at the request of the family. Authorities also confirmed two more cases: a doctor in his 50s who works at a hospital in western Japan and a man in his 20s who lives in Chiba, near Tokyo. None had a record of travelling abroad in recent weeks or contacts with Chinese nationals \u2013 a possible sign that the virus is spreading inside the country. Earlier in the day, Kato said there were 44 more cases on the Diamond Princess, which is still carrying nearly 3,500 passengers and crew members. The cruise ship now has 218 people infected with the virus aboard out of 713 tested since it entered the port of Yokohama on 3 February, the largest cluster of infections outside China. There was better news, however, for passengers aboard the Westerdam, a cruise ship carrying 2,200 passengers and crew that docked in Sihanoukville, Cambodia, on Thursday after being turned away by several other ports in Asia because of fear of the virus. Cambodian authorities were carrying out health checks before allowing passengers to leave the ship. Disembarkation is due on Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ve had so many near moments we thought we were going home only to be turned away,\u201d Angela Jones, a US tourist on board, told Reuters. \u201cThis morning, just seeing land was such a breathtaking moment.\u201d No cases of the virus have been detected on the ship, but about 20 passengers have reported stomachaches or fever, Cambodian health officials said. The ship\u2019s health staff considered them to be normal illnesses, but the affected passengers were being isolated from others, a health ministry spokeswoman said. The World Health Organization\u2019s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, praised the Cambodian government\u2019s decision. \u201cThis is an example of international solidarity we have been consistently calling for,\u201d Tedros said. \u201cOutbreaks can bring out the best and the worst in people.\u201d Japanese authorities, meanwhile, said they would allow some older passengers to leave the Diamond Princess to spend the remainder of their 14-day quarantine in government-designated accommodation. \u201cIf they test negative, those who wish to disembark can go and live in a lodging facility that the government will prepare,\u201d Kato said. We will make every effort to ensure the safety and peace of mind of the people.\u201d Priority is being given to passengers aged 80 or older who are staying in a cabin without a balcony, and those in a similar age range with chronic health conditions. About 80% of the ship\u2019s passengers are aged 60 or over, with 215 in their 80s and 11 in their 90s, according to Japanese media. The Diamond Princess\u2019s passengers and crew were originally to be quarantined on board until 19 February. The ship \u2013 home to the single largest cluster of infected people outside China \u2013 has been moored off Yokohama, near Tokyo, since 3 February after it emerged that a former passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong last month had tested positive for the virus.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe issue remains how are we going to be able to say what is happening with the trajectory of the outbreak when the cases definitions change midway through the epidemic?\u201d Hunter said. \u201cWill the figures be backdated? Also, what about cases that have a clinical diagnosis but negative lab tests, are they included in the confirmed cases or not?</p> \n<p>\u201cI have no problem with people using different case definitions but please be consistent or if you do change, run both in parallel for a few days so that no one believes the epidemic has suddenly got a lot worse. I suspect but can\u2019t be certain that the underlying trend is still downwards.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9ed4e84a9e05979776b58b2a2bf311797e827d7\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9ed4e84a9e05979776b58b2a2bf311797e827d7/0_407_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police wearing masks guard a road checkpoint outside Son Loi in Vietnam\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vietnamese olice wearing masks guard a road checkpoint outside Son Loi near Hanoi which is on lockdown due to coronavirus.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yves Dam Van/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The rest of China is only reporting confirmed cases of Covid-19 infection.

Top stories New South Wales police have compiled a secretive watch list of potential offenders \u2013 including a disproportionate amount of Indigenous children \u2013 for two decades, the state police watchdog has revealed. Described as an opaque system of \u201cpreventive policing\u201d, the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission\u2019s investigation into the Suspect Target Management Plan found \u201cunreasonable surveillance\u201d, \u201charassment\u201d and \u201cintrusive\u201d policing tactics, having reviewed the cases of 429 children aged nine to 17 on the watch list.

A list of funding options, including the INAS Global Games, was drawn up, but rejected in favour of the shooting study conducted by a consultancy group following a limited tender. A sudden spike in the number of coronavirus cases is not due to a \u201csignificant shift in the pattern of mortality or severity\u201d, the World Health Organisation has confirmed, but rather an uptick in retrospective diagnoses within the Hubei province. China also confirmed an additional 254 deaths, bringing the toll to 1,370, while Vietnam has placed 10,000 people under quarantine.

A Melbourne dentist has been given permission by the federal court to serve Google to ascertain the details of an anonymous account that left a bad review. Dr Matthew Kabbabe is seeking to sue the user for defamation, but the internet giant has in the past argued that reviews are necessary for accurate customer information. Former teacher and rugby league player Chris Dawson will stand trial for the murder of his wife Lynette, having been committed by magistrate nearly 40 years after the alleged crime took place. Labor has downplayed reports of up to 20 MPs meeting to form a breakaway pro-coal faction within the party, with the Coalition quick to accuse the opposition of internal divisions over climate policy, something leader Anthony Albanese has denied. The world The Antarctic has registered a temperature above 20C for the first time in history, prompting fears of climate instability in the world\u2019s greatest repository of ice.

Amsterdam\u2019s mayor has called for a ban on red-light district coffee shops selling cannabis to foreign tourists, as the city of just over a million people struggles to cope with more than 17 million visitors each year.

The first way is that China gets on top of the epidemic [\u2026] and that there are spillover cases all over the world but those are contained and we will have cases in the UK, that is highly likely, we may even get a bit of onward transmission in the UK and then the epidemic goes away. That is possible. The two things that may do that are the extraordinary efforts of the Chinese government and possibly a change in the seasons,\u201d he said. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cThe alternative is this is not possible to contain in China and then this starts to spread, probably initially quite slowly around the world and at that point unless the seasons come to our rescue then it is going to come to a situation where we have it in the EU, and in the UK. \u201c</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But he added that we shouldn\u2019t rely on the change of the seasons coming to the UK\u2019s rescue \u201cin any way\u201d. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cAt this point in time [\u2026] we have a strategy that relies on four tactical aims. The first is to contain, the second is to delay, the third is to do the science and the research, and the fourth is to mitigate so that we can actually brace the NHS.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked about the new case in London, Whitty said that officials were not in touch with everyone who had been on the same plane as the person who is now confirmed to have the virus, just those who had been in close proximity. Further infection of people who were outside that vicinity was unlikely, he added. </p> \n  <p>Whitty added that finding a vaccine in the short term was unlikely and impractical, suggesting that work on exploring the use of anti-viral drugs was a better focus. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>People talk about vaccines, it will in my view be a long while until we have a vaccine that is ready to deploy but we need to get on with that,\u201d he said. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked about the use of anti-viral drugs he added: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cWe need to look at existing drugs, like existing HIV drugs, and the Chinese are starting to do this, and test if the existing drugs work against this virus. Some may, some may not. </p> \n   <p>Biggest thing we have to do is around isolation and delay and trying to work out the patterns of that. </p> \n   <p>A large proportion having relatively mild disease, drugs are only likely to be useful for a minority [\u2026] There is clearly a lot of research we are having to do at the moment.\u201d </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Whitty said that people in the UK should not be changing their behaviour but taking sensible precautions to avoid getting any virus.<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>All the things that are going to make it more difficult to transmit this virus are good and sensible things we need to do to stop the transmission of any virus,\u201d he said. Remember in the UK, roughly 8,000 people in the UK die of flu. </p> \n   <p>People should be covering their mouths when they sneeze, disposing of handkerchiefs. </p> \n   <p>What we should be doing is taking sensible precautions, we would normally take in the winter season.\u201d </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>On the Today programme yesterday Professor Neil Ferguson, an infectious disease expert from Imperial College London, said he thought new cases of the virus could still rise and the world was in the \u201cearly phases of a global pandemic\u201d. He estimated around 60% of the UK population in such a situation could be affected, which if the mortality rate was 1% could result in hundreds of thousands of deaths. </p> \n  <p>But Whitty said it was unhelpful to speculate on numbers without strong evidence. He said the fourth strand of the UK coronavirus plan was mitigation, and ensuring the NHS was able to cope. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cThis epidemic, where it is to happen, we don\u2019t know where the peak would be and absolutely critically we don\u2019t know the proportion of people who have this disease without symptoms. Until we do [know] we really only have a best estimate,\u201d he said. </p> \n   <p>\u201cThe best estimate for the number of people dying at the top end of the range is about 2%, in my view it could

doctors comes after a London woman became the ninth person in the UK to test positive for the deadly virus.</p> \n  <p>There are concerns the city\u2019s status as a transport hub could exacerbate the spread of the virus, however doctors have said the risk of infection for residents in the capital remains low.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cIn general, if an initial case is in a densely populated area, then the risk of sustained person-to-person transmission following is higher,\u201d Dr Robin Thompson of Oxford University said.</p> \n   <p>This is exacerbated by the fact that London is a transport hub, and the underground could provide a network to spread the virus quickly.</p> \n   <p>As a result, given this case was in London, it might be expected that there is an increased risk posed by this case compared to the others we have seen.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><br>Dr Michael Head from the University of Southampton added: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cIt should also be noted that of the 1,750 tests carried out so far in the UK, over 99% of those tested have been negative for the coronavirus.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThus, risks to Londoners and UK residents remain low, though people should continue to keep an eye on guidance for the general public.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>While the patient has now been quarantined, Dr Thompson says the risk of the virus spreading depends on the woman\u2019s interactions prior to being placed in isolation.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cThe key factor here is the number of contacts that this infected individual has had prior to being isolated,\u201d he said.</p> \n   <p>\u201cIf this is low, then the risk of sustained human-to-human transmission is also low.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>As Public Health England investigates the patient\u2019s movements, Dr Nathalie MacDermott from the National Institute for Health Research said London commuters should continue to go about their business as usual.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cProvided the individual followed the government\u2019s advice (to self-isolate) there should be little concern of transmission to the general public in London,\u201d she said.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time

One of the group, Matt Raw, 38 from Knutsford, Cheshire, showed his elation as he left the Arrowe Park facility. \u201cWe\u2019re free \u2026 and the sun\u2019s shining \u2026 it\u2019s absolutely lovely to be out and I\u2019ll no doubt be going out for a pint a little bit later.\u201d Read our full report. As our story makes clear, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the huge jump in cases in Hubei \u2013 bringing the total to more than 60,000 worldwide \u2013 was caused by a change in the way Chinese authorities were counting them. The WHO is now working hard to get further details on when the extra cases of \u201cCovid-19\u201d occurred to paint a true picture of the development of the epidemic in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei. Reuters reports that Donald Trump has praised China over its handling of the outbreak, adding that the United States was working closely with Beijing. \u201cI think they\u2019ve handled it professionally, and I think they\u2019re extremely capable,\u201d Trump, who has previously been at loggerheads with the Chinese authorities over trade issues, said in a podcast broadcast on iHeart Radio on Thursday. In January, the US had angered China by banning foreign nationals who had recently visited the country. A change in data collection methodology from the Chinese authorities has caused a huge jump in the number of registered cases of coronavirus. Here\u2019s our report over the confusion about the full scale of the crisis, with more than 13,300 extra cases reported going back over an unknown number of days or weeks. A nurse in Brighton who went into self-isolation as part of efforts to stop the coronavirus from spreading has criticised the way this method of prevention is being managed. The unnamed nurse, who was exhibiting some of the symptoms of the strain of coronavirus, says she was told to self-isolate by Public Health England (PHE) after coming into direct, sustained contact with a person who was being tested for the virus. She said she was sent home in a taxi in which she was wearing a medical mask but the driver was not, and told the Brighton newspaper the Argus that self-isolation \u201cis not being dealt with effectively\u201d. The nurse said she had been given little advice about how to try and stop the spread of the virus when she arrived home and had had to rely on grocery and takeaway deliveries which she picked up from her doorstep. She told the newspaper: \u201cSince I found out, I\u2019ve had to get everyone out of my house to protect them. It\u2019s scary, because I\u2019ve got a compromised immune system. Some of these fears are over the top, but if I do get coronavirus, it could be fatal.\u201d She described how her family had \u201cpacked and gone\u201d when she got home and that her children were \u201cunderstandably upset\u201d that they had been forced to leave. The nurse said she had called NHS 111 but then had a 15-hour wait to get advice from PHE on how to get tested. She added: \u201cThis is not being dealt with effectively. I thought there would be a plan in place for something like this, but in my case, I know there wasn\u2019t one.\u201d PHE said it would not comment on individual cases. Adding to the impact the virus is having on businesses, we have this story about possible disruption to a key motor show. The spread of the disease has already forced the cancellation of the Mobile World Congress, a tech trade fair in Barcelona that had been expected to host more than 100,000 delegates from about 200 countries. Meanwhile, here is our full report on Japan\u2019s first death from the crisis \u2013 a woman in her 80s \u2013 as well as more cases reported on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which is docked in Yokohama. Businesses worldwide are feeling the effects of the crisis. For instance, JCB, the British digger maker, has cut working hours and suspended overtime for 4,000 UK employees after the outbreak prompted a shortage in parts coming from China. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of all the key coronavirus events from the past few hours: The first coronavirus case in London was confirmed, with the patient taking an Uber to Lewisham hospital against official health advice. Eighty-three Britons celebrated being released from their two-week quarantine in the Wirral. A surge in recorded cases in China\u2019s Hubei province is caused by a new reporting method, not an increase in the severity or mortality of the disease. Japan recorded its first death, only the third coronavirus fatality outside mainland China. Meanwhile, Singapore recorded its biggest daily jump in cases, with eight new infected patients. A North London GP practice closed because of coronavirus but this later turned out to be a false alarm. A Wuhan evacuee became the 15th coronavirus case in the US. Because of the coronavirus outbreak, oil demand is set to fall year on year in the first quarter for the first time since the depths of the financial crisis in 2009, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has said. Brent crude, the global benchmark, is down roughly 15% since the beginning of the year as the virus has spread. Four liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers bound for North Asia have changed destination or diverted after the outbreak hit gas demand in China, Reuters reports. Several analysts cut gas demand forecasts for China, expecting the outbreak to depress industrial, commercial and transportation appetite in the world\u2019s top gas importer. The early stages of the outbreak crisis led to a 70% fall in international air traffic in China while domestic air travel fell 50%, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies were in discussions to bring forward a policy meeting to this month from March, and to consider deepening oil supply curbs by an additional 500,000 barrels per day to 2.2m. The alleged presence of coronavirus that led to the closure of a GP practice in north London was a false alarm, it is understood. Ritchie Street surgery in Islington blamed the virus for its decision to shut in a notice on its door. It said: \u201cPractice is closed until 14/02/2020 due to the coronavirus. Any patients that have the symptoms should call 111 and not come to the practice.\u201d However, no patients from or staff at the practice have tested positive for the virus, it has now emerged. It remains unclear why the surgery management took the decision to shut. NHS officials believe that the management may have done so as a precaution after testing a patient who suspected that they may have contracted the virus. The latest figures from China do not show a \u201csignificant shift in the pattern of mortality or severity\u201d of the coronavirus, the World Health Organization\u2019s Dr Michael Ryan has said. He explained that while China reported an extra 13,332 clinically confirmed cases in Hubei province today, these \u201crelate to a period going back days and weeks\u201d and have been retrospectively classified based on diagnosis by medical professionals while awaiting laboratory test confirmation. We\u2019re not dealing with a spike of cases of 14,000 in one day. This does not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the virus. It remains unclear whether the spike in deaths reported by China - an additional 254 fatalities - relate to these clinically confirmed cases or not. Ryan, the executive director of the WHO health emergencies programme, said that apart from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which now has 218 confirmed cases, there has been no dramatic transmission outside China. \u201cThe iceberg may not be that great, but that\u2019s not a guarantee,\u201d he added. The rest of a special WHO team is expected to arrive in China over the coming weekend to investigative the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, he announced. When asked about the most urgent action need to tackle the epidemic, Ryan raised a few issues. He said the clinical trials in China should be expanded to countries such as Japan and Singapore, in order to better understand which treatments are effective. \u201cKnowing which drugs work would be a wonderful gift,\u201d he said, adding that antivirals used during the Sars and Mers epidemics are being trialled. It is also important to identify the animal source of the disease to stop a similar outbreak happening in future, Ryan said. He said that while vaccines and new drugs will take a lot longer to produce, there is no time to be wasted in investment and development. He added that it will take hundreds of millions of dollars of investment in multiple drug candidates to find a solution, and states are going to have to support the private sector in this endeavour. Finally, he said \u201cwe need a vaccine against misinformation\u201d to better inform the public about the disease and communicate in a more effective way. We reported earlier that the latest patient to be diagnosed with coronavirus in the UK took an Uber to hospital in south London after developing symptoms. Commenting on the safety of the Uber driver who drove the woman, Dr Rachel Thorn Heathcock, consultant at Public Health England, said: We are in contact with Uber to ensure the driver receives advice and information on what to do should they feel unwell in the coming days. As the journey was less than 15 minutes, the driver did not have close sustained contact with the individual and are not considered high risk. We would like to thank Uber for their cooperation. A Beijing florist is enclosing a special gift in her Valentine\u2019s Day bouquets this year \u2013 a small bottle of hand sanitiser to ward off coronavirus. It has been a tough month for Cai Xiaoman. Sales are down 90% in the midst of an outbreak that has infected more than 40,000 people in the country. People are staying at home, leaving shopping malls empty. Wearing a face mask, Cai carefully sprays her hands with alcohol and puts on a pair of gloves before packaging her flowers and adding hand sanitiser to the bouquets. She says she was inspired by a customer who asked her to sanitise a bouquet before she delivered it. Now she is now giving sanitiser to all her customers as a kind gesture. \u201cI think this is very heart-warming, and I want my customers to feel comfortable,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause now the outbreak is severe, and everyone is scared. I hope this will end soon.\u201d Another coronavirus case has been confirmed in the US after an evacuee from China was diagnosed while in quarantine in Texas. The infection was confirmed through a lab test on Wednesday night. The patient, who had been flown to at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, is now in isolation at a hospital and reported to be in stable condition. Two earlier US cases were confirmed in evacuees who were flown last week from the Chinese city of Wuhan to the Marine Corps air station Miramar in southern California. The Catholic diocese in Hong Kong has announced that masses will be suspended for two weeks. In a brief video announcement, Cardinal John Hon Tong wore a surgical mask as he urged the city\u2019s 400,000-strong Catholic community not to panic. He said masses would be halted from 15 to 28 February to avoid large gatherings, saying the next two weeks would be crucial for suppressing the epidemic. He urged members to participate in online mass, share anti-epidemic materials and pray for each other. Hong Kong, which has reported 51 cases including one death, has extended the closure of schools until 16 March. A nurse in Brighton, where five people have been diagnosed with coronavirus, has spoken out against the way \u201cself-isolation\u201d is being managed. The nurse has been told to self-isolate after coming into direct, sustained contact with a person being tested for the virus, and exhibiting some of the symptoms herself. Public Health England has advised anyone who comes into contact with a coronavirus case to remain alone at home to stop the virus spreading. The nurse, speaking anonymously to The Argus, said self-isolation \u201cis not being dealt with effectively\u201d. She said she was sent home from her workplace wearing a medical mask, but was taken by a taxi driver who was not wearing one. When I got home, my family had packed and gone. I\u2019ve got kids, and they were understandably upset they had to leave. They didn\u2019t understand. I didn\u2019t have any food in the house. I had to order a takeaway. It sounds ridiculous but I got fish and chips and asked the delivery person to leave it on the doorstep. Now, I\u2019m waiting for a Tesco delivery. I\u2019m going to ask them to leave it outside. I don\u2019t want to put signs outside my house saying I\u2019m in isolation, but I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019m supposed to do. She also said she had to find a way of getting everyone out of her house without risking passing on the infection to them, and feels the advice she has been given was insufficient. It\u2019s scary, because I\u2019ve got a compromised immune system. Some of these fears are over the top, but if I do get coronavirus, it could be fatal. Earlier today, the NHS chief executive, Sir Simon Stevens, said many more people may need to self-isolate over the coming weeks to stop the virus spreading. China is dragging its heels in accepting help on the ground from international health specialists, diplomats and experts have said. Four days after a World Health Organization (WHO) advance team arrived in Beijing, no details have been released on how and when the full mission will deploy. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, won a pledge from Chinese president Xi Jinping during his trip there two weeks ago that an international team would be able to help investigate the virus\u2019 origin and spread. An \u201cadvance team\u201d of three experts, led by Dr Bruce Aylward, a WHO official and public health emergency expert from Canada, as well as WHO\u2019s Dr Maria van Kerkhove, arrived in Beijing on Monday. Tedros said the full mission would include 10-15 experts, but has given no details of who they would be or when they would go to China. \u201cIt would obviously have been better if the (mission) team had arrived without delay,\u201d a senior Western diplomat in Geneva told Reuters, though he added they could still do effective work with Chinese colleagues when they arrive. He added: It\u2019s just been very worrying and troubling and we are not seeing as much of a substantive and independent role that we would expect at this point. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Wednesday it had not yet been invited to send experts to China to assist with the WHO investigation. \u201cNot only was China very late in inviting international partners to help with the response, but we still only have a skeletal advance team in Beijing, and not Hubei province,\u201d Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health law at Georgetown Law, told Reuters. \u201cIt appears that China has not accepted the US offer of on the ground CDC experts, which is unfortunate. CDC has among the most experienced first responders,\u201d he added. WHO officials have said that Chinese authorities have been open and cooperative, sharing data throughout the outbreak. Stormzy has rescheduled the Asia leg of his Heavy Is The Head tour due to the coronavirus outbreak. In a post on Instagram, the British rapper wrote: I was seriously looking forward to bringing the #HITH World tour to Asia and playing some epic sold-out shows but due to the ongoing health and travel concerns surrounding the Coronavirus, I\u2019m regrettably having to reschedule this leg of the Tour. Information regarding the rescheduled dates will follow in due course. Please contact your local ticket vendor for any further queries. I promise I\u2019ll be back. A notice on the website of Ritchie Street Health Centre, in Islington, says Practice is closed until 14/02/2020 due to the coronavirus. Any patients that have the symptoms should call 111 and not come to the practice. London announced its first case of coronavirus on Wednesday, after a woman presented at Lewisham hospital in south London with symptoms. It is unclear whether this new case is connected with the closure of the GP surgery. Dozen of Britons are celebrating the end of their two-week quarantine today, as they are finally allowed to leave the hospital facility in Wirral where they have been staying. Matt Raw, 38, from Knutsford, Cheshire, shouted: \u201cWe\u2019re free \u2026 and the sun\u2019s shining\u201d. Some good fresh air and very, very, very happy that all 83 of us have tested negative for the virus and I guess now back to business as usual. It is absolutely lovely to be out and I\u2019ll no doubt be going out for a pint a little bit later. He previously said of his time in the Arrowe Park facility in Wirral: It has not been that bad because they have looked after us so excellently. The wonderful, wonderful staff of the NHS, they have really done their very best to make us as comfortable as possible. We\u2019re not prisoners. They\u2019re trying to make us feel like, if anything, we\u2019re just on holiday for a couple of weeks, maybe without the swimming pool. Here\u2019s a recap of the number of recorded coronavirus cases across the globe: Mainland China: 1,367 deaths among 52,526 cases, mostly in the central province of Hubei Hong Kong: 51 cases, 1 death Macao: 10 Japan: 247 cases, including 218 from a cruise ship docked in Japan, 1 death Singapore: 50 Thailand: 33 South Korea: 28 Malaysia: 18 Taiwan: 18 Vietnam: 16 Australia: 14 Germany: 14 United States: 14. Separately, one US citizen died in China France: 11 United Kingdom: 8 United Arab Emirates: 8 Canada: 7 Philippines: 3 cases, including 1 death India: 3 Italy: 3 Russia: 2 Spain: 2 Belgium: 1 Nepal: 1 Sri Lanka: 1 Sweden: 1 Cambodia: 1 Finland: 1 The first person to be diagnosed with coronavirus in London travelled to a nearby hospital in an Uber taxi after falling ill, the Guardian has been told. Two staff from Lewisham hospital in south London are now in isolation at home after coming into contact with the woman, who turned up at the A&amp;E department unannounced. She did not arrive by ambulance or her own private vehicle and went straight to the A&amp;E reception desk to report her symptoms \u2013 both clear breaches of guidance aimed at stopping the spread of the virus. The woman, who has now been taken to St Thomas\u2019 hospital for treatment, is a Chinese national who had recently arrived in the capital from China. US stock index futures slipped on Thursday, Reuters reports, a day after Wall Street closed at record levels, as a spike in the number of deaths and new cases related to the coronavirus outbreak in China sent investors scurrying to safe-haven assets. Gold and the Japanese yen were in demand as a change in a diagnostic method pushed the number of new infections in Hubei province of China to 14,840 on Thursday, up from 2,015 cases reported on Wednesday, while the death toll climbed to 1,367. Fresh uncertainty about the scale of the epidemic looked set to derail a rally in stocks, a day after investors bought on signs that the virus spread was slowing. Latest figures show new coronavirus cases in Asian countries, as Japan records its first coronavirus death. In Vietnam, official media reported that a village of 10,000 north-west of the capital, Hanoi, had been put in lockdown because of a cluster of cases there. The online newspaper VN Express cited a senior official of Vinh Phuc province as reporting an increase in cases in the Son Loi commune. Vietnam has confirmed 16 cases, most of them in the province. Meanwhile Malaysia recorded its 19th positive coronavirus case - a 39-year-old woman who is a friend of the 14th reported case, a 37-year-old tourist from Wuhan. Singapore has recorded its biggest daily jump in coronavirus cases, with eight new patients bringing the total number of infected people in the country to 58. The health ministry said all the new cases had links to previous ones. The Straits Times reports that five of the new cases are linked to the Grace Assembly of God church, including a 54-year-old man who works at the National University of Singapore. Of the 58 confirmed cases reported, 15 have recovered and been discharged from hospital while seven are in critical condition in intensive care. Japan has recorded its first death from Covid-19 coronavirus, the country\u2019s health minister, Katsunobu Kato, has announced. The Japanese woman, in her 80s, did not come from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which is in quarantine in Yokohama port. She was living in Kanagawa prefecture, which borders on Tokyo. Japan has confirmed 247 cases of the virus, which include 218 from the cruise ship. Outside of mainland China, only Hong Kong and the Philippines have previously confirmed fatalities, with one death each. A face mask shortage risks \u201cimminent disruption\u201d to UK dental services, the British Dental Association (BDA) has warned. The association reports it has been inundated by calls from member practices unclear on their options, in the wake of panic buying and supply problems triggered by the coronavirus outbreak. China is the world\u2019s leading manufacturer of sanitary masks, and several suppliers have tripled their prices since January. The BDA chair, Mick Armstrong, said: In recent weeks dentists have been hit by panic buying, clumsy rationing and naked profiteering. Sadly a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach from suppliers is leaving many larger practices with few options. Our abiding interest is the safety of our patients, who face imminent disruption to their care. Unless we see a rapid increase in supply, dentists without face masks will have little choice but to down drills. Based on contact with leading suppliers, the BDA says \u201cone size fits all\u201d rationing has already left practices unable to order more than two boxes of masks a day, irrespective of their size. It estimates that a single surgery in a typical NHS practice, seeing around 28 patients a day, goes through five boxes of masks a week. While smaller practices may be able to maintain viability on permitted orders of 10 boxes a week, even \u201ctwo-chair\u201d NHS practices are now likely to use up their allocation completely. The BDA is dealing with inquires from practices with up to 13 chairs. The BDA has indicated it will ask NHS England and the Welsh government to invoke force majeure clauses in NHS contracts should the situation deteriorate further, in order to protect multiple practices left unable to meet their contractual targets in the event of disruption. The coronavirus epidemic is set to cast a shadow over Valentine\u2019s Day tomorrow, as restaurants in Shanghai report almost no reservations. Reuters reports that Bill Hu, the owner of a French fine dining spot in a shopping mall, is preparing for an exceptionally quiet evening as most reservations have been cancelled. The number of reservations this year is almost zero. This virus epidemic came all of a sudden. Many customers who had made reservations all called in to cancel. Last year his restaurant served around 170 customers on Valentine\u2019s Day. Meanwhile Austin Hu, a chef at the high-end restaurant Heritage by Madison, said: Valentine\u2019s Day is kind of sad so far. We have one booking at the moment. It\u2019s going to take a while for the confidence to come back. The real question is whether we can last long enough. In another blow for the romantics, a virologist has advised physical contact such as hugging, kissing and handshaking could increase spread of the infection. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Prof John Oxford from Queen Mary University said: I think we have to galvanise ourselves in our social actions \u2013 how we interact with people. And I think that is extremely important; more so than wearing a mask. I think that\u2019s a total diversion. What we need to do is less of the handshaking, hugging, kissing, that sort of thing, because this virus looks like it\u2019s spread by ordinary tidal breathing, not necessarily colds and coughing. A medical expert has said the latest coronavirus figures from China cannot be used to track the spread of the virus. China reported nearly 15,000 new cases in Hubei province over a 24-hour period, as it started including \u201cclinically diagnosed\u201d cases in its figures \u2013 meaning cases diagnosed by a CT scan but not confirmed by a laboratory test. Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the new figures do not point to a sharp increase in cases: If the figure now included suspect cases, many of the suspect cases will ultimately be proven to be Covid-19 (a confirmed case), [while] others will actually be other illnesses altogether or remain lacking a laboratory diagnosis. Of those suspect cases lacking a laboratory diagnosis, some but not all will be Covid-19. He said the fact that the World Health Organization has not updated its dashboard with today\u2019s Chinese figures suggests it has not yet decided how to deal with this. In determining whether the epidemic is declining from day to day or not we have to be careful only to compare like with like. Until we know more about the new method and how it compares to previous numbers we cannot use today\u2019s figures of how the epidemic is progressing. It almost certainly does not mean that there has been a resurgence of the epidemic overnight. European Union health ministers are holding an emergency meeting today on how to prevent the Covid-19 virus from further spreading across Europe. Ministers from the 27 member states gathered in Brussels, while Mike Ryan, the executive director of the World Health Organization\u2019s emergencies programme, will also join the debate via video link. More people have now died from Covid-19 than during the Sars outbreak, but no death has been reported in Europe so far. Fewer than 50 suspected cases have been registered in the continent but the EU said coordinated action was required to keep these figures low. Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d, the commissioner for crisis management, said before the meeting that the risk of Covid-19 further spreading in Europe remained \u201clow, but it may increase\u201d. The EU has so far organised the repatriation of about 500 of its citizens who were in China. Ministers will also discuss how to facilitate the joint purchase of protective equipment by member states in an attempt to avoid potential shortages, and how to help third countries with less robust health systems. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has thanked the 83 Britons leaving quarantine today for their \u201cbravery and patience\u201d. This will not have been an easy time for them and I would like to express my gratitude for their bravery and patience. Each individual has been given a clean bill of health, and the nation can be reassured that their departure presents no risk to the public. I am incredibly proud of every dedicated healthcare professional who has looked after these individuals over the last 14 days \u2013 their tireless work in exceptional circumstances is a testament to our steadfast NHS. Another update on the situation with the Diamond Princess cruise ship off Japan, after 44 new cases were confirmed onboard. Japan\u2019s health minister, Katsunobu Kato, said five of the patients sent to hospitals earlier have severe symptoms and are on artificial respirators or under intensive care. The ship, which is still carrying about 3,500 passengers and crew members, now has 218 people infected with the virus out of 713 people tested, the largest cluster of infections outside China. Kato also said the government has decided to allow passengers older than 80 to get off the ship after testing negative for the virus. He said results of tests on about 200 eligible passengers are under way, and those with chronic health problems or in cabins without operable windows will be given priority. Kato said the measure is to reduce health risks for passengers stuck in rooms under difficult conditions. Those who are released will be asked to stay at a designated facility through the end of the quarantine period. \u201cWe are doing our utmost for the health of crew members and passengers who remain on the ship,\u201d Kato told a news conference. Some experts have questioned Japan\u2019s strategy of isolating the passengers and crew in a potentially virus-affected environment on the ship while the disease is already slowly making its way into the country. On the ship, infections are getting very dense, said Shigeru Omi, an infectious disease prevention expert and former regional director for the World Health Organization. He said: It\u2019s like we are seeing a very condensed version of what could happen in a local community. Omi, who currently heads the Japan Community Health Care Organization, said those people who have tested positive for the virus are only a fraction of what could already be spreading outside of the ship. He added: We should assume that the virus has already been spreading in Japan. The NHS chief executive has thanked the Britons who have spent two weeks in quarantine and said many more people may need to self-isolate to stop the disease from spreading. Sir Simon Stevens said: As our first group of guests leaves Arrowe Park hospital, we want to thank them for the highly responsible, pragmatic and stoical way they have played their part in keeping both themselves and others safe. They have set an important example, recognising that over the coming weeks many more of us may need to self-isolate at home for a period to reduce this virus\u2019s spread. He also thanked the NHS staff who helped make the stay \u201cas safe and as comfortable as possible\u201d. With about 72 hours\u2019 notice they, and subsequently their colleagues in Milton Keynes, have mobilised clinical teams, personal support and pastoral care to look after over 200 people returning to this country under extremely trying circumstances. They have been hugely helped by the volunteers, residents, schools and those from local councils. He added that while the NHS has played its part, everyone should take simple steps such as washing hands to prevent the spread of infection and calling NHS 111 first before going to the doctors or A&amp;E if they have any concerns about or show symptoms of the virus. A British honeymooner diagnosed with the new coronavirus has said a language barrier meant he mistakenly believed he had tested negative for the disease. Alan Steele, who was taken to hospital from a quarantined cruise ship off the coast of Japan last week, said a second test came back negative and he will be released from quarantine if a third does the same. \u201cSeems that my 1st test was positive and I misunderstood due to language barrier,\u201d Steele posted on Facebook. \u201cAnyway 2nd test showed negative so a third test is now been done. I need 2 negatives to be freed so all crossed on 3rd test.\u201d Steele had posted on Wednesday about the \u201cgreat news\u201d that he had received a negative result for the virus. On Thursday, the Japanese health ministry said 44 more people onboard the Diamond Princess have been diagnosed with coronavirus, now known as Covid-19. The ship is carrying more than 3,500 passengers, including Steele\u2019s wife, Wendy Marshall Steele, and officials say a total of 218 people of the 713 tested have been infected. The vessel has been quarantined at Yokohama port since 3 February. Another British couple, David and Sally Abel, remain on the ship and said they have been given the option to leave and continue their quarantine on land if they test negative for the virus. In a video posted on Facebook, Sally Abel said: The Japanese health authorities have said if anyone tests negative, they will be given the option to either stay onboard and continue their quarantine onboard, or they could go to a Japanese housing unit or something and do it there. But for us, if that was the case for us, we\u2019re obviously going to be better off language-wise staying onboard than we are if we go into some sort of facility run by Japanese. The couple, who are celebrating their 50th wedding anniversary, told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain they fear being separated if only one of them tests positive for the virus. Sally said: My biggest fear is we are going to be tested in the next couple of days because of our age. They\u2019ve done over-80s, now they\u2019re going to do over-70s. We have been together 50 years and, if one of us is infected and the other one isn\u2019t, we will be separated. And that I don\u2019t particularly relish.

After today\u2019s news that the first London diagnosis has been confirmed it\u2019s a good chance to take stock and consider how the outbreak might be affecting your mental health. The Mental Health Foundation has issued some guidance on how to stay mentally healthy as you follow coverage of the outbreak. Dr Antonis Kousoulis, director of the foundation, said: Infectious disease outbreaks, like the current coronavirus, can be scary. While it is important to stay informed, there are many things we can do to manage our wellbeing. The foundation suggests: Try to avoid speculation and look up reputable sources on the outbreak Rumour and speculation can fuel anxiety. Having access to good quality information about the virus can help you feel more in control. Try to stay connected and remain calm At times of stress, we work better in company and with support. Try and keep in touch with your friends and family or contact a helpline for emotional support. Try to anticipate distress It is normal to feel vulnerable and overwhelmed as we read news about the outbreak, especially if you have experienced trauma or a mental health problem in the past. It\u2019s important to acknowledge these feelings and remind each other to look after our physical and mental health. We should also be aware of and avoid increasing habits that may not be helpful in the long term, like smoking and drinking. Try not to make assumptions Don\u2019t judge people and avoid jumping to conclusions about who is responsible for the spread of the disease. The coronavirus can affect anyone regardless of gender, ethnicity or sex. A caring and supportive stance improves the chances of prevention and recovery. And remember that not every cold or cough is the coronavirus. Try to manage how you follow the outbreak in the media There is lots of news coverage about the outbreak. If you find that the news is stressing you out, it\u2019s important to find a balance. It\u2019s best that you don\u2019t avoid all news and that you keep informing and educating yourself, but limit your news intake if it is bothering you. Talk to your children We need to ask children what they have heard about the outbreak and support them. Don\u2019t avoid the \u201cscary topic\u201d but engage in a way that is understandable to them. The foundation has more advice on talking with your children about world news. The chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, has told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the UK has a four-stage preparation plan, and while containment of coronavirus is the current aim the country is also preparing to delay the onset of an outbreak of the virus. \u201cDelay is the next stage of what we need to do,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause if we are going to get an outbreak here in the UK, and it is an if, not a when, putting it back in time into the summer away from the winter pressures on the NHS, buying us a bit more time to understand the virus better and possibly gives us a seasonal advantage is a big advantage.\u201d He said that the future prevalence of coronavirus was heavily dependent on what happened in China. \u201cBroadly this goes one of two ways. The first way is that China gets on top of the epidemic [\u2026] and that there are spillover cases all over the world but those are contained and we will have cases in the UK, that is highly likely, we may even get a bit of onward transmission in the UK and then the epidemic goes away. That is possible. The two things that may do that are the extraordinary efforts of the Chinese government and possibly a change in the seasons,\u201d he said. \u201cThe alternative is this is not possible to contain in China and then this starts to spread, probably initially quite slowly around the world and at that point unless the seasons come to our rescue then it is going to come to a situation where we have it in the EU, and in the UK. \u201c But he added that we shouldn\u2019t rely on the change of the seasons coming to the UK\u2019s rescue \u201cin any way\u201d. \u201cAt this point in time [\u2026] we have a strategy that relies on four tactical aims. The first is to contain, the second is to delay, the third is to do the science and the research, and the fourth is to mitigate so that we can actually brace the NHS.\u201d Asked about the new case in London, Whitty said that officials were not in touch with everyone who had been on the same plane as the person who is now confirmed to have the virus, just those who had been in close proximity. Further infection of people who were outside that vicinity was unlikely, he added. Whitty added that finding a vaccine in the short term was unlikely and impractical, suggesting that work on exploring the use of anti-viral drugs was a better focus. People talk about vaccines, it will in my view be a long while until we have a vaccine that is ready to deploy but we need to get on with that,\u201d he said. Asked about the use of anti-viral drugs he added: \u201cWe need to look at existing drugs, like existing HIV drugs, and the Chinese are starting to do this, and test if the existing drugs work against this virus. Some may, some may not. Biggest thing we have to do is around isolation and delay and trying to work out the patterns of that. A large proportion having relatively mild disease, drugs are only likely to be useful for a minority [\u2026] There is clearly a lot of research we are having to do at the moment.\u201d Whitty said that people in the UK should not be changing their behaviour but taking sensible precautions to avoid getting any virus. All the things that are going to make it more difficult to transmit this virus are good and sensible things we need to do to stop the transmission of any virus,\u201d he said. Remember in the UK, roughly 8,000 people in the UK die of flu. People should be covering their mouths when they sneeze, disposing of handkerchiefs. What we should be doing is taking sensible precautions, we would normally take in the winter season.\u201d On the Today programme yesterday Professor Neil Ferguson, an infectious disease expert from Imperial College London, said he thought new cases of the virus could still rise and the world was in the \u201cearly phases of a global pandemic\u201d. He estimated around 60% of the UK population in such a situation could be affected, which if the mortality rate was 1% could result in hundreds of thousands of deaths. But Whitty said it was unhelpful to speculate on numbers without strong evidence. He said the fourth strand of the UK coronavirus plan was mitigation, and ensuring the NHS was able to cope. \u201cThis epidemic, where it is to happen, we don\u2019t know where the peak would be and absolutely critically we don\u2019t know the proportion of people who have this disease without symptoms. Until we do [know] we really only have a best estimate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best estimate for the number of people dying at the top end of the range is about 2%, in my view it could be considerably less than that, but we have to prepare for the worst.\u201d Asked about a potential death toll, Whitty said: I think it\u2019s a mistake to use numbers which are entirely speculative [\u2026] At the moment the numbers we are seeing out of China are so variable that it is really difficult to put a fixed figure. If it looks like there is an epidemic rolling our way, which is possible, I would be delighted to come back and talk about real numbers instead of speculative numbers. Whitty said that it it was very difficult for China to deal with the outbreak and any irregularity in the numbers coming out of the country were not \u201cdeliberately misleading\u201d but instead the \u201creality is taking a long time to catch up with the facts\u201d. The latest coronavirus statistics from China\u2019s National Health Commission are snapping on Reuters China reports 254 new deaths in the mainland from the coronavirus outbreak as of the end of 12 February. China reports 15,152 new coronavirus cases in the mainland as of the end of 12 February. The Press Association reports that the warning from doctors comes after a London woman became the ninth person in the UK to test positive for the deadly virus. There are concerns the city\u2019s status as a transport hub could exacerbate the spread of the virus, however doctors have said the risk of infection for residents in the capital remains low. \u201cIn general, if an initial case is in a densely populated area, then the risk of sustained person-to-person transmission following is higher,\u201d Dr Robin Thompson of Oxford University said. This is exacerbated by the fact that London is a transport hub, and the underground could provide a network to spread the virus quickly. As a result, given this case was in London, it might be expected that there is an increased risk posed by this case compared to the others we have seen.\u201d Dr Michael Head from the University of Southampton added: \u201cIt should also be noted that of the 1,750 tests carried out so far in the UK, over 99% of those tested have been negative for the coronavirus. \u201cThus, risks to Londoners and UK residents remain low, though people should continue to keep an eye on guidance for the general public.\u201d While the patient has now been quarantined, Dr Thompson says the risk of the virus spreading depends on the woman\u2019s interactions prior to being placed in isolation. \u201cThe key factor here is the number of contacts that this infected individual has had prior to being isolated,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this is low, then the risk of sustained human-to-human transmission is also low.\u201d As Public Health England investigates the patient\u2019s movements, Dr Nathalie MacDermott from the National Institute for Health Research said London commuters should continue to go about their business as usual. \u201cProvided the individual followed the government\u2019s advice (to self-isolate) there should be little concern of transmission to the general public in London,\u201d she said. Here\u2019s a summary of the latest news on the coronavirus, now known as Covid-19. Hubei Health commission says there were 14,840 new cases of the virus diagnosed on Wednesday and 242 new deaths. The big jump in numbers is due to a change in the way cases are measured. Unusually, the National Health Commission has not reported a country-wide update of deaths and infections on Thursday. Big changes were unveiled in Hubei as both the party chief in the province and Wuhan\u2019s Communist party chief were sacked and replaced with men considered to be proteges of President Xi. China also sacked the head of the powerful Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, after months of pro-democracy protests. The MV Westerdam cruise ship has arrived in Cambodia after spending two weeks at sea because no other country would allow the liner to dock over fears about the coronavirus. 44 more passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan were diagnosed with Covid-19, taking the total infections on the ship to 218. A district of the Chinese city of Shiyan, in central Hubei province, has implemented \u201cwartime measures\u201d to combat the virus. Australia has extended its 14-day ban on tourists travelling from China to Australia (due to expire on Saturday), for another week. The South China Morning Post\u2019s correspondent in Beijing, Jun Mai, says the changes to key leaders in personnel in Hubei don\u2019t just bring in new leaders who are proteges of President Xi, but people with strong backgrounds in security. Looks like I\u2019m not the only person waiting for the Chinese government to update the latest national figures. Scott Morrison acknowledges the impact on Australia from the curb on tourism from China because of the virus. \u201cIn tourism (in Australia) it\u2019s a double blow because of the bushfires,\u201d Morrison says. Brendan Murphy, Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, says he wants to keep the travel ban for the moment because of the continued rise in cases inside and outside Hubei province. He describes the jump in cases in Hubei today as \u201cvery significant\u201d. Australia\u2019s health minister, Greg Hunt, is talking now. He confirms that there is no change to the 15 people confirmed as having the virus in Australia. \u201cThat means the measures we have taken are protecting Australians,\u201d he says. Hunt also says there are no confirmed cases among the Australians evacuated from Wuhan. We are hearing from the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, on entry restrictions on travellers from China.

Vietnamese media is reporting that a community near Hanoi has been quarantined after an eighth virus case was confirmed there. I\u2019ll bring you more on this when I have the details. This was quite a jolt from the state-run Global Times, given today\u2019s purge of senior Hubei officials and the steep rise in virus numbers. You can read our latest wrap on developments today. including leadership changes in Hubei and a big spike in virus numbers, below. The Global Times is reporting that a district in central Hubei province has implemented wartime control measures for the next 14 days, including the full closure of all buildings, the first time during the virus outbreak. The order, applying to a district in the city of Shiyan, says only those who are fighting the epidemic are allowed to leave their homes as of Thursday. All residential areas are being manned around the clock, it says. The wartime control measures were put in place after the district reported 137 confirmed cases of infection with the COVID-19, the second highest number in the city of Shiyan, where 562 were reported as of the end of Wednesday. Local neighbourhood committees will distribute basic necessities at a fixed time and fixed prices. The committees will help residents purchase medicines if they are urgently needed. Those who force their way into or out of residential areas, courtyards, buildings and roads will be detained, it said. Public security organs will help manage the campaign. Local Party officials must unconditionally obey the leadership and instructions of the local committees and participate in epidemic prevention work. People suffering from fever or who have come into close contact with infected patients will be sent to a medical observation point in the district. Hubei reported 48,206 confirmed cases, 32,994 of whom are from Wuhan, where the virus originated. Shiyan ranks 11th in Hubei. The controls were implemented to reduce the flow of people, to force the sources of the disease to be exposed, to curb the epidemic spread and prevent a long-term war of attrition, said the announcement. The announcement said the controls are in accordance with the law on public security management, the law on prevention and treatment of infectious diseases and regulations on urgent responses to public health emergencies. The ABC in Australia is reporting that the federal government is expected to extend its travel ban from mainland China due to the coronavirus or Covid-19 threat. It had been due to expire on Saturday. The current ban imposes a 14-day ban on tourists travelling from China to Australia. We\u2019ll bring you more on that when we have it. Vietnam Airlines has given an early indication of the financial impact on the industry as it announced it is losing 250bn dong (US$10.8m) a week in revenue due to travel curbs resulting from the coronavirus. The carrier said in an emailed statement it was reducing operations and trying to cut costs to \u201cachieve a positive financial result\u201d for this year. All its flights to and from mainland China have been suspended since the end of January, taking out 70,000 visitors per month between the two countries. It said: The epidemic has significantly reduced the travel demand of domestic and international tourists in the Vietnam network. Here\u2019s some more confusing news on the numbers of infections. This morning the Hubei Health Commission said as of midnight on 12 February, there were 14,840 new cases of coronavirus of Covid-19 (much higher than the previous day due to changes in how cases are counted). I mentioned a couple of posts back that the National Health Commission is several hours late announcing the national figures today. Now the state-run tabloid Global Times has tweeted that as of 5pm on 12 February, there were actually 16,568 confirmed coronavirus patients in Wuhan. This figure doesn\u2019t seem to tally with anything else, which is very strange, considering it is state-run media. On Thursday, Chinese state media announced several high profile firings, as the number of infections and deaths from the outbreak jumped. The party chief of Hubei province, Jiang Chaoliang was replaced by the former mayor of Shanghai, Ying Yong. Ma Guoqiang, the party chief of Wuhan, the city where the outbreak began, was also sacked and replaced by the former mayor of Jinan in Shandong province, Wang Zhonglin. Both Ying Yong and Wang Zhonglin are seen as close to Xi Jinping. The head of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, Zhang Xiaoming, will be replaced by Xia Baolong, vice-chairman of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference. Zhang\u2019s firing comes after more than seven months of anti-CCP and anti-government protests in Hong Kong. What do the changes signal? \u201cI suspect Xi would have wanted the personnel change to project a sense that he is in control of the situation. The bad numbers undermine that message,\u201d said Sam Crane who teaches Chinese politics and ancient philosophy at Williams College. Earlier this week, senior officials from Hubei\u2019s Health Commission \u2013 Zhang Jin, party secretary, and Liu Yingzi, the director, were also fired and replaced by an official from China\u2019s National Health Commission. Are the big changes in officials today related to the big jump in confirmed cases of Covid-19? The New York Times\u2019 Asia tech columnist, Li Yuan, certainly seems to think so. The Australian stock market has closed flat on Thursday afternoon. The ASX200 opened strongly in the morning but animal spirits were curbed by the terrible virus infection figures out of China. They weren\u2019t considered bad enough to send the index into the red for the day and it closed again just shy of the record high 7,090 points. In Tokyo the Nikkei is also flat as is the Kospi in Seoul. The Hang Seng is down 0.23% in Hong Kong and the Shanghai Composite is off 0.7%. Brent crude was up 15c to $55.94 a barrel and gold was also up. Events are moving very quickly today. We now know that in addition to the sacking of Hubei\u2019s provincial leader, Jiang Chaoliang, Wuhan\u2019s party chief, Ma Guoqiang, has also been replaced, North Korea has announced it will impose a 30-day quarantine for all foreign visitors and others suspected to have Covid-19, the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reports. \u201cAll the institutions and fields of the state and foreigners staying in the DPRK should obey it unconditionally,\u201d KCNA says. We are still waiting for China\u2019s National Health Commission to give its daily update of figures across the country. By my calculations, it has been delayed by several hours, compared with when it has been published for the past 10 days. Samoa\u2019s decision to refuse entry into the country of eight of its citizens over coronavirus fears has been criticised as a violation of international law by a legal expert. Eight people were denied entry into Samoa over the weekend as they returned home from India, travelling through Singapore. The day before their flight, Singapore was added to a list of countries from which the Samoan government said it would not accept travellers until they had been quarantined for 14 days. The group included five patients who had been in India for medical treatment. They were returned to Nadi, Fiji, their last port of departure, along with 11 others and are now being quarantined at the Grand Melanesian hotel in Nadi. \u201cIt is a violation of human rights international law for a country to deny the right of return of their own national. There is a human right to return to your home country and countries cannot deprive you of this right in a way that is arbitrary,\u201d said Jorge Contesse, the director of the Center for Transnational Law in the US. The decision has also been criticised in Fiji, where 19 people from the flight are now in quarantine. In an editorial on Wednesday, the Fiji Sun newspaper condemned the decision, saying it was \u201cmorally wrong for Samoa to refuse entry to eight of its citizens\u201d, calling it \u201cunacceptable and tantamount to dereliction of duty by a sovereign state\u201d. Members of China\u2019s Uighur minority living in exile are sounding the alarm over the risk of the coronavirus spreading in camps inside the country, where it is believed up to 1 million people are being detained. You can read our full story on it below: We\u2019re now hearing that China is replacing the head of its office that oversees matters in Hong Kong. Zhang Xiaoming would be removed as director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, the human resources ministry said, to be replaced by Xia Baolong, 67, a vice-chairman of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference. It follows months of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Another 44 people onboard a cruise liner moored off Japan\u2019s east coast have tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the number of infections on the ship to 218. The latest cases were confirmed after a further 221 people onboard the Diamond Princess were tested, the health minister, Katsunobu Kato, said on Thursday. A quarantine officer who boarded the ship to conduct initial health checks last week has also tested positive for Covid-19. The vessel, which will remain quarantined until at least 19 February, has the second largest number of infections outside mainland China. Amid growing concern for the health of the Diamond Princess\u2019s remaining 3,500 passengers and crew, older passengers and those with chronic illnesses could be allowed to leave the ship from Friday provided they test negative for the virus, Kato said. The Diamond Princess has been moored off Yokohama, near Tokyo, since 3 February after it emerged that a former passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong last month had tested positive for the virus. The president of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic committee said on Thursday that the Covid-19 outbreak would not affect this summer\u2019s Games. \u201cI want to again state clearly that cancellation or postponement of the Tokyo Games has not been considered,\u201d Yoshiro Mori said at the start of a two-day meeting in Tokyo with the International Olympic Committee. The chairman of the IOC coordination commission, John Coates, said the coronavirus was an \u201cunexpected issue\u201d, adding that organisers would draw up appropriate measures to protect athletes and spectators, Kyodo news agency said. Last week the organising committee\u2019s chief executive, Toshiro Muto, said he was concerned about the impact the spread of the virus was having in the run-up to the Tokyo Games, which are due to open in 162 days. Several qualifying tournaments that were due to be held in China have been postponed or moved to other countries. \u201cI am seriously worried that the spread of the infectious disease could throw cold water on the momentum toward the Games,\u201d Muto said. \u201cI hope that it will be stamped out as soon as possible.\u201d Indonesia\u2019s Jakarta Post is reporting that a man who flew from Wuhan to Bali on 22 January has tested positive for Covid-19 on his return to China. It says authorities in the eastern Chinese province of Anhui announced the case on Weibo. According to the post the man, who they identified as Jin, flew to Bali from Wuhan on 22 January, on Lion Air flight JT2618 and then took Garuda Indonesia flight GA858 from Denpasar (Bali) to Shanghai on 28 January. Anhui authorities confirmed on 5 February he had tested positive to the virus, according to their Weibo account. Covid-19 has an incubation period of up to 14 days. On Wednesday, the Garuda Indonesia spokesman Dicky Irchamsyah told the Jakarta Post he had not yet received a report about the case but \u201cwill check up on it\u201d. Lion Air\u2019s spokesman Danang Mandala separately said he would also look into the case. Bali\u2019s Provincial Health Agency chief, Ketut Suarjaya, told 7NEWS it was unclear whether the tourist was carrying the virus while holidaying in Indonesia. \u201cI think there is a small possibility,\u201d he said. According to 7NEWS, he said Indonesia was trying to find out where the man had visited on the island so investigations could be carried out. \u201cI think there is a small possibility that he was infected by the virus before he visited Bali,\u201d Suarjaya said. \u201cHowever, we will recheck all the facts. We will follow up the information. \u201cWe will trace all the places he had visited. Of course, we will raise our alert.\u201d The Singapore Sevens rugby tournament is expected to be postponed until October due to the Covid-19 outbreak, Reuters reports, citing a source familiar with the matter. The tournament is due to take place in the city-state on 11 and 12 April. Singapore has reported 50 cases of the virus. Several international sports events in Asia have been cancelled, postponed or moved because of the virus, including the Chinese Formula One grand prix scheduled for Shanghai in April and the indoor world athletics championships in Nanjing from 13-15 March. Another big change in Hubei province. It\u2019s been announced that Jiang Chaoliang, the party chief of Hubei province (effectively the leader of the province), has been replaced by the deputy party chief in Shanghai, Ying Yong. Earlier this week two other senior Hubei officials were replaced: Zhang Jin, the Communist party chief of Hubei\u2019s Health Commission, and Liu Yingzi, its director, were both fired. They were replaced by a national-level official, Wang Hesheng, the deputy director of China\u2019s National Health Commission. A team of officials will board the MV Westerdam to conduct health checks as the cruise ship remains anchored 1km (0.6 miles) off the coast of Sihanoukville port in Cambodia, the regional governor, Kouch Chamrouen has told Associated Press. The ship, which has 1,455 passengers and 802 crew onboard, arrived at the port early on Thursday. The passengers, who are mostly American, Canadian, British and Dutch, will not be allowed off until the checks are done. The US ambassador to Cambodia, W Patrick Murphy, said he sent an embassy team to work with the ship\u2019s representatives and Cambodian officials to help Americans disembark and transfer to their onward destinations. The ship\u2019s operator, Holland America Line, said no cases of the Covid-19 illness have been confirmed among the people onboard. A state-run tabloid, the Global Times, is reporting that Hubei has now adopted a stricter standard than other parts of the country in terms of recording cases, by adding the \u201cclinically diagnosed\u201d cases to those who have tested positive. This seems to be the opposite of what Hubei\u2019s Health Commission said \u2013 that it was changing its classifications \u201cin order to be consistent with the classification of case diagnosis used by other provinces across the country\u201d. Only one of them can be right. A Chinese state media outlet, the People\u2019s Daily, is reporting the \u201cgreat work from home experiment in China\u201d as a result of the virus. I assume it is not being ironic. The Hubei Health Commission has said the change in counting figures is to speed up treatment of patients. The rise comes from the daily \u201csuspected cases\u201d figures. The statement on their website says this is \u201cin order to be consistent with the classification of case diagnosis used by other provinces across the country, starting today (Thursday), Hubei province will include the number of clinically diagnosed cases into the number of confirmed cases for publication\u201d. Suspected cases in China as listed by the National Health Commission over the past few days are as follows: 8 February: 28,942 suspected cases (reported on 9 Feb). 9 February: 23,589 suspected cases (reported on 10 Feb). 10 February: 21,675 suspected cases (reported on 11 Feb). 11 February: 160,67, which I assume was missing a digit (reported on 12 Feb). I am still waiting on the latest update from the commission for the national figures for the last 24 hours. When we get them we will be able to tell if the rate of \u201csuspected cases\u201d has fallen, as those who have been \u201cclinically diagnosed\u201d are now being counted as confirmed cases. The New York Times is reporting that experts have been surprised by the change in the way cases are counted. \u201cWe\u2019re in unknown territory,\u201d Dr William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, told the NYT. \u201cThey\u2019re talking about using this as another diagnostic test, but we haven\u2019t seen it validated by data,\u201d Schaffner said. Children in Hong Kong have been told that schools in the city will remain closed until at least the middle of March. The education minister Kevin Yeung Yun-hung made the announcement on Thursday. Schools were due to open again on 2 March after a month-long closure due to the lunar new year holiday and then the Covid-19 outbreak. The government might also extend work-from-home arrangements for civil servants, the South China Morning Post said. We\u2019re getting some clarification from the Hubei Health Commission on the changes in the way they are counting new cases of Covid-19. A statement says it has added \u201cclinical diagnosis\u201d to the way of confirming cases, so that patients who have been \u201cclinically diagnosed\u201d, presumably by a doctor, can receive the same treatment as those who have tested positive to the virus. It says of the 14,840 new cases reported in Hubei province on Thursday, 13,332 of them were \u201cclinically diagnosed cases\u201d. The release says 33,693 patients are being treated in hospital in Hubei, \u201cof which 5,647 are critically ill and 1,437 are critically ill\u201d. I assume the two statements of \u201ccritically ill\u201d are to do with the translation of this page. I\u2019ll try to clarify this, but either way it\u2019s a reasonable proportion of the total number of patients in hospital.. You can see the full report here. AFP has more on officials in Hubei saying they were broadening their definition for Covid-19 cases by including people \u201cclinically diagnosed\u201d with the virus in the daily tally. This means officials can use lung imaging on suspected cases to diagnose the virus, rather than the standard nucleic acid tests. China has placed some 56 million in virtual quarantine in Hubei and its capital, Wuhan, since late last month and restricted movements of millions more in cities far from the centre of the outbreak in an unprecedented effort to contain the virus. Hong Kong police have arrested a man for stealing eight boxes of face masks from a car. Earlier, the chief of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, praised Cambodia for allowing the Westerdam to dock. \u201cThis is an example of international solidarity we have been consistently calling for,\u201d Tedros said before the ship\u2019s arrival. \u201cOutbreaks can bring out the best and the worst in people.\u201d The cruise ship MV Westerdam has arrived in Cambodia after spending two weeks at sea because no other country would allow the liner to dock over fears about coronavirus. The ship, which was turned down by Japan, Taiwan, Guam, the Philippines and Thailand after its original destination of Shanghai was closed, is moored in the Cambodian port town of Sihanoukville. \u201cWe\u2019ve had so many near moments we thought we were going home only to be turned away,\u201d Angela Jones, an American tourist onboard the ship, told Reuters. \u201cThis morning, just seeing land was such a breathtaking moment,\u201d said Jones. \u201cI thought: Is this real?\u201d But, with the ship still moored in the sea outside port, passengers will not be allowed to disembark before Cambodian health officials had carried out health checks onboard, according to a letter to passengers from the Westerdam captain, Vincent Smit, seen by Reuters. Only then would passengers be able to disembark and begin their journey home via chartered flights from Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, according to the letter. \u201cWe are very pleased to have our final plan,\u201d Smit said in the letter. Share prices across Asia Pacific are showing little sign of stress today despite the alarming jump in new Covid-19 cases in China. Australia\u2019s ASX200 has soared to a record high this morning, climbing by 0.2% to 7,100 points, although it has come down a bit from earlier highs. In Tokyo, the Nikkei is flat and the Kospi index is up 0.37% in Seoul. However, safe havens such as the Japanese yen and gold rose in response to the news from China. The yen last traded at 109.91 per dollar while gold rose 0.3% to $1,570.30 per ounce. The Australian dollar, a proxy for the Chinese economy, fell 0.2% to US$0.6725c. I mentioned earlier that Hubei authorities had begun including cases diagnosed through new clinical methods from Thursday in its daily figures. Reuters is reporting that Chinese state media said last week that Hubei would start recognising computerised tomography (CT) scan results as confirmation of infections, allowing hospitals to isolate patients more quickly. The total number of confirmed patients in China is just under 60,000. We have confirmation now that the latest person to be diagnosed with the virus in the US (bringing the US total to 14), was an evacuee from Wuhan. The patient was among 232 individuals who had been placed under quarantine at the Marine Corps Air Station in Miramar after being airlifted from Wuhan. A previous case of coronavirus was documented a few days earlier among the same group of evacuees. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials said it appeared that the two San Diego patients were separately exposed to the virus in China before arriving in the United States. The two arrived on different planes and were housed in separate facilities. The big rises in figures today cast a shadow on Beijing\u2019s touted \u201cpositive results\u201d from efforts to contain the virus. President Xi Jinping had chaired a meeting of the ruling Politburo Standing Committee after figures showed that the number of new cases dropped on Tuesday and Wednesday. Xi said there were \u201cpositive results\u201d but warned that the country \u201cmust not relax\u201d its epidemic control efforts, according to state media. In addition to the rise of new cases, there has also been a significant rise in the death toll in the past 24 hours. More than 240 deaths were recorded on Wednesday (figures published on Thursday). This compares with 97 deaths the previous day. There has been no change to the way deaths are recorded, so this really is a significant increase in one day. First up let\u2019s have a look at the massive jump in reported new cases of coronavirus. Nearly 15,000 new cases have been reported in a 24-hour period, taking the total number of cases to just under 60,000. To get an idea of the significance of this, the figure for confirmed new cases for Wednesday was 2,015. The Hubei Health Commission noted that it had begun including cases diagnosed through new clinical methods from Thursday. You may know that there has been a lot of debate in the media in recent days about a change in the way of counting figures by the National Health Commission. There was a suggestion that from 7 February, people who had tested positive but showed no symptoms, were not counted as confirmed cases. It has been very difficult to pin down the exact changes, and I\u2019ll try to do that today. But from my reading, it\u2019s likely that this huge jump in new confirmed cases reflects an adjustment of calculations, rather than a massively steep increase in actual new cases. I\u2019ll keep updating you on this as we get more information on it. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said a second patient in San Diego, California, has tested positive for coronavirus, according to CNBC. Earlier in the week another patient in San Diego who had been evacuated from Wuhan tested positive. We\u2019ll try to bring you more on that as soon as we can but that would take the US positive cases to 14. Welcome to our rolling coverage of the coronavirus outbreak. These are the top developments today: The number of deaths in China has increased sharply by at least 242 as of midnight on Wednesday, according to health officials in Hubei. New cases in Hubei have also leaped by 14,887, a sevenfold increase on the day before. The national total is now nearly 60,000 cases. The WHO chief has said the outbreak could still go in \u201cany direction\u201d. UK health chiefs are preparing for more cases after confirmation of the first case in London \u2013 a woman who flew into the UK from China at the weekend. A second patient has been diagnosed with Covid-19 in California. A cruise ship refused by four countries, the MV Westerdam, will be allowed to dock in Cambodia. The annual gathering of the tech industry in Barcelona \u2013 the Mobile World Congress \u2013 has been cancelled over fears of contagion at the huge event.

Sky After Dark pitches Tony Abbott\u2019s former chief of staff as \u201cAustralia\u2019s most sought-out political commentator\u201d, who \u201coffers her razor-sharp political analysis each weeknight\u201d. The razor-sharp commentary appears to run out on a Friday night, because Credlin often doubles up for her second job. On Friday Credlin told Sky viewers, \u201cPlainly, votes were bought to keep Michael McCormack in his job\u201d. On Sunday, fans of Credlin read: \u201cPlainly, votes were bought to keep Michael McCormack in his job.\u201d \u201cThe one Nat to act with real honour was Matt Canavan,\u201d was another line on repeat. The people\u2019s verdict is \u2026 not that clear The Australian showed just how stung it was by criticism of its coverage during the bushfires by publishing not one but two defensive pieces about how many subscribers it has. Guardian Australia reported that throughout the bushfire season the Oz kept up its climate denial commentary and underplayed aspects of the fires, and the New York Times and others had a similar view. The issue further blew up when an employee accused the company of \u201cmisinformation\u201d and diverting attention from climate change during the bushfire crisis in an explosive all-staff email, and when even James Murdoch criticised News Corp\u2019s Australian outlets for their \u201congoing denial\u201d. The Oz took the opportunity of the release of the Nielsen digital news rankings this week to hit back. \u201cAfter a summer of dishonest, distorted and desperate claims by Twitterati, Guardian Australia and The New York Times \u2013 which, despite its scant knowledge of our nation\u2019s conditions, misrepresented The Australian\u2019s coverage of the bushfire disaster \u2013 the people\u2019s verdict is in,\u201d an editorial thundered on Thursday. \u201cEager to experience full, accurate coverage of the disaster, and to understand what it meant for the nation, new readers flocked to The Australian. \u201cOur digital readership surged to more than 2.5 million in January \u2013 the biggest monthly audience ever recorded \u2013 and 19.1 per cent higher than in December. \u201cIn a time of fake news and hysteria, thoughtful Australians opted for factual content and unbiased analysis.\u201d But sadly for the Oz, the newspaper didn\u2019t even crack the top 10 of the Nielsen rankings, coming in 16th behind stablemates the Courier Mail. The big winner was ABC News, which soared into first place for the first time since 2016 with 11m readers. The Guardian held seventh place with 6.511m, a 10.8% rise from December. Miranda\u2019s mega Maga moment Daily Telegraph columnist Miranda Devine has received the highest accolade for articles she has written for the New York Post, where she is on secondment for the US election. None other than Donald Trump has praised Devine for her work \u2013 twice. \u201cI haven\u2019t looked [at Twitter] for a couple of hours but when I did look I\u2019d had something like 1,200 new followers, so that\u2019s pretty good,\u201d Devine told 2GB\u2019s Ben Fordham on the momentous day. \u201cA lot of love from the Maga people!\u201d So thrilled was the Tele that its correspondent was noticed that it commissioned an article about the president\u2019s latest tweet. \u201cMr Trump on Tuesday lauded Ms Devine\u2019s latest article pointing to the President\u2019s boosted approval ratings since the impeachment trial began,\u201d the Tele reported. \u201cThe words of praise come just days after Mr Trump retweeted Ms Devine\u2019s column for The Daily Telegraph last Friday, writing \u201cso true!\u201d, just hours after it was published.\u201d Devine told Fordham on radio she was having an exciting time in the States and there was no shortage of things to write about. She hoped to meet Trump in person, maybe at the 90th birthday party of New York Post columnist Cindy Adams in April, she said. Foxtel targets \u2018binge-conscious consumers\u2019 Foxtel announced another management shake-up this week, promoting two executives \u2013 Les Wigan and Lesley Portwain \u2013 after the departure of chief operating officer Euan Smith. Chief executive Patrick Delaney admitted the business model, which has been under pressure from Netflix, Stan and Amazon Prime, needed a restructure. \u201cWe now have an opportunity to bring forward our plans to reset Foxtel\u2019s operating model,\u201d Delaney said. \u201cThis will involve bringing best-in-class digital technology, including that created for the Kayo Sports streaming platform, across the entire group with the aim of delivering a material improvement in efficiency and customer experience.\u201d At News Corp\u2019s results last week, the global chief executive, Robert Thomson, said Foxtel was developing a streaming service like Kayo Sports, which has been successful in the Australian market. Foxtel\u2019s subscription revenues are down by 11%. \u201cFinally, at Foxtel, we are planning our entertainment OTT product, which is built off the Kayo system, and like Kayo will help maximise the value of existing rights, and reach binge-conscious consumers outside our traditional [base],\u201d he said. ABC uncut? Lobbying the Coalition government for ABC funding has never been easy. But after their excellent work covering the recent bushfires, there was a lot of love for Aunty in the corridors of Canberra this week. So much love Scott Morrison was keen to post a selfie with ABC chair Ita Buttrose who was accompanying her MD David Anderson for talks about reversing the $84m budget cut. Buttrose told the Heywire Regional Summit everyone acknowledges \u201cthe tireless work of the ABC keeping communities informed, connected and supported during the terrible events so many Australians have endured over the summer months\u201d. \u201cAs deputy prime minister Michael McCormack said yesterday, the ABC saved lives,\u201d she said. But is saving lives enough to claw back the funding? \u201cIt was a constructive conversation about the ABC and the valuable services we provide to rural and regional Australia,\u201d an ABC spokesman said.",
